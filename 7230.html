<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's a bit hard for me to come up with a satisfactory answer to this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem, because I don't start from the assumption of a physical universe at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all--like Bruno, I'm trying to start from a measure on observer-moments and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hope that somehow the appearance of a physical universe can be recovered 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the subjective probabilities experienced by observers...
</em><br />
<br />I have a similar perspective.  However I think it will turn out that the
<br />
simplest mathematical description of an observer-moment will involve a Big
<br />
Bang.  That is, describe a universe, describe natural laws, and let the
<br />
OM evolve.  This is the foundation for saying that the universe is real.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But my speculation would be this: multiple copies only increase first-person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure to the extent that, from a third-person perspective, they are likely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to create more *distinct* observers with a memory of the split going one way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than of the split going the other. So if we look at some very large region 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where there are 90 copies of our local region of the universe where the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum coinflip went one way and only 10 copy of our local region where the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coinflip went the other way, then even if those 90 copies run in lockstep 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a while, chances are good that eventually random events in each region 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will cause them to diverge. The end result would be that, after sufficient 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time, in this very large region you'll have 100 distinct regions which all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; share the same history up until that coinflip, with 90 having records of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flip going one way and 10 having records of it going the other.
</em><br />
<br />I meant to imply that this kind of differentiation could not occur in
<br />
my thought experiment, because the subject involved was a simulation in
<br />
a computer.  He is not interacting with the environment, he is running
<br />
a deterministic program.  So I can give him a good or bad experience
<br />
and he will not split.
<br />
<br />Do you think you would say, in that case, that when I flip my 90/10
<br />
quantum coin, there is no reason to give him the good experience with 90%
<br />
probability and the bad experience with 10% probability?  It would be just
<br />
as good to reverse the odds?
<br />
<br />Remember, I'm not running copies; I'm just running one program, and
<br />
flipping a biased coin to decide what to do.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And given my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; views on splits having an &quot;anticipatory&quot; quality (so if you're split into 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two and then one copy is scheduled to be split 999 times later, that will be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reflected in your subjective probabilities in the initial split), I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; naturally tend to think that this means you'd have a 9 times greater 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability of experiencing the coinflip outcome that will later lead to 90 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; divergent copies, even if the 90 copies run in lockstep initially.
</em><br />
<br />This is an interesting idea; one thing that occurs to me though is the
<br />
problem of amnesia.  (And let's face it, 99% of what we experience,
<br />
we don't remember.)  If you're split into two and experience something
<br />
in the one copy that is forgotten before it gets split 999 times, does
<br />
that to-be-forgotten experience still gain the benefit of the 999-fold
<br />
multiplication?
<br />
<br />In other words, is it by virtue of later memory of the event that you
<br />
expect the subjective probability to be magnified, or is it a more
<br />
metaphysical connection?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But like I said, it's difficult to make any definite claims about why we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience quantum probabilities the way we do, especially since no one has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; come up with a way to derive a simple frequentist notion of probability from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universal wavefunction in the MWI.
</em><br />
<br />That is indeed the case.  I hope to write an essay soon about what I
<br />
think such a solution would look like (not to offer a solution, merely
<br />
to try to clarify what exactly I think it needs to explain).
<br />
