An open problem raised in Tegmark's &quot;ensemble TOE&quot; paper (published in 
<br />
'98, if I recall) is to answer the question that is the subject of this 
<br />
thread.
<br />
<br />I believe recent work I have done has the potential to be a step towards 
<br />
that answer.
<br />
<br />First, a link to the very rough draft (please forgive formatting 
<br />
errors), and second what I think the deficiency is with this document:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.universalsight.org/math/9-26-08/01-03-structure_of_all_structures.pdf">http://www.universalsight.org/math/9-26-08/01-03-structure_of_all_structures.pdf</a>
<br />
<br />Abstract:
<br />
In this document, the author presents a structure with the
<br />
property that all structures are elementarily embeddable within it. One 
<br />
essen-
<br />
tial tool is a version of New Foundations set theory, ?first developed 
<br />
by Quine,
<br />
as presented by Holmes in [1]. The motivation is given by The Mathematical
<br />
Universe article by Max Tegmark, [2], in which it is hypothesized that 
<br />
physical
<br />
existence is mathematical existence and, consequently, it is 
<br />
hypothesized that
<br />
the structure with the aforementioned property could be central in the Math-
<br />
ematical Universe Hypothesis as being at least keenly connected to the 
<br />
literal
<br />
universe, if not literally being the universe.
<br />
The author assumes some knowledge of mathematical logic such as, for ex-
<br />
ample, the inductive de?finition of a fi?rst-order well-formed formula.
<br />
<br /><br />The intended audience is primarily Max Tegmark, honestly, but more 
<br />
generally, any physicist interested in Tegmark's self-proclaimed 
<br />
&quot;bananas articles&quot; like the MUH paper, and who have already been exposed 
<br />
to the basics of mathematical logic.
<br />
<br />Prior to drafting this document, I contacted Prof. Tegmark regarding the 
<br />
core ideas in the draft. I described what I was attempting and if I 
<br />
recall I sent him the abstract. As I will describe shortly, this is 
<br />
incomplete, so I didn't send him this pdf yet. I hope he wouldn't mind 
<br />
my inclusion of his response, which I think many here might find highly 
<br />
debatable (and worthy of discussion), sent by email:
<br />
<br />&lt;quote&gt;
<br />
It sounds to me from what you're saying that A would be the Level IV 
<br />
multiverse, i.e., all of physical reality.
<br />
&lt;/quote&gt;
<br />
<br />Now for the deficiency I see with my document. -If- there aren't any 
<br />
other errors, then something wrong with my ultimate structure is that it 
<br />
is the ultimate structure with respect to just one symbol set. I need a 
<br />
structure that is ultimate with respect to -all- symbol sets. The basic 
<br />
idea I had which I have not yet tried to formalize is encoding all 
<br />
symbol sets into an ultimate symbol set which in human mathematics is a 
<br />
countable set; so something like the set of natural numbers will encode 
<br />
all possible symbols. One simple way to do this would be to say all 
<br />
numbers congruent to 0 mod 3 are encodings of constant symbols, all 
<br />
numbers congruent to 1 mod 3 are encodings of n-ary relation symbols, 
<br />
and all numbers congruent to 2 mod 3 are encodings of n-ary function 
<br />
symbols.
<br />
So, note that I did not finish what I set out to do in my abstract: &quot;the 
<br />
author presents a structure with the property that all structures are 
<br />
elementarily embeddable within it.&quot; I believe what I have done is this: 
<br />
a structure over a fixed symbol set S with the property that all 
<br />
S-structures are elementarily embeddable within it.
<br />
<br />Now on to the subject of time.
<br />
<br />If Tegmark is correct and an ultimate structure literally is all of 
<br />
physical reality, what strikes me is that this ultimate structure 
<br />
appears quite static. What then is the source of our perceptions of 
<br />
transition, ie, time? This ultimate structure I presume (safely, I 
<br />
believe) is constant yet we perceive things to change. Why and how? IOW, 
<br />
what is the mechanism that converts the static ultimate structure into a 
<br />
fluid appearance of transition? These questions are still valid even if 
<br />
the ultimate structure I have in mind is wrong; Tegmark still 
<br />
hypothesizes that some math structure is all of physical reality.
