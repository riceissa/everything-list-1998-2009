Bruno,
<br />
<br />I reread your post of  5/11/2004 and it raised some questions and a 
<br />
possible paradox involving the idea that the &quot;notion of first person is 
<br />
absolutely not formalizable.&quot; (see below, for a quotation from your post)
<br />

<br />
<br />&lt;&lt; It may be that using the observer as starting points will force White 
<br />
Rabbits to be filtered out of the
<br />
&lt;&lt; observable world

<br /><em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;And again I totally agree. It *is* what is proved in my thesis. I

have done two things:
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;1) I have given a proof that if we are machine then physics must be

<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;science which isolates and exploits a (first person plural) measure

on the set of all
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;computational histories. The proof is rigorous, I would say 
</em><br />
definitive (unless some systematic
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;error of course), although provably unformalizable (so that only 1 
</em><br />
person can grasp it).
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;2) I provide a mathematical confirmation of comp by showing that 
</em><br />
(thanks to Godel,
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;Lob, Solovay ...) we can literally interview a universal machine, 
</em><br />
acting like a scientist
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;---by which I mean we will have only a third person discourse with 
</em><br />
her. BUT we can
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;interview her about the possible 1-person discourse. That is a &quot;tour 
</em><br />
de force&quot; in the sense
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;that the notion of first person is absolutely not formalizable (and 
</em><br />
so we cannot
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;define it in any third person way). But by using in a special way ideas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;from Plato's Theaetetus + Aristotle-Kripke modal logic + Godel's 
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;discovery make the &quot;tour de force&quot; easily tractable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;Here I can only be technical or poetical, and because being technical 
</em><br />
seems
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;yet premature I will sum up by saying that with comp, the plenitude 
</em><br />
is just the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;incredibly big &quot;set&quot; of universal machine's ignorance, and physics is 
</em><br />
the common
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;sharable border of that ignorance, and it has been confirmed because 
</em><br />
that
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;sharable border has been shown to obey to quantum laws.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;I get recently new result: one confirm that with comp the first 
</em><br />
person can hardly know
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;or even just believe in comp; the other (related to an error in my 
</em><br />
thesis I talked
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;about in some previous post) is the apparition of a &quot;new&quot; quantum 
</em><br />
logic (I did
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;not command it!) and even (I must verify) an infinity of quantum 
</em><br />
logics between
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;the singular first person and the totally sharable classical discourses.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;This could go along with your old theory that there could be a 
</em><br />
continuum of
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;person-point-of-view between the 1 and 3 person, and that would 
</em><br />
confirms that you
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;are rather gifted as an &quot;introspecter&quot; (do you remember? I thought 
</em><br />
you were silly).
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;But then it looks you don't like any more the 3-person discourse, why?
</em><br />
<br />The adoption of the first person as a &quot;frame of reference&quot; (my 
<br />
terminology) implies the ultimate relativization. In other words, the 
<br />
logical system governing the mental processes of the observer becomes 
<br />
part of the &quot;frame of reference&gt; However, we all know that human beings 
<br />
do not think according to formal systems. Human systems are full of 
<br />
inconsistencies, errors, etc... and very often their beliefs about the 
<br />
world is just wrong. Very often they even make arithmetic errors such as 
<br />
8x7 = 65.
<br />
<br />So if we assume a relative formulation, here is the dilemma:
<br />
1) if we adopt a formal system such as the one(s) your have talked about 
<br />
we assign an absolute quality to the observer which violates our premise 
<br />
of relative formulation.
<br />
2) If we adopt a non-formal human logical system,&quot; we are left with an 
<br />
extremely complicated task of reconciling the observations obtained by 
<br />
several observers who in my terminology &quot;share the same frame of reference&quot;
<br />
<br />One of the question that arise is how fundamental should be the concept 
<br />
of &quot;frame of reference&quot; or of the mechanism/logic that underlies our 
<br />
thinking:
<br />
1) Is it governed at the atomic level by physical laws down to 
<br />
resolution of Planck's constant? The notion of observer is defined here 
<br />
with a Planck resolution.  If we share the same physical laws then we 
<br />
can say that we share the same frame of reference. This option avoids 
<br />
the inconsistencies of the &quot;human logical systems&quot; but throws out of the 
<br />
window the relativistic formulation. In addition this approach provides 
<br />
a neat justification for the equivalence of the sets describing the 
<br />
physical world and the mental world.
<br />
2) Is it governed at the neurological or even at the psychological 
<br />
level? The notion of observer here has a very coarse resolution compared 
<br />
to the first option. This approach keeps the relative formulation but 
<br />
becomes a quagmire because of its lack of formalism. How can the notion 
<br />
of &quot;objective reality&quot; be defined? In fact, is there such a thing as a 
<br />
true psychological objective reality?  However, the fact that a 
<br />
&quot;psychological objective reality&quot; is an oxymoron (contradiction in 
<br />
terms) does not invalidate the definition of the observer at the 
<br />
psychological level. Au contraire.
