<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Einstein who opposed the Copenhagen School, died in 1955 in Princeton.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; same year, a young graduate student, Hugh Everett III, joined Princeton 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; University and two years later, under the guidance of John Archibald 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wheeler, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; he published his doctoral dissertation which he called a &quot;Relative State 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Formulation of quantum mechanics&quot; in the Reviews of Modern Physics, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Volumer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 29, No. 3, pages 454-462, July 1957. This paper clearly positions him as 
</em><br />
a 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; relativist.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Einstein claimed that no observer in an inertial frame is privileged; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everett 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; asserted that no observer state in superposition is privileged. Everett 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; the courage and vision to continue the quest that Einstein started. He 
</em><br />
is 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; true inheritor of Einstein's mantle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   It is well known that Einstein believed in an objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  reality.  That's why he made the EPR argument to Bohr.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Everett did indeed extend the work of Einstein.  That part I agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  with.  Like Einstein, he believed in an objective reality.  When he talked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  about observers in a superposition, he clearly believed that they exist in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  some objective sense.  That's how he could go beyond Copenhagen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Jacques, to call me &quot;no better than a Copenhagenist&quot; shows me your true 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; measure and your unfortunate lack of comprehension in this matter. I am 
</em><br />
a 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; relativist. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   No, you yourself said you're a subjectivist, anti-realist.  That's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  the problem, not the fact that you don't privilege one term in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  superposition, because neither do I.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   As far as your own measure I took that long ago.
</em><br />
<br />Wonderful! Now we are getting somewhere. I agree with you almost 100% except 
<br />
for the &quot;anti-realist&quot; part and the fact that I consider measure relative. 
<br />
:-) Our exchange has brought to focus the really important aspects of our 
<br />
difference.  Thank you!
<br />
<br />We are both relativist. Our difference is that you are an objectivist like 
<br />
Einstein whereas I am a subjectivist. I am not sure if Everett was an 
<br />
objectivist or a subjectivist.
<br />
<br />There is no problem with the relativist-objectivist point of view as long as 
<br />
you restrict yourself to non-self (3rd person) issues such as inertial frames 
<br />
of reference like Einstein did. However, as soon as you start talking about 
<br />
consciousness and quantum immortality which are, as Bruno calls them first 
<br />
person issues, then you are led inexorably from the objective point of view 
<br />
to the subjective one. Pushing the concept of relativity from Einstein's 
<br />
objective frames to its final conclusion, the self, you'll discover that the 
<br />
self becomes the ultimate frame of reference. The mind then becomes a frame 
<br />
of reference and relativity is expressed at least in part by Shannon mutual 
<br />
infomation theory. I like to think of &quot;mutual information&quot; as &quot;relative 
<br />
information.&quot; Other branches of mathematics that could bear on this problem 
<br />
is axiomatic theory and Goedel's work.  
<br />
<br />I am not sure if Everett did envisioned Quantum immortality and if he 
<br />
actually made the transition from objectivism to subjectivism.
<br />
<br />If however, you maintain an objective point of view, you forgo any 
<br />
understanding of consciousness. Objectively speaking, you are only a mass 
<br />
comprised mostly of water, nitrogen, phosporus and trace minerals totally 
<br />
void of consciousness. As an objective relativist you would deny any 
<br />
consciousness to anyone. Therefore, it is not surprising that you also deny 
<br />
Quantum immortality. 
<br />
<br />Yet you do feel conscious, don't you? How do you explain this?
<br />
<br />In summary, you can't possibly simultaneously retain objectivity, relativity 
<br />
and consciousness. One of them has to go. My choice was to keep  relativity 
<br />
and consciousness, and become a subjectivist. However objectivity is not 
<br />
necessarily dead as I explain below.

least
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;helpful to provide a mental framework to analyze things. Let me illustrate

just
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with a simple example from my physics education. In my general physics class 
</em><br />
in
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;college, it was taught that an inertial reference frame was any reference 
</em><br />
frame
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that was not accelerating relative to the fixed stars. The 'fixed stars' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;obviously a silly 'absolute' reference frame, because they are not that, but 
</em><br />
it is
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;still a convenient standard to reference to when talking about other 
</em><br />
reference
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;frames, which are relative to each other. I don't know if that clarifies my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspective a bit more. I cannot speak for the others.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Fred
</em><br />
<br />Yes I agree, the illusion of an objective reality is helpful in providing a 
<br />
mental framework for analyzing things. The reason why we have such an 
<br />
illusion is that, most of the time, our frames of reference are extremely 
<br />
close together. Our points of view do not differ significantly and therefore 
<br />
the world appears to be the same. So it's OK to be an objectivist in most 
<br />
cases. As I mentioned above, It was acceptable for Einstein to be an 
<br />
objectivist because his frames of reference were third-person-based and did 
<br />
not involve the self and more specifically the continuing existence of the 
<br />
self.
<br />
<br />However, when one starts to think in terms of consciousness and Quantum 
<br />
Immortality, the objectivity paradigm doesn't cut it anymore. In those cases, 
<br />
the relevent frames of reference are consciousness-based and anthropically 
<br />
dependent. To be more specific the frames of reference are comprised of the 
<br />
information and data processing capability in the mind of the observer, plus 
<br />
all the anthropically necessary sustaining factors in the environment. An 
<br />
example of sustaining factor would be the state of the cyanide capsule in the 
<br />
Schoedinger cat experiment. The state of the cyanide capsule represents the 
<br />
difference between the frames of reference for the cat that survives and the 
<br />
cat that dies.
