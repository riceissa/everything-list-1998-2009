<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think it's true. Bayes theorem is correct but the prior probability is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very strongly in favor of worlds with many humans.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However we can do estimate something about the duration of the human race.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For most of the distributions of births (including exponential growth of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the population), the average (over all human beings) ratio of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (tf-t)/(t-ti), the time left before doomsday over the time past since the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beginning of mankind, is of the order of one. The best estimate is thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that mankind has to live around as much time it has already lived, between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 10^5 to 10^7 years.
</em><br />
<br />It is not correct to apply time as a measure for the human race, because
<br />
you and I are members thereof, and because the number of people per unit
<br />
of
<br />
time has not been uniform.  John Leslie is correct in using the birth
<br />
order
<br />
of people as a measure of time passage.  You and I are indeed not in 
<br />
peculiar positions by this measure, while we are by direct time measure.
<br />
<br />It is interesting to note that the &quot;Copernican&quot; estimate that you give
<br />
originally, to my knowledge from Gott, does seem to give plausible time
<br />
estimates, but has the following property that makes me very suspicious
<br />
of Copernican estimates.  (First, the Copernican estimates as a whole
<br />
do not have a finite expectation, but the median estimate is for future
<br />
interval = observed past interval).  Then for Copernican estimates on
<br />
humans (as if they were made by an alien).  The time, as you indicate
<br />
is 10^5 to 10^7.  The number of people is about 60 10^9. The pair of
<br />
forecasts can both be met if the total forecast is for a rapid decline
<br />
of current population, then a long period of very few members.  This
<br />
is oddly reminiscent of a reversal of past history.
<br />
<br />In fact, the following theorem is easy to see. Given a function
<br />
strictly montonically increasing on (-infinty, 0), then the 
<br />
median Copernican forecast is the reversal about 0 of the function.
<br />
<br />This may be the best that the Copernican principle can get you in
<br />
a single dimension in which you have only a one way view.  Note that
<br />
it does put you at the most likely point (0).  However, it is rather
<br />
clear that time reversal per se makes a pretty poor forecast for
<br />
anything about which one can have some notion that there is an
<br />
irreversibility.  
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that this estimate is correct for most of your own remaining time of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life (except the very few new born babies, dying old people and victims of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mortal accidents). it is correct also to guess how long the Sun will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bright, and so on...We may belong to the unfortunate part that will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disappear, but despite the growth of population, we only represent a few
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; percent of the 10^11 people that have probably already lived, so this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; estimate would have been correct for most of them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gilles
</em><br />
<br />I rather suspect that there could be a lot of empirical cases in which
<br />
the Copernican forecasts would be right, but it is hard to reconcile
<br />
that with the apparent basis in a time reversal.
