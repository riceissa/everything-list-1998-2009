<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I really do not want to be a stick-in-the-mud here, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; what do we base the idea that &quot;copies&quot; could exist upon?
</em><br />
<br />Don't worry about not going along with someone's program ;-)
<br />
I think that you're just being polite by calling yourself
<br />
a stick-in-the-mud.  Why, if I had to interpose such a disclaimer
<br />
every time that I was stubborn and mule-headed, 90% of my posts
<br />
would be consist of nothing but apologies!!  :-)
<br />
<br />To prevent most of us from feeling inadquate, you should suppress
<br />
some of your southern politeness in these discussions  :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is a conjecture called &quot;functionalism&quot; (or one of its close variants).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I guess the &quot;strong AI&quot; view is that the mind can be emulated on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computer. And yes, just because many people believe this---not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; surprisingly many computer scientists---does not [necessarily]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; make it true.   [though I myself (Lee and his copies) believe it]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I am aware of those ideas and they seem, at least to me, to be supported
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by an article of Faith and not any kind of empirical evidence. Maybe that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why I have such an allergy to the conjecture. ;-)
</em><br />
<br />Well for Pete's sake!  Of *course* there is some faith here---as
<br />
you wryly note, you yourself are hardly exempt from indulging in
<br />
a little (or a lot) of speculation. What you have written is not
<br />
even an argument. Whereas what Brent Meeker wrote
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think there is considerable evidence to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;support the view that human level intelligence
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could be achieved by a (non-quantum) computer
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that human intelligence and consciousness
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are dependent on brain processes; e.g. see the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many studies of brain damaged patients.  Also,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is well established that consciousness
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corresponds to only a small part of the information
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;processing in the brain.
<br />
<br />definitely constitutes a strong argument, even if from your point
<br />
of view it does not constitute evidence.  (Thanks, Brent!)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; An aspect of this belief is that a robot could act indistinguishably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from humans. At first glance, this seems plausible enough; certainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; many early 20th century SF writers thought it reasonable. Even Searle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; concedes that such a robot could at least appear intelligent and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; thoughtful to Chinese speakers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I suspect that Turing also believed it: after all, he proposed that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a program one day behave indistinguishably from humans. And why not,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; exactly?  After all, the robot undertakes actions, performs calculations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; has internal states, and should be able to execute a repertoire as fine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as that of any human.  Unless there is some devastating reason to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; contrary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     What I seem to rest my skepticism upon is the fact that in all of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considerations there remains, tacitly or not, the assumption that these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;internal states&quot; have an entity &quot;to whom&quot; they have a particular valuation.
</em><br />
<br />This is the central problem from those who are deeply concerned as
<br />
to *why* 1st person experiences exist.  Too bad that to me, it's
<br />
just obvious that they must.  I literally cannot conceive of how
<br />
it could be different!  (Poor me, I suppose---in some ways some
<br />
of us just have too little imagination, I truly guess.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I see this expressed in the MWI, more precisely, in the &quot;relative state&quot; way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of thinking within an overall QM multiverse.
</em><br />
<br />Okay; On closer reading, I think that you are talking about
<br />
the way that many people cannot stand MWI because it seems
<br />
to require that they observe both outcomes of an experiment.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Additionally, we are still embroiled in debate over the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sufficiency of a Turing Test to give us reasonable certainty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to claim that we can reduce 1st person aspects from 3rd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person, Searle's Chinese Room being one example.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; What if &quot;I&quot;, or any one else's 1st person aspect, can not be copied?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; If the operation of copying is impossible, what is the status of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; of these thought experiments?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I notice that many people seek refuge in the &quot;no-copying&quot; theorem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; QM. Well, for them, I have that automobile travel also precludes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; survival.  I can prove that to enter an automobile, drive it somewhere,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and then exit the automobile invariably changes the quantum state of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the person so reckless as to do it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Come on, Lee, your trying to evade the argument. ;-)
</em><br />
<br />Am not!  If the shoe doesn't fit, then don't wear it. I thought
<br />
(mistakenly, it appears) that you were seeking refuge in the
<br />
no-clone QM theorem. Sorry for the misattribution. What you
<br />
are saying---PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG---is that copying
<br />
just might not be possible at all.  But I don't understand!
<br />
<br />Surely you admit that it is conceivable that a machine might
<br />
scan your brain and body and create a duplicate. (As I say,
<br />
it doesn't have to be **exact**.)  But didn't you see it happen many
<br />
times on Star Trek?  Or were you in the other room (as I often
<br />
was) visiting the refrigerator?  Is this or is this not what you
<br />
mean by &quot;suppose that copying is impossible&quot;?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If someone can teleport me back and forth from work to home, I'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be happy to go along even if 1 atom in every thousand cells of mine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; doesn't get copied. Moreover---I am not really picky about the exact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bound state of each atom, just so long as it is able to perform the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; role approximately expected of it. (That is, go ahead and remove any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; carbon atom you like, and replace it by another carbon atom in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; different state.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     If you care to look into teleportation, as it has been researched so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far, it has been shown that the &quot;original&quot; - that system or state of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system - that is teleported is not copied like some Xerox of an original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; document.
</em><br />
<br />My whole point is: WHO CARES?  If it misses an *entire* atom in every
<br />
10^14th of them, it doesn't matter to me.  It should not matter to
<br />
anyone.  Or am I missing your point?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/quantuminfo/teleportation/">http://www.research.ibm.com/quantuminfo/teleportation/</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Such can not be done because *all* of the information about the system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or state must be simultaneously measured and that act itself destroys the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original. If *all* of the information is not measured, then one is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copying or teleporting, one is just measuring. This is not overly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complicated!
</em><br />
<br />It is not overly complicated that it should not matter to any
<br />
rational person that not *all* the information is copied. And
<br />
I will not permit you to redefine *teleportation* and *copying*
<br />
beloved by millions of SF readers to require EXACT reproduction
<br />
of a quantum state.  As you admitted, even the impingement of
<br />
the slightest whiff of air drastically changes your quantum
<br />
state. And we are *none* the worse for it.  So who cares if
<br />
teleportation does not correctly handle every single atom?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Again, you are begging the point! The impact of air molecules change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one's quantum state! Perhaps we are stuck on this because we are assuming a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;still frame by still frame&quot; kind of representation of the situation. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum state of a system is continuously changing, that is why there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variable &quot;t&quot; in the Schrödinger equation for a wavefunction! I am commenting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the absurdity of copying the quantum mechanical system itself, or some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subset or trace of it, other that that implied by the rules of QM.
</em><br />
<br />I don't give a **** about *exact* copying.  Hence the *existence* of
<br />
copies has nothing whatsoever to do, in my view, with QM.
<br />
<br />Lee
<br />
<br />P.S.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; falsified, by the same experiments that unassailably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; imply that Nature is, at its core, Quantum Mechanical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; and not Classical and thus one wonders:  &quot;Why do we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; persist in this state of denial?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Probably for the same reason that some people continue to be Libertarians.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It's a belief thing---the way you see the world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Sure, and I hope that even Liberals can admit to errors in their beliefs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when presented with evidence and reasonable arguments to the contrary of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptions within their beliefs. It is when people engage in active denial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of matters of fact that persons like myself wonder about them. ;-)
</em><br />
<br />You are unfairly trying to take advantage of my well-known and uncontrollable
<br />
animus against liberalism!  But as one poster noted, it made it look like you
<br />
didn't know the difference between the wise and noble Libertarians and the
<br />
rascally liberals  :-)
