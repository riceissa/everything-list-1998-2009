<br />You should study what interests you. If this type of math does not 
<br />
interest you, you should of course study something else.
<br />
<br />As for measures of usefulness, it's certainly the case that most 
<br />
engineers, programmers, and even working physicists need little more 
<br />
than some linear algebra and bit of differential equations to handle 
<br />
99% of the situations they encounter. From what I see of the current AI 
<br />
literature, maybe a bit of logic, a smattering of graph theory, and 
<br />
whatever specialty math in the chosen subfield of AI. For physics, the 
<br />
mix is different but the same applies.
<br />
<br />And then I look to those doing the kind of physics of interest to me: 
<br />
John Baez, Fotini Markopoulou, Carlo Rovelli, Chris Isham, Lee Smolin. 
<br />
Then it's a lot of algebraic topology, n-category theory, homology, 
<br />
noncommutative geometry, topos theory (sheaves, locales, etc.), lattice 
<br />
theory, and so on. (Those interested in strings and field theories 
<br />
would deal with a slightly different mix.)
<br />
<br />Certainly I agree that most advanced math doesn't lead to specific 
<br />
theories having specific predictions. And before anyone jumps on me for 
<br />
saying this, this is a fact of our times. The &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; of 
<br />
50-80 years ago, where a few weeks or months spent brushing up on the 
<br />
then-abstract area of Hilbert spaces could lead to some testable 
<br />
predictions are over.
<br />
<br />My hunch is that the insights and understandings will come from those 
<br />
doing math and mathematical physics for the love of it, with occasional 
<br />
new testable predictions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My complaint is that these branches of math are very, very shallow, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of their extreme abstractness.  There are no deep theorems there.
</em><br />
<br />I'd count the Adjoint Functor Theorem as very deep, and useful. 
<br />
Likewise, Grothendieck's seminal work in the late 50s and early 60s on 
<br />
generalized spaces (Grothendieck topologies), along with the work by 
<br />
Serre, Lawvere, and others, eventually led to a category-theoretic 
<br />
proof by Deligne in 1974 of the Weil Conjecture.
<br />
<br />(All of these terms can be explored on the Web, of course, with some of 
<br />
them actually explained pretty well. A basic text like Mac Lane's 
<br />
&quot;Categories for the Working Mathematician,&quot; will help. Here's one of 
<br />
many Wikipedia-type articles on adjoint functors and the Adjoint 
<br />
Functor Theorem. <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjoint_functors">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjoint_functors</a>  )
<br />
<br />The early 60s saw three parallel developments, all deeply interrelated: 
<br />
the aforementioned Grothendieck topologies work, the efforts by Lawvere 
<br />
to provide an alternative foundation to mathematics besides set theory, 
<br />
and Cohen's forcing methods to prove the independence of the Axiom of 
<br />
Choice from much of the rest of mathematics. This was the birth of 
<br />
topos theory. (And the connections with intuitionistic logic, that is, 
<br />
the logic of Brouwer and Heyting, notably, is closely tied to these 
<br />
areas. And, I believe and so do others, closely tied to issues of 
<br />
partial knowledge, quantum cosmology, the holographic model (still very 
<br />
hypothetical), and issues with black holes, information content, and 
<br />
quantum mechanics.)
<br />
<br />What in mathematics is &quot;deep,&quot; anyway? To some, the proof of the 
<br />
Taneyama Conjecture was deep, while to others it was just number 
<br />
theory. To others, proving certain properties about pullbacks in 
<br />
categories of objects and morphisms is deeper than proving something 
<br />
about the zeroes of a polynomial or calculating a Mersenne prime. To 
<br />
each their own.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no surprises.  There are abstract structures that may help to guide 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but the theory doesn't tell you much besides the fact that these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist and have some agreeable properties.  The universe is a lot 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deeper than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that....
</em><br />
<br />When I look at the expanse of mathematics, I find it useful to see that 
<br />
category theory (and topos theory) tells us that a proof for 
<br />
semigroups, for example, automatically applies to an ostensibly 
<br />
different domain. This language allows us to &quot;move up a level&quot; and see 
<br />
the underlying similarities, even the isomorphisms. To see that while 
<br />
we may have several different names for things, they are actually the 
<br />
same thing.
<br />
<br />Robert Geroch bases his text &quot;Mathematical Physics&quot; around category as 
<br />
a unifying approach...I hope this becomes the norm as this century 
<br />
unfolds, similar to the way the differential forms version of general 
<br />
relativity took over from the index gymnastics of ordinary tensors. 
<br />
(And apropos of your point about the new math not leading to many new 
<br />
predictions, did the Cartan-influenced differential forms approach to 
<br />
GR lead to new predictions that the classical, tensor-oriented approach 
<br />
did not? Probably few, if any, as most of the accessible predictions of 
<br />
GR were made a long time ago. But should students learning GR learn the 
<br />
methods for raising and lower indices in tensors or the more modern 
<br />
differential forms approach? The time saved, and the unity gained, may 
<br />
lead to new syntheses, such as in quantum gravity.
<br />
<br />Likewise, is the Hilbert space formulation of QM dramatically different 
<br />
in making predictions that the Schrodinger wave equation formulation? 
<br />
Working chemists still calculate Hamiltonians and wave equations--they 
<br />
don't need to think in terms of Hilbert space abstractions. (And in the 
<br />
area of observables, the great Von Neumann actually got it _wrong_ in 
<br />
his formulation, as Bell proved several decades later...)
<br />
<br />Geroch says this in his introduction:
<br />
<br />&quot;In each area of mathematics (e.g., groups, topological spaces) there 
<br />
are available many definitions and constructions. It turns out, 
<br />
however, that there are a number of notions (e.g., that of a product) 
<br />
that occur naturally in various areas of mathematics, with only slight 
<br />
changes from one area to another. It is convenient to take advantage of 
<br />
this observation. Category theory can be described as that branch of 
<br />
mathematics in which one studies certain definitions in a broader 
<br />
context--without reference to the particular area to which the 
<br />
definition might be applied. It is the &quot;mathematics of mathematics.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Although this subject takes some getting used to, it is, in my 
<br />
opinion, worth the effort. It provides a systematic framework that can 
<br />
help one to remember definitions in various areas of mathematics, to 
<br />
understand what many constructions mean and how they can be used, and 
<br />
even to invent useful definitions when needed.&quot;
<br />
<br />(p. 3)
<br />
<br />And apropos of one of the direct themes of this list, the chart on page 
<br />
248 is a better chart of the categories which are of direct (known) 
<br />
relevance to modern physics than Max Tegmark's chart of what he thinks 
<br />
of as the branches of mathematics. (I don't mean this to sound 
<br />
snide...it's just a statement of my opinion. Further, Tegmark and 
<br />
others working on All Math Models need to get up to speed on this 
<br />
&quot;mathematics of mathematics.&quot;)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Division algebras like quaternions and octonions are not shallow in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense; nor are the complex numbers, or linear operators on Hilbert 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, I'm just giving one mathematician's intuitive reaction to these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; branches of math and their possible applicability in the TOE domain.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *may* be applicable but if so, only for setting the stage... and what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; main actors will be, we don't have any idea...
</em><br />
<br />Sure, there's juicy stuff in the details of octonions. John Baez would 
<br />
agree with you. Getting down to making exact calculations is almost 
<br />
always necessary, and sometimes illuminating. But he also connects 
<br />
quaternions, octonions, etc. to n-categories and more generalized 
<br />
truths. Read his stuff for details--he writes more about both of these 
<br />
areas, various algebras and various categories, and their connections 
<br />
to physics, than anyone I know.
<br />
<br />Look, I'm happy that you looked at category theory and didn't find it 
<br />
to your taste. I had the opposite experience. Diversity is good.
<br />
