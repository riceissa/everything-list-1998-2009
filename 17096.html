Hi John, and the other.
<br />
<br />John motivates me to explain what is a function, &quot;for a mathematician&quot;.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; let me skip the technical part

<br /><br />OK. But I remind you this current thread *is* technical.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and jump on the following text.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; F u n c t i o n  as I believe is - for you - the y = f(x) form. For

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation (curve). And here is my problem: who does the plotting? (Do

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not say: YOU are, or Iam, that would add to the function concept the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; homunculus to make it from a written format into a F U N C T I O N ).
</em><br />
<br /><br />But I have not yet say what is a function. I just mentioned that &quot;they  
<br />
are everywhere&quot; to open the appetite of the audience.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; F u n c t i o n  as I believe is - for you - the y = f(x) form.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You take a risk believing things - for me -.
<br />
<br />Actually the &quot;y = f(x)&quot;  form will come later, with the goal of  
<br />
distinguishing clearly the key difference between a function and the  
<br />
many possible forms of a function.
<br />
<br /><br />Ah! but you force me to define what is a function right on (for a  
<br />
mathematician of course). Take it easy. You can skip to the sum-up  
<br />
line below.
<br />
<br /><br />OK, ready? I mean the others among those who pursue this mathematical  
<br />
shortcut toward the seventh step (the UD step, actually).
<br />
<br /><br />We have already seen functions. If you remember the bijection between  
<br />
A = {a,b,c,d,e,f,g} and B = {1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7}.
<br />
<br />a  ----------  7
<br />
b  ----------  2
<br />
c  ----------  3
<br />
d  ----------  4
<br />
e  ----------  5
<br />
f  ----------  6
<br />
g  ----------  1
<br />
<br /><br />I said that the following set of couples
<br />
<br />{(a,1), (b,2) (c,3) (d,4), (e,5), (f,6), (g,7)}
<br />
<br />was a nice &quot;set theoretical&quot; representation of the bijection, and that  
<br />
the bijection is an example of function. We can give it a name, F, for  
<br />
example.
<br />
<br />F = {(a,1), (b,2) (c,3) (d,4), (e,5), (f,6), (g,7)}.
<br />
<br />A function is a mathematical object, actually a set, which embodies an  
<br />
association between the elements of two sets. Here the two sets  
<br />
involved are A and B.
<br />
A is said to be the domain of F. B is said to be the range of F. And  
<br />
the function itself, F,  get a nice set theoretical  &quot;form&quot; of a set.  
<br />
The set of all the couples which determine or define the association.  
<br />
Here it is the set {(a,1), (b,2) (c,3) (d,4), (e,5), (f,6), (g,7)}.
<br />
<br />Arbitrary set of couples will appear as very good way to describe  
<br />
relation, in general.
<br />
<br /><br />But for function a key condition, the functional condition, has to be  
<br />
applied:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If (a, b) belongs to F then if (a, c) belongs to F we have  
<br />
that b = c.   (the functional condition).
<br />
<br /><br />This means, that if F is a function from the set A to the set B, you  
<br />
cannot associate to one object of A, many objects of B.
<br />
<br />For example the temperature in a place can be a function of time,  
<br />
because at each moment of time you will not associate two temperatures.
<br />
It is the key point for seeing that a function from A to B, describe a  
<br />
very general notion of dependency.
<br />
<br />We will be interested in functions from N to N. (With N = {0, 1,  
<br />
2, ...}. Where examples abound.
<br />
<br />Take the function which associates to each natural number its successor.
<br />
<br />The function is (or is represented &quot;fully&quot;) by the infinite set of  
<br />
couples
<br />
<br />{(0, 1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5, 6), (6, 7), ...}
<br />
<br />We will be interested in function having two arguments. Those will be  
<br />
the function from NXN to N. Example: take addition. This is a  
<br />
function, because when you add any numbers, 03 and 6, for example, 3+6,  
<br />
you don't expect two results. So the functional condition is  
<br />
respected. OK? So the function addition can be defined or represented  
<br />
by the set
<br />
<br />{((0, 0), 0), ((0, 1) 1) ...  ((4, 8) 12) ... }
<br />
<br />With the numbers, all the operations are functions. The same with the  
<br />
sets.
<br />
<br /><br />To sum up: a function is a set of couples, most of the time infinite,  
<br />
respecting the functional condition.
<br />
<br />A good training consists in searching all functions between little sets:
<br />
<br /><br />Exercise:
<br />
<br /><br />1) how many functions and what are they, from the set {0, 1} to  
<br />
himself. What are the functions from {0, 1) to {0, 1}?
<br />
<br />Solution:
<br />
<br />{(0,0), (1,0)}   the constant function which associates zero to any  
<br />
value of its argument.
<br />
{(0,1), (1,1)}   the constant function which associates one to any  
<br />
value of its argument.
<br />
{(0,0), (1,1)}  the identity function, which output its argument as  
<br />
value.
<br />
{(0,1), (1,0)}, the NOT function, which associate 00 to 1, and 01 to 0.
<br />
<br />There is four functions from {0, 1} to {0, 1}.
<br />
<br /><br />2) how many functions, and what are they, from the set cartesian  
<br />
product {0, 1} X {0, 1} to {0, 1}
<br />
<br />Among them many are celebrities, you know. The AND, the OR, and many  
<br />
(how many?) others.
<br />
<br />For a beginner in math, this is not at all an easy exercise. The real  
<br />
useful exercise is to try to understand the enunciation of the  
<br />
question. We will take the time needed.
<br />
<br /><br />3) A bit tricky perhaps: how many functions exist from { } to { } ?
<br />
<br /><br />----------------------------------------- SUM UP LINE  
<br />
----------------------
<br />
<br />So functions, once mathematical objects, are just set of couples,  
<br />
verifying a condition. We will be interested in the functions from N  
<br />
to N. Each such function is an infinite set of couples.
<br />
<br />Some function have some form, or related expression. Not all though  
<br />
(as we will see), and we will have to study the relation between form  
<br />
and function. Many functions will lack a form, and this will not  
<br />
prevent them to play some role in the life of those who have a form.
<br />
<br />John, we will see who plot which functions and why. I promise.  ;)
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
