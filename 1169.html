<em class="quotelev1">&gt;demonstration of &quot;digital character&quot;, the default value being analogicalness.

<br />Do you think that a distance of 10^-500 has a accepted meaning for any 
<br />
physicist. Some physicist and mathematician believe that &quot;analogical&quot; 
<br />
system are &quot;idealisations&quot;. At least with the &quot;digital&quot; there is Church
<br />
Thesis which makes things clearer.
<br />

<br />Any reasonable quantized version of Schroedinger equation. Nobody has ever
<br />
proved the necessity of non-computable real numbers there. Only Penrose
<br />
seems to search non-computability there, for rather obscur reasons.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Independantly of the practical possibility, I see no reason why duplicated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;people would fail the Turing test.
</em><br />
<br />I see no reason too. Comp is indeed the hypothesis that duplicated people
<br />
are equivalent from their first person point of view.
<br />
Well, of course comp ask for a digital truncation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree completely with you- comp2 is actually the hypothesis that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computation of the physical properties of an analogical machine (e.g. our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brain) can emulate this machine from the first person point of view.
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand. Comp need the digital &quot;approximation&quot;.
<br />
The discussion here will be impossible if you don't tell me precisely what
<br />
is an analogical machine, without using the vague &quot;continuum feeling&quot; 
<br />
which
<br />
is what I want to explain.
<br />
<br />All what I say is that IF comp is correct THEN
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) There is no need to postulate the existence of a substancial 
<br />
universe,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) There is a simple explanation (WTP) why we 'see' many universe. 
<br />
(WTP = 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Weak Turing-tropic Principle)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The idea that we can disappear (die) can only be whishfull thinking
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) ALL physical predicate are computationnal modalities, and ALL 
<br />
physical
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laws are deducible from computer science/number theory.
<br />
<br />It is still possible that IF comp is correct THEN there are flying 
<br />
rabbits 
<br />
or just Noise, etc. (So that comp would be refuted). 
<br />
<br />I like COMP because it makes possible to work with a concrete plenitude 
<br />
principle (George Levy term), and it implies (easily) apparent 
<br />
indeterminism,
<br />
non-locality, and our belief in the continuum.
<br />
<br />And if you take a substancial continuum for granted (like Penrose), then 
<br />
OK,
<br />
comp must be false for you. I have no problem with that.
<br />
<br />The problem exists only for people (the majority!, perhaps not in 
<br />
this list), who believe (implicitly or explicitly) in comp AND who believe
<br />
at the same time in a  &quot;physical substancial material&quot; Universe.
<br />
<br />The problem (misunderstanding) between us is not philosophical but
<br />
methodological. I don't want to defend comp, just to put it toward its 
<br />
logical
<br />
limits.
<br />
If we ever find a real contradiction in comp, we will be both winner here.
<br />
But we must not confuse the strange with the absurd, or the 
<br />
counter-intuitive
<br />
with the contradictory.
<br />
And untill now, comp seems to be confirmed by the facts (cf QM, MWI, etc.)
<br />
<br />Bruno.
