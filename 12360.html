Hi Jef,
<br />
<br />Please, don't hesitate to skip the remarks you could find a bit too 
<br />
technical, but which could help others who know perhaps a bit more on G 
<br />
and G*, which are theories which I use to tackle many questions in this 
<br />
list. You can come back on those remarks if ever
<br />
you got time and motivation to do so.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Although we all share the illusion of a direct and immediate sense 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of consciousness, on what basis can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; you claim that it actually is real?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Because we cannot doubt it. It is the real message,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; imo, of Descartes &quot;diagonal argument&quot;: it is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fixed point of doubt. If we decide to doubt everything,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we will find ourselves, at some stage, doubting we doubt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of everything. The same for relativization: we cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relativize everything without an absolute base on which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that relativization is effective.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is a subtle, and non-traditional thought:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Classical philosophy always put the Reasoner at the center of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure of reasoning. But with our more developed awareness of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolution, evolutionary psychology, cognitive science, it is becoming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clearer that this pure &quot;Copernican&quot; view of reasoning is invalid.  We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now can see that every Reasoner is embedded within some a priori
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; framework such that there is an intrinsic bias or offset to any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective construct.  When we are aware that there is fundamental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bias,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is clear that one can not validly reason to the point of doubting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything.
</em><br />
<br />All this makes sense to me. I can interpret your terms in the 
<br />
(post-godelian) mechanist theory of mind/matter. The &quot;bias&quot; is given by 
<br />
our &quot;body&quot; itself, or our &quot;godel number&quot; or any &quot;correct&quot; 3-person 
<br />
description of ourselves (like the artificial digital body proposed by 
<br />
the digital computationalist doctor).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When all that is in doubt is removed, we don't arrive at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zero as is classically thought,
</em><br />
<br /><br />... before Godel &amp; Co. Classical philosophy is different before and 
<br />
after Turing, Post, Church, Godel, Markov, Uspenski, Kolmogorov, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but at some indistinct offset determined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by our very nature as a reasoner embedded in a real environment.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here there is a technical problem because there is just no &quot;real 
<br />
environment&quot;; but it could be easily resolved by replacing &quot;real 
<br />
environment&quot; by &quot;relatively most probable computational histories&quot;.
<br />
This is more coherent with both the comp hyp and quantum mechanics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Understanding this eliminates the pressure to deal with conceptual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identities leading to meaningless absolutes.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure which &quot;meaningless absolutes&quot; you refer too. In the comp 
<br />
theory many simple truth can be considered as absolute and indeed 
<br />
communicably so (like arithmetical truth, piece of set theoretical 
<br />
truth, ...). Also the first person (which admit some precise 
<br />
definition) is related to some absolutes.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This understanding also helps resolve other philosophical &quot;paradoxes&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such as solipsism, meaning of life, free-will and others hinging on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea of a subjective center.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmmm here I think you are a bit quick. But I have no problem with many 
<br />
philosophical paradoxes, although the theory solves them with different 
<br />
degree of quality. &quot;Free-will&quot; is due in part to the availability, for 
<br />
enough rich universal machine, of its &quot;ignorance space&quot;. Somehow I am 
<br />
free to choose going to the movie or to the theater because ... I don't 
<br />
know what I want .... Once I know what I want, I remain free in the 
<br />
sense of being self-determinate about my (future) action.
<br />
For the modalist: The 3-description of that difference space is given 
<br />
by G* (truth about the self-referential ability of the machine) and G 
<br />
(what the machine can prove about its self-referential ability). But G* 
<br />
minus G admit modal variants, so that the ignorance space, like the 
<br />
whole of arithmetical truth differentiates with the change of point of 
<br />
view. This indeed shed light on many paradoxes (and, BTW, can also be 
<br />
used to show invalid many reasonings in cognitive computer science).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If you want (like David
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and George) consciousness is our criteria of &quot;absolute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (but not 3-communicable) truth&quot;. I don't think we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; genuinely doubt we are conscious, although we can doubt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on any content of that consciousness, but that is different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We can doubt having been conscious in some past, but we cannot doubt 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; being conscious here and now, whatever that means.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;...&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The &quot;truth&quot; here bears on the existence of the experience, and has  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nothing to do with anything which could be reported by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experiencer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On this basis I understand your point, and as long as we are very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; careful about conveying which particular meaning of &quot;knowing&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;certainty&quot;, and &quot;truth&quot; we are referring to, then there will be little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confusion.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But such dual usage leaves us at risk of our thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; repeatedly falling into the singularity of the self, from which there's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no objective (and thus workable) basis for any claim.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here I disagree. The only risk I see, is the confusion between the 
<br />
3-self (grosso modo my body or body description) and the 1-self (which 
<br />
*from his view* has no body at all, nor any description).
<br />
This is a difficult point. G* proves that the 1-self and the 3-self are 
<br />
the same (extensionally: they have the same 3-behavior, same body, 
<br />
etc.). But G* proves also that G does not prove that equivalence so 
<br />
that from the first person view of the machine, those views are quite 
<br />
distinct and in particular they obey different logic. Simplifying a 
<br />
bit: the 3-view = classical logic, the 1-view = intuitionistic logic, 
<br />
the 1-plural view = quantum logic).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My personal experience is that there's no paradox at all if one is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; willing to fully accept that within any framework of description there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is absolutely no difference at all between a person and a zombie,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Should we send our children in jail when they torture their dolls? I am 
<br />
afraid you are using your own G* as it was a G, making the confusion 
<br />
described above. Sorry for analysing your comment in my &quot;theoretical 
<br />
terms&quot;.  I am NOT pretending the theory is correct, but in the worst 
<br />
case it can help as a sort of etalon for classifying other approaches.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even the most philosophically cognizant, being evolved human organisms,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will snap back to defending the existence of a 1st person point of view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even though it isn't detectable or measurable and has absolutely no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effect on the physical world.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course (for the long-time reader of the list, albeit soundly 
<br />
skeptical) I believe (assuming comp) the contrary: what we call 
<br />
&quot;physical world&quot; should eventually be explained in term of sheaf of 
<br />
cohering machine dreams. the &quot;cohering&quot; factor makes possible to glue 
<br />
together those dreams making us believe in a local physical reality, 
<br />
but that reality emerge from *all* machine dreams 
<br />
(1-plural-computations).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is virtually impossible for many people to see that even IF the 1st
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person experience actually exists, it can't be described, even by that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person,
</em><br />
<br />Good intuition (with respect to the comp hyp.) This is even provable by 
<br />
the machine itself (in the form: If I am consistent then the first 
<br />
person cannot be described in any third person way by myself).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; except from a third person perspective.
</em><br />
<br />Only trough a guess, I insist.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That voice in your own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind, those images in your imagination, none can be said to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experienced without being interpreted.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The idea of direct experience is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incoherent.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, some inputs needs less internal processing than others. Some 
<br />
experiences are &quot;more direct&quot; than others. In any case, conscious 
<br />
experience most probably needs some non trivial self-reflecting 
<br />
processing and are not &quot;direct&quot;. There are many &quot;universal machine&quot; in 
<br />
a brain, dynamically mirroring each others.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It always carries the implication that there's some other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process there to have the experience.  It's turtles all the way down.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is here that theoretical computer science can provide fixed points, 
<br />
i.e. definite solution for infinite regress. The key idea for 
<br />
self-reference can be technically approached through diagonalization 
<br />
procedure. As illustration you get self-reproduction by applying a 
<br />
duplicator on itself: if for all x, Dx gives xx, then DD gives DD.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The essence of Buddhist training is to accept this non-existence of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Self
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at a deep level.  It is very rare, but not impossible to achieve such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding, and while still experiencing the illusion, to see it as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an illusion, with no actual boundary to distinguish an imagined self
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the rest of nature. I think that a machine intelligence, while
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; requiring a model of self, would have no need of this illusion which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a result of our evolutionary development.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure about that. Once the machine has a &quot;model&quot; of itself, 
<br />
there is part of itself which will be interpreted correctly as 
<br />
&quot;perceptive fields&quot; in the company of measurable but incommunicable 
<br />
intensities, and this can provide natural candidates for qualia.
<br />
Some &quot;local self&quot; can be illusory, but some enlarged global self could 
<br />
be &quot;correct illusion&quot;, i.e. stable and consistent lawful &quot;illusion&quot; 
<br />
with respect to its most probable (set of) computational histories.
<br />
I don't think this is &quot;completely programmable&quot;, but it is partially 
<br />
programmable by some formula like &quot;help yourself&quot;, and so I could agree 
<br />
this necessitate &quot;evolutionary development&quot;. Those developments could 
<br />
be necessary long (thus deep in Bennett sense for those who have read 
<br />
Bennett). Again, in that sense, I agree with you. But such long 
<br />
computation generates our &quot;bio-physics&quot;. Physics is &quot;secondary&quot; with 
<br />
respect to the set of all possible computations (cf Church thesis).
