Dear Juergen:
<br />
<br />At 4/3/01, you wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; caterpillars.  Now stir with my Everything/Nothing alternation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Stir how? In a computable way? You might want to try to formally describe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what you mean.
</em><br />
<br />I believe that attempting an extensive detailed formal description of the 
<br />
Everything is the wrong approach. IMO - at least in this case - the more 
<br />
information used to describe, the smaller the thing described.
<br />
<br />I became convinced some time ago and before joining this list that the 
<br />
actual foundation of our experience was &quot;no information&quot;.  So how does one 
<br />
describe &quot;no information&quot; or &quot;The Nothing&quot;?  Since it is empty it is 
<br />
anisomorphic.
<br />
<br />I hit on the idea that its very emptiness may make it Godelian 
<br />
incomplete.  Since The Nothing can not resolve any question whatsoever the 
<br />
issue became an effort to construct a meaningful one.
<br />
<br />That brought me to the question of its stability.  Can The Nothing 
<br />
endure?  I do not see &quot;Time&quot; as entering by the back door via this question 
<br />
because it is an issue of stasis not flow.  I see no way for The Nothing to 
<br />
escape addressing the issue of the durability i.e. stability of its own 
<br />
stasis.
<br />
<br />Since The Nothing is sans logic to address this issue it must resort to 
<br />
test by perturbation.  IMO the minimum perturbation is for The Nothing to 
<br />
directly become The Everything.   According to the notion that no selection 
<br />
- i.e. having all information - is identical to having no information - The 
<br />
Everything is just a different configuration of &quot;no information&quot; - well 
<br />
almost.
<br />
<br />The interesting thing is that the Everything being a perturbation from the 
<br />
Nothing does not contain the Nothing. Subtracting the Nothing from &quot;all 
<br />
information&quot; to produce the Everything is the smallest selection 
<br />
[perturbation] I can think of.  The idea being that no information and all 
<br />
information are identical but the Everything is not quite all 
<br />
information.  For this reason I prefer the name Superverse.
<br />
<br />The perturbation is a history destroying event.  The Superverse, lacking 
<br />
knowledge of its origin, has exposure to the same unresolvable question re 
<br />
its stability.  To test this it must execute a perturbation to the 
<br />
Nothing.  Again a history destroying event.  So here is a 
<br />
Superverse/Nothing [S/N] alternation or foundation for our experience.
<br />
<br />I also had a description of this alternation idea in an earlier post:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2663.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2663.html</a>
<br />
<br />So having arrived at the idea that a Superverse does show up what do we do 
<br />
to understand our place in it?  This would be making a further 
<br />
selection.  Now the larger the piece of the Superverse you describe the 
<br />
less information you should need to describe it. So select pieces of this 
<br />
Superverse that can support our universe until one finds one with the 
<br />
shortest description. This in a way brought me to the idea of pattern.  A 
<br />
pattern may be represented buy a binary string but need not be a 
<br />
number.   I select a very large piece of the Superverse by describing a no 
<br />
further selection seething foamy fractal pattern of patterns.  To minimize 
<br />
non uniformity and selection within the fractal each pattern is present an 
<br />
infinite number of times.
<br />
<br />Each pattern has a set of isomorphic links which are either active or 
<br />
possible states of universes.
<br />
<br />Now why seething?  First there is the history destroying S/N alternation so 
<br />
each manifestation of the Superverse  is an independent pattern of 
<br />
patterns.  Second to avoid a selection during a Superverse manifestation 
<br />
and the resulting increase in information the active/possible status of 
<br />
isomorphic links should be an uncoordinated dynamic.
<br />
<br />Each link &quot;j&quot; has a self contained set of rules Rj for finding its possible 
<br />
successor link(s) within the fractal.  When one such possible successor 
<br />
link is &quot;encountered&quot; during the seething it becomes the next state of that 
<br />
universe.  This is a link shift.  There is no coordination between links.
<br />
<br />Again avoiding selection these rules can be anything from simple to highly 
<br />
complex, and completely deterministic [only one successor link is 
<br />
acceptable] to totally random [all links are acceptable successors].  So 
<br />
which Rj is ours?  I believe the answer is a simple set of rules with some 
<br />
true noise content operating in links to finite patterns.
<br />
<br />As to my rationale for a presence of true noise in our universe see my work 
<br />
in progress,  George Levy style FAQ contribution at: [The intro is largely 
<br />
a repeat of the above.] [ It also fixes a number of problems in the model 
<br />
for those who have looked at my larger paper before.]

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one allows an infinite repeat of each and every natural number 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not a uniform distribution?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;There are many ways of repeating each natural number infinitely often.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;But what does this have to do with a uniform distribution? How do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;assign probabilities to numbers?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The scenario I was trying to create is where you have numbers with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; different properties say some short strings, some long strings, some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; patterned strings, some with complex patterns, etc. etc.  Now on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; line numbers with one family of properties may be more or less numerous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; than numbers with another family of properties.  If you put all these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; numbers in a bag and reach in and pull out a number at random the largest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; family would have the greatest probability of having a member be the one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; pulled out - an uneven distribution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Pull out at random?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The topic of this thread is precisely: where does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the randomness come from?
</em><br />
<br />Rather it is evident from the above that I think the real question is how 
<br />
to base our particular isomorphism on &quot;no information&quot;.   Our instinctive 
<br />
reaction - to which Russell draws attention - that a random string contains 
<br />
no information is in this venue perhaps the right assessment.  In my model 
<br />
getting a random sequence is no trouble at all - just use a &quot;do not care&quot; 
<br />
Rj.  The &quot;pull out at random&quot; is a valid reflection of my model since the 
<br />
seething of both sorts will effect the dwell between link shifts.  Any SAS 
<br />
in a link so effected will not notice this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now increase the contents of the bag so that all the original numbers are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in there with an infinite number of repeats - all families of properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would have the identical probability of  having a member be the one pulled
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; out - an even distribution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why? Suppose every 2^n-th number in the bag is n. Then each number is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;repeated infinitely many times. But why should P(17) equal P(42)?
</em><br />
<br />In reference to the discussion above the shifting of a link from pattern to 
<br />
pattern in the fractal described is on a global basis absent preference for 
<br />
a particular pattern.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is an instructive little exercise: Try to precisely describe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a probability distribution on the natural numbers such that all are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equally likely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Similar to some properties of my Everything but I use pattern rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; number.  All numbers may be patterns but not all patterns are numbers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then try to precisely describe a probability distribution on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinitely many patterns such that all are equally likely.
</em><br />
<br />Remember my point of view - minimum descriptive need [uniform distribution] 
<br />
is an indicator that a very large piece of the Superverse is being described.
<br />
