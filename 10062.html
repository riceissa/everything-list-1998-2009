<br />I should clarify, I meant that our ideas are even worse in terms of
<br />
systematic exploration of all the possibilities, because we generally
<br />
consider an infinity of possible universes, while the string theory
<br />
landscape predicts (some people say) about 10^500 possible universes.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you see that they haven't really formulated rigorous theories about measure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilities etc. of the multiverse. It's still very much in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;handwaving&quot; stage.
</em><br />
<br />This is actually a very interesting paper, by Starkman and Trotta.  I had
<br />
seen some mention of it but hadn't tracked it down.  Here is the abstract:
<br />
<br />&quot;We revisit anthropic arguments purporting to explain the measured value
<br />
of the cosmological constant. We argue that different ways of assigning
<br />
probabilities to candidate universes lead to totally different anthropic
<br />
predictions. As an explicit example, we show that weighting different
<br />
universes by the total number of possible observations leads to an
<br />
extremely small probability for observing a value of Lambda equal to or
<br />
greater than what we now measure. We conclude that anthropic reasoning
<br />
within the framework of probability as frequency is ill-defined and
<br />
that it cannot be used to explain the value of Lambda, nor, likely,
<br />
any other physical parameters.&quot;
<br />
<br />The paper is pretty technical but I thought I could understand the gist
<br />
of it.  The cosmological constant (&quot;Lambda&quot;) is a repulsive force which
<br />
drives galaxies apart in the Big Bang model.  Until a few years ago it was
<br />
thought to be entirely theoretical, but since then observations indicate
<br />
that it is real, and that the universal expansion is accelerating.
<br />
The question then becomes what would happen in universes with different
<br />
values of the CC.
<br />
<br />The paper basically shows that observers (or civilizations) can last
<br />
longer in universes with smaller CC's.  The CC eventually puts an end
<br />
to the observations that can be made, because the expansion gets too
<br />
fast and there is no longer enough energy density.  The higher the CC,
<br />
the sooner this happens.  With CC's as high as what we observe, the
<br />
theoretical lifetime of civilization is much shorter than in universes
<br />
with smaller CC's.
<br />
<br />The authors choose to use as their measure, the number of times the
<br />
CC can be measured in a given universe.  This makes low-CC universes
<br />
have a much higher measure, because the window for CC observations is
<br />
longer in those.  Hence they conclude that the highest probability is
<br />
for a CC much smaller than we observe, and so our own CC value cannot
<br />
be explained anthropically.
<br />
<br />This is in contrast to earlier results which used different measures, such
<br />
as the number of galaxies, and found that our CC results were consistent
<br />
with anthropic considerations.  The authors argue that their measure is
<br />
at least as philosphically justifiable as those earlier papers, and their
<br />
real point is that no measure can be justified as better than another,
<br />
hence all anthropic reasoning is just hand-waving.
<br />
<br />In our terms we might put it like this.  The new paper essentially uses a
<br />
measure which is the number of possible observer-moments in the universe.
<br />
Universes with a high CC go through a &quot;big rip&quot; process eventually,
<br />
accelerating to a super-expansion mode and presumably putting an end
<br />
to observers.  Universes with a low or zero CC go through this much
<br />
later or not at all, allowing for more observer-moments.  Hence this
<br />
measure gives a bonus to universes that last a long time.
<br />
<br />Earlier papers apparently looked at a snapshot of time similar to the
<br />
present day, and in effect based the measure on the number of observers
<br />
(assumed to be proportional to the number of galaxies).  So we have a
<br />
distinction between an observer-moment measure and an observer measure.
<br />
The two apparently give very different results, the OM measure preferring
<br />
long-lasting universes while the observer measure is more interested in
<br />
the size of the universe.
<br />
<br />I guess I'll stop here and see if there is more interest.  To leave with
<br />
a few questions: Is there any fundamental way to decide which measure
<br />
is &quot;best&quot;?  Do the OM measure and the observer measure really give
<br />
different results, and is that significant?  Are there other measures
<br />
that might be used, and what results would they get?  And finally, will
<br />
this apparent failure of anthropic reasoning discredit the concept among
<br />
working physicists?  As I mentioned, I've already seen it used in a blog
<br />
common on Woit's blog that I pointed to the other day, in just that way.
