Hi All,
<br />
<br />Wei Dai wrote (in part):
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps it would help if list members each posts a short biography of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;themselves, and tell us their intellectual backgrounds. What fields are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you familiar with, what relevant books/papers have you read, etc.? This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way, if you don't understand someone's post, you can look up his JOINING
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;post in the archive and figure out what background he is assuming. I got
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this idea from the SL4 mailing list; maybe it will work here as well.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. I am a belgium mathematician from Brussels University (born in 
<br />
Germany 1955).
<br />
I got a PhD thesis at the french University of Lille (you can download
<br />
it from my URL). The subject of the thesis is ..., well almost the very subject
<br />
of this list: it is a deductive argument showing that if we take very
<br />
seriously the computationnalist hypothesis in the cognitive science, then
<br />
the mind body problem is partially reduced into a derivation of the physical
<br />
laws from the platonic existence of *all* computations. A consequence is that
<br />
physics becomes a branch of &quot;machine's psychology&quot;.
<br />
How did I find this? My starting obsessive question was &quot;How long lives
<br />
an amoeba?&quot;, or &quot;Does an amoeba survive its self-replication?&quot;. I made public
<br />
my first &quot;theory&quot; in 1963 (at school), where I answered positively
<br />
the last question. After that, my poor mind transforms itself into a 
<br />
battlefield
<br />
where two different approaches concerning the amoeba question evolve.
<br />
The first approach was biological and mainly mechanist and discrete, the
<br />
second approach was chemical and based on the idea that a continuum exists,
<br />
which  put a doubt on the biological discreteness. So I got conflicting
<br />
craving for biology and chemistry. My first bible-book was the book
<br />
by Watson &quot;Molecular Biology of the Gene&quot; (its french version). Its chapter
<br />
&quot;The cells obey to the chemical laws&quot; leads me to Pauling books on chemistry.
<br />
But I got a feeling that despite appearances biology was more fundamental
<br />
that physics. I was suspecting the existence of a more abstract biology capable
<br />
of explaining the form of the physical laws, and that it should be so if we
<br />
want ever been able to understand the nature of reality and where did it come
<br />
from.
<br />
In 1971 I discover Logic in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and soon after I 
<br />
discover books
<br />
on Godel's theorems containing an abstract (matter independent) explanation of
<br />
self-replication processes.
<br />
The Godelian logic of self-reference appears to be a good candidate for the
<br />
abstract biology and psychology I was searching.
<br />
This solved my Chemist/Biology hesitation, and I decided to do math 
<br />
at university.
<br />
Unfortunately most mathematicians, including the only
<br />
local logician, were allergic to Godel's theorem! (not so rare attitude)
<br />
I will submit different project
<br />
for a thesis in 1977, including a work showing that the bacteria Escherichia
<br />
Coli was essentially Turing equivalent. Although biologists and engineers were
<br />
interested, the mathematicians were negative (to say the least), so 
<br />
much that I get a
<br />
depression which leads me to Buddhism and Taoism for years, earning my life by
<br />
teaching mathematics or working for private societies (biotechnology), and
<br />
using my free-time for meditation and chineese calligraphy, but also more and
<br />
more chemistry (again) and quantum chemistry.
<br />
10 years later, biologists, physicians (!) and engineers from 
<br />
Brussels, but also a
<br />
logician from Liege (other city in Belgium) will &quot;force&quot; me to publish a
<br />
paper in a proceeding for a meeting at Toulouse around artificial intelligence
<br />
and cognitive science, and they will provide me a financement for 
<br />
doing a thesis.
<br />
The paper &quot;Theoretical computer science and philosophy of mind&quot; (which includes
<br />
the result of my thesis except theorem 14) will be
<br />
published in 1988 at Toulouse (precise french ref in my thesis).
<br />
It contains the comp and quantum suicide argument, the movie graph argument
<br />
(one year before Maudlin, I've been lucky!). The logical technical part
<br />
has been  shortened for length reasons, though. I will published 
<br />
those missing part
<br />
in 1991 and 1992: Amoeba, planaria and dreaming machine, Mechanism and Personal
<br />
Identity. (ref in the thesis).
<br />
Then I will be asked to submit the thesis at Brussels. Due to the continued
<br />
harrasment by the same Godel-allergic mathematicians I will eventually (1998)
<br />
submit it at the french university of Lille. I'm still working at IRIDIA at
<br />
Brussels University. I finance myself like almost everybody at IRIDIA
<br />
(cf my URL). Although I got a price for the thesis one year after (in 1999), I
<br />
know it will still take some time before people get familiar with the idea.
<br />
I know that in this list some people have had very similar intuition and I
<br />
encourage them to work them out---despite academical difficulties in front of
<br />
novelties.
<br />

Strictly speaking the background needed for my work is -Mathematical 
Logic, Quantum
Mechanics and some Cognitive Science.
A shortcut for the logic part of the thesis are the following two books:
    - Formal Logic its scope and limits, by Richard Jeffrey (McGraw-Hill, Second
      Ed.1981).    A good elementary introduction to formal logic.
    - Computability and Logic, by George Boolos and Richard Jeffrey (Cambridge
      University Press (third ed. 1989).
I mentionned often the Boolos 1993 as the classical treatise of the (modal)
Godelian logics of self-reference (also known as &quot;logics of 
provability&quot;, mainly
the modal logics G and G* and their children).
Smullyan's book &quot;Forever Undecided&quot; is a recreative introduction to G.
But see also for the machine-mind/godel link the important book by Judson Webb:
&quot;Mechanism, Mentalism and Metamathematics&quot; D. Reidel Publishing Co., Dordrecht.
My favorite textbook on quantum mechanics is the two volumes &quot;Cohen-Tannoudji
Diu Laloe&quot; Quantum Mechanics I &amp; II, (Hermann editeur for the french edition,
I know it has been translated in English but I ignore where).
&quot;Mind's I&quot; edited by Dennett and Hofstadter can help the understanding of the
pure cognitive part of my thesis. Science fiction book like &quot;permutation city&quot;
by Greg Egan or the older &quot;simulacron 3&quot; by Daniel Galouye are good 
introduction too.
----
Currently I am working and teaching math. I give also an elementary free course
on the mind body problem, including comparisons between classical and quantum
computing/information sciences, self-reference logic, etc.
Since I read Kitaev paper(++) on topological quantum computing I am interested
in knot theory and I am currently reading the very good &quot;Knots and Physics&quot;
by Louis H. Kauffmann (Singapore publi.). It is not impossible that knots will
help me to make progress in the search of a formal semantics for Z1* (which is
the &quot;physical theory&quot; extracted from the machine 
psychology/self-reference logic).
I am writting (very slowly) a long and technical papers corresponding 
to my french thesis. It is hard to find a good way of writing which 
can satisfy simultaneously cognitivists, logicians and physicists.
(++) Downloadable at <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/find">http://xxx.lanl.gov/find</a>   (Los Alamos Archives)
      quant-ph/9707021 [abs, ps, pdf, other] :
      Title: Fault-tolerant quantum computation by anyons
      Authors: A. Yu. Kitaev
      Comments: 27 pages, Latex2e, uses amssymb.sty, 13 Postscript figures
Oh! Looking for the correct orthograph of &quot;Kauffman&quot; I just discover its recent
&quot;biologic&quot; (See <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0204007">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0204007</a> ) which 
beginning is quite akin to the abstract biology I worked on and 
described in &quot;Amoeba, Planaria ...&quot;,
perhaps even easier to read. I'm quite glad to discover Kauffman has no
prejudice against non mathematical use of Godel ...
I want also point on John Case's web page for similar abstract-biological
application of godelian type of self-reference: 
<a href="http://www.cis.udel.edu/~case/self-ref.html">http://www.cis.udel.edu/~case/self-ref.html</a>
Other reference are in my thesis (for exemple John Myhill).
I guess you all know Everett, Deutsch ... so I stop here.
