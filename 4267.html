</em><br />
<br />Bruno is right that I would emphasize the mathematics over the &quot;COMP&quot; 
<br />
aspects. Computations are kinds of mathematics: mappings, iterations, 
<br />
theorem provings, even topological operations of various kinds. Not all 
<br />
mathematics is easily implemented on computers, but the principle is 
<br />
clear.
<br />
<br />I suppose I am partly a Platonist, in that I believe there's more to 
<br />
mathematics than merely symbol manipulation (the Formalist) school. 
<br />
Computers are exciting because they give us another way to make real 
<br />
(or reify) the abstractions of mathematics. I believe, for example, 
<br />
that categories (e.g., HILB or VECT) are in some sense &quot;real,&quot; that we 
<br />
can send our minds and our computers as robot explorers into these 
<br />
&quot;scapes&quot; of Platonia, into the ideosphere, into noespace, or whatever. 
<br />
(Sorry for waxing poetic...)
<br />
<br />There is a sense in which the Platonist point of view is consistent 
<br />
with the Chaitin/Wolfram notion that mathematics will become largely 
<br />
explorational. Arguably, this has been what mathematics has _always_ 
<br />
been, that the process of discovering truths is not about proving 
<br />
theorems from postulates, at least not exclusively. Even geometry got 
<br />
its start not from considering abstractions out of a pure ideosphere, 
<br />
but from issues of measuring the earth (geo-metry), of building 
<br />
pyramids, of dividing farmlands, of measuring grain storage, and so on. 
<br />
Later mathematics was also guided at least partly by the practical, 
<br />
whether the study of differential equations or elliptic functions. Of 
<br />
all of the possibly-provable truths, laid out like stepping stones in a 
<br />
vast marsh of as-yet-unproved and possibly-unprovable truths, which 
<br />
stepping stones are followed, and are laid in the marsh as new proofs 
<br />
are obtained, is often shaped by engineering and physics 
<br />
considerations. Even in the purest areas of mathematics, such as number 
<br />
theory. The Chaitin argument that computers will be used increasingly 
<br />
to explore this landscape is, I think, certainly correct. (Personally, 
<br />
I am tremendously excited to think about what future versions of 
<br />
Mathematica, for example, will look like when running on computers 100 
<br />
or 1000 times faster than my current Mac and running with immersive VR 
<br />
graphics systems. At Moore's Law rates of progress, I'll have this here 
<br />
in my home within the next 10-15 years or so. This is my main interest, 
<br />
more so than speculating on whether the universe runs on a computer or 
<br />
not. But Everything issues touch on this...)
<br />
<br />OK, so which is it, really, Platonism or Formalism? Paul Taylor makes a 
<br />
good case in &quot;Practical Foundations of Mathematics&quot; that category 
<br />
theory in general and topos theory in particular provide the 
<br />
unification of these two points of view. Mathematical objects live in a 
<br />
universe of categories, with certain rules for moving between 
<br />
categories, and that various universes exist as toposes. We as humans 
<br />
can manipulate these rules, learn how these objects behave, and thus 
<br />
explore these spaces.
<br />
<br />Now whether it makes sense (or &quot;is really the case&quot;) to say that 
<br />
Reality is some kind of computer program is not all clear to me. Like 
<br />
many others, I have problems with the notion that reality is a program 
<br />
running on some kind of metacomputer. Perhaps computation is woven into 
<br />
the fabric of spacetime at a deep enough level, and perhaps there are 
<br />
alternative &quot;state machine&quot; rules which could be imagined in other 
<br />
universes (or even in different parts of our universe, e.g., changes in 
<br />
rules at very high energies, or near singularities, etc.
<br />
<br />I'm not--at this time--much engaged by the &quot;universe as a computer 
<br />
program&quot; idea. A useful hypothesis to have--the 
<br />
Zuse/Fredkin/Lloyd/Schmidhuber/Wolfram/etc. thesis, in its various 
<br />
forms--but a long, long way from being established as the most 
<br />
believable hypothesis. To me, at least.
<br />
<br />(I think Egan gives us a fairly plausible, fictional timeline for 
<br />
figuring this stuff out: a workable TOE by the middle of this century, 
<br />
i.e., within our lifetimes. That is, a theory which unifies relativity 
<br />
and QM, and which is presumably also brings in QED, QCD, etc. Perhaps 
<br />
involving a mixture of string/brane theory, spin foams and loop 
<br />
gravity, etc. Lee Smolin has some plausible speculations about how 
<br />
these areas may come together over the next several decades. This TOE 
<br />
is of course not expected to be truly a theory of everything, as we all 
<br />
know: the phrase TOE is mostly about the unification of the two major 
<br />
classes of theories noted above.
<br />
<br />Then perhaps several centuries of very little progress, as the energies 
<br />
to get to the Planck energy are enormous (e.g., compressing a mass 
<br />
about equal to a cell to a size 20 orders of magnitude smaller than a 
<br />
proton). Egan plausibly describes an accelerator the length of a chunk 
<br />
of the solar system, using the most advanced &quot;PASER&quot; (the solid-state 
<br />
lasing accelerators proposed recently), to accelerate particles to the 
<br />
energies where discrepancies in models (computer programs??) might show 
<br />
up. In one of his novels (&quot;Diaspora&quot;) he has this happening a few 
<br />
thousand years from now. This sounds about &quot;right&quot; to me. (I'll be 
<br />
happy to give some of my reasons for &quot;pessimism&quot; on this timetable if 
<br />
there's any real interest.)
<br />
<br />Of course, breakthroughs in mathematics may provide major new clues, 
<br />
which is where I put my efforts.)
<br />
<br />I take the &quot;Everything&quot; ideas in the broader sense, a la Egan's &quot;all 
<br />
topologies model,&quot; a la the &quot;universes as toposes&quot; (topoi) area of 
<br />
study, etc. My focus is more on logic and the connections between 
<br />
topology, algebra, and logic. It may be that we learn that at the 
<br />
Planck scale (approx. 10^-35 m) the causal sets are best modeled as 
<br />
computer-like iterations of the spin graphs. But this is a long way 
<br />
from saying consciousness arises from the COMP hypothesis, so on this 
<br />
topic I am silent. As Wittgenstein said, &quot;Whereof one cannot speak, one 
<br />
must remain silent.&quot; Bluntly, don't talk if you have nothing to say.
<br />
<br />Which is why I have little to say about the COMP hypothesis. I'll be 
<br />
excited if evidence mounts that there's something to it. If the COMP 
<br />
hypothesis has engineering implications, e.g., affects the design of AI 
<br />
systems, this will be cool.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Could we not recover 1-uncertainty from the Kochen-Specker
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theorem of QM itself?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Probably so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />This seems to be assuming the conclusion. Gleason's Theorem and 
<br />
Kochen-Specker are about the properties of Hilbert spaces. But the 
<br />
reason we use the Hilbert space formulation for quantum mechanics, as 
<br />
opposed to just using classical state spaces, is because the Hilbert 
<br />
space formulation (largely of Von Neumann) gave us the &quot;correct&quot; 
<br />
noncommutation, uncertainty principle, Pauli exclusion principle, etc., 
<br />
things which were consistent with the observed properties of simple 
<br />
atoms, slit experiments, etc. In other words, the 
<br />
Planck/Einstein/Heisenberg/Schrodinger/Bohr/etc. results and successful 
<br />
models (e.g., of the atom) gave us the Hilbert space formulation, which 
<br />
Gleason, Bell, Kochen, Specker, etc. then proved theorems about.
<br />
<br />I don't think it would be kosher to assume reality has aspects of the 
<br />
category HILB and then use theorems about Hilbert spaces to then prove 
<br />
the Uncertainty Principle.
<br />
<br />(My apologies if this was not what was intended by &quot;recover 
<br />
1-uncertainty.&quot;)
<br />
<br />This is a good example, by the way, of how the physics applications of 
<br />
Hilbert spaces incentivized mathematicians to study Hilbert spaces in 
<br />
ways they probably would not have had Hilbert spaces just been another 
<br />
of many abstract spaces. Gleason had many interests in pure math, so he 
<br />
probably would have proved his theorem regardless, but Bell, Kochen, 
<br />
and Specker probably would not have had QM issues not been of such 
<br />
interest.
