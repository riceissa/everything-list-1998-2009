Dear Stephen,
<br />
<br /><br />At 10:54 18/06/04 -0400, Stephen Paul King wrote:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Thank you for bringing this book to our attention. I will see if I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;get a copy ASAP. I am very interested in how Changeux deals with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;epiphenomena problem, if he even addresses it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not really, Changeux is eliminarivist both on mind and mathematics!
<br />
He takes that as high-level pure (implicitely 3-person) description of natural
<br />
phenomena.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I have read the Smullyan book and found that it strenghend my insistence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that we need to give a more detailed explanation as to how, at least, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appearence of physical implementations are necessary; he did not address
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physicality at all.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Obviously. It is just an introduction to the Godel-Lob logic G of 
<br />
Self-Reference.
<br />
I would bet he is not aware of my proof that if we are digitalisable 
<br />
machine then
<br />
physics is (re)define as the measure one on the consistent extensions (UDA),
<br />
and he is probably still  less aware of its arithmetical translation
<br />
(the machine interview) and the derivation of QL. Today provability logicians
<br />
and quantum logicians seems not really aware of each others, and all logicians
<br />
and even probably all mathematicians are not really interested in fundamental
<br />
questions.
<br />
Still, Smullyan is aware that G could be useful in (theoretical) artificial
<br />
intelligence; he even asserts that G has a psychological appeal.
<br />
To tell you how &quot;grave&quot; is the situation ;) : Smullyan, like 99,99999999%
<br />
of the scientists, and like 99,999999999% of the laymen since Aristotle,
<br />
believes in a physical reality. Actually there is an explicit passage where
<br />
Smullyan says so by giving a &quot;typical&quot; platonic dualist, even modal, account
<br />
of the difference between math and physics. Let me quote him, but before
<br />
let me recall that, in classical (also called boolean) propositional logic, a
<br />
tautology is a formula true in all possible worlds, where a world is an
<br />
assignement of 1 or 0 to propositional letters. For example,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;((NOT A) OR ((NOT B) OR A)
<br />
<br />has always the truth value 1, independently of the truth value given to
<br />
A or to B, as I hope people can verify by building the truth table.
<br />
<br />After having explain along this way what a tautology is, Smullyan
<br />
says:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt; This is related to Leibniz's notion of possible worlds. Leibniz
<br />
claimed that of all possible worlds, this one was the best. frankly I
<br />
have no idea whether he was right or wrong in this, but the
<br />
interesting things is that he considered other possible worlds. Out
<br />
of this, a whole branch of philosophical logic known as possible world
<br />
semantics has developed in recent years---notably by the philosopher
<br />
Saul Kripke---which we will discuss in a later chapter. Given any
<br />
possible world, the set of all propositions that are true for that world,
<br />
together with the set of propositions that are false for that world,
<br />
constitute the state of affairs holding for *that* world. A tautology,
<br />
then, is true, not only for this world, but for *all* possible worlds.
<br />
The physical sciences are interested in the state of affairs that holds
<br />
for the *actual* world, whereas pure mathematics and logic study
<br />
*all* possible states of affairs. &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Smullyan confuses physics with what I call &quot;geography&quot;!.
<br />
I guess quantum many-worlders have good evidence that physics
<br />
is related to the interference of the many worlds. Also modern laws
<br />
of physics are most of the time derivable from being invariant for
<br />
a (symmetrical) transformation ... among &quot;states of affairs&quot;.
<br />
And computationalists *know* much more: physics is as
<br />
mathematical as mathematics and machine psychology:
<br />
physics entirely emerges from the interference between all
<br />
states of affairs (actually: maximal sequences of states of
<br />
affairs)... as anticipated by sound machines.
<br />
<br />Note also that Smullyan uses (but does not study nor exploit)
<br />
the Thaetetus trick by defining knowledge by true belief: a reasoner
<br />
knows p if he believes p and p is true.
<br />
<br />Note also Smullyan can be quite perverse! Indeed, he proposes
<br />
a &quot;self-referential&quot; interpretation of G*---which arithmetically never
<br />
talks about itself but *about* some machine. It makes look G*
<br />
a very queer (although consistent but not self-referentially correct)
<br />
machine.
<br />
<br />But the book has an infinite charm, and is very much easier
<br />
than Boolos 1993 (classical treatise on G) or Smorinski 1985
<br />
(classical textbook).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hopefully your explanation of G and G* will help.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is really the explanation of my thesis which you need, I am
<br />
afraid I can hardly explain better G than Smullyan. But ok I will
<br />
try. You can find in my url links to this list where I made
<br />
previous attempt. If someone has an idea if we can send mails
<br />
mixed with simple drawings, that would help ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     One question to leave you with: If it can be proved that a physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implementation of quantum computation exist in Nature (in microtubles to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;specific), what effect would this have in your thinking? (I am very aware of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tegmark's paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(<a href="http://www.consciousness.arizona.edu/hameroff/papers/decoherence/decoherenc">http://www.consciousness.arizona.edu/hameroff/papers/decoherence/decoherenc</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;e.html ) but have found a possible loophole that seems to allow coherence to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;occur in long enough durations for quantum computations to take place.)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />It would change nothing.
<br />
Why?  Because the only assumption I am using is that we are (turing) emulable,
<br />
and all known physical unitary transformations (solutions of SWE) are turing
<br />
emulable (albeit &quot;slowly&quot; but this does not matter in UD*, given than the 
<br />
first person
<br />
cannot be aware of the slowness (and even of any &quot;actualness&quot; of an execution)
<br />
of the UD.  Cf UDA.
<br />
<br />(If the brain is a quantum machine following a NON computable unitary
<br />
evolution like Nielsen's one, that is something like e^(i.Omega t), with Omega
<br />
being the Chaitin number of some universal machine, then it could change
<br />
things, but then comp would be false, and we go out of my working
<br />
hypothesis  ;)
<br />
BTW, with comp, the existence of such a non comp unitary evolution is
<br />
highly undecidable.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Hi all,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am rather busy finishing my (french, alas again) paper on the debate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; between the french biologist J.P. Changeux and the french mathematician
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Alain Connes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Actually the book has been translated:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691004056/wwwlink-software-21/202-7192216-8003069">http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691004056/wwwlink-software-21/202-7192216-8003069</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Changeux is a materialist elimininativist. He believes in monistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; materialism. Mathematics, according to him, is exclusively a construction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the human brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Connes is platonist for mathematical truth, but seems to accept some form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of physical realism, so that he accepts a form of platonistic dualism (an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; invention of Aristotle, not Plato: it is the position of realism with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; respect to both math and physics). Connes acknowledges that his position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; entails the mystery of the relation between math and physics (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unreasonable effectiveness of math in physics). Obviously the comp hyp can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reconcile them, but at the price of dismissing physical realism. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; recommend the book. It makes clear the inevitability of a clash between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; forms of realism in science. It is also interesting that Connes uses the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; term of &quot;bifurcation&quot; both in relation with Everett's quantum mechanics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Godel's theorem; that's a point which is made utterly clear in the comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; approach I follow for the fundamental questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I hope also you have been able to buy the little and cheap book &quot;Forever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Undecided&quot; by Smullyan, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; has been re-edited recently, but seems to be again out of print. I will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; make some critical comments about it soon. I definitely consider that book
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as a royal introduction to the modal logic G, which, as you (should) know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is the basic material on which the technical comp derivation of physics is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; extracted. (Well the beginning of the derivation, of course ...). Be sure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you have no more problem with the Universal Dovetailer Argument, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;please
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; don't hesitate to send last minute objections ;)
