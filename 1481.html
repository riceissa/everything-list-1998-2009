<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; More relevantly, it is posulated as highly likely that, starting with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a random Life formation, SAS's will evolve of their own accord. One
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; proves this by showing that our UTM is also a universal constructor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (can take a coded blueprint and build out of it a machine at least as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; complex as itself). UTM is also a universal destructor and therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mobile. Eventually you get evolution and SAS's.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are difficulties with this, due to the difficulty of a formation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defending itself against noise from outside.  The Life universe does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem to lend itself to constructing barriers.  No one has ever built a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wall that could withstand random Life noise.
</em><br />
<br />Life creatures could perhaps overcome these problems by making multiple
<br />
copies of themselves and allowing the majority of them to die. Or life
<br />
organisms
<br />
could detect empy regions of space using the sort of switchback formations
<br />
which
<br />
are used in designing the universal constructor.
<br />
<br />The problems you are suggesting are substantial I agree, but perhaps not
<br />
insurmountable.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, the same thing is true in our universe.  There is no wall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that can withstand everything that can be thrown at it (ultra-high
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; temperatures, relativistic collisions, etc.).  Life has evolved in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; special regions which are relatively gentle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, perhaps if the Life universe was big enough there would be regions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that just happened to be formed of islands large enough to form living
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities, surrounded by empty spaces so that these entities would not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be destroyed from the outside.  But these would be very rare, without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any systematic large-scale phenomena to self-organize biospheres as we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have in our universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Such 'Life' evolution raises an interesting question: These SAS's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would build universities and study mathematics, computer science and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physics. Some J.H.Conway of the Life universe would discover the amusing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and diverting Life game, and start discovering gliders, glider guns,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; space rakes etc. Sooner or later a physicists would hear about this new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; development and the realisation would be made that their universe *is*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a Life simulation. Such a discovery would of course revolutionise the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; study of physics for these SAS's.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is simply an analog to what is happening in our own universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as we discover regularities and create models of fundamental physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Newtonian mathematics was found to apply with tremendous accuracy to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the basic behavior of physical objects, and this has provided insight
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into the possible nature of the universe.
</em><br />
<br />What do you mean by &quot;Newtonian mathematics&quot;? If you mean the basic tools
<br />
of analysis (calculus) then I was always under the impression that it was
<br />
with
<br />
a view to solving problems in physics that Newton made these discoveries in
<br />
the first place.
<br />
<br />I'm talking about someone discovering a model of purely abstract interest and
<br />
then
<br />
realising that this model accurately represents their world. I don't think
<br />
anything
<br />
like this has happened to us yet. My hunch is that it will...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; More interestingly still: when are *we* going to discover some CA or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; similar which turns out to be *our* universe? In my lifetime I hope.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is nothing special about a CA; any set of mathematical laws which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fully describe our universe.  What you are really asking is when or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether we will find a fully unified and universal physical theory.
</em><br />
<br />Yes I am. But I'm also suggesting that such a theory may turn out to be a CA.
<br />
<br />That doesn't mean that CA's are special. Or even that I think that our world
<br />
is a CA.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whether this theory can be expressed in a formulation based on CAs is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insignificant in my opinion.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In particular this would shed no light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatsoever on the likelihood that we are in some sense actually part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a computer simulation.  Computers can simulate any mathematical or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical structure, and there is nothing special and CAs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Of course not. But if we did turn out to be a CA (say) then it would be a bit
<br />
bloody-minded
<br />
to say that this fact was an illusion and we could equally assume our
<br />
universe was
<br />
a LISP program or whatever, even though all such are computationally
<br />
equivalent. Doesn't
<br />
physics search for the most *elegant* formulation of our universe's laws? And
<br />
doesn't
<br />
the coding theorem or some such say, in essence, that the most elegant
<br />
explanations
<br />
(in terms of low Kolmogorov complexity) can be assumed to be the only ones as
<br />
far as
<br />
probability computations (and anthropic arguments) are concerned?
<br />
<br />Also: I don't think that your question of whether we are &quot;actually&quot; part of a
<br />
computer
<br />
simulation has any meaning at all. Our world simply exists, as do all
<br />
possible worlds. Would
<br />
running our world's laws on a giant supercomputer make it exist &quot;more&quot;?
