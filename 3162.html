<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: Marchal &lt;marchal.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The full UDA appears at <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A better more recent version is in the conversation with Joel Dobrzelewski:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;see the main links at <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html</a>
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will comment on the first version because it's the only mostly 
<br />
complete one that's all in one place.  If you have a better version, put it 
<br />
all into one file if you want me to comment on it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is quoted from m1726:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;             The Universal Dovetailer Argument.  (UDA)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;UDA is a proof that:  COMP entails REVERSAL physics/psychology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;COMP is the hypothesis that there is a level such that I survive a digital 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;functional substitution of my generalised body/brain (see above) made at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that level, + Church Thesis (CT: digital = turing) + Arithmetical Platonism 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(AR: the belief that arithmetical propositions obeys classical logic, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this independently of my own cognitive ability).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To sum up: COMP = \exists n SURV-SUBST(n)    + CT   + AR&quot;
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we see the &quot;COMP&quot; with its survival talk.  What it means is not 
<br />
clear.  &quot;Me&quot; is a matter of definition, and that has not been provided.  But 
<br />
onward.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Note also that I'm assuming a minimal amount of folk psychology (FOLK)
</em><br />
without which such an enterprise would be meaningless. It is the
<br />
minimal amount of psychology to understand that you or someone else
<br />
could, in some situation, accept an artificial-digital brain graft,
<br />
and to understand the intuitive difference between first and third
<br />
person. (See below).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intuitive?  I still have no clues about why you think &quot;first person&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;third person&quot; are useful concepts.  But lets go on ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(the modal 'chapter 5' of my thesis can be interpreted as an
</em><br />
attempt (at least) to eliminate FOLK by substituting it by the
<br />
godelian provability logics and its thaetetical variants).
<br />
But the real goal of the  chapter 5 is to make the derivation of
<br />
physics real and concrete.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Note also that it is the AR part of COMP which will makes COMP an
</em><br />
everything type of theory (explicitely so with the UD). This makes
<br />
'my' COMP assumption equivalent to Schmidhuber's one.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To make the reasoning easy I introduce supplementary hypotheses.
</em><br />
I will eliminate these hypotheses in due course.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;a) NEURO: The neurophysiologist hypothesis. This is a supposition that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;level of substitution is high, or that my generalised brain is my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;biological brain (the one in my skull) relevantly described at the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;molecular level (let us say).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, I can't see a new problem with this one, although the old problem 
<br />
that by &quot;level of sub.&quot; I guess you would relate that back to the &quot;would 
<br />
survive&quot; business which has not been defined, is a deeply hidden but 
<br />
embedded problem here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;b) CU: there is a Concrete Universe, whatever it is. This is need for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;decor.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK.  Obviously you will get rid of this supplementary hypothesis at some 
<br />
point, but for now I see no problem with it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;c) CUD: there is a Concrete running of a UD in the concrete universe.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one is actually not obvious, since it requires a universe infinite 
<br />
in both storage capacity and computing time.  A closed universe (assuming no 
<br />
omega point) wouldn't allow this, for example.  An open universe might not 
<br />
either for that matter.  But for now I will accept this assumption.  Clearly 
<br />
though, UD's will be few and far between in any universe that looks like 
<br />
ours.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;d) 3-locality: computations are locally implementable in the concrete 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe. That is it is possible to separate two implementations of two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computations in such a way that the result of one of these computations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will not interfere with the result of the other one. Computations can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;independent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;More generally the result of a computation is independant of any event 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;occuring a long way (out of the light cone) from that computation.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems fine.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;e) Conceptual OCCAM razor. I will not insist. That should be easy for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;many-worlder. The movie-graph argument in my thesis is really an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;elimination of occam razor. See also Maudlin's paper.  We talk about that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the discussion list (key word: Maudlin, graph, movie, crackpot).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know I reject the &quot;movie graph&quot; argument, but Occam's razor is 
<br />
certainly fine with me.  Just use it correctly ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The proof. (in 15 steps).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) By COMP and NEURO you survive with an artificial digital (turing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emulable, with TC) brain. OK?  (CU is used implicitely).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already not OK, since no meaning has been given to the term &quot;you 
<br />
survive&quot;.  In particular, it could instead be that you die but some other 
<br />
guy will live in that brain.  That's perfectly compatible with 
<br />
computationalism, if not with &quot;COMP&quot;.  It's really just a matter of 
<br />
definition though.  In any case, with a certain utility function you won't 
<br />
care what definition is used, as long as someone will be in the artificial 
<br />
brain.  Let's see where this goes ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) By COMP and NEURO you survive classical teleportation. This follows from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) where the building (reconstitution) of the brain is done a long way from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the 'reading device' and the annihilation of the original body. (CU is used 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implicitely).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one is equivalent to 1) I think, and suffers the same problem of 
<br />
definitions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;3) By COMP and NEURO (and implicitely CU, I will not mention it again) you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;survive teleportation with a delay. After the annihilation, your body and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brain description is keep intact during one year, and then you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reconstituted.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same issue again.  So far at least, other than raising that 
<br />
question of definition, there haven't been real problems with these 
<br />
assumptions.  Let's continue ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;An important point is that you (from your first person point of view) will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not see the difference with the simple teleportation case (case 2). But an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exterior observator (third person) will see the difference. Indeed for him 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the delayed teleportation last one year.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here there is a new problem in that the term &quot;1st person POV&quot; appears.  
<br />
To the extent that I can define such a view, it's basically what an 
<br />
observer-moment experiences.  Thus it can't extend across time, so there is 
<br />
no meaning to it seeing teleportation.  This problem may return, but again 
<br />
it's basically a problem of definition so far.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But caution is called for because the &quot;first person&quot; term is often used 
<br />
synonymously with the FIN.  Has the FIN already been assumed here?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;4) You are teleported from the center of the galaxy to its border.  At the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;opposite border a star explodes. This changes nothing: you still survive. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This follows easily from 3-locality.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one raises no new issues.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;5) You are teleported from the center of the galaxy to its border.  At the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;opposite border you are reconstituted. (For exemple the scanned information 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has been send in opposite direction from the center of the galaxy, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reconstituting machines has been put on the edge of the galaxy). You still 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;survive, by COMP and 3-locality.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I.e. you are copied twice, and one copy and the original are destroyed. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the remaining copy the original &quot;you&quot;?)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one just begs the question of defining &quot;your identity&quot; once again, 
<br />
though a bit more strongly and making it a little more obvious why the 
<br />
question is important.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;6) You are duplicable. (Direct consequence of 5). More precisely:
</em><br />
You are 3-duplicable.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure what this one means, but I guess it means that if you are 
<br />
copied, all copies are considered to be &quot;you&quot;.  That's one definition that 
<br />
could be used, so I have no problem with that, although I probably wouldn't 
<br />
use that defintion myself.  The problem here is that it's by no means clear 
<br />
that you realize it's just a matter of definition.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And the first person doesn't *feel the split*
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comment again raises the &quot;1st person&quot; definition problem.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;7) Although your surviving does not depend on the faraway events,
</em><br />
from the first person perspective the event &quot;I survive at the
<br />
left edge (let us say) of the galaxy&quot; could depend on the faraway
<br />
other reconstitution. The duplicability entails first person
<br />
indeterminisme, although everything is determinate for a third
<br />
person. (It is really the computationalist 3-determinateness
<br />
which entails the computationalist 1-indeterminateness).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge problem with this one!  I see no indeterminism entering 
<br />
anywhere.  If &quot;you&quot; is defined to include all copies, then by definition the 
<br />
collective &quot;you&quot; see all copies' situations.  If not, I can give no meaning 
<br />
to #6.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am copied, then with a reasonable utility function, I would care 
<br />
about the fate of all copies regardless of whether they are defined to be 
<br />
&quot;me&quot; or not.  I will also note at this point that making copies is a process 
<br />
that increases &quot;my&quot; (or &quot;similar to me&quot;) measure, just as destroying copies 
<br />
decreases it.  That's not to be forgotten as measure will become important a 
<br />
bit later.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(exercise: show that the duplicability entails the unprovability
</em><br />
of COMP. Hint: consider teleportation without annihilation of the
<br />
original, with a delay, applied to a non-computationalist)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't see what you're driving at here.  In any case, both &quot;COMP&quot; and 
<br />
computationalism itself are obviously not provable.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;8) You are 'read' and annihilated in Brussels and the information
</em><br />
is send to Washington and Moscow. You are reconstituted at Washington
<br />
and the information is keep intact at Moscow during one year. Then
<br />
you are reconstituted at Moscow. (Duplication with assymmetric
<br />
delay). The point is the following: whatever the way you choose for
<br />
quantifying the 1-indeterminisme in the symmetric duplication, you
<br />
must quantifify in the same manner the assymmetric duplication.
<br />
This follows from COMP and 3. The first person cannot be aware of
<br />
the delays.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one seems to raise no _new_ problems that I didn't mention already.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;9) There is also a form of 1-non-locality. Although your surviving
</em><br />
does not depend on faraway events, your expectation of personal
<br />
experience does depend on faraway events. Here also, it is the
<br />
strict 3-locality which entail the 1-non-locality.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you mean here the &quot;indeterminism&quot; I have already explained why that 
<br />
is a problem.  For practical purposes it may be convenient for me to reason 
<br />
as though (for example) QM implies randomness in what I can expect, but this 
<br />
is really not true.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's like, when I design a test to give to a class that I'm teaching, it 
<br />
may be convenient for me to treat the student's knowledge as a random 
<br />
variable, even if I know that some students know things that others don't.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;10) Here is an old argument you can find in all idealist school
</em><br />
of thought (Hindouist, Budhist, Platon, Descartes, Berkeley, etc.)
<br />
It is based on the notion of dream, but today it is more easy
<br />
(especially with COMP) to convey it with the notion of virtual reality. The 
<br />
point is: For any neigborhood and any time interval, you can build a 
<br />
computing machine simulating that &quot;space-time&quot; at such a level that a first 
<br />
person will not be able to see any difference.  (The computing machine 
<br />
preserves the relevant counterfactuals). Roughly speaking a first person 
<br />
cannot distinguish 'real neigborhood' with virtual (digitally simulated) 
<br />
neighborhood (for all level 'below' its own substitution level).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this one doesn't raise _new_ problems.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;11) To sum up: the way you quantify the indeterminisme is independent
</em><br />
of the time, the place and the nature (real/virtual) of the reconstitution.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no _new_ problems with that statement.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Note: the indeterminism is pure 1-indeterminism. Nevertheless, by
</em><br />
duplicating entire population, the indeterminism can be made
<br />
third person 'verifiable' inside each multiplied population. This
<br />
leads to what I call first person of the plural indeterminism.
<br />
(I would like to know a better english expression for that!).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The note I guess refers to a situation like QM where the probabilistic 
<br />
nature of it is (though false) known to the general population.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;12) A Universal Dovetailer exists. (Extraordinary consequence of
</em><br />
Church thesis and Arithmetical Realism). The UD simulates all
<br />
possible digital devices in a quasi-parallel manner).
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Adding a line in the code of any UD, and you get a quasi-
</em><br />
computation of its Chaitin \Omega number).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 12) is just a statement of math, I take it.  (As opposed to CUD 
<br />
above.)  Sure, some programs are UD's.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;13) So let us assume CU and CUD, that is let us assume explicitely
</em><br />
there is a concrete universe and a concrete running of a UD in it.
<br />
This need a sort of steady state universe or an infinitely expanding
<br />
universe to run the complete infinite UD.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK so far.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose you let a pen falls. You want predict what will happen.
</em><br />
Let us suppose your brain is in state S at the beginning of the
<br />
experiment. The concrete UD will go to that state infinitely often
<br />
and compute all sort of computational continuations. This is
<br />
equivalent to reconstitutions. It follows from 11 that your
<br />
expectation are undetermined, and the domain of the indeterminism
<br />
is given by the (infinite) set of reconstitutions. To predict,
<br />
with COMP, what will happen you must take into account all
<br />
possible histories going through the state S of your brain.
<br />
And here clearly the NEURO hypothesis is not used. Even if your
<br />
real brain state is the state of the actual concrete universe,
<br />
with COMP that state will be generated (infinitely often) by the
<br />
UD. Same reasoning if your brain state is the quantum state of
<br />
the universe, so the reasoning works even if the brain is a
<br />
non local quantum object (if that exists). So the physics is
<br />
determined by the collection of your computational continuations
<br />
relatively to your first person actual state.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it that this is the crucial step, the real heart of the UDA.  And 
<br />
here the problem, perhaps related to the problems of defintion that I've 
<br />
been pointing out, is that you ignore MEASURE.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, an infinite universe will contain some machines that simulate N 
<br />
steps in a UDA.  Consider an open universe like ours.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the measure of such machines is m(N), then in a universe like 
<br />
ours most likely m(N) will be proportional to V exp(-kN), where V is the 
<br />
volume of space being considered (assume V is very large), and k is some 
<br />
constant.  Even worse, the UD itself will revisit any given computation more 
<br />
and more slowly, so this decay of measure will have even worse effects on 
<br />
the measure of each computation within the UD itself.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's also true that the measure of &quot;normal&quot; people (those implemented 
<br />
outside UD's) will decay as V exp(- k' N), but surely the total measure of 
<br />
&quot;inside UD&quot; will be negligable compared to &quot;outside UD&quot; people.  (It's a lot 
<br />
easier to built and maintain regular brains than to build and maintain a 
<br />
UD).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, even with the FIN that the &quot;outsiders&quot; would dominate would also be 
<br />
true, so the UDA doesn't even hold up with the FIN.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;14) If 'that' physics is different from the traditional empirical physics, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then you refute COMP. But with COMP you will not refute COMP, isn't it? So 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with COMP you will derive the laws of physics, i.e. invariant and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;similarities in the 'average' continuations of yourself (defining the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure on the computationnal continuations).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one would have been OK if 1)-13) had been well-defined and true, I 
<br />
think.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even then one must remember the assumptions such as CUD that might 
<br />
be refuted by physics.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;15) Once you explain why arithmetical machines are statistically right
</em><br />
to believe in physical laws without any real universe, such a real
<br />
universe is redundant.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I agree with, and it's independent of the preceding stuff.  That's 
<br />
why I think &quot;white rabbit&quot; studies among the set of all possible 
<br />
computations could be useful.  But obviously, no one has come close to 
<br />
showing that the typical experience would be statistically &quot;right&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;By Arithmetical Realism and OCCAM razor, there is no need
</em><br />
to run the concrete UD, nor is there any need for a real concrete
<br />
Universe.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be true if &quot;statistically right&quot; had been shown.  Even if 
<br />
1-13) had been true, it would still leave the possibilty that CUD is false, 
<br />
that CU is true, and that the statistics would not be right.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Or you can use the movie graph argument to show that a first
</em><br />
person is not able to distinguish real/virtual/and *Arithmetical*
<br />
nature of his own implementations, and this eliminates OCCAM.)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't see why you'd bring in that.  As you know, I reject the &quot;movie 
<br />
graph&quot; argument, but I agree that mathematical implementations _might_ be 
<br />
giving rise to consciousness.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up: the UDA contains four basic errors:
<br />
1.  Key terms are not defined.
<br />
2.  &quot;Indeterminism&quot; is assumed, but there is none.
<br />
3.  The fact that the CUD's would have negligable measure is ignored.  This 
<br />
one invalidates the UDA even if FIN is assumed.
<br />
4.  The fact that CU might be true but CUD false is mentioned, but then 
<br />
ignored.
