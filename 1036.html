Christopher Maloney &lt;dude.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm sure that there are ... universes in which a detective named
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sherlock Holmes actually exists, fitting all the right descriptions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... but they are not accessible by us.
</em><br />
<br />The Connan-Doyle books are an access to such universes! Like a spycam
<br />
peeking into them.  Universes are, after all, abstractions, exactly as
<br />
are fictional scenarios. Simulations, whether in computers or authors'
<br />
and readers' imaginations, connect alternative worlds to us.
<br />
<br />I think, deep down, you harbor the conventional illusion that our
<br />
physical world is somehow more real than other possible worlds.  You
<br />
should try to liberate yourself from that notion.
<br />
<br />As an exercise to make Sherlock' reality more apparent, imagine the
<br />
following progression of alternate implementations:
<br />
<br />The adventures of Sherlock Holmes described in a book (as you read it,
<br />
a simulation of Sherlock's world is created in your head, but you
<br />
(mistakenly) discount that as not real)
<br />
<br />The same stories portrayed by Jeremy Brett and other actors.  There is
<br />
now a lot more specific detail, including visual.  Sherlock Holmes
<br />
really exists as an interpretation of the behavior of Jeremy Brett
<br />
(there is another interpretation in which Brett is an actor portraying
<br />
Holmes, but that is interesting mainly to acting students).
<br />
<br />The same stories embedded into interactive video game.  You can now
<br />
not only watch Sherlock, but interact and he will respond to you.
<br />
When game AI is sufficiently advanced, you can have long, insightful
<br />
conversations with him.
<br />
<br />The same AI programs that control the virtual characters installed in
<br />
full-size robot bodies.  Not only can you talk with him, you can run
<br />
with him across the moors, and when the story is over, take him out
<br />
and introduce him to your friends, as real a part of the particular
<br />
fantasy we call physical reality as you or I.
<br />
<br />(I thought the Star Trek TNG explorations of these kind of ideas
<br />
via holodeck virtual reality was pretty good, and much better than
<br />
some of the pedestrian sentiments I've seen on this list recently.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If our tools were sophisticated enough, we could figure out what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that creature was experiencing at that moment, independent of his or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her report.
</em><br />
<br />NO!  We may determine the full physical structure of an organism well
<br />
enough to simulate it faithfully as a purely physical object.
<br />
<br />However, any experiences we impute to it will remain a subjective
<br />
matter with different answers for different observers.  Some observers
<br />
will be content to say there are no experiences in any case, including
<br />
when they simulate you or me.
<br />
<br />Physical measurements don't objectively reveal experiences, because
<br />
experiences are not physical properties.  Pain, pleasure, belief and
<br />
the other psychological components of consciousness are abstractions
<br />
that can be mapped onto physical structures, but not in a unique way.
<br />
<br />Some mappings are useful for particular purposes.  Psychological
<br />
mappings surely evolved so we could coordinate better in social
<br />
groups.  It helps me (read &quot;me&quot;) act effectively to classify your
<br />
state as hungry or sad or in pain, or liking or disliking me.
<br />
<br />It also helps me plan my own activities to similarly classify my own
<br />
state, and a richer classification is possible because I have
<br />
privileged access to all sorts of internal variables like signals
<br />
from my peripheral and visceral nerves and brain systems, hormone
<br />
concentrations and so on.
<br />
<br />The resulting abstract psychological self-interpretation (our internal
<br />
sense of consciousness) is so tightly integrated to our physical
<br />
functioning that it may seem absolute and inevitable, but it's not.
<br />
<br />The standard self-interpretation is replaced by other interpretations,
<br />
for instance when we sleep, become unconscious, are hypnotized or
<br />
otherwise influenced by compelling suggestions or go into meditative
<br />
trances (even as we perform tasks excellently).  In many such cases
<br />
seemingly absolute sensations like intense pain simply vanish, no
<br />
longer part of our self-interpretation.
<br />
<br />Multiple-personality syndrome also seems to be an example of a body
<br />
and brain interpreting itself differently at different times.
<br />
<br /><br />Western philosophy of mind, influenced by soulist religious ideas, has
<br />
hyperinflated the significance of our own mutable self-interpretations
<br />
into absolute immutable bedrocks of existence.  But that idea just
<br />
doesn't work, it only befuddles its holders.
