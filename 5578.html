<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;And again I totally agree. It *is* what is proved in my thesis. I have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; done two things:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;1) I have given a proof that if we are machine then physics must be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; redefined as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;science which isolates and exploits a (first person plural) measure on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the set of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;computational histories. The proof is rigorous, I would say definitive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (unless some systematic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;error of course), although provably unformalizable (so that only 1 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person can grasp it).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;2) I provide a mathematical confirmation of comp by showing that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (thanks to Godel,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;Lob, Solovay ...) we can literally interview a universal machine, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acting like a scientist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;---by which I mean we will have only a third person discourse with her. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BUT we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;interview her about the possible 1-person discourse. That is a &quot;tour de 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; force&quot; in the sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;that the notion of first person is absolutely not formalizable (and so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;define it in any third person way). But by using in a special way ideas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;from Plato's Theaetetus + Aristotle-Kripke modal logic + Godel's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incompleteness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;discovery make the &quot;tour de force&quot; easily tractable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;Here I can only be technical or poetical, and because being technical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;yet premature I will sum up by saying that with comp, the plenitude is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;incredibly big &quot;set&quot; of universal machine's ignorance, and physics is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;sharable border of that ignorance, and it has been confirmed because that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;sharable border has been shown to obey to quantum laws.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;I get recently new result: one confirm that with comp the first person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can hardly know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;or even just believe in comp; the other (related to an error in my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thesis I talked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;about in some previous post) is the apparition of a &quot;new&quot; quantum logic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;not command it!) and even (I must verify) an infinity of quantum logics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;the singular first person and the totally sharable classical discourses.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;This could go along with your old theory that there could be a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuum of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;person-point-of-view between the 1 and 3 person, and that would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confirms that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;are rather gifted as an &quot;introspecter&quot; (do you remember? I thought you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were silly).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;But then it looks you don't like any more the 3-person discourse, why?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The adoption of the first person as a &quot;frame of reference&quot; (my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;terminology) implies the ultimate relativization. In other words, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logical system governing the mental processes of the observer becomes part 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the &quot;frame of reference&gt; However, we all know that human beings do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think according to formal systems. Human systems are full of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inconsistencies, errors, etc... and very often their beliefs about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world is just wrong. Very often they even make arithmetic errors such as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;8x7 = 65.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So if we assume a relative formulation, here is the dilemma:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) if we adopt a formal system such as the one(s) your have talked about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we assign an absolute quality to the observer which violates our premise 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of relative formulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) If we adopt a non-formal human logical system,&quot; we are left with an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;extremely complicated task of reconciling the observations obtained by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;several observers who in my terminology &quot;share the same frame of reference&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One of the question that arise is how fundamental should be the concept of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;frame of reference&quot; or of the mechanism/logic that underlies our thinking:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) Is it governed at the atomic level by physical laws down to resolution 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of Planck's constant? The notion of observer is defined here with a Planck 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;resolution.  If we share the same physical laws then we can say that we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;share the same frame of reference. This option avoids the inconsistencies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the &quot;human logical systems&quot; but throws out of the window the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relativistic formulation. In addition this approach provides a neat 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;justification for the equivalence of the sets describing the physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world and the mental world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) Is it governed at the neurological or even at the psychological level? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The notion of observer here has a very coarse resolution compared to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first option. This approach keeps the relative formulation but becomes a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quagmire because of its lack of formalism. How can the notion of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;objective reality&quot; be defined? In fact, is there such a thing as a true 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;psychological objective reality?  However, the fact that a &quot;psychological 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objective reality&quot; is an oxymoron (contradiction in terms) does not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;invalidate the definition of the observer at the psychological level. Au 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contraire.
</em><br />
<br /><br />-----------------
<br />
<br /><br />Remember that my starting point is the computationalist hypothesis in the 
<br />
theoretical cognitive science. I take as objective truth arithmetical 
<br />
truth, and as third person objective communicable truth the provable 
<br />
arithmetical propositions like &quot;1+1=2&quot;, &quot;Prime(17)&quot;, or &quot;the machine number 
<br />
i (in some enumeration) does not stop on input number j&quot;, this + Church 
<br />
Thesis + the &quot;yes doctor&quot; act of faith is what I mean by comp.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From this it will follow many things which can perhaps put some light on 
<br />
your questions and dilemmas, although, as you, see my point of departure is 
<br />
not a &quot;relative formulation&quot;. What will happen is that physics will 
<br />
reemerge from what is invariant from all &quot;relative point of view&quot;, which 
<br />
are  themselves defined by the formal machines we are at some, necessarily 
<br />
unknowable, level.  Indeed, in a second step, I interview the *sound*  (by 
<br />
choice) universal machines on those invariant &quot;through all 
<br />
relativities&quot;.  The reasoning I invite people into occurs itselfs at a 
<br />
third person level, as do the interview of the machine.
<br />
<br />But then, talking with the machine I need to (re)define some notion.
<br />
<br />I (re)define science as the third person provability: thanks to Solovay 
<br />
this is formalizable by a modal logic G   (+ that incredible G* which 
<br />
extends it at the &quot;truth&quot; level))
<br />
Let us write it simply by []p. It means p is provable by me (me=the 
<br />
(hopefully) sound machine).
<br />
<br />I define, following Theaetetus, the knowledge of p by the conjunction of 
<br />
[]p and p. That is &quot;I know p&quot; = []p   &amp;   p&quot;. Now the machine is sound, in 
<br />
particular the &quot;truth theory&quot; G* (the one I called the guardian angel 
<br />
sometimes) prove that
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[]p   is equivalent to    []p &amp; p
<br />
<br />So, from the *true* point of view: scientific provability and knowledge are 
<br />
equivalent. But, keep attention because here is the goedelian crux:
<br />
<br />The sound machine itself does not, and cannot,  prove or know 
<br />
that   (  []p   is equivalent to    []p  &amp;  p  ). That is, the knower (or 
<br />
first person) defined by []p &amp; p
<br />
cannot know its &quot;objective frame&quot; from which []p has been defined. The 
<br />
first person cannot know, neither proves, that she is any machine, although 
<br />
with comp
<br />
the machine can still infer the existence, or even bet on some 
<br />
presentation, of a machine through which he/she could hopefully survive.
<br />
<br />This is important because although the knower and the &quot;scientist machine&quot; 
<br />
will know/prove the same arithmetical propositions, the logic of those
<br />
knowable, respectively provable, propositions differs considerably. &quot;[]p&quot; 
<br />
obeys to G (and G*),  &quot;[]p &amp; p&quot; obeys to the time/consciousness logic S4Grz.
<br />
G describes a sort of buddhist heraclitean (irreflexive) path where you can 
<br />
die, dream, get things wrong (like 8x7 = 65) at each instant, but S4Grz
<br />
describes ever evolving certainty-knowledge states.
<br />
<br />(Do you see why the sound machine cannot prove that  (  []p   is equivalent 
<br />
to    []p &amp; p ) ? Because if the machine proves that, then the machine
<br />
will prove that []p -&gt; p, in particular the machine will prove []false -&gt; 
<br />
false, that is the machine will prove NOT [] false, so the machine will 
<br />
prove her
<br />
own consistency, which no sound machine can do by Godel's second 
<br />
incompleteness theorem.)
<br />
<br />You see, I take the self-reference logic as a sort of &quot;exact third person 
<br />
psychology/theology&quot;. It cannot be normative because we cannot know
<br />
ourselves as consistent machine, and thanks to the difference of behavior 
<br />
between []p and []p &amp; p, there is room for subtle inside views of arithmetic.
<br />
<br />For the laws of physics it is the G*-equivalence between []p with the big 
<br />
nuance []p &amp; &lt;&gt;p which plays the main role; and which will correspond
<br />
to the observable invariant relative to the consistent state of the 
<br />
machine. (Although since recently S4Grz does say interesting things too, I 
<br />
realize)
<br />
<br />I mean, all the relative aspects of reality are captured by point of views 
<br />
(modalities) from inside arithmetical truth, which I take as absolute.
<br />
It is counterintuitive because the inside views will appear bigger than the 
<br />
outside view (like in Alice in Wonderland, Yellow Submarine, etc.),
<br />
but logicians are used to such relativity of views. They traditionally 
<br />
handle them with &quot;model theory&quot;, or, in some case like our's &quot;modal logic&quot;.
<br />
<br />So to answer precisely your first dilemma between (I quote you):
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt; 1) if we adopt a formal system such as the one(s) your have talked about 
<br />
we assign an absolute quality to the observer which violates our premise of 
<br />
relative formulation.
<br />
2) If we adopt a non-formal human logical system,&quot; we are left with an 
<br />
extremely complicated task of reconciling the observations obtained by 
<br />
several observers who in my terminology &quot;share the same frame of reference&quot; &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />My answer is that we can take both. The formal []p and the unformal []p &amp; 
<br />
p.   They are the same, the guardian angel says.  But the machine cannot 
<br />
know that, there is a necessary ignorance which must be taken account. It 
<br />
is good because the UDA did show that physics emerges from such an ignorance.
<br />
*We* can do that, because through comp we reason at the upper purely 
<br />
arithmetical and third person communicable level.
<br />
<br />Mmmh ... I certainly should explain better why []p is formal, and []p &amp; p 
<br />
is unformal. The fact is that []p interprets the arithmetical beweisbar 
<br />
Godel's provability, so you can translate []p in arithmetic, but to 
<br />
translate []p &amp; p you would need an arithmetical truth predicate which does 
<br />
not exist by Tarski (see the thesis for a rigorous argument). At the higher 
<br />
level of description of course []p &amp; p is formal. Yes, G and G* are so 
<br />
powerful as being able to &quot;metaformalize&quot; unformality!
<br />
<br />Concerning your other dilemma:
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt; 1) Is it governed at the atomic level by physical laws down to 
<br />
resolution of Planck's constant?
<br />
2) Is it governed at the neurological or even at the psychological level?&quot; &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />We will never know that. Some will bet on low level (meaning saying NO to 
<br />
the doctor for a very long time), other will bet on high level (saying 
<br />
quickly YES to their doctor). In all case it will be at their risk and 
<br />
peril, forever undecided.   The reasoning I propose, and its translation in 
<br />
arithmetic, does not depend on the choice of the level, only on its existence.
<br />
Now, obviously, observation and introspection will give strong *evidence* 
<br />
for some levels, but on that matter cautiousness will *always* be needed.
<br />
<br />Note I was assuming comp throughout.
<br />
<br />I hope I have not been too technical, and that this helps a bit, and also 
<br />
that you are not too much disappointed that my approach relies so heavily 
<br />
and quasi-exclusively on the insane belief in the third person 
<br />
communicability of elementary arithmetic, but I know you knew that :)
