<em class="quotelev1">&gt; QTI it experiences being decapitated but then survives indefinitely -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somehow . . . well, I'd like to hear what QTI supporters think happens
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next (from the pov of the victim).  Are they magically translated into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a non-decapitated version of themselves, and if so, how? Surely it can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be in the same quantum state that they're in? If not, do they experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indefinitely continued survival as a severed head, or . . . what??? Just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; curious!
</em><br />
<br />The answer is very simple.  The future that is experienced is the least
<br />
unlikely that allows for continuation of consciousness.  (More precisely,
<br />
the probability distribution over those futures where you are still
<br />
alive determines the relative probability of experience given that you
<br />
find yourself alive, a tautology.)
<br />
<br />So, your head has been cut off and clunk, you fall on the ground,
<br />
getting a nasty knock on the head, not to mention the neck soreness and
<br />
missing body.  How could you survive?  There are several alternatives.
<br />
<br />It is possible that entropy ceases to operate in your brain, and that
<br />
you continue to think despite the loss of blood flow.  This however would
<br />
be an astronomically unlikely future.
<br />
<br />More likely, aliens or supernatural intelligences of some sort would
<br />
intervene to keep you alive.  Alternatively, it would turn out that
<br />
you were playing a futuristic video game where you had temporarily
<br />
blanked out your memory to make it more realistic.  Then next thing
<br />
you see is &quot;Game Over&quot;.
<br />
<br />These possibilities makes most sense if you consider the set of all
<br />
physical systems where you have the same mental state, rather than
<br />
just the systems which are part of your corner of the QM multiverse.
<br />
There are universes where aliens are monitoring the earth, unknown to
<br />
its inhabitants, and the mental states of residents of earth in such
<br />
universes will be identical to the states of people in some other
<br />
universes without aliens.
<br />
<br />When you find yourself with head chopped off, you don't know which
<br />
class of universe you are in.  I would argue that there is no &quot;fact
<br />
of the matter&quot; about it (this is our old argument about whether
<br />
your consciousness is tied to a specific instance of the many which
<br />
instantiate it).  Hence you will experience the most likely continuation
<br />
which is consistent with your mental experiences in any branch of the
<br />
QM universe which could produce that experience.
<br />
<br />I think we all agree with the objective facts of the situation here.
<br />
For any observer moment there exist other observer moments which are
<br />
subjectively in its future (equivalently, for which it is subjectively
<br />
in the past).  The question is whether to interpret this fact as meaning
<br />
continued survival.  Ultimately that is a matter of definitions.
