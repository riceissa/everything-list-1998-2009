Jaques Mallah's role is important in that he forces us to confront important 
<br />
issues. However, he could more effectively communicate by &quot;polishing&quot; his 
<br />
style. Enough said of that.  Wei Dai has summarized the issue very well. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I think the main point of disagreement between the two camps now is
<br />
&nbsp;relative SSSA versus absolute SSSA (Marchal's terms). Can we all agree
<br />
&nbsp;that given the absolute SSSA, there is no justification for QS? &gt;&gt;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
My understanding of the &quot;Strong&quot; Self Sampling Assumption is shaky, but I 
<br />
think I agree with the above statement. I would find it clearer if it could 
<br />
be rephrased as follows: If the number of branching in the MW is absolute 
<br />
then there is no justification for QS.
<br />
<br />This is the crux of the matter.
<br />
<br />Jaques Mallah's position is summarized in his words:
<br />
&lt;&lt; Your total measure would be reduced, so there would be less
<br />
observers with that name in the ensemble, and the total number of
<br />
observers would be less. &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Clearly Jacques views the number of branches in the MW as absolute  and 
<br />
limited. If you do QS and trim a few branches you just end up with less 
<br />
branches. The more stringent the QS conditions (winning a $1million or a 
<br />
$1billion or having Elvis Presley come back to life) the smaller the number 
<br />
of branches you end up in. And if you make the conditions too stringent you 
<br />
may end up with nothing. No more of you.
<br />
<br />If however, the number of branches does not change no matter where you are in 
<br />
the MW -- according to a kind of a super Cosmological Principle -- then no 
<br />
matter how many times you commit QS, you still have the same number of 
<br />
branches left. This, I think, is the &quot;relative&quot; SSSA that Wei Dai and Marchal 
<br />
are talking about. Adding branches or subtracting branches has no impact on 
<br />
the probability of your future existence. And it is precisely in the 
<br />
discussion of probability in this environment that some of the hottest 
<br />
discussions with Jacques have taken place.
<br />
<br />So which is it? absolute and limited number of branches or relative and 
<br />
unlimited?
<br />
<br />I think that the discussion hinges around the size of the MW. If the size is 
<br />
finite, then there is no question, in my mind that Jacques is right. The 
<br />
number of branches is finite and QS just trims the MW tree (or network). If 
<br />
however, the MW is infinite, then the answer is more difficult.
<br />
<br />Imagine the MW to be infinite aleph1 just like the number of points on a 
<br />
line. In this environment the super Cosmological Principle I mentioned above 
<br />
applies: no matter how many times you cut that line, the number of points on 
<br />
any segment is still aleph1. This number is like the speed of light: a 
<br />
physical constant of that world: aleph1, independent of the observer's 
<br />
position -- or line segment.
<br />
<br />So one condition for justifying QS is having an infinite MW. -- I am not sure 
<br />
what is the lowest of Cantor's infinities would correspond to a sufficient 
<br />
condition.
<br />
<br />A second condition is that the number of branches &quot;cut&quot; by QS should be 
<br />
infinitely smaller than the infinity of the MW. (ie Aleph QS &lt; Aleph MW) 
<br />
<br />I would like to add that on purely philosopical grounds I can only conceive 
<br />
of an absolute infinitely large MW, larger than all of Cantor's infinities -- 
<br />
because any other size would have to be arbitrary and therefore have a reason 
<br />
to be so. And this limited MW would end up being just one instance of many 
<br />
other MW in a larger MMW.
<br />
<br />So which is it? Is the MW finite or infinite? Is QS justified?
<br />
<br />This said, I think that NOTHING justifies QS. My position however is ethical. 
<br />
As the idea of the MW matured in my mind, I have become convinced that while 
<br />
the MW is absolutely infinite, it is possible to avoid the nihilist 
<br />
philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche and evolve an ethic of the many worlds. In 
<br />
fact the JUSTIFICATION FOR QS COULD BE TURNED ON ITS HEAD as I have pointed 
<br />
out in my last post. Beautifully said in the 23rd psalm: &quot;The Lord is my 
<br />
shepherd, I shall not want...the shadow of the valley of death (the MW)... I 
<br />
shall fear no evil... .my cup runneth over&quot; The knowledge that we are 
<br />
immortal and that all stings and arrows are temporary can give us a new 
<br />
perspective on the world.
