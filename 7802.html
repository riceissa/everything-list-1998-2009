<br /><br />I will. Thanks to your post I realize that a possible quite huge 
<br />
misunderstanding here could vacuously grow between us. Perhaps you 
<br />
didn't realize the impact of Godel's theorem in computer science, and 
<br />
then, with the assumption of comp, the impact on science in general.
<br />
I probably underestimate some difficulties. I reassure you at once on 
<br />
Plato. By Plato I mean Plato with all the necessary revision and 
<br />
updating made necessary by the discovery of the incompleteness 
<br />
phenomenon. In particular its &quot;politics&quot; does not survive and I agree 
<br />
with Popper on its critics of *that* aspect of Plato.
<br />
<br />(I will answer Colin, Chris and Hal Finney later, but my answer to 
<br />
Colin will somehow try to clarify points in those discussions too, 
<br />
actually the reciprocal is also true).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Theology concerns itself with the &quot;mechanism&quot; of belief.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; What is the mechanism of belief?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; It acts like a filter, or a pair of tinted glasses if you will.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Belief is that way of looking at reality that reinforces that way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; looking at reality. Is that scientific?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No. But then your definition of theology is perhaps a little bit to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; much a contingent matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Perhaps the word &quot;theology&quot; has too many connotations. I explain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; below why I do think that, despite its heavy historical background, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it could still be the less misleading word.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I prefer &quot;metaphysical&quot; myself. After all, it claims to be the system 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that is looking at the system. That is perhaps best described as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;metaphysics&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />I don't like too much that word because, in my neighborhood it has 
<br />
become almost a synonym of crackpot. It interfere also with 
<br />
metamathematics, which is the mathematical study of what machine (or 
<br />
more general theories) can prove and guess about themselves.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Any assessment of supposed objective rigour in ANY form of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; theological thinking - be it &quot;total unrigorous manipulative pseudo-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; theology&quot; or even the usual kind of theology taught to the average
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; working cleric has to be seen in the light of this comment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The FOR book, Everett formulation of QM, and my own work rely on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computationalist hypothesis. Is this not a &quot;theological&quot; assumption?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Only if it can never be proven.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is incredible that you say that. My point is, among others, that IF 
<br />
comp is true, then it will never be proven. It is the beauty of it; the 
<br />
theory justifies why you should not take the theory for granted. 
<br />
Practically it means that if your doctor guaranties you under the name 
<br />
of science that you will survive with some artificial digital brain, 
<br />
you better run. He is provably an ignorant, or a lier, or &quot;joking 
<br />
person&quot;, or mad, or a zombie, etc: he communicates the false. Bf.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The trick is to NEVER believe that it can never be proven!
</em><br />
<br />My problem, Kim, is that I have a &quot;theology&quot;. With comp, it is computer 
<br />
science. But, after Godel computer science splitted somehow into two 
<br />
parts revealing an inescapable gap between truth and provability. The 
<br />
most &quot;theological part&quot; of it is the difference between computer 
<br />
science and computer's computer science, that is between what is true 
<br />
about the destiny of machines from their many possible points of view, 
<br />
and what machines can prove, in all generality, from, in and out of 
<br />
those points of view. Mathematically the propositional part of that 
<br />
&quot;theology&quot; is given by the difference between two modal logics G* and 
<br />
G.
<br />
By (machine) theology I mean G* - G. My result (see my url) is that 
<br />
physics is derivable from it, constructively, if comp is true.
<br />
I have reason to identify (at first) the scientific belied with proof. 
<br />
You tell me ~B~B(comp), making you false by G*.
<br />
Read Smullyan's &quot;Forever undecided&quot; which gives a good introduction to 
<br />
G.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If COMP one day turns out to be true
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />You mean will be proved ? What do you mean?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; then it's not theological anymore, it's logical.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Mmmh... Since the fall of logicism even &quot;numbers&quot; are not &quot;logical&quot;. 
<br />
But comp is at the intersection of computer science, theoretical 
<br />
physics and cognitive science. It is at at best applied mathematics. We 
<br />
can only bet on our better theory. (my work shows that comp is 
<br />
testable, that is we could learn it is false, but if comp is true we 
<br />
will need forever some act of faith to say yes to the doctor. Thought 
<br />
experiments can illustrate that even if you survive with an artificial 
<br />
brain, that personal fact of you does not make it possible to be use 
<br />
for a third person (scientific) communication of that facts.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm assuming an equivalence of meaning here in the use of the terms 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;theological&quot; and &quot;metaphysical&quot; in dealing with assumptions.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />No problem at all. I told that I have use biology, psychology etc. I am 
<br />
searching a term, that's all.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, if quantum computers turn out to work in the specified 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manner, then MWI is proven
</em><br />
<br /><br />No. Is comfirmed. Not proven. We don't have prove that there is even 
<br />
one accessible world, or observer-moment (as we are used to call them 
<br />
here).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and there never was anything metaphysical going on. Whether or not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is seen as reliable proof of COMP remains to be seen
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I insist. IF true, COMP will never be proved. And then, as you confirm, 
<br />
it is a reason to take it as a theological assumption.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The danger, that Alan guards against, lies in STARTING from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphysical/theological viewpoint. But this of course makes it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extremely hard to deal with all these assumptions out in the open (as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you say).
</em><br />
<br /><br />But any ontological commitment is a form of metaphysical/theological 
<br />
starting point. To ignore this is hidden the doubt we can always have 
<br />
form some theories.
<br />
Moreover, the difference between David Deutsch and me, is that David 
<br />
makes two ontological commitments: numbers and  physical universe(s). 
<br />
Me: numbers.
<br />
I feel less &quot;superstitious&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I certainly do not hold that scientists are somehow free of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ravages of belief.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Of course. All theories are hopefully consistent set of beliefs.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In science, one's beliefs are always smuggled in through the back door 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -
</em><br />
<br />But we start from it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; hence Einstein's famous  &quot;God does not play dice with the universe&quot;. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He meant it quite as much as a statement of religious faith as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refutation of QM (and I do not believe Einstein would have considered 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; himself offtopic either)
</em><br />
<br /><br />(we can go back on this. Einstein is still quite mysterious for me on 
<br />
the &quot;theological&quot; point.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Is this not a belief in a form of survival after a form of possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; death? A belief that I can survive with an artificial body can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; seen as an argument for the ability of the &quot;soul&quot; to be independent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of its body. No?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes of course, but again if it turns out to be physically real or at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least possible (testable), why do we need the metaphysics?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Because it gives the overall pictures making you capable to cope with 
<br />
the long term, personally and collectively. With comp, &quot;consciousness&quot; 
<br />
is itself a result of an unconscious *bet* on the existence of some 
<br />
accessible world. As Stathis has explained, once you belief in comp, 
<br />
you can retrospectively bet that &quot;amoebas&quot; did bet on it a long time 
<br />
ago (they do self-duplicate).
<br />
But the fact is that if we assume comp we need, for mathematical 
<br />
reason, to make the difference between what is true on us, and still 
<br />
undecidable. We can bet on it at our risk and peril. It reminds it is a 
<br />
personal affair.
<br />
(With comp) we are necessarily humble and modest in front of very 
<br />
tricky questions.
<br />
Science is above all modesty. With comp theology inherits that modesty.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What if the &quot;soul&quot; turns out to be the summation of the &quot;amplitude of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your minds&quot; to use Herwig's words, spread across the multiverse? I can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cope with that notion under the banner of the real, the possible. No 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; star in the east, no burning bushes - just a mind-blowing real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility
</em><br />
<br /><br />And probably a necessity with comp, except that the observable 
<br />
multiverse will appear as the board of the &quot;mindscape&quot;. Of course if 
<br />
you don't know my work I could seem a little quick here. 10000 
<br />
apologies.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Those cases also illustrate the possibility of some theological 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assumptions about which we can reason. As Deutsch and Tipler do, it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; seems to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The exciting part surely in what they do is to bypass the theology 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; altogether.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I don't buy this. Any talk on &quot;immortality&quot; is theological, unless you 
<br />
take an explicit non computationalist theory of mind, like the one of 
<br />
Penrose.  I mean, Deutsch and Everett bet on comp, and with comp, even 
<br />
the belief in one world is a bet. We must be far modest than most 
<br />
materialist and dualist are usually.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's simply an unnecessary explanatory step. Truth really is stranger 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than fiction. Theology would try to reference everything to the Bible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - see next
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Bibles are important for historical and affective reasons. No serious, 
<br />
or just consistent, theologian will take Biblic texts has definitive 
<br />
theories on the matter. True, in our story, the bible and its messages 
<br />
has been deformed or has been given inconsistent literal 
<br />
interpretations and that has been bloody as those sorts of confusion 
<br />
usually are.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Theology wants to limit the field of ideas because theology is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; traditional gate-keeper of the intellect of organised religion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is not because 99% of the theologians, and this 99% of the time, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are under the control of political organization (like science 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sometimes, somewhere: ex: genetic in Soviet Union), that we should 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dismiss the original questioning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I feel it is the other way around. Politics is belief or spirituality 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in action.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hopefully nowadays with regulative self-correcting procedure. Like 
<br />
elections.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What we believe authors what we do, sets up what we call &quot;moral&quot;.  The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supposed split between the Church and the State is as much nonsense 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; today as it was in the Middle Ages.
</em><br />
<br />What are you saying? That democracies does not always work? True, it is 
<br />
something of the type &quot;alive&quot;. Democracies can die. They could defend 
<br />
themselves too. Better to avoid to mix science and/or theologies with 
<br />
politics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Law is ultimately rooted in adherence to a moral framework, so belief 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in values, morals etc precedes politics, indeed gives rise to it
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; anyone heard of an organised religion that is gagging for new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; thinking, new ideas???
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Come on. The jewish commentaries, the scolastic christians, The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Muslim neoplatonist,  the Hinduism school, the taoist schools, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; buddhist schools: all have been open some long time to critical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; argumentations and improvements. Hinduism and Buddhism have even had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; quite sophisticate internal school of logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most look to their past for a continuing mandate and thus fall back on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their laurels.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not at all. You see them like that. Perhaps it is the way those things 
<br />
are taught.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is not enough futuristic stuff in theology.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I cannot imagine something more futuristic. Forget the bible and the 
<br />
boring sermons.
<br />
Work on the mind-body problem by yourself. &quot;official theology&quot; has stop 
<br />
to think since its last very deep discussion in the middle age. Science 
<br />
has not yet solve the mind body problem. We are ignorant. But with the 
<br />
comp hyp, suddenly we can at least see how much the matter is non 
<br />
trivial. The future is 99% theological, actually theotechnological.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's usually about why things have to be NOW the way they are because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of something that happened way back THEN.  COMP is exciting because it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; offers the possibility of &quot;future&quot; conditioning of &quot;past&quot; events. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Religious thinking is not really up to this
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. But comp is meta-theological if you want. It is consistent with 
<br />
many non literal reading on most sacred text, which most of the time 
<br />
are written by people who have some serious concern with our possible 
<br />
destinies.  Literal and fanatical reading are prohibited by the most 
<br />
elementary logic and recognizance (bet!) of the other and their 
<br />
abilities to reason.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Look at the neo-platonist tradition: quite a long and sincere 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; argumentation. It still exists today everywhere on the planet, even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; if it is hidden by the media politically correct cacophonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet, Plato was a truly fascist thinker. He admired Sparta, a fascist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state - and built this power-structure thing into his vision of what a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Republic was. Let's not forget that. He believed in slavery.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is the mark of great genius. They told us from time to time 
<br />
enormous stupidities!
<br />
As I said I am with you.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This surely is of interest in looking at the theological aspects of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the neo-platonist tradition?
</em><br />
<br /><br />No. they continues the open minded questioning and reasoning. Of course 
<br />
&quot;disciples&quot; add mistakes ... until some proposes new theories. Slavery 
<br />
has a very long and complex history until recently. But please don't 
<br />
take any thinker so closely. Revised some of the old thought 
<br />
automatically and concentrates on what they have really discovered.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; He claimed a form of reality for ideas that is based on &quot;mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality&quot; - essentially a yes-no, right-wrong information system - at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least in its everyday implementation. This was extrapolated as the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; search for &quot;truth&quot;. According to Socrates (or Plato more likely as all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we know of Socrates words comes via Plato's ) - all you had to do was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get rid of all error and then you are left with the truth.
</em><br />
<br />Very schematically that's the way.
<br />
After Godel we know the solidity of the roots of the doubts, and we 
<br />
know the path can be tortuous and can lead to some catastrop.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this is nonsense.
</em><br />
<br />Literally yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Life is not a mathematical problem.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That you can solve. But it could be a mathematical adventure, literally.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Usually the cause of all &quot;error&quot; is human nature. This is a very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficult cause to remove.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is the impact of Godel's theorem. The casue of all &quot;error&quot; is 
<br />
already &quot;machine nature&quot;.
<br />
It is just impossible to remove the cause. Actually comp makes the 
<br />
prediction that most of the problem is enhanced by attempts to remove 
<br />
it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Theology has an unspoken brief to limit the field of ideas to what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the powerbrokers in organised religions long ago decided was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; permissable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But organised religion, like organised academy, should be separate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from the original intent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The same is true for philosophy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's hard not to extrapolate to the world around here. Many religious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scholars are standing up for their beliefs right now in a very public 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way. Islamic scholars have the direct ear of government. In this way, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief systems can quickly author actions if required.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />But it has nothing to do with Islam per se. Christians, Atheist and 
<br />
many others have shown various form of deadly fanaticism. In moral or 
<br />
affective wounded states any fundamental non rigorous theory can be sum 
<br />
up by &quot;it is the fault of the other&quot;. It is not theology, it is when 
<br />
&quot;serious&quot; theology failed. A rampant danger of our societies who forget 
<br />
to invest in our atemporal questioning and contemplation.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Science (and hopefully philosophy if it can keep up) will usually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; seek to enlarge and populate the field of ideas with anything and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; everything necessary to understand reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But by preventing seriousness in theology and its related questions, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you make yourself an objective ally of those who want &quot;theology&quot; to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be kept in the hand of social manipulators.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If by &quot;seriousness in theology&quot; you allow that everything in a belief 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system may be subject to a complete makeover or update to a more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contemporary way of expressing and dealing with issues then I am not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against it at all.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Nice! So we do agree on the fundamental. My &quot;theology&quot; is as vulnerable 
<br />
as it can be. I say precisely how to derive the precise physics from 
<br />
the comp hyp. If it gives statements contrary to empirically known fact 
<br />
or theories, it will be refuted.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything has to change in the universe, so why does belief remain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stuck in Sunday school?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Forget Sunday school if your teacher was not quite up with the task of 
<br />
open your mind to unsolved fundamental questions. That happens in 
<br />
mathematics too.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Going back to the Bible to justify everything is how the social 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manipulators work because God spoke to man in a way that requires 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation and that can be exploited
</em><br />
<br /><br />The Muslim and Jews and Christian should come back to their serious 
<br />
discussion from the middle age. Theology is motivated in great part by 
<br />
the fear of death, and most people just does not want to have doubt. 
<br />
But science is mainly systematics doubting and it is just a question of 
<br />
time we will again be more serious; In the meantime let us protect us 
<br />
from any authoritative arguments. Terrorism, small and large, is of 
<br />
that type.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And the worst is that this attitude encourages a wrong understanding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of science, like if science was answering (or even tackling) those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; questions, which for methodological reasons only, it does not. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; makes science a peculiar theology : one which pretend to reach the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; truth. Is that not a form of arrogance?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Like I said - scientists have their beliefs; they just don't talk 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about them.
</em><br />
<br />I disagree. They does not make them explicit, but science gives 
<br />
collection of consistent (hopefully) set of beliefs.  &quot;H phi = E phi&quot; 
<br />
is a belief.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most don't talk about them even to themselves and that's the biggest 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worry.
</em><br />
<br />In that case they &quot;religious&quot; in the pejorative sense. They are 
<br />
irrational.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's impossible not to act out of belief because we know when we are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doing something we do not believe in. You cannot lie to yourself.
</em><br />
<br />Sorry but with comp you can. It makes suffering soon or later.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do not think science pretends to be reaching the truth because if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that happens we all have to shut up and go to bed because there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing left to talk about.
</em><br />
<br /><br />With comp you can be assure the adventure is without ends. Careful, you 
<br />
cannot be assure of comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Is not naturalism a religion? Is not the &quot;primitive universe&quot; or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;Nature&quot; just a &quot;Modern God&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. But doesn't Occam's razor eliminate some things here? Or, doesn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Occam show up when God is around?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Sound machine cannot even give a name to truth.
<br />
I was just saying that with Occam, comp does not need to add the 
<br />
hypothesis of the existence of a physical universe. Like I said above I 
<br />
do an ontological commitment less than David.
<br />
Matter is ether, phlogistic. Unrelated with our physical beliefs. That 
<br />
is not obvious. You can try to understand the argument with links in my 
<br />
url, or by reading this list where we discuss it and similar 
<br />
approaches.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; After all, as I just recall in my preceding post, nobody has given a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; proof of the existence of Nature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the Gaia hypothesis of Lovelock came closest.
</em><br />
<br />We are not talking at the same level, or you are joking a little bit.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Earth may yet convince us that she exists through repeated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attempts to destroy the human plague with natural catastrophe and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; severe weather. We take a lot of convincing, don't we?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The earth is perhaps &quot;sick&quot; and we should act, but that does not prove 
<br />
anything existencial. No more that knocking a table. Nothing. It 
<br />
confirms some hardness to live together, but we are not talking 
<br />
ecology.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Even Aristotle, as I begin to suspect, has been much more cautious on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the existence of Nature than most of its followers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I have no problem with scientists and theologians. I have problem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with any dogma, both when used in science or in theology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But today, dogmatic theologians are less annoying than dogmatic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scientists,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Except where they provide intellectual justification for people to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strap bombs on themselves etc.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Pseudo-intellectual of that sorts will always benefit from the 
<br />
incapacity of human to courageously confront themselves with a 
<br />
scientific (doubting, methodologically agnostic) attitude on the 
<br />
unsolved questions.
<br />
Such unwillingness to put their theories in doubt (given that they do 
<br />
not solve nor really address the fundamental issues) makes larger the 
<br />
abyss between human and exact sciences; and this results in making the 
<br />
exact sciences less exacts and the human sciences less human, if not 
<br />
bloody.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because the dogmatic scientists pretend having no dogma, making 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dialog on fundamental open questions even more difficult I'm afraid.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then it is a very silly situation then. We should dismiss all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientists' claims until we can be certain of their dogma. You can see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why they try to avoid it
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />We must dismiss all statements of certainty, and all dogma, and 
<br />
concentrates on the consequences of our assumptions, and taking our 
<br />
theories seriously, in any field.
<br />
<br />Assuming comp, theology is just the attempt to figure out what is 
<br />
*true* for machines, and we have a wonderful tools to dig toward a 
<br />
better and better picture: theoretical computer science.
<br />
comp forces us to be modest, if only because it justify how much our 
<br />
ignorance grows with the development of our knowledge.
