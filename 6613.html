</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Non-separateness and identity are not the same thing! Your argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against dualism assumes that the duals are somehow separable and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-mutually dependent and thus lacking a linking mechanism dualism fails as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a viable theory. On the other hand, once we see the flaw in the assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we are making, that Body and Mind - Physical existence and Mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence (or Information!) are separable in the sense that one can have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning and &quot;reason to be&quot; without the other, we can again consider how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dualism can be viable as people such as Vaughan Pratt have done.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The hard part is in overcoming the prejudice that has built up since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Descartes' flawed theory was proposed. His failure was in assuming that Body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Mind are &quot;substances&quot; that have independent yet equal existence. The use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the assumption of &quot;substance&quot; caries with it the necessitation of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;causal connector&quot; and barring the existence of such a connector the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption leads to an inconsistency. When we consider the duality in terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of process or types and tokens or hardware and software, whose very meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vanishes with out the other, it makes a lot more sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     This is analogous to claiming that numbers can somehow exist without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there being any need for them to be representable in any way. How does any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number, even a Gödel number, represent anything at all if the means by which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to perform the act of making a distinction is not present &quot;in them&quot;? There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not such a thing as an &quot;action&quot; in Platonia!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     It is one thing to claim that any event or action or aspect of existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be faithfully represented as some number, just like a movie is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enumerated by a string of ones and zeroes in the tiny pits in  DVD disc, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without there being some means that is not a number to act upon that number,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the very notion of number vanishes. Numbers, all mathematics and logics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessitate some means to express themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Unless we can somehow &quot;read each other's minds&quot;, it is impossible for me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to communicate the difference between the number 1 and the number 2. Without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some physical structure to act as an interface between our Minds, minds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot interact or even &quot;know&quot; anything; there is no &quot;definiteness&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Similarly, Bodies cannot ask questions or predictions or have anticipations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or self-representations without some Mind associated. Nature has given us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fingers with which to understand numbers...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     A Platonist neglects his own brain when he demands that we believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers are all that exist.
</em><br />
<br />Dear SPK
<br />
<br />Though I entirely agree with what you state above, I take issue with your
<br />
characterization of &quot;Platonism&quot; as some form of mathematical monism.
<br />
If you had called &quot;Pythagorianism&quot; to the doctrine that &quot;only numbers
<br />
exist&quot; you would most likely be correct. Platonism, however, is very
<br />
definitely a form of ontological dualism: Platonists never deny the
<br />
existence of the physical world, though they insist that it exists as
<br />
a corrupted copy of the world of forms, that one holding the &quot;true&quot;
<br />
reality.  It is one think to reject the false, and another one to deny
<br />
its existence! Sorry but this is not a pedantic point.
<br />
<br />In other words: in all you say above you argue as a true Platonist,
<br />
(only one that does not know he is one)!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Consciousness seems to be more of a functional relationship between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physical and the Mental, the Outside and the Inside, as Chalmer's states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When the two dual aspects are taken to the ultimate level of Existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in-itself, the distinction between the two vanishes. Russell saw this long
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ago, he denoted it as &quot;neutral monism&quot;. It is too bad that he made the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mistake of excluding non-well founded sets from consideration.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />If that ultimate level of Existence, as you put it, was as accessible to us as
<br />
the world of (mathematical) forms is to our minds, than I would take it as
<br />
an indication that we (our sould) would had already migrated back to it in
<br />
old platonic parlance. Till than dualism seems quite unavoidable.
<br />
<br />Kindly,
<br />
<br />-Joao

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Stathis: Can the description of the apple, or bat, or whatever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; meaningfully include what it is like to be that thing?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My argument (which is Dennet's argument) is that &quot;what it is like to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that thing&quot; is identical to &quot;being that thing&quot;. As Bruno points out, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 3rd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person level (ie. the level where I am describing or simulating an apple),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a description can not &quot;be&quot; a thing; but on the 1st person level (where a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; description *is* the thing, from the point of view of the thing, inside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simulation, as it were), then the description does &quot;include&quot; what it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; like to be that thing. But &quot;include&quot; is not the correct word to use, since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; subtly assumes a dualism (that the qualia exist somehow separate from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mere description of the thing); the description *just is* the thing.
