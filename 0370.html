</em><br />
<br />It is your responsibility to explain and justify your intuition.
<br />
We can't continue this discussion if you are going to appeal to an
<br />
intuition that only you have access to.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Of course your way has rather counterintuitive consequences which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalism avoids.  The recently dead, for example, could have about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as much measure in your scheme as the living, since the brain would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the same chemical structure but would no longer compute.  What do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you think it would feel like to be such a consciousness?  I doubt it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feel like anything, but that's just a restatement of my above position.
</em><br />
<br />It doesn't feel like anything because consciousness depends on the
<br />
structure of neuron firing patterns. Since the brain-dead have no brain
<br />
activity they obviously lack this structure. I don't see how this is a
<br />
problem for my proposal.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	I doubt that.  Remember, in these artificial neural nets, brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; size is already present (easy to make em' big).  All that remains is for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them to start exploiting the niche of intelligence, and since it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have advantages, it should be a fairly steady and stable progression,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with plenty of time to let it happen.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not convinced that if you add in the code for evolving the neural nets
<br />
(what are you going to replace DNA, proteins, etc. with?) and simulating
<br />
the external environment (what environment are you going to use?), and
<br />
interfacing the neural nets with the external environment, that it's going
<br />
to be shorter than the program form I proposed. But I agree that without a
<br />
more authoratative estimate this discussion probably won't get very far.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	That doesn't make much sense to me.  If there's something that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's like to be a string, why should that be ruined just because it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surrounded by other strings?  There are no external observers here, just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; internal observers.  Is your idea that the concious part of the tape must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be printed out at the beginning of the tape?
</em><br />
<br />Why should it be ruined if it's interspersed with a 0 every other bit? Why
<br />
should it be ruined if it is intermingled with this other string in this
<br />
particular way? But notice that in all three cases you're introducing new
<br />
information that is not present in the original string, namely the
<br />
algorithm for extracting the substring from the original string. Clearly a
<br />
line has to be drawn somewhere and the natural place to draw it is to
<br />
disallow any extra information. Thus a substring cannot be conscious
<br />
because it is not a self-contained carrier of information, and it can only
<br />
be made into one by the introduction of new information.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That is not the model I have in mind. It doesn't seem sensible to think of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a universe with a continuous infinity of Turing machines.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Why not?  The set of all possible programs - what could be more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural than that?  It seems closest to Max's 'everything' idea as well.
</em><br />
<br />Sorry, I was wrong. It's not insensible to think of a universe with a
<br />
continuous infinity of Turing machines. All you need is a three
<br />
dimensional Turing machine and a universe with four spacial dimensions.
