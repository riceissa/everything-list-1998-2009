<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I might still occasionally face accidents where I had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be very lucky to survive, but the lower the probability there is of
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; surviving a particular type of accident, the less likely I am to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience events leading up to such an accident.
</em><br />
<br />So if someone is on a cliff about to commit suicide, from his
<br />
perspective, he will probably find he can't go through with it?  In fact
<br />
will a suicidal person find that nothing tends to go wrong in his life
<br />
(because if it did he would want to commit suicide)?  The more suicidal
<br />
he is the better!  Or perhaps there is a vanishingly small probability
<br />
of finding yourself so easily depressed even though it is not
<br />
unreasonable to come across other people that are.  But if the tendency
<br />
to be suicidal is inherited in the genes can it be that this is
<br />
anticipatory as well?  Of course at the time you inherit your genes you
<br />
aren't conscious.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Well, I do believe in continuity of consciousness, modulo the issues

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of measure.  That is, I think some continuations would be more likely
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;be experienced than others.  For example, if you started up 9
</em><br />
computers
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;each running one copy of me (all running the same program so they stay
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in sync), and one computer running a different copy of me, my current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;theory is that I would expect to experience the first version with 90%
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;probability.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Almost OK, but perhaps false if you put *the measure* on the (infinite)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computations going through those states. I mean, if the 9 computers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;running one copy of you just stop (in some absolute way I ask you to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conceive for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the benefit of the argument), and if the one computer running the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different copy, instead of stopping, is multiplied eventually into many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-distinguishable copies of you, then putting the measure on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;histories should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;make you expect to experience (and memorized) the second version more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probably.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is the idea I like to summarize in the following diagram:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;\        /                     |      |
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   \    /                       |      |
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     \/               =        |      |
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      |                         |      |
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      |                         |      |
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That is, it is like a &quot;future&quot; bifurcation enhances your present
</em><br />
measure.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is why I think comp confirms Deutsch idea that QM branching is
</em><br />
really
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;QM differentiation. What do you think? I mean, do you conceive that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure could be put only on the &quot;maximal&quot; possible computations?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno
</em><br />
<br />This is an important point which I think people often miss about the
<br />
QTI. It 
<br />
is sometimes spoken of as if the QTI only goes into effect at the moment
<br />
you 
<br />
are about to die (and thus have no successor observer-moment), which
<br />
would 
<br />
often require some fantastically improbable escape, like quantum
<br />
tunneling 
<br />
away from a nearby nuclear explosion. But if later bifurcations can
<br />
effect 
<br />
the first-person probability of earlier ones, this need not be the case.
<br />
<br />Consider this thought experiment. Two presidential candidates, let's say
<br />
<br />Wesley Clark and George W. Bush, are going to be running against each
<br />
other 
<br />
in the presidential election. Two months before the election, I step
<br />
into a 
<br />
machine that destructively scans me and recreates two copies in
<br />
different 
<br />
locations--one copy will appear in a room with a portrait of George W.
<br />
on 
<br />
the wall, the other copy will appear in a room with a portrait of Wesley
<br />
<br />Clark. The usual interpretation of first-person probabilities is that,
<br />
all 
<br />
other things being equal, as the scanner begins to activate I should
<br />
expect 
<br />
a 50% chance that the next thing I see will be the portrait of George W.
<br />
<br />appearing before me, and a 50% chance that it will be Wesley Clark.
<br />
<br />But suppose all other things are *not* equal--an additional part of the 
<br />
plan, which I have agreed to, is that following the election, the copy
<br />
who 
<br />
appeared in the room with the winning candidate will be duplicated 999 
<br />
times, while the copy who appeared in the room with the losing candidate
<br />
<br />will not experience any further duplications. Thus, at any time after
<br />
the 
<br />
election, 999 out of 1000 versions of me who are &quot;descended&quot; from the 
<br />
original who first stepped into the duplication machine two months
<br />
before 
<br />
the election will remember appearing in the room with the candidate who 
<br />
ended up winning, while only 1 out of 1000 will remember appearing in
<br />
the 
<br />
room with the losing candidate.
<br />
<br />The &quot;last minute&quot; theory of quantum immortality is based on the idea
<br />
that 
<br />
first-person probabilities are based solely on the observer-moments that
<br />
<br />qualify as immediate successors to my current observer-moment, and this
<br />
idea 
<br />
suggests that as I step into the duplication machine two months before
<br />
the 
<br />
election, I should expect a 50% chance of appearing in the room with the
<br />
<br />portrait of the candidate who goes on to win the election. But as Bruno 
<br />
suggests, an alternate theory is that later bifurcations should be taken
<br />
to 
<br />
influence the first-person probabilities of earlier bifurcations--under
<br />
this 
<br />
&quot;anticipatory&quot; theory, I should expect only a 1 out of 1000 chance that
<br />
I 
<br />
will appear in the room with the portrait of the losing candidate. This 
<br />
would lead to a weird sort of &quot;first-person precognition&quot;, where after
<br />
the 
<br />
duplication but before the election, I'd have good reason to believe
<br />
(from a 
<br />
first-person point of view) that I could predict the outcome with a high
<br />
<br />probability of being right. But this kind of prediction would be useless
<br />
<br />from a third-person point of view, since all outside observers would see
<br />
two 
<br />
symmetrical copies who both seem equally certain that their candidate
<br />
will 
<br />
be the winner. Of course this is not much stranger than the basic
<br />
quantum 
<br />
immortality idea that if I am in some dangerous accident, most
<br />
third-person 
<br />
observers will see me end up dead, while I have a close to 100% chance
<br />
of 
<br />
surviving from a first-person POV.
<br />
<br />Applied to quantum immortality, this &quot;anticipatory&quot; idea suggests it
<br />
would 
<br />
not be as if the universe is allowing events to go any which way right
<br />
up 
<br />
until something is about to kill me, and then it steps in with some 
<br />
miraculous coincidence which saves me; instead, it would be more like
<br />
the 
<br />
universe would constantly be nudging the my first-person probabilities
<br />
in 
<br />
favor of branches where I don't face any dangerous accidents which
<br />
require 
<br />
&quot;miracles&quot; in the first place. Of course since this would just be a 
<br />
probabilistic effect, I might still occasionally face accidents where I
<br />
had 
<br />
to be very lucky to survive, but the lower the probability there is of 
<br />
surviving a particular type of accident, the less likely I am to
<br />
experience 
<br />
events leading up to such an accident.
