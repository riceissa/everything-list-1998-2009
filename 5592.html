<em class="quotelev1">&gt;up the dictionary:
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. Note that I agree with John that &lt;&lt;Vocabularies usually list the 
<br />
historical common sense versions of obsolete world views&gt;&gt;. But I 
<br />
understand the move and will make some comments, if only to point toward 
<br />
the perhaps &quot;obsolete views&quot;.
<br />
The main one is that the definitions implicitly assumes a little bit of 
<br />
Aristotelian physicalism: this entails we should distinguish the relativity 
<br />
with respect to our mind state, and relativity to our &quot;position&quot; with 
<br />
respect to some universe (which I do not assume the existence).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Objectivity: the ability to express or deal with facts or conditions as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perceived without without distortion by personal feelings, prejudices or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpretationsthe ability to observe independetly of one's own mental state.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Subjectivity: [the ability to perceive a reality as] related to or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;determined by the mind as the subject of experience; the ability to ... 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;identify by means of one's perception of one's own states and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;processes...rather than as independent of mind.
</em><br />
<br />Too vague.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Relativity: the state of being dependent for existence on or determined in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nature, value, or quality by relation to something else.
</em><br />
<br />Mmmmh.... (By which I mean I can agree and I can disagree depending on the 
<br />
sense of each word in the sentence).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Absolut[ism]: [the quality of ] being self sufficient and independent for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;external references or relationships
</em><br />
<br />With that definition, you can say that my starting point is &quot;absolute&quot; 
<br />
giving that physics will be entirely determined by self-introspection (but 
<br />
then at latter stage that introspection will be described by a machine 
<br />
after a choice of third person description of the first person states).  I 
<br />
don't think it is important.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Therefore, subjectivity and objectivity are opposite, relativity and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;absolutism are opposite.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I totally agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;A first person perception is a subjective or relative experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A third person perception is an objective or absolute experience.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course I would say
<br />
<br />A first person perception is a subjective experience, and then an absolute 
<br />
one (in the sense that it is not relativizable, if you have a headache you 
<br />
cannot relativize the feeling itself, although you could relativize the 
<br />
importance of it, ...).
<br />
A third person perception is an objective experience, and then a relative 
<br />
one (in the sense that you will need to choose either a theory or a set of 
<br />
experimental devices, let us say a frame (?), without which the proof or 
<br />
the observation are not defined.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You have moved to a meta level: how do you deal with being a scientist. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The paradox is that your research as a scientists should not be restricted 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by your need for communicating with other scientists. It's like Einstein 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;worrying that his communication of the relativity theory would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;corrupted by his relative motion with other scientists.  We can assume for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the time being that our frames of reference are sufficiently close that we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can pretend to talk objectively about the first person or more precisely, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that our relative talk about the first person will not be corrupted by our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;slightly different frames of reference.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I did move to a meta level indeed. About &lt;&lt;how do you deal with being a 
<br />
scientist&gt;&gt;. I would say by publishing, or ... perishing, I guess ... ;) 
<br />
When you say that my research as a scientist should not be restricted by 
<br />
the need for communicating with other scientist, I agree concerning the 
<br />
research itself, but the communication of it must take &quot;the 
<br />
un-communicable&quot; into account due to the nature of the subject.
<br />
Then I am not sure of the link with your last sentence, but I am dispose to 
<br />
assume our &quot;frames of reference&quot; are sufficiently close to pretend to talk 
<br />
objectively ...(OK) ... about the first person .... still OK but only if we 
<br />
agree on some definition or modelization (at some point) or even some 
<br />
intuition about the very notion of first person. Here I think we agree with 
<br />
the words &quot;first/third person&quot;, and &quot;subjective/objective&quot;, but apparently 
<br />
we are using &quot;absolute&quot; and &quot;relative&quot; in the opposite sense.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Now all theories come from and are ultimately addressed to first person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;So, when I propose an axiom, like &quot;x + 0 = x&quot;, I can only hope it makes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(absolute) sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OK here we may have encountered the vocabulary problem. I would say it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;makes relative sense. As a proof, suppose my mental states are such that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpret + as x. Then it would make sense to me that x+0 = 0.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But then you are using the term &quot;relative&quot; in my sense !?!?. That is 
<br />
relative with respect to a theory (resp a model) in which the behavior of 
<br />
&quot;+&quot; and &quot;x&quot; are defined. I was assuming here the intended meaning of &quot;+&quot;.
<br />
We cannot axiomatize addition without having some basic intuition of it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;But I can only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;communicate such relative objective statements. This is the price of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;science imo.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Now, could you reassure me: do you agree with proposition like &quot;x + 0 = 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;0&quot;, or prime(17)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I guess and hope so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As I said, depending on the states of my mind, I may not agree with this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;propostion,. I could interpret &quot;or&quot; as &quot;and&quot;, and then the proposition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be false.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />That move leads us nowhere. You force me to ask you &quot;is your mind in a 
<br />
state such as willing to recognize the truth of the proposition which I 
<br />
attempt to refer by &quot;x + 0 = 0&quot;? And in case you have forget the usual 
<br />
meaning of &quot;+&quot; don't hesitate to open your &quot;objective&quot; dictionary this time 
<br />
too.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Obviously the &quot;yes doctor&quot; proposition is more demanding, and that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;why ultimately I eliminate it methodologically by interviewing a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;sound  universal Turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;machine instead of &quot;grandmother&quot;, but such an elimination is only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;strategical&quot;. One of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;goal is to illustrate that although the first person discourse is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;unscientific,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;psychologists would not agree with that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;by its very nature,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;we still can, by giving genuine definitions and hypotheses build a pure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;third person discourse,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;which can be scientific (that is: modest relative and uncertain) *on* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;first person discourses and views.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Does that make sense?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OK the discourse must be third person, we have no choice, but the content 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the discourse must be first person.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Absolutely!  But note that we can still have a PARTIAL third person 
<br />
description or modelization of that content. I really believe that modal 
<br />
logic will help us to clarify those subtle points.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Ah! About the gray hair problem, I think it is always the same problem, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;some lack
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of knowledge in the field of logic. You are not the only one (in the list 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and elsewhere),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;let us think what to do about that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hair dye?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />&quot;hair dye&quot; ?  That expression looks terrible! Please don't do that. I am 
<br />
sure a tiny detour through logic will be wizer for the health of your hair, 
<br />
unless you continue to split them right at the start (just a pun!).
<br />
<br />Are you ready for some definition? (We can abandon for a while the 
<br />
&quot;absolute&quot;/&quot;relative&quot; opposite view giving that we agree on the 1/3 
<br />
distinction and on the subjective/objective opposition, and that's what 
<br />
counts in the interview of the Universal Machine (and its Godelian 
<br />
&quot;Guardian Angel&quot;).
