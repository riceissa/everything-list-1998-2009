<br />I think I already answered this question. A given machine can only simulate
<br />
a world much simpler than itself  - obviously it cannot simulate itself.
<br />
With your brain you are not able to think of every people in detail: you
<br />
can only have very crude approximations of them. So you cannot emulate a
<br />
&quot;whole society&quot; (obviously computer games are much simpler than the real
<br />
life!)
<br />
&nbsp;A computer could compute a simple approximation of the real environment,
<br />
but not an environment including this computer itself. So the world it
<br />
would generate would be a (very) simplified version of our world, in other
<br />
words another world, lacking in particular this computer itself! And the
<br />
&quot;you&quot; you would try to simulate would also be an oversimplified version of
<br />
you, that you would probably refuse to consider as a &quot;perfect copy&quot; of you.
<br />
<br />Of course I agree that you could imagine the opposite situation where our
<br />
world would be the result of a computation in a much larger world. It
<br />
doesn't contradict what I say because our consciousness would still be
<br />
unique in the world (real or simulated) where we are actually living. As I
<br />
said you may imagine two different implementations of the same
<br />
consciousness in different, non interacting worlds, such as in MWI.
<br />
However, if the worlds are different, you have to be careful in defining
<br />
what you call the &quot;same&quot; consciousness in this case. In the MWI you may
<br />
rely upon the time-ordering of the macroscopic components of the wave
<br />
function to determine &quot;who&quot; becomes &quot;who&quot;.
<br />
<br />Of course I assume here that the consciousness is the result of preexisting
<br />
physical laws, which put constraints on its evolution. Even if you think we
<br />
are the result of a huge program, I assume that this program does respect
<br />
the physical laws : it calculates the physical evolution of the Universe
<br />
whose consequence is the apparition of conscious beings (apparently what we
<br />
observe!). In games, you would be free to program conscious beings
<br />
independantly of each other and duplicate them ad libitum. The problem is
<br />
that  we are not living in a game (or at least we do not control it, and
<br />
none of our machine can control it as well). So you can not construct a
<br />
machine that is both conscious of our environment and can control it or
<br />
simulate it...
<br />
<br />I have not really a theory of that, but I think that &quot;consciousness&quot; may
<br />
not be an objective property, but rather a property relative to the world
<br />
in which the system is actually living in. It may be interesting to think
<br />
of a definition of it based on the idea that a conscious being should have
<br />
a representation of his environment complex enough to insure its
<br />
uniqueness, which corresponds to what we are actually experiencing. I think
<br />
that we would start to consider that computers are conscious when it would
<br />
become obvious that they know &quot;who&quot; they are...
