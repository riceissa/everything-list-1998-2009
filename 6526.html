Hal,
<br />
<br />Thanks for an illuminating explanation of Tipler's paper.
<br />
<br />I wonder if you and/or any other members on this list have an opinion about 
<br />
the validity of an article at
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.hedweb.com/nihilism/nihilfil.htm">http://www.hedweb.com/nihilism/nihilfil.htm</a>
<br />
<br />This is a discussion of &quot;WHY DOES ANYTHING EXIST?&quot;  (The author is 
<br />
apparently a David Pearce.  There are many with that name and I am unable to 
<br />
determine which one.)  His conclusion is that &quot;. . . the summed membership 
<br />
of the uncountably large set of positive and negative numbers, and every 
<br />
more fancy and elaborate pair of positive and negative real and imaginary 
<br />
etc terms, trivially and exactly cancels out to/adds up to 0. . . .  Net 
<br />
energy etc of Multiverse = 0 = all possible outcomes. . . if, in all, there 
<br />
is 0, i.e no (net) properties whatsoever, then there just isn't anything 
<br />
substantive which needs explaining.&quot;  (Please go to the URL to avoid 
<br />
misinterpretations which I may have introduced by my editing.)

Subject: Re: Tipler Weighs In
<br />
<br /><br />Lee Corbin points to
<br />
Tipler's March 2005 paper &quot;The Structure of the World From Pure Numbers&quot;:
<br />
<a href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0034-4885/68/4/R04">http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0034-4885/68/4/R04</a>
<br />
<br />I tried to read this paper, but it was 60 pages long and extremely
<br />
technical, mostly over my head.  The gist of it was an updating of
<br />
Tipler's Omega Point theory, advanced in his book, The Physics of
<br />
Immortality.  Basically the OP theory predicts, based on the assumption
<br />
that the laws of physics we know today are roughly correct, that the
<br />
universe must re-collapse in a special way that can't really happen
<br />
naturally, hence Tipler deduces that intelligent life will survive
<br />
through and guide the ultimate collapse, during which time the information
<br />
content of the universe will go to infinity.
<br />
<br />The new paper proposes an updated cosmological model that includes a
<br />
number of new ideas.  One is that the fundamental laws of physics for the
<br />
universe are infinitely complex.  This is where his title comes from; he
<br />
assumes that the universe is based on the mathematics of the continuum,
<br />
i.e. the real numbers.  In fact Tipler argues that the universe must
<br />
have infinitely complex laws, basing this surprising conclusion on the
<br />
Lowenheim-Skolem paradox, which says that any set of finite axioms
<br />
can be fit to a mathematical object that is only countable in size.
<br />
Hence technically we can't really describe the real numbers without an
<br />
infinite number of axioms, and therefore if the universe is truly based
<br />
on the reals, it must have laws of infinite complexity.  (Otherwise the
<br />
laws would equally well describe a universe based only on the integers.)
<br />
<br />Another idea Tipler proposes is that under the MWI, different universes
<br />
in the multiverse will expand to different maximum sizes R before
<br />
re-collapsing.  The probability measure however works out to be higher
<br />
with larger R, hence for any finite R the probability is 1 (i.e. certain)
<br />
that our universe will be bigger than that.  This is his solution to why
<br />
the universe appears to be flat - it's finite in size but very very big.
<br />
<br />Although Tipler wants the laws to be infinitely complex, the physical
<br />
information content of the universe should be zero, he argues, at the
<br />
time of the Big Bang (this is due to the Beckenstein Bound).  That means
<br />
among other things there are no particles back then, and so he proposes
<br />
a special field called an SU(2) gauge field which creates particles
<br />
as the universe expands.  He is able to sort of show that it would
<br />
preferentially create matter instead of antimatter, and also that this
<br />
field would be responsible for the cosmological constant (CC) which is being
<br />
observed, aka negative energy.
<br />
<br />In order for the universe to re-collapse as Tipler insists it must,
<br />
due to his Omega Point theory, the CC must reverse sign eventually.
<br />
Tipler suggests that this will happen because life will choose to do so,
<br />
and that somehow people will find a way to reverse the particle-creation
<br />
effect, catalyzing the destruction of particles in such a way as to
<br />
reverse the CC and cause the universe to begin to re-collapse.
<br />
<br />Yes, he's definitely full of wild ideas here.  Another idea is that
<br />
particle masses should not have specific, arbitrary values as most
<br />
physicists believe, but rather they should take on a full range of values,
<br />
from 0 to positive infinity, over the history of the universe.  There is
<br />
some slight observational evidence for a time-based change in the fine
<br />
structure constant alpha, and Tipler points to that to buttress his theory
<br />
- however the actual measured value is inconsistent with other aspects,
<br />
so he has to assume that the measurements are mistaken!
<br />
<br />Another testable idea is that the cosmic microwave background radiation
<br />
is not the cooled-down EM radiation from the big bang, but instead is the
<br />
remnants of that SU(2) field which was responsible for particle creation.
<br />
He shows that such a field would look superficially like cooled down
<br />
photons, but it really is not.  In particular, the photons in this special
<br />
field would only interact with left handed electrons, not right handed
<br />
ones.  This would cause the photons to have less interaction with matter
<br />
in a way which should be measurable.  He uses this to solve the current
<br />
puzzle of high energy cosmic rays: such rays should not exist due to
<br />
interaction with microwave background photons.  Tipler's alternative does
<br />
not interact so well and so it would at least help to explain the problem.
<br />
<br />Overall it is quite a mixed bag of exotic ideas that I don't think
<br />
physicists are going to find very convincing.  The idea of infinitely
<br />
complex natural laws is going to be particularly off-putting, I would
<br />
imagine.  However the idea that the cosmic microwave background interacts
<br />
differently with matter than ordinary photons is an interesting one and
<br />
might be worth investigating.  It doesn't have that much connection to
<br />
the rest of his theory, though.
