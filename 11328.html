<br />I got overwhelmed by work and dropped the other thread... apologies...
<br />
<br />I have realised I have a fundamentally different view to 'computational'
<br />
and 'physical' and 'number'. On reflection it seems to be that when most
<br />
of the folk on this list think of 'number' they think of it as the
<br />
idealised numbers - numbers that are perfect. There are no fuzzy edges or
<br />
'remainders' in these numbers. We can use them to represent quantities of
<br />
notional objects and the behaviour of the objects follows the rules of the
<br />
idealised numbers. All good.
<br />
<br />But what numbers are used in the construction of the 'physical'? My
<br />
particular ontic prejudice :-) all along has been that the physical is
<br />
simply a reified computation, but not on idealised numbers. I suppose all
<br />
number comes down to logical operations whetween types... but the
<br />
'numbers' underlying the mathematics can be any arbitrary event( as a
<br />
type) any instance(s) of a type. A collection of such instances operating
<br />
together literally become the mathematics.
<br />
<br />In this approach the 'chair', to me, literally is a computational outcome.
<br />
The 'proof' process has no end and the mathematics automatically enacts
<br />
proofs (this is the 2nd law of thermodynamics at work). The chair is a
<br />
continually unfolding proof within the mathematics of these
<br />
'numbers_that_are_not'. The fact that we are also proofs within the same
<br />
mathematics means that we, in having perceptual faculties, get to label
<br />
whatever it is we are in as 'physical'. This does not mean that there is
<br />
no such thing as 'real'. What it means is that the computation that we are
<br />
is the only reified computation. That computation is just not one done on
<br />
the idealised numbers.
<br />
<br />To me, saying that computation on idealised numbers is the only 'real
<br />
computation' ( = distingishing between chair and math) is like choosing
<br />
one isotope of carbon and declaring it to be the 'real' carbon
<br />
(mathematics)...When in fact all the isotopes are carbon(mathematics),
<br />
just on different bases. Or perhaps that the only 'real' colour
<br />
representation is RGB, not CMYK or any of the others equivalents.
<br />
<br />Choosing a perfect number set to perform mathematics and do computing and
<br />
formal proofs works really well and we have been able to use it to great
<br />
effect.
<br />
<br />However, I find I cannot distinguish between a 'chair' and a 'mathematical
<br />
concep' and a 'mathematical proof' and a 'computation' and 'the physical'
<br />
and the 'real'. They are all the same thing. In fact in this particular
<br />
case it's a damned nuiscance we have different words forcing us to make
<br />
the distinction and have predispositions to regard them as such.
<br />
<br />I reached this position independently and you may think I'm nuts... I
<br />
can't help what I see... is there something wrong with this way of
<br />
thinking? I seemed to have reached it naturally and only recently realised
<br />
that I was thinking very diffrerently to everyone else... or maybe I'm
<br />
not, but just misunderstand... hard for me to tell. Perhaps you can help!
<br />
<br />regards
