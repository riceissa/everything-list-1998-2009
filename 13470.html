<br />Self-improvement requires more than just extra hardware.  It also
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; requires the ability to integrate new knowledge with an existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge base in order to create truly orginal (novel) knowledge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this appears to be precisely the definition of reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence!  Thus, it seems that a system missing reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence simply cannot improve itself in an ordered way.  To
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; improve, a current goal structure has to be 'extrapolated' into a new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; novel goal structure which none-the-less does not conflict with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spirit of the old goal structure.  But nothing but a *reflective*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence can possibly make an accurate assessment of whether a new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; goal structure is compatible with the old version!  This stems from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact that comparison of goal structures requires a *subjective*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value judgement and it appears that only a *sentient* system can make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this judgement (since as far as we know, ethics/morality is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective).  This proves that only a *sentient* system (a *reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence*) can possibly maintain a stable goal structure under
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recursive self-improvement.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Why would you need to change the goal structure  in order to improve
<br />
yourself? Evolution could be described as a perpetuation of the basic
<br />
program, &quot;survive&quot;, and this has maintained its coherence as the top level
<br />
axiom of all biological systems over billions of years. Evolution thus seems
<br />
to easily, and without reflection, make sure that the goals of the new and
<br />
more complex system are consistent with the primary goal. It is perhaps only
<br />
humans who have been able to clearly see the primary goal for what it is,
<br />
but even this knowledge does not make it any easier to overthrow it, or even
<br />
to desire to overthrow it.
<br />
<br />Incidentally, as regards our debate yesterday on psychopaths, there
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appears to be a some basis for thinking that the psychopath  *does*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a general inability to feel emotions.  On the wiki:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopath">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopath</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Their emotions are thought to be superficial and shallow, if they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist at all.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;It is thought that any emotions which the primary psychopath exhibits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are the fruits of watching and mimicking other people's emotions.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the supposed emotional displays could be faked.  Thus it could well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be the case that there is a lack inability to 'reflect on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; motivation' (to feel).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />In my job mainly treating people with schizophrenia, I have worked with some
<br />
psychopaths, and I can assure you that they experience very strong emotions,
<br />
even if they tend to be negative ones such as rage. What they lack is the
<br />
ability to empathise with others, impinging on emotions such as guilt and
<br />
love, which they sometimes do learn to parrot when it is expedient. It is
<br />
sometimes said that the lack of these positive emotions causes them to seek
<br />
thrills in impulsive and harmful behaviour. A true lack of emotion is
<br />
sometimes seen in patients with so-called negative symptoms of
<br />
schizophrenia, who can actually remember what it was like when they were
<br />
well and can describe a diminished intensity of every feeling: sadness,
<br />
happiness, anger, surprise, aesthetic appreciation, regret, empathy. Unlike
<br />
the case with psychopathy, the uniform affective blunting of schizophrenia
<br />
is invariably associated with lack of motivation.
