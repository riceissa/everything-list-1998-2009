<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, you said All comments welcome. You asked for it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First, there's a lot to read here, so I assumed you were presenting the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basic gist of your ideas in the first few paragraphs, and so I have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; few comments about those paragraphs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I commend you for trying to explain values as part of the framework.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've whinced before when I've read some thought experiments on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list that depended on accepting the existence of such ideas as good and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bad. I believe in the existence of good and bad, but one needs to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; support his/her belief in good and bad and not take them as a given.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems that your limitation of reality to meaningful existence is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually rejecting Mathematical Platonism. Why is consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; required to make a mathematical truth real? I thought that you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to deal with all of existence, not just meaningful existence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since your theory tries to explain &quot;how the most fundamental properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of existence facts fit together into a unified metaphysical framework.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And yet here you limit existence to what we can perceive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The core assumption is that existence without perception is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningless. Reality requires not only raw data but something to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *interpret* that data, to supply meaning to it. This can only be done
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by consciousness of *some* kind. If something was hypothesized to exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that could in no way directly or indirectly affect the conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceptions of *any* possible observer, then in what sense could it be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said to exist at all? Even if it could be successfully argued that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; did have some kind of abstract philosophical existence, it could never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have any possible value to sentient minds. For the purposes of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding general intelligence, it suffices to define that which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists as that which could directly or indirectly ( i.e. in principle)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; affect the perceptions of *some* possible conscious observer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you've eliminated the whole realm of &quot;unperceived reality&quot; in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; superset of existence. You've eliminated the motivation to bring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unperceived reality into the realm of perceived reality, since the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; former does not exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Reading these metaphysical theories doesn't really impress me when I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realize that these theories really don't have anything new in them that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ancient Greeks (for instance) didn't have.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course the big gap in all of these theories, which I believe will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never be filled, is the integration of consciousness (in general) into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics. Even if we integrate human consciousness into it (which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't think is going to happen), that doesn't cover the whole gammit of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what consciousness is in the whole universe. Who knows, there's so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much we don't know about stars (and they are so big) that perhaps some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stars have consciousness of some kind that is outside of the definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of how we would define it, but may be even more &quot;enlightened&quot; about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, and yet we may never know.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

What I wrote there may be misleading.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;By 'perceivable' I don't necessarily mean 'perceived by humans', what I
<br />
mean is 'perceivable *in principle* (i.e. by some mind, somewhere in the
<br />
universe). Reality can only ever be understood from the perspective of a
<br />
mind. Therefore only things capable of (in principle) making a difference to
<br />
perceived reality need to be taken into account when devising ultimate
<br />
theories of metaphysics.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;If you read what I wrote I made it pretty clear that I believe in a kind of
<br />
mathematical Platonism. My proposed noumenon (raw fabric) of reality was
<br />
something I called 'Mathematico-Cognition' (a hybrid of mathematics and
<br />
information processing).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;I don't think the 'perceivable in principle' requirement contradicts
<br />
mathematical Platonism. What makes you think that mathematical objects
<br />
aren't perceivable? True, most *humans* can't perceive mathematical things,
<br />
but that's probably just a limitation of the human mind. I think that a mind
<br />
sufficiently talented at math *could* in principle directly perceive
<br />
mathematical objects. Kurt Godel claimed that it was possible to directly
<br />
perceive mathematical objects. He even thought the mind was capable of
<br />
directly perceiving infinite sets.
