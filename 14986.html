<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And why, specifically, would something like Bohmian mechanics fail to qualify as &quot;descriptions of an underlying reality&quot;? is it because it doesn't say anything about first-person qualia, or is it for some other reason? What if we had a theory along the lines of Bohmian mechanics, and combined that with &quot;psychophysical laws&quot; of the type Chalmers postulates, laws which define a mapping between configurations of physical entities (described in mathematical, third-person terms) and specific qualia--would *that* qualify as what you mean by &quot;aspect 1&quot;?

Good question.
<br />
<br />YES - Bohmian/Stappian/Bohrian/Penrosian/any old quantum mechanics 
<br />
flavour all fail to predict an observer. Brilliantly predictive OF 
<br />
observations (appearances) - but that's it. */Dual aspect science 
<br />
predicts that failure. /*
<br />
<br />RE: Chalmers 'postulates' ('law of organisational invariance' etc)
<br />
What you are talking about is basically the same thing as 'neural 
<br />
correlates of consciousness'. Correlating reports of P-consciousness 
<br />
with neural activity is descriptive: WHAT. Not explanatory: WHY? It is 
<br />
based on the &quot;Mind Brain Identity&quot; theorem...yet another tedious 
<br />
cultural agreement masquerading as science that says: &quot;to describe the 
<br />
brain is to describe the mind&quot;. The dressing up with 'psychophysical' 
<br />
label changes nothing. There is no prediction here. There is merely 
<br />
correlation based on the same kind of prescriptive deployment of a new 
<br />
self-fulfilling 'received view'. I hope you can see this.
<br />
<br />'Postulates' are just empty declarations. If they fail to make any 
<br />
predictions they are just a lot of conventions - folk lore - just as bad 
<br />
as any ascription to QM as ontological. If postulates are contrived to 
<br />
fit expectations then they are tautologies (in exactly the same way that 
<br />
computer 'science' computer programs are self-fulfilling tautologies). 
<br />
This process merely creates a CORRELATE of the observation, not a LAW OF 
<br />
NATURE.
<br />
<br />A real theory would literally predict /a-priori /that our brains should 
<br />
exist and have the structure they have, that it will be 'like something' 
<br />
to be the material involved. (It will also be able to make a 
<br />
scientifically justified statement about the P-cosnciousness of a rock, 
<br />
a computer and an elephant.) It will predict that: There will be 
<br />
neurons, assembled into layers and columns like SUCH, that their shape 
<br />
shall be THIS. That membranes of THAT structure shall be found and shall 
<br />
be be penetrated by  ion channels THUS; That the soma shall be of this 
<br />
morphogy, and the ion channels shall be of these types and have surface 
<br />
densities thus...that the composition of the membrane shall be an 
<br />
ordered but dynamic fluid with lipid rafts doing THIS in THESE cells to 
<br />
make RED in V4 of the occipital. and so on...
<br />
<br />Further more, a complete &lt;aspect 1&gt; will result in F=MA as an emergent 
<br />
a-priori property of reality, calculated as a statistic of the monism. 
<br />
It would also predict, a-priori, the gravitational constant as an 
<br />
&lt;aspect-1&gt; statistic, along with the speed of light C  and so on. In 
<br />
that way the &lt;aspect 1&gt; and &lt;aspect 2&gt; shall mesh, perfectly, both 
<br />
supported by the empirical evidence (a) by predicting an observer 
<br />
(structured as per the above) and (b) that the observer shall construct 
<br />
the law F=MA in the appropriate non-relativistic context of appearances.
<br />
<br />&lt;aspect 1&gt; is NOT underling reality, but a description of it. There may 
<br />
be 100 complete, consistent sets, all of which work as well as each 
<br />
other. We must live with that potential ambiguity. There's no 
<br />
fundamental reason why we are ever entitled to a unique solution to 
<br />
&lt;aspect 1&gt;. But it may turn out that there can only be one. We'll never 
<br />
know unless we let ourselves look, will we??
<br />
<br />&lt;aspect 2&gt; is NOT underling reality, but a description of its 
<br />
appearances to an observer inside a reality described structurally as 
<br />
&lt;aspect 1&gt;. 100 different life-forms, as scientists/observers all over 
<br />
the universe, may all concoct 100 totally different sets of 'laws of 
<br />
nature', each  one just as predictive of the natural world, none of 
<br />
which are 'right' , but all are 'predictive' to each life-form. They all 
<br />
are empirically verified by 100 very different P-consciousnesses of each 
<br />
species of scientist....but they /all predict the same outcome for a 
<br />
given experiment/. Human-centric 'laws of nature' are an illusion. 
<br />
&lt;aspect 2&gt; 'Laws of Nature' are filtered through the P-cosnciousness of 
<br />
the observer and verified on that basis! We need to 'get over ourselves' 
<br />
yet again, in another round of 'copernican decentralisation' : only this 
<br />
time in respect of our phenomenal lives and the laws we concoct..
<br />
<br />Are we there yet?
<br />
<br />Science is really messed up. The 'XYZ interpretation' is a peculiar 
<br />
cover welded over knowledge, erected by physicists. At the same time 
<br />
neuroscientists have their own cover welded over their own explanatory 
<br />
failure: called the Mind-Brain Identity Theorem. The two disciplines 
<br />
rarely meet on the same ground. Each has the answer to the other's 
<br />
problem. The system perpetuates. No progress is made. Both operate in 
<br />
this regime of 'SINGLE ASPECT SCIENCE' for no good reason. This is the 
<br />
way the 'hard problem' remains hard.
<br />
<br />I drew this state of affairs as a diagram in my paper that has been out 
<br />
there for 2 years. I empirically observe scientists and I report what 
<br />
they do. What they (WE - I am enrolled this mess too) do is bizarre. The 
<br />
upgrade from SAS to DAS alters not one single &lt;aspect 2&gt; law. Despite 
<br />
this we still do nothing...
<br />
<br />This thread has revealed the 'Cellular Automata' metaphor as perhaps a 
<br />
very useful way to describe DAS. I must work on this a bit more. :-)
