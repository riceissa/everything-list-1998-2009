<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This reminds me of something I wanted to ask you Bruno. In your work

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you axiomatise knowledge and end up with various logical systems that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describe variously 1st person knowledge, 1st person communicable

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge, 3rd person knowledge etc. In some of these, the Deontic

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axiom comes up, which if translated into Kripke semantics reads &quot;all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds have a successor word&quot; (or &quot;no worlds are terminal&quot;).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />OK. For the benefit of others I recall that I am interested in what 
<br />
machines can prove and can expect about themselves.
<br />
<br />The goal is to interview the machine about the &quot;measure on the 
<br />
collection of its maximal consistent extensions&quot;. The &quot;maximal 
<br />
consistent extensions&quot; are playing the role of the computational 
<br />
histories, but in a language available to the machine (by Godel 
<br />
technic).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I limit myself to sound machine with enough provability power. By a 
<br />
technic akin to godel or meta-programing, we can translate &quot;the machine 
<br />
proves &lt;some proposition P&gt; &quot;  *in*  the language of the machine. I 
<br />
note that translation Bp. So BP means &quot;the machine proves P&quot; in the 
<br />
language of the machine. It can be shown that if the machine proves 
<br />
some proposition P, then such a machine has enough &quot;introspective 
<br />
power&quot; to also prove that she prove P. We have
<br />
<br />If the machine proves P, then the machine proves BP,
<br />
<br />which, for a modal logician, is the closer under the necessitation 
<br />
rule. Then, the machine has again enough &quot;introspection&quot; to &quot;know&quot; 
<br />
this, in the sense, for any formula P in its language, she can proves 
<br />
the true formula:
<br />
<br />BP -&gt; BBP
<br />
<br />She can prove also that she is close for the modus ponens: if she 
<br />
proves A and if she proves A-&gt;B, then she proves that B. &quot;She know 
<br />
that&quot; means that for any A she proves (and its is true) that
<br />
<br />B(P-&gt;Q) -&gt; (BP -&gt; BQ)
<br />
<br />And it can be proved that she is Loebian, which means she proves BP-&gt;P 
<br />
only if she actually proves P. In particular she cannot prove Bf -&gt; f.  
<br />
(where &quot;f&quot; = &quot;0≠1&quot;). Actually she knows she is Loebian:  for any P, she 
<br />
proves
<br />
<br />B(BP -&gt; P) -&gt; BP
<br />
<br />OK? By a theorem of Solovay, those formula and rules axiomatizes 
<br />
soundly and completely the (propositional) part of the machine's 
<br />
provability logic. Those formula and rules constitutes the logic G).
<br />
<br />If the formula BP-&gt;P is true for any P, this really means the machine 
<br />
is sound. But the machine cannot prove its soundness. She cannot prove 
<br />
BP-&gt;P for any P. She cannot prove, for example its own consistency ~Bf  
<br />
(~P is equivalent to P-&gt; f).
<br />
<br />So although (BP &amp; P) is generally equivalent to BP about the machine, 
<br />
she cannot generally prove it, and from its perspective BP is not 
<br />
(necessarily) equivalent to (BP &amp; P).
<br />
<br />So provability, from the machine perspective, behaves like a &quot;belief&quot; 
<br />
modality, where Bp does not (necessarily) entails P.
<br />
<br />I recall that for knowledge CP, philosopher asks for both CP -&gt; P, and 
<br />
the closure for the necessitation rule.
<br />
<br />But then this means we can define &quot;knowledge of P&quot;, CP, by BP &amp; P.
<br />
<br />And then we can interview the machine (through an infinite 
<br />
conversation, ok, but finitely summarized thanks to Solovay's G) about 
<br />
the logic of knowledge &quot;CP&quot;. This gives a logic of &quot;temporal knowledge&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of a &quot;knower&quot; verifying the philosophers' most agreed upon definition. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it as the simplest first person notion &quot;definable&quot; in the 
<br />
language of the machine.
<br />
[Careful here: CP will appear to be only very indirectly definable by 
<br />
the machine: no machine can give a third person description of its &quot;CP&quot; 
<br />
logic!
<br />
<br />The logic of CP is the system known as S4Grz. The subjective 
<br />
temporality aspect come from the fact that on finite transitive frames 
<br />
respecting the Grz formula the Kripke accessibility relation is 
<br />
antisymmetric and reflexive, like in Bergson/Brouwer conception of 
<br />
time. See perhaps:
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
<br /><br />Note that BP -&gt; P is equivalent to ~P -&gt; ~B~ ~P, and if that is 
<br />
true/provable for any P, then it is equivalent to P -&gt; ~B~p, so BP -&gt; 
<br />
P, as axioms, entails BP -&gt; ~B~P (the deontic formula). But, by 
<br />
incompleteness the reverse is false.
<br />
<br />Now you were just pointing on tis little less simple definition of 
<br />
first person based on the deontic transformation. This one has been 
<br />
studied in my thesis, so I have only my papers in my url for 
<br />
references). Here a new logic is defined by DP = BP &amp; ~B~P. It is not 
<br />
used to define a first person knower, but more a first person plural 
<br />
gambler. The logic of DP loses the necessitation rule and loses the 
<br />
Kripke semantics, but get interesting quasi-topological spaces instead. 
<br />
A &quot;immediate time&quot; notion (re)appear though the combination of the two 
<br />
ideas: define D'P by BP &amp; ~B~P &amp; P.
<br />
<br />Do you you grasp the nuance between
<br />
<br />BP   (Theaetetus 0)
<br />
BP &amp; P  (Theaetetus 1)
<br />
BP  &amp; ~B~P  (Theaetetus 2)
<br />
BP &amp; ~B~P &amp; P  (Theaetetus 3) ?
<br />
<br />Only Theaetetus 1 gives rise to a &quot;temporal subjectivity&quot;.
<br />
(Now if you interview the machine on *comp* itself, by limiting the 
<br />
atomic P to DU accessible truth, the Theaetetus 1, 2 and 3 all leads to 
<br />
different &quot;quantum logics&quot;. In my thesis of Brussels and Lille I have 
<br />
been wrong, I thought wrongly that the pure (given by Theaetetus 1) 
<br />
first person collapse with comp).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appears that you would like to identify what I call psychological time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a succession of worlds that follow according to these Kripke
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; semantics. Particularly in comments like the above. Since we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; started with an interpretation of knowledge, formalised it to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical system - how do we make sense of this backwards
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation, ie treating the Kripke semantics as describing the 1st
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person appearance of time? You make no reference (or perhaps only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hints) in your Lille thesis - I never got around to downloading your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brussels thesis - is there something in that? or is it a more recent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; development.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Things are indeed explained, with much details in the Brussel's thesis. 
<br />
There is also new developments (Blok and Ysapia) but I have skipped 
<br />
them now: there is perhaps an infinity of first person notions between 
<br />
the &quot;quantum like&quot; to the classical one, and that could perhaps give a 
<br />
beginning of a description of a purely arithmetical decoherence 
<br />
phenomenon: a very fine grained description of the transformation from 
<br />
possibility into actuality from a sequence of intermediate first person 
<br />
point of views. For a  many-worlder this is a description of 
<br />
differentiations of worlds/states/histories/OMs...). The 
<br />
differentiation should lead to an internal coherent information flux 
<br />
.... I don't know. What is new also is that I have realised that the 
<br />
Shoenfinkel Curry Combinators (alias the Church lambda calculus) can 
<br />
provide big help to simplify the mathematical conjectures I have been 
<br />
led to, and that's progress, I guess.
