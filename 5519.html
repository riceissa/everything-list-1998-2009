Dear Bruno,

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to focus on one thing, but will interleave comments on the

rest..

</em><br />
my
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is good it is not your point because there are delay in Platonia,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at least in the sense I was using the word. A delay relative to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational state is the minimal number of step for the UD
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to come back on that state or its continuations (roughly speaking).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By the &quot;compiler theorem&quot; this make sense, and it is just a (computable)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number. It has nothing to to with the subjective time we will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be able to &quot;axiomatize&quot; once we define the first person, and it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing to do with the physical time which we will or will not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recover from the quantum logics (given by interviewing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the sound universal machine).
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this statement has me very puzzled! Platonia must include all
<br />
possible computational steps and even if we only consider computations as N
<br />
to N maps we will find that there exist minimal recursions (like Poincare
<br />
recursions where the computation returns to its initial state) that will be
<br />
infinitely long. These are the type of computations that I am troubled by,
<br />
computations that are attempts to solve NP-Complete problems.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of a delay is it when we have infinitely many steps? You seem
<br />
to have ignored what I wrote below.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am distinguishing subjective time from this &quot;delay&quot;! But I wonder if
<br />
you are not forgetting that Platonia is, by definition, timeless. Platonia
<br />
is given, to abuse words, all at once. It is eternal and without beginning
<br />
or end to its existence. Given this, it must be Complete and all inclusive.
<br />
Do you not agree?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;**I am trying to see how you deal with the problem of intractible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;computations - as implementable given infinite resources - and how it may
</em><br />
be
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;possible for measures to be defined using them. I had not considered this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;application but it is intriguing. ***

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Yes, but is this derivation on that can be taken to exist
</em><br />
independent of
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the first person aspect of comp histories?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     This may be one of my key difficulties. On one hand, I do not have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;problem with the idea of Platonic existence, re AR, of mathematical
</em><br />
objects
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;but I do have a problem with the seeming lack of a clear explanation of
</em><br />
how
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the &quot;flow of temporality &quot; arises in the first person aspect.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But we have not yet arrive at this point. Wait for S4Grz. You *will*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be delighted :)    (We will see ...).
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very interested in studying S4Grz!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     It seems to me that what ever our theory of Everything is, it must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;explain how it is not just possible to have a &quot;flow of temporality&quot;  a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;priori; it must have a non-measure zero sampling in the class of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;possible relationships between numbers - or whatever notion of Ur-object
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that one uses.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     I personaly eschew the notion of fundamental &quot;objects&quot; and use the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Heraclitian notion of Process and fundamental, thus I see mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;objects - numbers, etc. - as derivative of this notion of Process. I see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Hintikka's idea of proofs as game theoretical constructs as strongly
</em><br />
hinting
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;at this idea...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is really a matter of convenience, to take numbers, sets, or games.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But in general game theories, or set theories are richer and less simple
</em><br />
than
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elementary arithmetic. I don't think those dictinction are quite relevant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You will tell me ... after I make enough precise the result I got and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions I conjecture.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you know Conway game theory?  Where games are just a slight
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generalisation of his concept of number?
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but it has been some time ago that I studied Conway's idea. I do
<br />
recall that it intrigued me a great deal. What is your take on it?
<br />
<br />snip
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     I have been following your discussion with Kory (and all others)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;closely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     In an attempt to &quot;put all my cards on the table&quot; I will state that
</em><br />
my
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;idea is a kind of process based mind-body dualism (based on Vaughan
</em><br />
Pratt's
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;work <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/pratt95rational.html">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/pratt95rational.html</a>), but one that
</em><br />
becomes
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;very similar to Russell's &quot;neutral monism&quot; in the limit of &quot;the Totality
</em><br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Existence&quot;, which I believe is the same as your Platonia, e.g. an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;asymptotically vanishing dualism. I do not see Platonia as being
</em><br />
&quot;mental&quot;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;or &quot;mind&quot;, ala a new form of Berkeliean Idealism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can guess similarities indeed.  But (I told you this before) Pratt's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paper are hard, and the relation with mind and bodies is implicit, nowhere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does him really tackle the m/b problem.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pratt explains his idea in great detail in the above referenced paper
<br />
and in several other places on his website. But it seems that his idea is
<br />
very hard to comprehend. It boils down to solving the problem of how minds
<br />
interact with minds and bodies with bodies, this after he proposes a way to
<br />
mathematically represent both. Perhaps you missed that part of his work...
<br />
;-)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMHO, there are some important details left unfinished in Pratt's work,
<br />
mainly the &quot;forgetful&quot; mapping but I am confident that that will be solved
<br />
in the proper season.
<br />
<br /><br />Kindest regards,
<br />
<br />Stephen
