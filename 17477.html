<br />Hi Rex
<br />
<br />Recalling your interest in Chalmers: I was re-reading &quot;Facing Up to
<br />
the Problem of Consciousness&quot; recently, and I  realised - I think for
<br />
the first time - that his own &quot;double-aspect theory of information&quot; is
<br />
effectively a reformulation, in less 'professionally-embarrassing'
<br />
lingo, of eastern metaphysics!   AFAICS he's basically saying that a)
<br />
'intrinsic' existence is qualitative; and b) the 'physical' is based
<br />
on second-order 'causal relations' derived from an 'extrinsic'
<br />
viewpoint embedded in a).  It's worth quoting his short excursion into
<br />
metaphysical speculation at the end:
<br />
<br />&quot;This could answer a concern about the causal relevance of experience
<br />
- a natural worry, given a picture on which the physical domain is
<br />
causally closed, and on which experience is supplementary to the
<br />
physical.&quot;
<br />
<br />Hm...  Worrying indeed!  He goes on to say:
<br />
<br />&quot;The informational view allows us to understand how experience might
<br />
have a subtle kind of causal relevance in virtue of its status as the
<br />
intrinsic nature of the physical. This metaphysical speculation is
<br />
probably best ignored for the purposes of developing a scientific
<br />
theory, but in addressing some philosophical issues it is quite
<br />
suggestive.&quot;
<br />
<br />Of course, he could as well have said:
<br />
<br />&quot;The informational view allows us to understand how the physical might

<br />
theory, but in addressing some philosophical issues it is quite
<br />

<br />
<br />So IOW the &quot;subtle causal relevance&quot; of what he terms the intrinsic is
<br />
in constituting what exists.  Not so subtle perhaps ;-)  And the - no
<br />
doubt equally subtle? - relevance of the extrinsic is in being the
<br />
shareable account of what happens after that.  I guess one might
<br />
indeed find this &quot;suggestive&quot;!

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;I exist&quot; could be, perhaps, tautological. But &quot;Reality&quot;? I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; think so. Certainly not from inside.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is reality, beyond our conscious experience of existence?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The conclusion will be that consciousness, or anything apprehended by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a person in some stable way has to be realted to an infinity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relations between numbers. And most are not &quot;caused&quot; by a rule-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; following system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given an infinity of relations between numbers to work with, wouldn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pretty much everything be representable?  If so, then what is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significance of being able to represent the contents of our conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience, including a represention of our lack of comprehension as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to &quot;how a symbolic self-representing relation individuate into an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incommunicable, non doubtable, lived qualia&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact, here, this pen on my desk.  To me, that pen now represents my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lack of comprehension as to how a symbolic self-representing relation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individuates into an incommunicable, non doubtable, lived qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There, that wasn't so hard.  What is the significance of this?  If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's no significance to my pen representing this, then what is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significance of using relations between numbers to represent the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; So I can (sort of) see how a logical machine might symbolically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; represent reality in this way.  BUT, this doesn't answer the question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; of why there should be a conscious experience associated with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; machine symbolically representing reality this way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Does it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It does not. That is why it is the assumption of the theory. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; working hypothesis. The light in the dark.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay this is related to my point above and is the core of my problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with your view, and with physicalism due to it's similar assumption.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And then, the beauty of it, is that, ONCE the assumption is done, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can understand fully and rationally why we cannot understand how a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; symbolic self-representing relation individuate into an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; incommunicable, non doubtable, lived qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your &quot;understanding&quot; boils down to:  here is a mathematical model that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; represents our situation, and which may have some practical use in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predicting what we will observe in the future.  Why will it correctly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predict what we observe?  Because that's the way things are.  Will it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always predict what we will observe?  Well, either it will or it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; won't.  We can't know in advance.  We'll see.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What we CAN be sure of is that with an infinity of relations between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers at our disposal, if at some point we observe something that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistent with the predictions of this model, we can find a NEW
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model that is consistent with both old and new observations!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, please see my last response to Brent about subjective explanations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and virtual-gas, I think it's relevant!
