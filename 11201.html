<br />
Hi all,
<br />
<br />About the question by Stathis:  &quot;does any piece of matter implement all 
<br />
computations&quot;, after reflection I would say that both comp and the 
<br />
quantum should answer in the positive.
<br />
First in reasonable quantum field theories, the vacuum is already 
<br />
turing universal (and 1-person relatively unstable with Everett). Also 
<br />
to compute the probability that the piece of vacuum O go from state O 
<br />
to state O you have to compute the (amplitude of) probabilty that O go 
<br />
to C and that C go to 0, and this for *any* C, so that strictly 
<br />
speaking you have to take into account the infinity of white rabbit 
<br />
histories where for going from 0 to 0 the vaccum go toward the ten 
<br />
thousands big bangs and crunches and other brane collisions (modulo 
<br />
time question).
<br />
<br />That is why both with comp and with the quantum we met infinities and 
<br />
we take a look for renormalization strategies.
<br />
<br />For example in string theory when you describe the &quot;vacuum&quot; state Zero 
<br />
(of the relativistic open quantum string) you have to sum on a 
<br />
reasonable combination of creation and annihilation operators (as 
<br />
usual)  but you have to add, actually,  some shift which you hope to be 
<br />
equal to minus one if you want the string spectrum to include the 
<br />
massless photon, but instead of -1, string theory gives 1/2(D - 2)(1 + 
<br />
2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + ...), where D is the dimension of the brane 
<br />
(26). If that does not look like an infinity.
<br />
But here the String theorist are lucky because number theorist knew 
<br />
already that *in the complex plane* the sum of the gaussian integers 1 
<br />
+ 2 + ... = (1 + 0i) + (2 + 0i) + ... is equal to the value of Riemann 
<br />
Zeta function on -1 zeta(-1), and this can be computed (by analytical 
<br />
extension) and it gives -1/12 (fractional and negative!). But so there 
<br />
are massless photon in the open string spectrum!  (cf: zeta(s), s 
<br />
complex number, is equal to (the provably unique analytical extension) 
<br />
of the sum of the inverse of the natural numbers n up to s = Sum 1/n^s. 
<br />
Euler showed us that this sum is deeply related to the prime numbers. 
<br />
Hope you all recall that a^(-1) = 1/a.
<br />
<br />Why do I talk about string theory now?
<br />
<br />Remember the two &quot;ontic&quot; theories. I have already described two of 
<br />
them: Robinson Arithmetic and the COMBINATORS. Their are ontologically 
<br />
equivalent, and there are many others such theories. But the choice of 
<br />
representation is important once we want to extract efficiently 
<br />
information on the possible person views (plotinus hypostases).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Robinson Arithmetic is important because it makes the Universal 
<br />
Dovetailer &quot;discourse&quot; part of the much richer lobian discourse, and 
<br />
that makes it possible to keep track of the difference between *true* 
<br />
and *provable* (arithmetical) propositions. In Plotinus term it keep 
<br />
tracks of the difference between earth and the divine.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- COMBINATORS is important because it gives a very fine grained on the 
<br />
computations making it possible to sum up classical physics and quantum 
<br />
physics in a very rough but illuminating way: classical physics = no 
<br />
kestrel, quantum physics = no starlings: i.e. no loss and no creation 
<br />
of information. This leads to a BCI combinator algebra with genuine 
<br />
linear epistemic extension (and modelizable by symmetrical monoidal 
<br />
categories).
<br />
<br />- Now, for the measure corresponding to the 3-physical point of view 
<br />
(the arithmetical fourth hypostase, &quot;intelligible matter&quot;, the first 
<br />
person plural) I think, since I have finished Matiyasevich's book(*), 
<br />
that the diophantine representation could be used to provide a shortcut 
<br />
to the 3-person physics, actually (like I said once) by the study of 
<br />
(irreducible presentations of) the groups of permutations (on some 
<br />
fields) keeping the roots of an universal (in turing sense, and more 
<br />
general with CT) diophantine polynomial. See the summary of the ontic 
<br />
theory (of everything) representation below.
<br />
<br />Now each time I think (this includes reading books, goggeling ...) 
<br />
about those diophantine equations I am driven toward those modular 
<br />
functions and modular forms, which are basic tools in &quot;advanced number 
<br />
theory&quot; (like the one used to settle Fermat for example, a very famous 
<br />
diophantine problem. I guess the mathematically inclined everythinger 
<br />
has heard about those modular forms.
<br />
<br />But did you heard about Monstrous Moonshine? This is incredible and 
<br />
nobody told me!
<br />
It appears that the coefficient of the most &quot;basic&quot; modular form (big 
<br />
integer, like 196883) are related to the dimension of the irreducible 
<br />
representation (complex matrices) of the
<br />
element of the Monster (the bigger simple finite &quot;sporadic&quot; group, 
<br />
where sporadic means that it belongs to the 26 weird finite simple 
<br />
groups which cannot be put in any reasonable classification (a simple 
<br />
group is to a group what a prime number is to a number).
<br />
<br />Like in the Polya Hilbert story that relation has been the object of a 
<br />
conjecture. Conway conjectured it  in a mathematically precise manner 
<br />
by conjecturing the existence of some &quot;graded algebra&quot; relating the 
<br />
Monster and the modular form, but unlike the Polya Hilbert conjecture 
<br />
about Riemann,  this one has been solved, by its student Borcheds (he 
<br />
got the medal field for that).
<br />
And it appears that the genuine graded algebra has been found through a 
<br />
direct inspiration of string theory. Indeed, apparently (I am still 
<br />
discovering this) the algebra is at least a precise algebraical &quot;toy&quot; 
<br />
string theory.
<br />
<br />This gives two good news for the string theorists:
<br />
1) if their loose their job in physics, they will be welcomed in Number 
<br />
Theory!
<br />
2) if comp is true, and if string theory is true, string should 
<br />
(re)emerge in the first person plural (fourth) hypostases, and this can 
<br />
be related to the irreducible representation of permutation group of 
<br />
universal polynomial's roots, probably on all number theoretical rings 
<br />
and fields. Somehow string theory suggests that the &quot;many world&quot; idea 
<br />
extends itself to the many number systems, many topologies, ...
<br />
Greg Egan was correct with his permutation idea, but Adams is false, 42 
<br />
is not the solution of the riddle of the universe, it is definitely 24 
<br />
which plays some weird but big role here. I am looking to see if that 
<br />
24 is related to the 24 from Ramanujan partition formula. I think so.
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br /><br /><br />APPENDICE:
<br />
<br />The ontic theory: three equivalent representations (sketched):
<br />
<br />1) RA (Robinson Arithmetic)
<br />
Classical logic + the successor axioms + the recursive definition of 
<br />
addition + the recursive definition of multiplication (formalisable in 
<br />
first order predicate logic, see Podnieks page). I have already give 
<br />
you the formal presentation.
<br />
<br />Advantage: RA is turing equivalent and at the same time a subtheory of 
<br />
all correct lobian machine discourse, like Peano Arithmetic PA which is 
<br />
RA + the induction axioms.
<br />
In this representation universal computability is a weak subcase of 
<br />
provability.
<br />
The &quot;B&quot; in the description of the hypostases is for Godel's translation 
<br />
of provability *in* PA, i.e. in term of addition and multiplication of 
<br />
numbers. By Solovay theorem we inheritate the two modal logics G and G* 
<br />
formalising the propositionnal level of self-correctness. It is here 
<br />
that we get the 8 hypostases:
<br />
<br />ONE:                                            p (does not split)
<br />
INTELLECT:                              Bp    (split by G* minus G)
<br />
SOUL:                                         Bp &amp; p  (does not split)
<br />
INTELLIGIBLE MATTER:        Bp &amp; Dp   (split by G* minus G)
<br />
SENSIBLE MATTER:               Bp &amp; Dp &amp; p   (split by G* minus G)
<br />
<br />You can call them Truth, Reason, Knowledge, Observation and Feeling if 
<br />
you prefer, but please keep the G/G* splitting in mind.
<br />
<br /><br />2) COMBINATORS:
<br />
They give a quasi-algebraical ontic toe with interesting categories as 
<br />
models. From some related point of view, their little cousin LAMBDA 
<br />
EXPRESSION are better at the job.
<br />
Suitable for the structure of computations (as opposed to 
<br />
computability). Two important version emerge, the SK and the BCI, but 
<br />
the second is not turing universal and is supposed to describe the 
<br />
&quot;uncrashable&quot; (and thus non universal) rock-bottom physical reality.
<br />
<br />a) With kestrel and starlings: (Eyes closed, SK quasi-algebra)
<br />
<br />Axioms:
<br />
Kxy = x
<br />
Sxyz = xy(xz)
<br />
<br />Rules: (no need of classical logic!). Just the rules:
<br />
<br />- you can infer x = x
<br />
- from x = y and y = z, you can infer x = z
<br />
- from x = y you can infer y = x
<br />
- from x = y you can infer xz = yz
<br />
- from x = y you can infer zx = zy
<br />
<br />b) Without kestrel and starling (Eyes open, BCI algebra)
<br />
<br />Axioms:
<br />
Bxyz = x(yz)
<br />
Cxyz = xzy
<br />
Ix = x
<br />
<br />Same rules of inference.
<br />
<br />(careful BCI-algebra are not turing universal, unlike SK or BCK), the 
<br />
epistemic extension is needed, it gives a sort of &quot;dual point of view&quot;.
<br />
<br />Explanations:
<br />
See my old post on this, + my last (Elsevier) paper. Note that this is 
<br />
post thesis material. Like what follows:
<br />
<br /><br />3) Universal diophantine equation. See Matiyasevich's book.
<br />
The diophantine set are exactly the Wi of the recursion scientist, by 
<br />
Matiyasevic result(*).
<br />
Like there is a universal Wu, there is a universal diophantine 
<br />
polynomial Pu. Some of its parameter can be used for coding any turing 
<br />
set or function in term of its roots or through its positive values.
<br />
For example for precise integer values on some of its parameters such a 
<br />
polynomial has all and only all prime numbers as value.
<br />
This is really the golden bridge between number theory and recursion 
<br />
theory (alias computer science).
<br />
And Monstrous Moonshine (see above, see more on this with Google) seems 
<br />
to be a promising bridge between number theory, algebra, topology and 
<br />
... physics.
<br />
<br />(*) See Matiyasevich's book &quot;Hilbert's Tenth Problem&quot;. The MIT Press, 
<br />
1993. Third printing 1996. That book is a total chef-d'oeuvre. It is, 
<br />
given on a plate,  the bridge between number theory (Diophantine 
<br />
equation) and recursion theory.
<br />
<br />PS: part of this post has been written some time ago. Since then I have 
<br />
read (quickly, not doing all exercices!) the marvellous book by Terry 
<br />
Gannon &quot;Moonshine beyond the Monster: The Brigde Connecting Algebra, 
<br />
Modular Forms and Physics (Cambridge Monograph on Mathematical 
<br />
Physics). Superb, very well written, but expensive (130 $). 
<br />
Unexpectedly perhaps, Gannon is a Many-Worlder!
<br />
For String Theory, Barton Zwiebach's book &quot;A first course in String 
<br />
Theory&quot; remains the more readable.
<br />
Of course, to read such books you have to love the numbers a bit ...
<br />
Louis Kauffman's book &quot;Knots and Physics&quot; remains quite genuine in this 
<br />
context (cf my older post on knot theory, Yetter, etc.).
