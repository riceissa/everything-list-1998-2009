Hi Bruno and everybody,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hope to send my comments and/or 'OK' sign :-) on Monday.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Take it easy. There is no deadline on the list.
</em><br />
<br />Making a declaration helps me to get things done. Yet I'm late. Whenever 
<br />
you see such sentences in my posts, you can skip it, they are mostly for 
<br />
me :-)
<br />
<br />---------------
<br />
I'll try to write a summary in my own words. Let's see how much I did
<br />
understand.
<br />
<br />Prepositions:
<br />
A  .... finite alphabet
<br />
A* .... finite words over A  (it is enumerable, moreover effectively
<br />
enumerable)
<br />
L ..... a language over A.
<br />
E  .... a subset of A*, a set of valid expressions in L  (obviously, it
<br />
is at least enumerable)
<br />
M ..... a machine which understands to L
<br />
f ..... a total function from N to N.
<br />
<br />Goal: I want to develop a universal language L which describes all
<br />
and only all functions f. Given an expression from E, M computes the
<br />
result in finite time. Given the restrictions on L, the result is a
<br />
number and nothing else.
<br />
<br />The set of all functions f from N to N is not enumerable (by Cantor's
<br />
diagonal). Thus there is no bijection to E. Thus, I have to find a
<br />
smaller set of functions. I will call this set a set of computable
<br />
functions, C. Inevitably, this is computability by definition, by
<br />
definition of L. So L should be 'really good' in order to encompass as
<br />
much functions f from N to N as possible.
<br />
<br /><br />Now, I think of a bijection between E and C.
<br />
0 --- E_0 ~ f_0
<br />
1 --- E_1 ~ f_1
<br />
2 --- E_2 ~ f_2
<br />
3 --- E_3 ~ f_3
<br />
....
<br />
....
<br />
<br />Since E are efficiently enumerable, C are efficiently enumerable as 
<br />
well. Yes, it might happen that f_i = f_j for i != j, but is does not 
<br />
matter as long as all unique f_i are in the enumeration.
<br />
<br />Time for the Kleene diagonal argument. Opps, a language L that I dreamt 
<br />
of does not exist. I have to relax from the condition that M on E_i 
<br />
always return a number in a finite time. Well, what to return if not a 
<br />
number ... nothing -&gt; M experiences an infinite loop.
<br />
<br />What a world, ok, my language has to describe total functions from N to 
<br />
N and as well as strict partial functions from N to N. And it is clear 
<br />
that I cannot know whether E_i corresponds to a total function or a 
<br />
strict partial function. f' stands for any function descriable by L.
<br />
<br />0 --- E_0 ~ f'_0
<br />
1 --- E_1 ~ f'_1
<br />
2 --- E_2 ~ f'_2
<br />
3 --- E_3 ~ f'_3
<br />
....
<br />
....
<br />
<br />N, E and C are enumerable, moreover obviously effectively enumerable. 
<br />
Any subset of C is at least enumerable. A subset of C corresponding to 
<br />
total functions is no effectively enumerable. It cannot be.
<br />
<br />Well, a language L which describes both total and strict partial 
<br />
functions and hereby defines a set of computable functions is not 
<br />
refuted by Kleene's diagonal.
<br />
<br />It is not obvious to me how strong sort of evidence that universal L 
<br />
exists, it is to survive Kleene's diagnonal. Droping an apple on the 
<br />
floor is in favor of Newton's law but not very convincing :-)
<br />
<br />Oh, now I realize that my question is actually weird. Since the set of 
<br />
computable functions is defined by L, and L is said to be universal if 
<br />
it describes exactly these functions - it is simple to develop a trivial 
<br />
L  -&gt; it defines a set of computable functions ... and of course 
<br />
universal L exists.
<br />
<br />In this sence a universal language L always exists. So I write it rather 
<br />
like this:
<br />
<br />If we develop many sufficiently different programming languages and they 
<br />
turn out to be all equivalent, it might convince me that the set of 
<br />
'computable functions' is fixed. Although, written like this I can think 
<br />
of educated (math) people who will tell me: This is all you have????
<br />
<br />So, what are like 2-3 most direct consequences of CT which make CT to 
<br />
seem rock-solid? Here I assume that CT basically says that the set of 
<br />
functions descriable by the lambda calculus is all what I can ever compute.
<br />
<br /><br />-------------
<br />
Regarding points 3)-5) of your summary, I am lost on terms such as
<br />
Absolute ontic TOE, Observer Moments, Aristotelian principles, Machine 
<br />
theology, ...
<br />
<br /><br />-------------
<br />
I wrote down a list of short-term goals on what I would like to have 
<br />
some background/knowledge with a help from this list:
<br />
<br /><br />1\ I saw somewhere a sentence saying approximately this:
<br />
&quot;.... so universe is performing a computation. Is then universe a big 
<br />
computer? No.&quot;
<br />
<br />I would like to know in a broad sense what it tries to say a why one 
<br />
shoud rather accept it or reject.
<br />
<br />2\ Bruno, you recently wrote that you do not agree with Wolfram's 
<br />
Principle of Computational Equivalence. As I understand to that 
<br />
principle, Wolfram says that universe is a big cellular automata. What 
<br />
is the evidence that it is unlikely this way?
<br />
<br /><br />Sincerely,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mirek
