Hi Godfrey

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am sorry I have not responded to you previously and I

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thank you for the further clarifications your provide

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unfortunately I don't feel I grasp it well enough

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to make any useful comment as to its contents.
</em><br />
<br />There is a recent thread I started &quot;An All/Nothing universe model&quot; that 
<br />
gives some of the model's recent development.  I can not access the archive 
<br />
right now so I can not give you a URL for the start of the thread.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; From what you say before it seems that you claim that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you derive YD, CT and AR from it which happen to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno's points of departure! Is that the case? Does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your All include false statements too?
</em><br />
<br />I do not derive YD, CT or AR.  The model is based on a list of properties 
<br />
that objects can have.  Definition divides this list into two sub 
<br />
lists.  The Nothing has the sole property &quot;empty&quot;, the All has all the 
<br />
remaining properties.  The list of course would have properties that seem 
<br />
incompatible as simultaneous properties of a single object, but 
<br />
nevertheless definitions create such objects as the &quot;is not&quot; member of the 
<br />
definitional pair.   So the All is - in total - self incompatible, but so 
<br />
what?
<br />
<br />It would seem that the All contains YD, CT, and AR since these are 
<br />
potential properties of objects and would be on the list.  I gave an 
<br />
example of a universe that seems compatible with these and seems to become 
<br />
more  compatible with our universe if one adds noise which is the result of 
<br />
the random dynamic.  The fact that YD may be incompatible with QM or any 
<br />
other item on the list is not relevant to the All but only to sequences of 
<br />
states of universes that are given instantations of reality by the dynamic.
<br />
<br />Thus if Bruno's reasoning from YD, CT, and AR is correct -  I am not one to 
<br />
judge - then the All would contain  potential sequences of universe states 
<br />
compatible with comp.  The noise causes such sequences to jump tracks here 
<br />
and there.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am asking this out of curiosity not because I see any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;obvious way of addressing the falsification of your model.
</em><br />
<br />As to falsifiability of my model I will try to list my assumptions, etc.:
<br />
<br />1) There exists a list [call it the Everything] of all possible properties 
<br />
of objects that can have reality.
<br />
<br />2) The list is divided into two sub lists by the process of definition 
<br />
[definition forms a definitional [is:is not] pair].
<br />
<br />3) The definition resulting in the [Nothing:All] definitional pair is 
<br />
unavoidable and thus this pair has  simultaneous existence with the list.
<br />
<br />It is then noted that the Nothing can not respond to any meaningful 
<br />
question about itself and there is such a question: Does it persist?  Thus 
<br />
the Nothing is incomplete.  The necessary attempt at resolution of this 
<br />
incompleteness by the Nothing by accessing [incorportating] parts of the 
<br />
list [a symmetry breaking?] results in a random dynamic within the All 
<br />
producing a randomly evolving Something [that which the Nothing has become 
<br />
by incorporating parts of the list] [an evolving universe].  But by #3 the 
<br />
Nothing must be restored so the process of creating randomly evolving 
<br />
Somethings repeats [a form of an MWI]. A random evolution can produce long 
<br />
strings of states of universes that can support Self Aware Structures 
<br />
[SAS], YD, comp etc.  [A state of a universe is one side of a definitional 
<br />
pair - a sub list, and I have in the past called sub lists &quot;kernels&quot; [of 
<br />
information] to tie in with some of my previous posts.]
<br />
<br />That is my model in a nut shell.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't want to sound like a big stickler for Popper or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anything but I am sure you are familiar with the infamous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;libel often directed at String Theory that &quot;it is not even false!&quot;
</em><br />
<br />I believe that particular description is actually more like &quot;that is not 
<br />
even wrong&quot; [citation unknown] and may be older than string theory.  In any 
<br />
event I think we should be careful how we use descriptions such as 
<br />
true/false, right /wrong, compatible/incompatible, in contradiction with, 
<br />
etc. because they seem to have different domains.  I am now interested in 
<br />
how you and Bruno use such terms re comp, YD, UDA, QM, MWI, etc.
<br />
<br />In that regard I think it is time you present your argument re YD/QM and 
<br />
see what the list has to say about it.
<br />
<br />Hal Ruhl
