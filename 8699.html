<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;We can argue about the precise definition of words, but I think a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;fundamental point is missed if religion and atheism are put on a par. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;is like the Christian fundamentalists' demand that &quot;creation science&quot; be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;taught in schools alongside evolutionary biology, because nobody can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;reasonably claim that evolutionary biology is *certainly* true and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;creation science&quot; *certainly* false.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;There is a clear difference between, on the one hand, believing x despite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the lack of any supporting evidence and, on the other hand, not believing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;x because of the lack of any supporting evidence - especially if x is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;something inherently bizarre or incredible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here you make a point. But this is because &quot;creation science&quot; is just not a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;science. Those who pretend it is a science are just doing rhetorical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tricks.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps one day &quot;creation science&quot; will appear. This would be the case if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;creation science&quot; (the doctrine that the best explanation for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;existence of the universe is that God has made it recently in less than 7 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;days) is made enough precise to not only be tested but to provide a best 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;overview of reality, etc. But of course today this is not the case, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;creation science&quot;, *as* a science is much more a like a fuzzy speculation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;predicting and actually explaining nothing. Their proponents just are no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;playing the game.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but this is the problem with belief in a personal God versus 
<br />
non-belief. Theism would be an empirical, or equivalently scientific, belief 
<br />
if its proponents were consistent: if God intervenes in the world, then by 
<br />
definition he must leave some evidence of this intervention. (The 
<br />
alternative believers' position is deism, the idea that God made the world 
<br />
but then refrained from any further interventions in its affairs. Deism has 
<br />
never really inspired religious devotion like theism has.) The reality is, 
<br />
however, that there is less evidence for religious beliefs than there is for 
<br />
most bizarre secular beliefs, such as the belief that Elvis is alive, or 
<br />
that aliens regularly abduct humans to experiment on them.
<br />
<br />It is worth stressing that what normally counts for religious belief (in the 
<br />
Western tradition) is *not* a vague deism, but very specific beliefs about a 
<br />
Personal God: for example, that he caused one third of himself to be born of 
<br />
a virgin so that he could live as a human and, though immortal and destined 
<br />
to rise again, die a horrible death in order to save  humans from being 
<br />
punished for Adam and Eve's original transgression against God in the Garden 
<br />
of Eden at the instigation of a snake which told Eve she and Adam would lose 
<br />
their ignorance if they ate the fruit of a certain forbidden (by God) tree; 
<br />
and that anyone who believes this and admits he is a miserable sinner will 
<br />
go to Heaven, while non-believers will suffer eternal torment in Hell. I 
<br />
mean, give me Elvis and aliens with anal probes any time...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, most people who says &quot;I don't believe in God&quot;, in general believe in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;physical or material&quot; universe; and that is still a sort of religious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;belief. Atheist are not just believer because they believe in 0 God, as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;George put it, but also because they replace God by something else, without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;really explaining what it is and how it helps us to figure what exist, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In my state of ignorance I would even say that for me GOD and UNIVERSE are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;both enough fuzzy that distinguishing them at the start could be a 1004 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fallacy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But, perhaps unlike some of you, I did not get any religious education, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all what I know in &quot;theology&quot; comes from study and experience, and all what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do appreciate in the Monism of the Jewish, Muslim and Christian 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theologies (but present also in some Chinese and Indian philosophical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;systems) seems to be the parts they have kept from the pre-Christian and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pre-Muslim neo-Platonician theology. Today's catholic theologians who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;insist too much on the quality in rigour of that type of theology get 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;trouble with the Roman Authority.
</em><br />
<br />If GOD and UNIVERSE are fuzzy and difficult to distinguish, you're very far 
<br />
from talking about the God of people who are religious.
