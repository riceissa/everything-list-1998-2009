<br />GOOD GRIEF.  Woodin may soon be up for *sainthood* among us
<br />
mathematical platonists.  Thanks, Stephen.
<br />
<br />Get a load of the following:
<br />
<br /><br />To Platonists, mathematical objects such as sets exist in an ideal mathematical world, and axiomatic systems are merely useful tools
<br />
for illuminating which statements about those objects are true in that world. To Platonists, the continuum hypothesis feels like a
<br />
concrete statement that should be true or false. To them, if the standard axioms can't settle the continuum hypothesis, it's not
<br />
that the hypothesis is a meaningless question, but rather that the axioms are insufficient.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From this point of view, Cohen's result indicates that mathematicians need to add to their roster of axioms about infinite sets.
</em><br />
There is a problem, however. An axiom should be so intuitively obvious that everyone agrees immediately that it's true. Yet
<br />
intuition quickly evaporates when confronted with questions about infinity.
<br />
<br />Infinite Elegance
<br />
<br />In the decades that followed Cohen's 1963 result, mathematicians trying to settle the continuum hypothesis ran into a roadblock:
<br />
While some people proposed new axioms indicating the continuum hypothesis was true, others proposed what seemed like equally good
<br />
axioms indicating the it false, Woodin says.
<br />
<br />Woodin decided to try a different tack. Instead of looking for the missing axiom, he gathered circumstantial evidence about what the
<br />
implications of that axiom would be. To do this without knowing what the axiom was, Woodin tried to figure out whether some axioms
<br />
are somehow better than others. A good axiom, he felt, should help mathematicians settle not only the continuum hypothesis but also
<br />
many other questions about Cantor's hierarchy of infinite sets.
<br />
<br />Mathematicians have long known that there is no all-powerful axiom that can answer every question about Cantor's hierarchy. However,
<br />
Woodin suspected a compromise is possible: There might be axioms that answer all questions up to the level of the hierarchy that the
<br />
continuum hypothesis concerns&#x2014;the realm of the smallest uncountably infinite sets. Woodin called such an axiom &quot;elegant.&quot;
<br />
<br />In a book-length mathematical argument that has been percolating through the set theory community for the last few years, Woodin has
<br />
proved&#x2014;apart from one missing piece that must still be filled in&#x2014;that elegant axioms do exist and, crucially, that every elegant
<br />
axiom would make the continuum hypothesis false.
<br />
<br />&quot;If there's a simple solution to the continuum hypothesis, it must be that it is false,&quot; Woodin says. And if it is false, then there
<br />
are indeed infinite sets bigger than the counting numbers and smaller than the real numbers.
<br />
<br />Woodin's novel approach of sidestepping the search for the right axiom doesn't conform to the way mathematicians thought the
<br />
continuum hypothesis would be settled, says Joel Hamkins of the City University of New York and Georgia State University in Atlanta.
<br />
<br />Mathematicians haven't yet absorbed the ramifications of Woodin's work fully enough to decide whether it settles the matter of the
<br />
continuum hypothesis, says Akihiro Kanamori of Boston University (Mass.). &quot;[It's] considered a very impressive achievement, but very
<br />
few people understand the higher reaches [of Woodin's framework],&quot; he says.
<br />
<br />Does Woodin himself believe that the continuum hypothesis is false? &quot;If anyone should have an opinion on this, I should, but even
<br />
I'm not sure,&quot; he answers. &quot;What I can say is that 10 years ago, I wouldn't have believed there was a chance the continuum
<br />
hypothesis was solvable. Now, I really think it has an answer.&quot;
