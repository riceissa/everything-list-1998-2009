<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Well, I do believe in continuity of consciousness, modulo the issues

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of measure.  That is, I think some continuations would be more likely to

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;each running one copy of me (all running the same program so they stay

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in sync), and one computer running a different copy of me, my current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;theory is that I would expect to experience the first version with 90%

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;probability.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Almost OK, but perhaps false if you put *the measure* on the (infinite)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computations going through those states. I mean, if the 9 computers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;running one copy of you just stop (in some absolute way I ask you to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conceive for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the benefit of the argument), and if the one computer running the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different copy, instead of stopping, is multiplied eventually into many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-distinguishable copies of you, then putting the measure on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;histories should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;make you expect to experience (and memorized) the second version more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probably.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is the idea I like to summarize in the following diagram:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;\        /                     |      |
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   \    /                       |      |
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     \/               =        |      |
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      |                         |      |
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      |                         |      |
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That is, it is like a &quot;future&quot; bifurcation enhances your present measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is why I think comp confirms Deutsch idea that QM branching is really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;QM differentiation. What do you think? I mean, do you conceive that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure could be put only on the &quot;maximal&quot; possible computations?

<br />This is an important point which I think people often miss about the QTI. It 
<br />
is sometimes spoken of as if the QTI only goes into effect at the moment you 
<br />
are about to die (and thus have no successor observer-moment), which would 
<br />
often require some fantastically improbable escape, like quantum tunneling 
<br />
away from a nearby nuclear explosion. But if later bifurcations can effect 
<br />
the first-person probability of earlier ones, this need not be the case.
<br />
<br />Consider this thought experiment. Two presidential candidates, let's say 
<br />
Wesley Clark and George W. Bush, are going to be running against each other 
<br />
in the presidential election. Two months before the election, I step into a 
<br />
machine that destructively scans me and recreates two copies in different 
<br />
locations--one copy will appear in a room with a portrait of George W. on 
<br />
the wall, the other copy will appear in a room with a portrait of Wesley 
<br />
Clark. The usual interpretation of first-person probabilities is that, all 
<br />
other things being equal, as the scanner begins to activate I should expect 
<br />
a 50% chance that the next thing I see will be the portrait of George W. 
<br />
appearing before me, and a 50% chance that it will be Wesley Clark.
<br />
<br />But suppose all other things are *not* equal--an additional part of the 
<br />
plan, which I have agreed to, is that following the election, the copy who 
<br />
appeared in the room with the winning candidate will be duplicated 999 
<br />
times, while the copy who appeared in the room with the losing candidate 
<br />
will not experience any further duplications. Thus, at any time after the 
<br />
election, 999 out of 1000 versions of me who are &quot;descended&quot; from the 
<br />
original who first stepped into the duplication machine two months before 
<br />
the election will remember appearing in the room with the candidate who 
<br />
ended up winning, while only 1 out of 1000 will remember appearing in the 
<br />
room with the losing candidate.
<br />
<br />The &quot;last minute&quot; theory of quantum immortality is based on the idea that 
<br />
first-person probabilities are based solely on the observer-moments that 
<br />
qualify as immediate successors to my current observer-moment, and this idea 
<br />
suggests that as I step into the duplication machine two months before the 
<br />
election, I should expect a 50% chance of appearing in the room with the 
<br />
portrait of the candidate who goes on to win the election. But as Bruno 
<br />
suggests, an alternate theory is that later bifurcations should be taken to 
<br />
influence the first-person probabilities of earlier bifurcations--under this 
<br />
&quot;anticipatory&quot; theory, I should expect only a 1 out of 1000 chance that I 
<br />
will appear in the room with the portrait of the losing candidate. This 
<br />
would lead to a weird sort of &quot;first-person precognition&quot;, where after the 
<br />
duplication but before the election, I'd have good reason to believe (from a 
<br />
first-person point of view) that I could predict the outcome with a high 
<br />
probability of being right. But this kind of prediction would be useless 
<br />
from a third-person point of view, since all outside observers would see two 
<br />
symmetrical copies who both seem equally certain that their candidate will 
<br />
be the winner. Of course this is not much stranger than the basic quantum 
<br />
immortality idea that if I am in some dangerous accident, most third-person 
<br />
observers will see me end up dead, while I have a close to 100% chance of 
<br />
surviving from a first-person POV.
<br />
<br />Applied to quantum immortality, this &quot;anticipatory&quot; idea suggests it would 
<br />
not be as if the universe is allowing events to go any which way right up 
<br />
until something is about to kill me, and then it steps in with some 
<br />
miraculous coincidence which saves me; instead, it would be more like the 
<br />
universe would constantly be nudging the my first-person probabilities in 
<br />
favor of branches where I don't face any dangerous accidents which require 
<br />
&quot;miracles&quot; in the first place. Of course since this would just be a 
<br />
probabilistic effect, I might still occasionally face accidents where I had 
<br />
to be very lucky to survive, but the lower the probability there is of 
<br />
surviving a particular type of accident, the less likely I am to experience 
<br />
events leading up to such an accident.
