</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;confusion.
</em><br />
<br />I agree that confusion often arises from not clearly stating one's implicit 
<br />
beliefs about consciousness, but I think it's actually useful to 
<br />
differentiate between 3 different positions here:
<br />
<br />1.  Consciousness is not &quot;real&quot;--our decision to call a system &quot;conscious&quot; 
<br />
or not is based only on subjective aesthetic criteria, like &quot;cuteness&quot; 
<br />
(Daniel Dennett's example).  The only facts about reality are third-person 
<br />
facts, in this view.
<br />
<br />2.  Consciousness is real, but the feeling of continuity of consciousness 
<br />
over time (the 'flow of related thoughts in time' above) is not.  In this 
<br />
view, only moments of experience exist, but nothing flows between these 
<br />
moments.
<br />
<br />3.  Consciousness is real, and so is continuity of consciousness over time.  
<br />
Proponents of this view may still believe that identity can split or merge 
<br />
though (think of many-worlds, or replicator experiments).
<br />
<br />As I said, I think a lot of the problem in consciousness-related debates is 
<br />
that people don't make their assumptions explicit.  For example, the 
<br />
&quot;quantum immortality&quot; idea looks quite plausible if you accept #3, given a 
<br />
few additional assumptions...but it's liable to seem pretty silly otherwise.
<br />
<br />Personally I think #3 is most likely.  If you accept #1, you're saying that 
<br />
consciousness should be *defined* as &quot;ability to pass the Turing Test,&quot; that 
<br />
there's no truth about whether it is like anything to be a given system or 
<br />
not.  I think that I would continue to be conscious even if everyone else 
<br />
thought I wasn't...but see Chalmers' &quot;The Conscious Mind&quot; for more arguments 
<br />
on why we should &quot;take consciousness seriously&quot; and reject #1.
<br />
<br />If you accept #2, you are saying that expectations of future outcomes are 
<br />
illusions.  &quot;I&quot; would have no more reason to fear being tortured tomorrow 
<br />
than to fear my twin's being tortured (although in both cases I would feel 
<br />
empathy for the victim).  Likewise, if I was about to be replicated it would 
<br />
be meaningless to wonder if I was going to &quot;become&quot; the original or the 
<br />
copy.
<br />
<br />I have a lot of sympathy for #2 though--it's certainly true that &quot;I think 
<br />
therefore I am&quot; applies only to the present moment, and that memories are 
<br />
just another type of experience I can have right *now*.  But even the 
<br />
Buddhists, whose philosophy carries strong echoes of the &quot;only the present 
<br />
exists&quot; idea, also talk about the difference between absolute truth and 
<br />
relative truth.  Identity-over-time may not be true in the absolute sense, 
<br />
but it's generally seen as being true in the relative sense, just like the 
<br />
distinction between &quot;my&quot; consciousness and &quot;yours&quot; (which advocates of #2 
<br />
assume is real).
<br />
<br />If we ever develop a &quot;theory of consciousness&quot; in the sense that Chalmers 
<br />
talks about, it's not so unreasonable to imagine it would quantify some 
<br />
measure of &quot;similarity&quot; between distinct moment-of-consciousness-patterns, 
<br />
which we might interpret as giving the probability of &quot;becoming&quot; one version 
<br />
or another in a replicator experiment (such a theory would be especially 
<br />
useful in the case of imperfect copies).
<br />
<br />I'd be interested to hear other people's opinions about which view is most 
<br />
plausible, though.
<br />
<br />Jesse Mazer
