&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally got to read Maudlin's full paper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was surprised that, since he makes the argument that he does,
<br />
that he was aware that (and emphasizes) that information transmission does
<br />
not require any physical activity.  (A lack of being sent a 1 means a 0.)
<br />
In fact this is the whole basis for his argument: for him consciousness
<br />
must require more activity than is needed for information transmission.  I
<br />
fail to see how he could hold such a point of view.  A computer processes
<br />
information.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me offer an alternative approach to the Maudlin/Marchal implementation

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question which is consistent with computationalism but avoids some of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the difficulties.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computationalism says that implementation of a certain class of algorithms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is necessary and sufficient for consciousness.  Maudlin presents an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment where a seemingly minor and (he argues) irrelevant change makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the difference between whether a conscious computation is implemented
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However to conclude that Maudlin's change (adding an inert block) makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness go away (even assuming computationalism) is a fallacy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We agree that the initial computation (sans block) is conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We agree that adding the block changes the computation (by changing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterfactual behavior).  But we cannot conclude from this that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resulting computation is not conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The new configuration, with the block, implements a different computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than without (if you take counterfactuals into consideration).  But have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we proven that this new computation is not conscious?  No!  All we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proven is that this is different from the computation we started with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But more than one computation can be conscious, obviously.  It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceivable that the new computation, although different, is conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as well.  This is a possible escape from Maudlin's argument.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with this objection to Maudlin as well.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assume that the device implements the following computation: If
<br />
the initial state of the Turing-like machine is X, or if it is any state
<br />
which a Turing machine would pass through if started in state X, then the
<br />
computer will enter the next state in that series; otherwise it will halt.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the floats (blocked add-on machines can be added but are
<br />
irrelevant, the floats can just pull a string) it would seem that
<br />
Maudlin's machine can implement such a computation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a computation can still be very nontrivial.  As a simple
<br />
example X can be a program to calculate pi.  I would think that if a
<br />
Turing machine started with program X would be conscious, then such a
<br />
modified program would also be.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objection will now be raised that, as Maudlin thinks, the
<br />
physical system he describes is too simple to be conscious.  This is not
<br />
neccessarily true.  A Turing machine is not that complicated to begin
<br />
with.  For example, after the spout passes a trough, if (((it was already
<br />
full) and (there was no empting trigger)) or (the spout was unblocked))
<br />
then (the trough will be full) else (it will not be).  The fact is there
<br />
are logic gates all over the place, at least in that view of it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unlike Chalmers' clock and dial, Maudlin's example certainly
<br />
raises no threat of panpsychism.  His device is quite complicated and
<br />
unlikely to exist in nature.  It is also clear that the device has encoded
<br />
in it a lot of information about the computation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno, I think it is now abundently clear that Maudlin's paper
<br />
does not rule out physical computationalism, and other people on the list
<br />
have seen that as well.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the 'movie' angle?  Would a device that replayed a
<br />
given series of states implement a computation?  For example, suppose
<br />
there is a two dimensional grid on which are layed out the values (0 or 1)
<br />
of each bit that would be encountered in the computation as a function of
<br />
position (x) and time step (t).  Now take a long bar, parrallell to x, and
<br />
send it across the grid at constant velocity.  Define the state of the
<br />
system to be the sequence of bits under the bar.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously it would be a problem if such a system implemented the
<br />
computation.  The bar plays almost no role so one would have little choice
<br />
but to say it is irrelevant, thus that a static picture could be conscious
<br />
(rejecting computationalism).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding a third dimension one could even have one such sheet for
<br />
every possible initial condition of the machine, stacked on top of each
<br />
other.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately this is rather different from Maudlin's example and it
<br />
does not compute except in the clock and dial sense, according to my
<br />
proposal.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW I have realized for unrelated reasons that my proposal needs
<br />
modification.  I will work on it when I am able.
