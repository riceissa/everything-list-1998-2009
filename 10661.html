<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Exactly. And if non-phsyical systems (Plato' Heaven) don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; implement counterfactuals, then they can't run programmes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and if Plato's heaven can't run programmes, it can't be running us as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; programmes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would say that only non-physical system implement counterfactuals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A counterfactual is somethingthat could have happened, but didn't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A static, immaterial systems can only handle counterfactuals by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turning them into factuals -- everything that can happen does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen. It can fully capture the *conditional* structure of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programme,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (unlike a &quot;recording&quot;) at the expense of not being a process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A programme is not the same thing as a process.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I agree. Like a corpse is not the same as a life.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computationalism refers to real, physical processes running on material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computers.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Words like &quot;real&quot;, &quot;physical&quot; &quot;material&quot; needs to be (re)defined or at 
<br />
least clarify in front of the UDA.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Proponents of the argument need to show that the causality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and dynamism are inessential (that there is no relevant difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between process and programme) before you can have consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implemented Platonically.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say there is no relevant difference, from the first person 
<br />
point of view, between a process in a &quot;real universe&quot; and a relative 
<br />
computation in Platonia.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To exist Platonically is to exist eternally and necessarily. There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no time or changein Plato's heave.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All partial recursive solutions of Schroedinger or Dirac equation 
<br />
exists in Platonia, and define through that &quot;block description&quot; notion 
<br />
of internal time quite analogous to Everett subjective probabilities.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Therefore, to &quot;gain entry&quot;, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational mind will have to be translated from a running process
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into something static and acausal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One route is to replace the process with a programme. After all, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programme does specify all the possible counterfactual behaviour, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is basically a string of 1's and 0's, and therefore a suitabale
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occupant of Plato's heaven. But a specification of counterfactual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour is not actual counterfactual behaviour. The information is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same, but they are not the same thing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />A program is basically the same as a number. A process or a computation 
<br />
is a finite or infinite sequence of numbers (possibly branching, and 
<br />
defined relatively to a universal numbers).
<br />
The UD build all such (branching) sequences.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No-one would believe that a brain-scan, however detailed, is conscious,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; so not computationalist, however ardent, is required to believe that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; progamme on a disk, gathering dust on a shelf, is sentient, however
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good a piece of AI code it may be!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another route is &quot;record&quot; the actual behaviour, under some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circumstances of a process, into a stream of data (ultimately, a string
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of numbers, and therefore soemthing already in Plato's heaven).
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK then.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; route loses the conditonal structure, the counterfactuals that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vital to computer programmes and therefore to computationalism.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not in the &quot;all computations&quot; view.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computer programmes contain conditional (if-then) statements. A given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; run of the programme will in general not explore every branch. yet the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unexplored branches are part of the programme. A branch of an if-then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement that is not executed on a particular run of a programme will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constitute a counterfactual, a situation that could have happened but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; didn't. Without counterfactuals you cannot tell which programme
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (algorithm) a process is implementing because two algorithms could have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same execution path but different unexecuted branches.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The UD generates all such branching sequences. And the non triviality 
<br />
of computer science gives reasons to add different relative weigh on 
<br />
the branches (already like the MWI).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since a &quot;recording&quot; is not computation as such, the computationalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need not attribute mentality to it -- it need not have a mind of its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own, any more than the characters in a movie.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Right.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Another way of looking at this is via the Turing Test; a mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recording would never pass a TT since it has no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; condiitonal/counterfactual behaviour and therfore cannot answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unexpected questions).
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK (but not quite relevant imo, because I can attribute a mind to a 
<br />
sleeping person, although it lacks inputs and outputs).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That counterfactuality is the essence of (immaterial) comp. Although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; here Russell has a point: the quantum multiverse seems to handle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; counterfactual.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Multiverse theories seek to turn the 3rd-person &quot;X could have happened
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but didn't&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into the 1st-person &quot;X could have been observed by me, but wasn't&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Now if comp is correct, I cannot distinguish a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;genuine&quot; quantum multiverse from any of its emulation in Platonia,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A quantum multiverse is sitll only a tiny corner of Platonia.
</em><br />
<br /><br />A priori. But if the quantum hypothesis is correct, and if comp is 
<br />
correct, the multiverse is a point of view related to the *whole* of 
<br />
the arithmetical platonia.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physical many-world theories have resources to keep counterfactuals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unobserved that immaterial MW-theories lack (including the simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of one that many mathematical possibilities do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist physically).
</em><br />
<br /><br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For instance, even if their are two informationally identical me's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in different branches of a phsycial universe, it is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inevitable that any sharing or corss-over of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consicousness would occur, because in  a phsyical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, cosnciousness would have something other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than informational structures to supervene on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus me might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well be able to tell that we are in a quantum multiverse rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonia, on the basis that we just do not observe enough weirdness.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, that is almost exactly the point of the UDA. Comp is testable by 
<br />
comparing the weight on the branches with the weight on the empirically 
<br />
infered branches.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Too broad: If I am just a mathematical structure, I should have a much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wider range of experience than I do. There is a mathemtical structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding to myself with all my experiences up to time T. There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a vast array of mathematical structures corresponding to other versions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of me with having a huge range of experiences -- ordinary ones, like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuing to type, extraordinary ones like seeing my computer sudenly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turn into bowl of petunias. All these versions of me share the memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the &quot;me&quot; who is writing this, so they all identify themselves as me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remember, that for mathematical monism it is only necessary that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible experience has a mathematical description. This is known as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the White Rabbit problem. If we think in terms of multiverse theories,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we would say that there is one &quot;me&quot; in this universe and other &quot;me's&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in other universes,a nd they are kept out of contact with each other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question is whether a purely mathematical scheme has enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resources to impose isolation or otherwise remove the White Rabbit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right. And at first sight there will be too many white rabbits. But 
<br />
then, by linking the 1-comp indeterminacy with the &quot;indexical&quot; godelian 
<br />
form of incompleteness in the manner of the lobian interview, we see 
<br />
that computer science apparently has the resource to enhance local 
<br />
&quot;normality&quot;. Even Gaussian one. That's my whole point indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Too narrow: there are a number of prima-facie phenomena which a purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical approach struggles to deal with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessity/contingency
</em><br />
<br /><br />You say so.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why space ? It is tempting to think that if a number of, or some other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical entity, occurs in a set with other numbers, that is, as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were, a &quot;space&quot; which is disconnected from other sets, so that a set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forms a natural model of an *isolated* universe withing a multiverse, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe which does not suffer from the White Rabbit problem. However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maths per se does not work that way. The number &quot;2&quot; that appears in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of even numbers is exactly the same number &quot;2&quot; that appears in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list of numbers less than 10. It does not acquire any further
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characteristics from its context.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. Any isolate mathematical structure would no more explain 
<br />
&quot;space-consciousness&quot; than a single real physical universe. The first 
<br />
person is distributed in all mathematical structure sufficiently rich 
<br />
to support the corresponding version of the 3-person. Any stable first 
<br />
person experience have to take into account that distribution.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The time issue should be obvious. Mathematics is tradionally held to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deal with timeless, eternal truths. This is reflected in the metpahor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of mathematical truth being discovered not found (which, in line with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my criticism of Platonism, should not be taken to seriously). It could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be objected that physics can model time mathematically; it can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objected right back that it does so by spatialising time, by turning it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into just another dimension, in which nothing really changes, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing passes. Some even go so far as to insist that this model is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what time &quot;really&quot; is, which is surely a case of mistaking the map for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the territory.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right. I don't have that problem in the sense that comp indeed will 
<br />
identify some &quot;map&quot; with some &quot;territory&quot;. It is one thing to be 
<br />
cautious not confusing map and territory, and another thing to pretend 
<br />
map are always everywhere different from a territory. By Brouwer fixed 
<br />
point theorem everybody knows that a map embedded continuously *in* a 
<br />
territory will have a fixed point where the point on the map is 
<br />
identical with the &quot;point&quot; in the territory. This is an image, but this 
<br />
is exactly what happens in all the fixed point theorem of computer 
<br />
science. Saying &quot;yes&quot; to a doctor is already possible only through 
<br />
accepting that an &quot;artificial brain&quot; will preserve the &quot;real thing&quot; 
<br />
(you).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consciousness is a problem for all forms of materialism and physicalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to some extent, but it is possible to discern where the problem is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particularly acute. There is no great problem with the idea that matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered as a bare substrate can have mental properities.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Panpsychism ? An electron would be conscious? Why do you think there 
<br />
are neurons in brains?
<br />
Why do you think there are genes in cells? Do you think they are only 
<br />
amplifiers of particle's mind.
<br />
Note that this would not a priori contradict comp per se, it would only 
<br />
make the substitution level very low.  (Unlikely imo, but that is not 
<br />
relevant for our discussion).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inability to have mental properties would itself be a property and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore be inconsistent with the bareness of a bare substrate. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;subjectivity&quot; of conscious states, often treated as &quot;inherent&quot; boils
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down to a problem of communicating one's qualia -- how one feels, how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things seem. Thus it is not truly inherent but depends on the means of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication being used. Feelings and seemings can be more readily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicated in artistic, poetic language, and least readily in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific, technical language. Since the harder, more technical a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science is, the more mathematical it is, the communication problem is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at its most acute in a purely mathematical langauge. Thus the problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with physicalism is not its posit of matter (as a bare substrate) but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its other posit, that all properties are physical. Since physics is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical, that amounts to the claim that all properties are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical (or at least mathematically describable). In making the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transition from a physicalist world-view to a mathematical one, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of a material substrate is abandoned (although it was never a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem for consciousness) and the posit of mathematical properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; becomes, which is a problem for consciousness becomes extreme.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Why?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The interesting thing is that these two problems can be used to solve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each other to some extent. if we allow extra-mathemtical properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into our universe, we can use them to solve the White Rabbit problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are two ways of doing this: We can claim either:-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; White Rabbit universes don't exist at all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; White Rabbit universes are causally separated from us (or remote in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first is basically a reversion to a single-universe theory (1).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematical monists sometimes complain that they can't see what role
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter plays. One way of seeing its role is as a solution to the WR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem. For the non-Platonist, most mathematical entitites have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;merely abstract&quot; existence. Only a subset truly, conceretely, exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is an extra factor that the priveleged few have. What is it ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Materiality. For the physicalist, matter is the token of existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maerial things, exist, immaterial ones don't.
</em><br />
<br /><br />&quot;material things exist&quot; is Aristotle's assumption.
<br />
I don't do that assumption, if only because it posits what I want to 
<br />
understand.
<br />
The UDA just explains why such an explanation is necessary once we 
<br />
assume comp.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second moves on from a Mathematical Multiverse to a physical one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (3). The interesting thing about the second variety of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-just-mathematical monism is that as well as addressing the White
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rabbit problem, it removes some further contingency. If the matter,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical laws, and so on, are logically possible, then the general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach of arguing for a universe/multiverse on the grounds of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; removing contingency must embrace them -- otherwise it would be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contingent fact that the universe/multiverse consists of nothing but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the physical laws must take that into account.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All forms of physics handle counterfactuals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or do you mean it handles them in the sense of making them real  -- as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Deutsch insists.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That way, except I say this from the comp assumption, unlike Deutsch 
<br />
who says this from the quantum assumption. (of course &quot;real&quot; means here 
<br />
generated by the UD)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Multiverse theories claim that all possible worlds exist; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;possible&quot; has more than one meaning, so there is more than one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse theory.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sure. I got a different &quot;multiverse&quot; for each hypostases. But only few 
<br />
hypostases can correspond to a probability calculus (or a credibility 
<br />
calculus) on possible computations as seen from internal views. 
<br />
Limiting the range of multiverse corresponding to physical realities.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Logical possibility simply means that something is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not self-contradictory. Physical possibility means something is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contradictory to the laws of physics. &quot;Five-sided square&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-contradictory. &quot;Water runnig uphill&quot; is not, but it is physically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossoble.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'And, as I argued in FoR, the reality of universes in which we chose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differently makes sense of (some) formally 'counter- factual'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statements that don't make sense in single- universe physics, which can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only help in making sense of free will.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are forced to conclude that, in spacetime physics [i.e. without a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse], conditional statements whose premise is false (&quot;if Faraday
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had died in 1830 ...&quot;) have no meaning. '[Fabric of Reality, D Deutsch,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; p. 275]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose we agree. What is Deutsch himself to make of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterfactuals we need to discuss the consequences of the laws of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics themselves, such as: &quot;If charge were not conserved, the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be a very different place&quot;? The multiverse is no help, for by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition, it contains no worlds in which the laws are different.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. It is a weak point of the quantum multiverse. Instead, the comp 
<br />
multiverse is unique by emerging on all arithmetical relations. I could 
<br />
say on all mathematical structures, but comp makes arithmetic enough.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Deutsch's view thus implies that these essential claims about how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things would have been had the laws of nature been different &quot;have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Not necessarily. Deutsch does endows AR. If a multiverse can exist 
<br />
without lobian machine inside (that exists!), then even for Deutsch 
<br />
some mathematical multiverse can be used to reason on physical 
<br />
counterfactuals. This could be not interesting by making the notion of 
<br />
counterfactuals too large, but that is another question.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The moral is that if we want to give truth conditions for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterfactuals in terms of possible worlds, we need the set of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ogically possible worlds, not the set of physically possible worlds.
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed, Deutsch's whole multiverse probably counts as a single possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world in David Lewis's account, to which Deutsch later compares his own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view: &quot;The fruitfulness of the multiverse theory in contributing to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solution of long-standing philosophical problems is so great that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be worth adopting even if there were no physical evidence for it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at all. Indeed, the philosopher David Lewis, in his book On The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Plurality of Worlds, has postulated the existence of a multiverse for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical reasons alone.&quot; [pp. 339,40], my italics. Note that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doubtful whether the italicised counterfactual is itself meaningful, on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Deutsch's view! In fact, what Lewis postulates is not a multiverse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory, in Deutsch's sense.
</em><br />
<br />OK. (with the proviso above)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; from:-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.usyd.edu.au/time/price/preprints/DeutschReview-bjps.html">http://www.usyd.edu.au/time/price/preprints/DeutschReview-bjps.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Under David's interpretation, conditional statements whose antecedents
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are false in all physically possible universes, such &quot;as there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perpetual motion machine...&quot; are meaningless.
</em><br />
<br />Same as above. Note that with comp this problem is solved (but then the 
<br />
physical multiverse structure must be derived from the numbers laws).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So are positive statements about things that don't exist in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical universe, eg &quot;there is a perpetual motion machine&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So are negative statements about things that don't exist in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical universe, &quot;there is no perpetual motion machine&quot;. But, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course, we would regard the last as meaningful and true.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is in fact a whole bunch of reasons for thinking that statements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't require real-world referents to be meaningful.
</em><br />
<br />Key remarks. Comp extends this to consciousness experience in all its 
<br />
shapes. Like in platonic dreams ultimate referent are not needed.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We judge the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meanings of statements by their semantic and syntactic makeup. we don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; judge them by peeping into the universe next door. We can make sense of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;there is life on other planets&quot; without knowing whether there is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact life on other planets. If we couldn't make (linguistic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comceptual) sense of &quot;there is life on other planets&quot;, we wouldn't know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how to go about verifying its truth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The kind of linguistic/semantic meaning I have been talking about is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; called &quot;sense&quot;, as opposed to reference, the real-world object a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement is about, if it is about one. The distinction originated with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Frege
</em><br />
<br /><br />But that makes sense only through an aristotelian account of matter.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David's contention seems to be based on the idea that &quot;all meaning is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference&quot;. However it is arbitrary at best. It suggests statements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like &quot;if MWI is false..&quot; are meaningless unless there is a world where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MWI is in fact false. But how can that be if there is in fact, more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than one world ?
</em><br />
<br />I think we agree. I think you are just skeptical about the idea that 
<br />
standard comp entails pythagorean comp (not by making &quot;matter&quot; 
<br />
inconsistent, but by making any link between mind and &quot;primitive 
<br />
matter&quot; ad hoc and un-exploitable for solving the mind/body relation).
