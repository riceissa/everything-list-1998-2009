Brent,
<br />
sorry if I irritated you - that is felt in your response. 
<br />
----------------------
<br />
You remarked:
<br />
(&gt;&quot;&gt;     Upon your:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;...an unbiased sample, of the available evidence? &quot; is showing. -      Who is unbiased? )&quot;&lt;
</em><br />
You don't have to decide who's unbiased. 
<br />
JM:
<br />
My question meant: NOBODY is unbiased. Not you, not me, whoever 'thinks' has some position which is hard to overcome.
<br />
In the continuation I would appreciate to substitute your &quot;opinion&quot; word by &quot;belief system&quot; - scientific or religious. 
<br />
-----------------
<br />
&quot; Is there no reason to prefer science to voodoo?&quot;
<br />
Ask a voodoo official.  A friend was raised by nuns in Chile and asked &quot;I was thinking...&quot; whereupon the nun - educatrix shouted her down: &quot;you should not &quot;think&quot; you should &quot;believe&quot;. (Have you ever believed a science-book? Say: stories told by your college-professor? )
<br />
You cannot exclude in reasonable discussions the religious vast majority of humanity, - talking about a handful of 'free thinking' fundamentalists (science-crazed  people) is a vaste of time. In our western 'culture' the science-belief system is comparable mutatis mutandis with the religious one - noting some differences WHAT conditions are set for accepting an evidence (=truth). 
<br />
--------
<br />
Your: &quot;???&quot; - look in your text for &quot;imply&quot;.
<br />
--------------
<br />
Your par: &quot;What's your evidence for that? ...&quot;
<br />
You can pick the religious old, I can pkick the others, and tjhose who changed (or abandoned at all) religions. I was referring to a &quot;pristine faith&quot; of the young. The official religion of a country is politics. I don't know about your statistical figures, but social (marital?) pressure keeps lots of people as churchgoers from the many millions that don't go. Even in countries of an 'official' state-religion. 
<br />
--------
<br />
Finally:
<br />
&quot;... in fact they all claim that they are immune from test.  This is where they fail in their epistemological duty.&quot;

<br />
You mean the epistemological duty YOU impose? They simply claim to be immune from YOUR test, they have their own 'test' and 'evidence'.
<br />
That was my point.

<br />
John M

<br />
PS I hate to be i nvolved in arguments on religions and am sorry to have opened my mouse. Especially not with people who 'fundamentally' are on the same side with me - just hate my trend to be 'unbiased' (= fair to both parts). JM

</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't have to decide who's unbiased.  But if you refuse to consider some evidence because it might conflict with your opinion while you accept other evidence of the same type because it supports your opinion, then you are guilty of bias.  And if you're going to act on your opinion in a way that affects others, then I think you have an ethical duty to consider the evidence.  

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;We all live in our mindset (belief system) and call

</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;You ignored my prefacing statement that everyone has a political right to their beliefs - i.e. they should not be subject to coercion, like threat of death.  I explicitly rejected religious fanaticism.  Why do you bring it up as though I endorsed it?

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you have no standard but &quot;culture&quot; then how can you reject their culture of religious fanaticism.  Is it mere personal preference?  Can you offer no reasons.  Is there no reason to prefer science to voodoo?
<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;What's your evidence for that?  The overwhelming majority of people follow the religion of their parents.  That's why there are &quot;Muslim countries&quot; and &quot;Catholic countries&quot; and &quot;Hindu countries&quot;.  People may develop a different conception of their religion as they age, but I've know as many to become less doubtful as to become more.

</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly.  And none of them teach that you should empirically test their holy doctrines; in fact they all claim that they are immune from test.  This is where they fail in their epistemological duty.
