Man this is a tin of worms! I have just done a 30 page detailed 
<br />
refutation of computationalism.
<br />
It's going through peer review at the moment.
<br />
<br />The basic problem that most people fall foul of is the conflation of 
<br />
'physics-as-computation' with the type of computation that is being 
<br />
carried out in a Turing machine (a standard computer). In the paper I 
<br />
drew an artificial distinction between them. I called the former NATURAL 
<br />
COMPUTATION (NC) and the latter ARTIFICIAL COMPUTATION (AC). The idea is 
<br />
that if COMP is true then there is no distinction between AC and NC. The 
<br />
distinction should fail.
<br />
<br />I found one an one only situation/place where AC and NC part company. 
<br />
Call this situation X.
<br />
<br />If COMP is false in this one place X it is false as a general claim. I 
<br />
also found 02 downstream (consequential) failures that ultimately get 
<br />
their truth-basis from X, so they are a little weaker as formal 
<br />
arguments against COMP.
<br />
<br />*FACT*: Humans make propositions that are fundamentally of an informal 
<br />
nature. That is, the utterances of a human can be inconsistent and form  
<br />
an fundamentally incomplete set (we don't 'know everything'). The 
<br />
quintessential definition of a scientist is a 'correctable liar'. When a 
<br />
hypothesis is uttered it has the status indistinguishable of a lie. 
<br />
Humans can participate in the universe in ways which can (apparently) 
<br />
violate any law of nature. Humans must be able to 'violate' laws of 
<br />
nature in the process of accessing new/novel formal systems to describe 
<br />
the unknown natural world. Look at the world. It is not hard to see how 
<br />
humans exemplify an informal system. All over the world are quite normal 
<br />
(non-pathologically affected) humans with the same sensory systems and 
<br />
mental capacities. Yet all manner of ignorance and fervently held 
<br />
contradictory belief systems are 'rationally' adopted.
<br />
===================
<br />
COMP fails when:
<br />
a) You assume COMP is true and build an artificial (AC/computer) 
<br />
scientist &lt;Sa&gt; and expect &lt;Sa&gt; to be able to carry out authentic 
<br />
original science on the a-priori unknown....identically to humans. To do 
<br />
this you use a human-originated formal model (law of nature) ts to do 
<br />
this.... your computer 'computes ts, you EMBODY the computer in a 
<br />
suitable robotic form and then expect it to do science like humans. If 
<br />
COMP is true then the human scientist and the robot scientist should be 
<br />
indistinguishable.
<br />
<br />b) You then discover that it is a fundamental impossibility that &lt;Sa&gt; be 
<br />
able to debate/propose that COMP is a law of nature.
<br />
<br />c) Humans can debate/propose that COMP is a law of nature.
<br />
<br />BECAUSE:  (b) &lt;&gt; (c) they are distinguishable. NC and AC are different
<br />
THEREFORE: ts cannot be the 'law of nature' for a scientist.
<br />
THEREFORE: COMP is false in the special case of (b)
<br />
THEREFORE: COMP is false as a general claim.
<br />
<br />(b) is not a claim of truth or falsehood. It is a claim that the very 
<br />
idea of &lt;Sa&gt; ever proposing COMP (= doubting that COMP is true) is 
<br />
impossible. This is because it is a formal system trying, with a fixed, 
<br />
formal set of rules (even self modifying according to yet more rules) to 
<br />
construct statements that are the product of an informal system (a human 
<br />
scientist). The very idea of this is a contradiction in terms. The 
<br />
formal system is 100% deterministic, unable to violate rules. When it 
<br />
encounters a liar it will be unable to resolve what falsehood is being 
<br />
presented. It requires all falsehoods to be a-priori known. Impossible. 
<br />
How can a formal system encounter a world in which COMP is actually 
<br />
false? If it could, COMP would be FALSE! If COMP is true then it can't. 
<br />
Humans are informal....ergo we have some part of the natural world 
<br />
capable of behaving informally....=&gt; GOTCHA!
<br />
<br />This argument is has very 'Godellian' structure. That was accidental.
<br />
<br />When you say 'physics is fundamental'. I don't actually known what that 
<br />
means.
<br />
<br />What I can tell you is that to construct an authentic ARTIFICIAL 
<br />
SCIENTIST (not a simulation, but an 'inorganic' scientist), you have to 
<br />
*replicate the real physics of cognition, *not 'compute a model' of the 
<br />
cognition or a 'compute a model of the physics underlying cognition'. 
<br />
Then an artificial scientist is a scioentist in the same sense that 
<br />
artificial light is light.
<br />
<br />R.I.P. COMP
<br />
<br />=&gt; Strong AI (a computer can be a mind) is false.
<br />
=&gt; Weak AI (A computer model of cognition can never be actual cognition) 
<br />
is true.
<br />
<br />It's nice to finally have at least one tiny little place (X) where the 
<br />
seeds of clarity can be found.
<br />
<br />Cheers

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I note that the recent posts by Peter Jones - aka the mysterious 1Z,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and the originator of the curiously useful 'real in the sense I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; real' or RITSIAR - occurred shortly after my taking his name in vain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hmm.......
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Anyway, this signalled the resumption of a long-running debate about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the validity of causal accounts of the first person based on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; functional or computational rationale.  I'm going to make an attempt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to annihilate this intuition in this thread, and hope to encourage
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; feedback specifically on this issue.  You will recall that this is at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the heart of Bruno's requirement to base COMP - i.e. the explicitly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computational account of mind - on the the number realm, with physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; derived as an emergent from this.  Step 08 of the UDA addresses these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; issues in a very particular way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; However, I've always felt that there's a more intuitively obvious and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; just as devastating blow that can be dealt to functional or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computational notions based on physical entities and relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conceived as ontologically foundational and singular (i.e. no dualism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; please).  So as not to be misunderstood (too quickly!) let me make it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; clear at the outset that I'm addressing this to first person conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experience, not to third person descriptions of 'mentality' - so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; eliminativists can stop reading at this point as there is nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; further that requires explanation in their view (as odd as I trust
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this sounds to you non-eliminativists out there).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The argument runs as follows.  To take what physics describes with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; maximal seriousness - as standing for ontological reality - is just to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; take its entities and causal relationships seriously to the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; extent.  God knows, physicists have gone to enough trouble to define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; these entities and relationships with the most precisely articulated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; set of nomological-causal principles we possess.  Consequently, taking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; these with maximal seriousness entails abjuring other causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; principles as independently efficacious: i.e. showing how - or at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; least being committed to the belief that - all higher order causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; principles somehow supervene on these fundamentals.  Any other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; position would be either obscurantist or incoherent for a physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; realist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now I should say at this point that I'm not criticising this position,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm merely articulating it.  It follows from the foregoing that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; although we may speak in chemical, biological, physiological or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; historical narratives, we believe that in principle at least these are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reducible to their physical bases.  We also know that although we may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; speak of cabbages and kings, weather, oceans, processes, computations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and untold myriads of equally 'emergent' phenomena, we still must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; retain our commitment to their reducibility to their physical bases.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So of course, we can - and do - legitimately speak, in this way, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical computers as 'performing computations', but following the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; foregoing principle we can see that actually this is just a convenient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; shorthand for what is occurring in the physical substrates upon which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the notion of computation must - and of course does - rely for its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; realisation in the world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To be more explicit: The notion of a 'program' or 'computation' - when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we place it under analysis -  is a convenient shorthand for an ordered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; set of first person concepts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In what sense &quot;first person&quot;? Surely not in the sense that qualia are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supposed to be mysteriously and incommunicably first-person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Presumably in the sense that something is only a computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when regarded as such, (like certain pieces of paper being money).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But that is quite contentious. It is not enough to say &quot;under
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analysis&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one must actually analyse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which finds its way into the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; account in the form of various matter-energy dispositions.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; macroscopic media for these are variously paper and ink, actions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computer keyboards, patterns of voltages in computer circuitry,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; illumination of pixels on screens, etc.  All of these, of course, can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - and must - reduce to fundamental relations amongst physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'ultimates'.  At some point after entering the physical causal nexus,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this chain of dispositions may re-enter the first person account
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (don't ask me how - it's inessential to the argument) at which point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; they may again be construed *by someone* in computational terms in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; first person context.  But at no point is the 'computation' - qua
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; concept - in any way material (pun intended) to the physical account;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a fortiori, in no way can it - or need it - be ascribed causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; significance in terms of the physical account.  After all, what could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this possibly mean?  Are these spooky 'computational' relationships
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'reaching across' the energy-transfers of the computer circuitry and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; changing their outcomes? Of course not.  How could they?  And why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would they need to?  Everything's going along just fine by itself by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; purely physical means.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I hope the foregoing makes it clear that computer programs and their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computations - at the point of physical instantiation - literally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; don't exist in the world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It doens't remotely. Just because something (eg a horse)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isn't a *fundamental* constituent of the world doesn't make it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-existent in the sense that unicorn is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  They're semantic formulations - ways of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; speaking - that have applicability only in the first-person context,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and we can see that this is true any time we like by performing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; kind of 'eliminativist' demonstration performed above: i.e. we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; eliminate the concept without affecting the action on the ground one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whit.  Of course, this is the insight that makes the strictly physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; account of mind - as presently understood - problematic if one wishes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to take the first person seriously, because it shows the notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'emergence' to be redundant at the level of causation. It's just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; another way of speaking, however much insight it carries - for us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; However, it isn't my wish to make that point again here.  Rather my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intention has been to show that whatever options are left in strict
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physicalism to address the first person issues seriously - without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; eliminating them - emergence is emphatically not one of them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I hope this makes the argument clear, and also illustrates the point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of Bruno's reversal of numbers and physics to save the computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; account of mind (and body, as it happens).  To be absolutely explicit:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; if functional-computational relations are to be taken to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fundamentally causally efficacious, they must be held to be real and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; foundational in exactly the sense (RITSIAR) ascribed to those in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical account.  But for that to be the case, all other causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relations must supervene on them - again just as in the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; account.  But now, of course, this must include physics itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What must include physics itself?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now, you don't of course have to accept COMP.  But if you want to be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical realist, it means you can only hang on to the computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explanation of mind by eliminating the mind itself from reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see how that follows at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Personally, not being committed to such an explanation, this doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in itself constitute my problem with current physical accounts.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; alternative is rather that physics as an account of mind must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; incomplete, or else it is wrong.   But that's another story.
