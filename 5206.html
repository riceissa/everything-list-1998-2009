<br />
Sorry. Can't help myself : Is there any point in completing that term 
<br />
paper really?
<br />
<br />On a few points.
<br />
<br />I don't believe in the point of view of &quot;nihilism because everything 
<br />
will happen in the multiverse, anyway, regardless of what I do&quot;..
<br />
My reasons are a little vague, but here's a stab at it:
<br />
<br />1. I look at us group of human observer SAS's as results of and 
<br />
guardians of emerged complex order in our universe.
<br />
In fact I believe our universe (its temporal arrow etc) is only 
<br />
observable because it is the set of paths through the multiverse
<br />
that has all this emerged complex order in it.I believe these 
<br />
potentially observable sets of paths through the multiverse's general
<br />
disorder are rare (of small measure.)
<br />
<br />2. Somehow, all of us human observers are clearly &quot;in&quot; or &quot;observing&quot; 
<br />
the SAME set of paths through the multiverse.
<br />
Now that is significant. It tells us that in the emergent-order paths of 
<br />
multiverse info-state evolution, that those paths
<br />
are observable consistently to ANY observer that emerges as part of the 
<br />
emerged complex order present in those paths.
<br />
<br />3. I see humans (or other intelligent lifeforms) as in some strange ways 
<br />
the smart-lookahead &quot;guardians&quot; of the particular
<br />
piece of emergent-order their most a part of (their planet, their 
<br />
ecosystems, their societies, themselves).The reason
<br />
we emerged (or are still here) is because we have helped make our 
<br />
emergent complex system &quot;successful&quot; (robust).
<br />
<br />4. For some strange reason, I value the most complex yet elegant and 
<br />
robust emergent order (for itself). This is why
<br />
for example, I'm an environmental activist in my spare (hah!) time.
<br />
<br />5. I think if one values elegant, robust complex order, and if one is an 
<br />
active part of the elegant, robust, complex
<br />
order, who emerged precisely so that a SAS of the emerged system could 
<br />
sense and make sense of the surroundings,
<br />
and could model and influence the future, and guard the SAS's own 
<br />
existence and that of the whole emerged system of
<br />
which it is a part, then &quot;guard away&quot; I say, actively, not 
<br />
nihilistically. Model your world. Predict its different possible
<br />
futures, and use your emerged (and cultivated, same thing) wisdom to 
<br />
steer yourself, and your society, and your
<br />
ecosystem, and your planet, away from harm and too-soon reduction to 
<br />
entropy. In the very, very end, it is said,
<br />
entropy wins (like the house wins in Vegas.) But why not have as good a 
<br />
game as possible before it ends in a billion
<br />
or trillions of years.
<br />
<br />6. Of course, it doesn't make sense to try to protect (and advance in 
<br />
elegance) an emergent order that is indeed truly
<br />
robust, does it? But my point back there was that we are supposed to be 
<br />
part of the emergent system's self-defense
<br />
mechanism, because we can think and plan, and change things in our universe.
<br />
<br />7. So can we change the multiverse as a whole? Probably not. But all 
<br />
that observers can ever co-observe
<br />
is a single self-consistent universe in the multiverse. Look at earth 
<br />
and earthlife like a surfboard and surfer surfing
<br />
this big coherent wave of informationally self-consistent order that is 
<br />
our universe. What we as the surfer can
<br />
do is look ahead, and steer the board, and prolong the ride, and make it 
<br />
as amazing as possible before it
<br />
tumbles into the vortex. That's enough control to say let's delay 
<br />
nihilism til the very last possible moment at least,
<br />
shall we. Let's see where we might wash up if we keep riding well. 
<br />
Enough. Enough. This tortured analogy is
<br />
killing me.
<br />
<br />8. You may say that there's all these other virtual doppelganger surfers 
<br />
and surfboards (even on our same order-wave universe)
<br />
so why bother steering anyway? One of us will make it. Yeah well I don't 
<br />
think so. I think all the emergent systems
<br />
kind of compete with each other to organize things, and there's winners 
<br />
and losers, and the losers are all just info-noise.
<br />
<br />8. I guess the above is premised on the supposition that we CAN steer. 
<br />
That we have any say over when and how
<br />
our part of our universe degrades into entrop (info-noise.) This is 
<br />
really vague but I have some strange
<br />
sense that what observing AGENT (actor) systems such as ourselves are 
<br />
doing is choosing (or having a part
<br />
in choosing) the way in which their quantum world becomes their 
<br />
classical world. I think there's the possibility
<br />
of free will there. It's like their steering the NOW wavefront itself 
<br />
(in their shared universe). If the possibly ordered
<br />
paths through multiverse infospace near these observers are more than 
<br />
one possible path, maybe its the observers,
<br />
by the sum total of their collective actions, that micro-manage the 
<br />
choice of future info-paths that will still be
<br />
consistent with the path(s) their all on. Maybe the set of possible 
<br />
consistent and ordered paths is narrower and narrower as
<br />
time goes on for them, but I think there are still choices to be made. 
<br />
It's possible that that's an illusion, but choice being an illusion
<br />
is a concept for the theoretical meta-level, for OUTSIDE our universe 
<br />
path. Inside our path(s), our paths and the real or
<br />
illusory choices we make within them, are all we'll EVER be able to see. 
<br />
So why not play along with the rules of the
<br />
game your in, be a guardian angel of elegant complex order near you. Why 
<br />
not model and see the probabilities ahead
<br />
with all your learning power and determination, and why not then choose 
<br />
with all your might? Whether it all amounts
<br />
to a hill of beans in this crazy world or not is one of the last 
<br />
mysteries. But mysteries help make it all so fricking
<br />
amazing. Try solving them. What can you lose?
<br />
<br />9. But go ahead and explore your point of view in your essay, and maybe 
<br />
post it when you're done.
<br />
I could be entirely wrong the way I see things, and your outline looks 
<br />
great. Maybe simplify,
<br />
cover a little less, but a little deeper, because simplicity with 
<br />
complexity underneath it is what it's all about.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;------------------------------------------------------- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A Scientific Basis for Ethical and Existential Nihilism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I. Introduction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     A. Societal habit of classification of moral disciplines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     B. Difference of anyone to a possibly fitting classification makes such divvying impossible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     C. One must evaluate the individual sets of moral principles to establish their validity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;II. What is ethical?—Establishing a Basis for Reference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     A. Definition of ethic/moral
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          1. Participation/contribution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          2. Action
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          3. Earning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     B. Earning as an ethical point for reference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          1. Earning governed by psychological history
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          2. Psychology influenced by the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          3. The physical is governed by causality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     C. Ethic is debunked by the causal nature of space-time and quantum superpositioning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;III.   Space-Time and Quantum Physics form a basis for inevitability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     A. The “So-Called Relativity Theory” Perspective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          1. The space-time manifold is a substrate upon which things exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          2. The future condition of events or anything can be determined using equations to model energy and position over time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          3. All things have a definite past, present, and future, ontologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          4. Limited by information acquisition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               a) speed of light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               b) infinitesimal spaces governed by quantum theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     B. Quantum Physics Perspective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          1. Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               a) impossible to know one’s future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               b) definite past
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          2. Schrödinger’s wave function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               a) Schrödinger’s Cat Paradox
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               b) superposition of waves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               c) collapse of the wave function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               d) Copenhagen Interpretation (CHI)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               e) Hugh Everett III’s theory that all possible resultant collapses can be defined by a superposition in Hilbert Space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     C. Multiverse Theory—Multiple Universes in which all possibilities are played out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          1. There is a total number of possible arrangements of matter based on the limits of the entropy of space-time, where the total is equal to the permutation of particles and energies and dependent on the total number of particles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          2. All these possibilities are superimposed upon one another to form an infinite-dimensional Hilbert Space in which the wave function resides, evolving over time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               a) Each universe is a subset, a space-time system in which one arrangement of matter exists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               b) One space-time event sequence is merely the use of time and physical law/rules to determine a valid progression of one universal space to another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               c) This creates multiple space-time pathways, each of which encompasses a version of the past, present, and future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               d) Each point has a past with possible futures to be determined upon collapse of the wave function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               e) Our own physical, present reality, interpreted as a resulting situation of the collapse, is one point in space-time with a sequence of probability states with the same past configuration
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               f) This course of action leading to each possible reality yields multiple pathways from the beginning to the end of time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               g) Each point in time has nearly infinite future possibilities, but each path contains only itself—one path with two endpoints—essentially arriving from the restraints of causality on the topological set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;IV. Philosophical Implications
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     A. Every person has a definite past
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          1. Every person is the result of the path of space-time upon which its universe’s energy has traveled
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          2. Because of causality and entropy bounds, one has no control over the past
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          3. A future is simply the result of influences of the wave function and its probabilities on space-time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     B. A person’s future is inevitable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          1. No matter what decision one chooses, the psyche’s action is defined and controlled by the wave function in its space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          2. All decisions, choices, and outcomes are predefined, if only in a superposition of probabilities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          3. This leads to a lack of personal contribution on the part of the person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     C. A person is not to be held accountable for what he/she cannot control
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          1. If a person cannot control the set of probabilities of the outcome, then are they really making a decision?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               a) Yes, they do define a pathway,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               b) But, there is no preference of one over the other physically, except what is determined by the probabilities defined by the wave function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               c) No one outcome is more likely then another with respect to its predefined wave-function probability of occurrence within the Hilbert Space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          2. Not having any preference of one course of action over another causes a void of emotional imperative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     D. The lack of responsibility on the part of the individual results in a demoralization of human will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          1. Human will is merely the result of a manifestation of a pathway of the wave function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               a) There is no earning, as everything is determined as a whole of the state of the universe—everything is part of the same system and coordinates the various conditions for future outcomes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               b) If there is no preferred human will, there is no moral imperative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          2. Morals are the principles of conduct governing an individual or a group
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               a) This is devoid of valid background
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                    (i) There is only the physical that actually governs someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                    (ii) An ethic is “a guiding philosophy” that drives people to an end based on moral obligation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                    (iii)  They have no sound logical basis, s there is no preferred action over another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;               b) This yields a demoralization of the ends of ethics to which people are judged
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;V. Conclusion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     A. Societal Taboo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          1. Societal taboo is the aversion of standard moral or ethical principle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          2. Because any ethic/moral end is void, so are society’s totems and taboos
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     B. Existential Nihilism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          1. In addition to the invalid social ends, there is no scientific justification for morals of any sort, only that in the Darwinistic sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          2. Everything is merely its own existence in the Hilbert Space-time framework
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          3. Thus, existential and ethical nihilism replaces moralism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;----------------------------------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Feel free to comment on this.  Is my logic sufficiently justified? If not, how so?  Thanks
