<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is the conclusion correct?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />This is the standard &quot;Doomsday argument&quot; (see 
<br />
<a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com/primer1.html">http://www.anthropic-principle.com/primer1.html</a> and 
<br />
<a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com/faq.html">http://www.anthropic-principle.com/faq.html</a> from Nick Bostrom's site), but 
<br />
there's a loophole--it's possible that something like Nick Bostrom's 
<br />
&quot;simulation argument&quot; (which has its own site at 
<br />
<a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/">http://www.simulation-argument.com/</a> ) is correct, and that we are *already* 
<br />
living in some vast transhuman galaxy-spanning civilization, but we just 
<br />
don't know it because a significant fraction of the observer-moments in this 
<br />
civilization are part of &quot;ancestor simulations&quot; which simulate the distant 
<br />
past (or alternate versions of their own 'actual' past) in great detail. In 
<br />
this case the self-sampling assumption which tells us our own present 
<br />
observer-moment is &quot;typical&quot; could be correct, and yet we'd have incorrect 
<br />
information about the total number of humanlike observers that had gone 
<br />
before us, if we knew the actual number it might tell us that doomsday was 
<br />
far off.
<br />
<br />Thinking about these ideas, I also came up with a somewhat different thought 
<br />
about how our current observer-moment might be &quot;typical&quot; without it needing 
<br />
to imply the likelihood that civilization was on the verge of ending. It's 
<br />
pretty science-fictioney and fanciful, but maybe not *too* much more so than 
<br />
the ancestor simulation idea. The basic idea came out of thinking about 
<br />
whether it would ever be possible to &quot;merge&quot; distinct minds into a single 
<br />
one, especially in a hypothetical future when mind uploading is possible and 
<br />
the minds that want to merge exist as programs running on advanced 
<br />
computers. This idea of mind-merging appears a lot in science fiction--think 
<br />
of the Borg on Star Trek--but it seemed to me that it would actually be 
<br />
quite difficult, because neural networks are so idiosyncratic in the details 
<br />
of their connections, and because memories and knowledge are stored in such 
<br />
a distributed way, they aren't like ordinary computer programs designed by 
<br />
humans where you have neat easy-to-follow decision trees and units of 
<br />
information stored in distinct clearly-marked locations. Figuring out how to 
<br />
map one neural network's concept of a &quot;cat&quot; (for example) to another's in 
<br />
such a way that the combined neural network behaved in a nice unified matter 
<br />
wouldn't be straightforward at all, and each person's concept of a cat 
<br />
probably involves links to huge numbers of implicit memories which have a 
<br />
basis in that person's unique life history.
<br />
<br />So, is there any remotely plausible way it could be done? My idea was that 
<br />
if mind B wanted to integrate mind A into itself, perhaps the only way to do 
<br />
it would be to hook the two neural networks up with a lot of initially 
<br />
fairly random connections (just as the connections between different areas 
<br />
in the brain of a newborn are initially fairly random), and then *replay* 
<br />
the entire history of A's neural network from when it was first formed up to 
<br />
the moment it agreed to merge with B, with B's neural network adapting to it 
<br />
in realtime and forming meaningful connections between A's network and its 
<br />
own, in much the same way that our left hemisphere has been hooked up to our 
<br />
right hemisphere since our brain first formed and the two are in a constant 
<br />
process of adapting to changes in one another so they can function as a 
<br />
unified whole. For this to work, perhaps B would have to be put into a very 
<br />
passive, receptive state, so that it was experiencing the things happening 
<br />
in A's brain throughout the &quot;replay&quot; of A's life as if they were happening 
<br />
to itself, with no explicit conscious memories or awareness of itself as an 
<br />
individual distinct from A with its own separate life history. In this case, 
<br />
the experience of being B's neural network experiencing this replay of A's 
<br />
life might be subjectively indistinguishable from A's original life--there'd 
<br />
be no way of telling whether a particular observer-moment was actually that 
<br />
of A or of B passively experiencing as part of such an extended replay.
<br />
<br />And suppose that later, after B had emerged from this life-replay with A now 
<br />
assimilated into itself, and B had gotten back to its normal life in this 
<br />
transhuman future, another mind C wanted to assimilate B into itself in the 
<br />
same way. If it used the same procedure, it would have to experience a 
<br />
replay of the entire history of B's neural network, including the period 
<br />
where B was experiencing the replay of A's neural network (even if C had 
<br />
already experienced a reply of A's history on its own)--and these 
<br />
experiences, too, could be indistinguishable from the original experiences 
<br />
of A! So if I'm having experiences which subjectively seem like those of A, 
<br />
I'd have no way of being sure if they weren't actually those of some 
<br />
transhuman intellect which wanted to integrate my mind into itself, or some 
<br />
other transhuman intellect which wanted to integrate that first transhuman's 
<br />
mind into itself, etc. If we imagine that a significant number of future 
<br />
transhuman minds will be &quot;descendents&quot; of the earliest uploads (perhaps 
<br />
because those will be the ones that have had the most time to make multiple 
<br />
diverging copies of themselves, so they form the largest 'clades'), then as 
<br />
different future minds keep wanting to merge with one another, they might 
<br />
keep having to re-experience the same original life histories of the 
<br />
earliest uploads, over and over again. Thus experiences of the lives of 
<br />
beings who were born within decades of the development of uploading 
<br />
technology (or just close enough to the development of the technology so 
<br />
that, even if they didn't naturally live to see it, they'd be able to use 
<br />
cryonics to get their brains preserved so that they could be scanned once it 
<br />
became possible) could form a significant fraction of the set of all 
<br />
observer-moments in some extremely vast galaxy-spanning transhuman 
<br />
civilization.
<br />
<br />Perhaps it's pretty farfetched, but my motive in thinking along these lines 
<br />
is not just that I want to see the doomsday argument wrong when applied to 
<br />
the lifetime of our civilization--it's that the doomsday argument can also 
<br />
be applied to our *individual* lifetimes, so that if my current 
<br />
observer-moment is &quot;typical&quot; the number of years I have left to live is 
<br />
unlikely to be too many times larger than the number of years I've lived 
<br />
already, and yet in this form it seems to be clearly incompatible with the 
<br />
argument for quantum immortality, which I also find pretty plausible (see my 
<br />
argument in favor of QI at 
<br />
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/msg/c88e55c668ac4f65">http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/msg/c88e55c668ac4f65</a> ). The 
<br />
only way for the two arguments to be compatible is if we have beings with 
<br />
infinitely extended lifespans that nevertheless are continually having 
<br />
experiences where they *believe* themselves to have only lived for a few 
<br />
decades and have no conscious memories of a longer life prior to 
<br />
that--something along the lines of &quot;reincarnation&quot;, except that I want a 
<br />
version that doesn't require believing in a supernatural non-computable 
<br />
&quot;soul&quot;. This is my attempt to come up with a rationale for why transhuman 
<br />
minds might have a lot of observer-moments that seem to be those of 
<br />
short-lived beings like ourselves, one which hopefully would not seem 
<br />
completely crazy to someone who's already prepared to swallow notions like 
<br />
mind uploading and giant post-singularity transhuman civilizations (and at 
<br />
least some on this list would probably fall into that category).
