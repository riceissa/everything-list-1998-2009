</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't see why. Surely what is being asserted is that there is a set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of physically real universes, and it is a subset of logically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible universes (&quot;Platonia&quot;) -- but logically possible universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are not real in any sense, they are just an abstraction.
</em><br />
<br />Well, that is the whole (as yet unproven) claim of those like
<br />
Balfour, Schmidhuber, and Marchal, etc.  Namely, that they are
<br />
real (see Bruno's nice &quot;sum up&quot; below).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But logically possible universes are certainly real in one sense: as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being logically possible. Or as being logically consistent.
</em><br />
<br />Yes indeed. If I have a string that contains (looks entirely arbitrary)
<br />
<br />...071CB7150F1B0571C391BF0194C713100F15070C33149054012F0C59202039D10091...
<br />
<br />of one's and zeros (in hex notation) and somewhere else an almost
<br />
exactly similar string (both either finite, or infinite), then
<br />
indeed there *is* an objective relationship between them if they
<br />
are sufficiently similar. They are, in fact, related precisely
<br />
to the degree that there is such a mapping from one to the other.
<br />
<br />Now the more complex the mapping, that is, the more esoteric the
<br />
TM that is needed (the greater the Kolmogorov complexity of the
<br />
program that relates them), the less that they are *objectively*
<br />
related.
<br />
<br />And since by hypothesis, all strings &quot;exist&quot; to platonic mathematicians,
<br />
all strings exist in Platonia, then any and every relationship that you
<br />
care to name exists there also. But one has to keep in mind a sort of
<br />
futility that attends such observations; a futility described first by
<br />
Borges.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If they are furthermore enough rich in complexity to have &quot;abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inhabitants&quot;, it is reasonable or plausible (at least) that for those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inhabitants their abstract universe will look as it is real.
</em><br />
<br />This rests on the surprising conclusion that the inhabitants actually
<br />
compute later states from earlier ones.  Of course, it can always be
<br />
made to *look* as though that is what &quot;happened&quot;.  Eternal Truth #6:
<br />
seek and ye shall find.
<br />
<br />It is precisely this latter &quot;surprising conclusion&quot; that is resisted
<br />
by so many (including me).  Just as it would seem that anyone should
<br />
resist making conclusions about the relationships between the books
<br />
in Borges' Library of Babel.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And this will make sense if, furthermore again, their relative abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational continuations have the right measure. And theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer science can justify the existence of such relative measure.
</em><br />
<br />We may take the books in the Borges library---admittedly in his
<br />
scenario none of which is infinite---and begin willy-nilly assigning
<br />
a greater measure to some than to others.  It is extremely tempting
<br />
to assign greater measure to short ones. But in the infinite-string
<br />
version of Borges' library, Russell Standish (for one) begins by
<br />
assigning equal measure to each bit string.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And, finally, if such mathematical measure leads to the verified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirical measure, then, frankly, it seems to me that materialism in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics begins to look like ... late vitalism in 19th century biology.
</em><br />
<br />A big &quot;if&quot;!  Indeed, if a single new prediction comes from consideration
<br />
of Platonia or of Borges' Library (finite or infinite-string version),
<br />
then there will be quite a cause for celebrating.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To sum up: &quot;real&quot; is just (abstract) consistency as seen from inside.
</em><br />
<br />Great summary. Are all these books in libraries whispering to
<br />
each other or not?  They indeed even quote each other verbatim,
<br />
and many can be seen to be holding conversations with each other
<br />
at arbitrarily high degrees of abstraction and wisdom. But will
<br />
anyone a hundred years from now think there is anything substantial
<br />
in this perception, or not?
<br />
<br />Lee
