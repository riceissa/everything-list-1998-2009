</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, you seem to insist on your own language.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not at all. I insist on the consequences of comp. Like Godfrey you  
<br />
have admitted not having read neither the UDA proof nor its  
<br />
constructive translation. Now you talk like if I was calling comp  
<br />
something else. That physics is secondary with comp is a result, a  
<br />
theorem in cognitive science/theology/biology (call that like you  
<br />
want). That materialism is incompatible with computationalism is a  
<br />
result, etc.
<br />
So please, you can doubt the result, and then you could perhaps point  
<br />
on some error in UDA, but it is unfair to pretend that by comp I am  
<br />
not just talking on the &quot;well known&quot; comp in cognitive science. Of  
<br />
course, many many many papers still confused comp and materialism,  
<br />
but unless UDA is wrong this is no more possible to do.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; First, you admitted that by &quot;COMP&quot; or &quot;comp&quot; you *meant*  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalism.
</em><br />
<br />I have always use that term. comp is just shorter and easy to pronounce.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then you overlay all your own beliefs on computationalism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which certainly confuses a lot of people.
</em><br />
<br />No. I point on a theorem and refer to its proof. Actually I intervene  
<br />
in this list when people says something which can be shown not valid  
<br />
by the UDA reversal.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is what wikipedia says: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a> 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Connectionism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Computationalism is a specific form of cognitivism which argues  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that mental activity is computational, i.e. that the mind is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; essentially a Turing machine.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Lee, please take into account that those who wrote those words are  
<br />
probably not (yet?) aware of my result.
<br />
My fault, in part, because I am slow at submitting papers. Actually I  
<br />
have never do that. All papers which I have published has been  
<br />
ordered by some people who heard about my stuff. Why? That's another  
<br />
story.
<br />
Of course the reversal result introduces ambiguity in expressions  
<br />
like &quot;mental activity&quot;. That is why I sum up &quot;comp&quot; by YD + CT + AR.  
<br />
(&quot;Yes doctor&quot; + Church Thesis + Arithmetical realism).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Many researchers argued that the trend in connectionism was towards  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a reversion to associationism, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the abandonment of the idea of a language of thought, something  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they felt was mistaken. On the other hand, it was those very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tendencies that made connectionism attractive for other researchers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds per se, but  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the debate as it was phrased in the late 1980s and early 1990s
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly led to opposition between the two approaches. However,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; throughout the debate some researchers have argued that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connectionism and computationalism are fully compatible, though  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing like a consensus has ever been reached. The differences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the two approaches that are usually cited are the following:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * Computationalists posit symbolic models that do not resemble  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; underlying brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       structure at all, whereas connectionists engage in &quot;low  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level&quot; modeling, trying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       to ensure that their models resemble neurological structures.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * Computationalists generally focus on the structure of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explicit symbols (mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       models) and syntactical rules for their internal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manipulation, whereas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       connectionists focus on learning from environmental stimuli  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and storing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       this information in a form of connections between neurons.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * Computationalists believe that internal mental activity  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consists of manipulation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       of explicit symbols, whereas connectionists believe that the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manipulation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       explicit symbols is a poor model of mental activity.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here I agree comp must be distinguished with functionalism, and then  
<br />
comp is much weaker, because it says we are turing machine emulable  
<br />
*at some level*, which could be far more low than symbolic type of  
<br />
processing (it could even be the dovetailing on the solution of  
<br />
DeWhit-Wheeler cosmological wave equation). But this makes sense  
<br />
through the result I got, with the grandmother YD and without.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So please, Bruno, quit trying to imply that all computationalists  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (e.g. me)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe *only* on the UDist or only in mathematical structures.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Don't confuse UDist (Schmidhuber Hal Finney sort of theory) and the  
<br />
UD. Original paper of UD &quot;paradox&quot;:
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/M&amp;PI_15-MAI-91.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/M&amp;PI_15-MAI-91.pdf</a>
<br />
Note the reversal is implicit (diplomatic stuff!).
<br />
The question is: Do you agree that YD, computationalism, and  
<br />
Uploading acceptance are mainly equivalent?
<br />
Then I have shown that this entails the reversal physics/computer- 
<br />
science.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For many, many years whenever you wrote &quot;COMP&quot; I assumed that you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meant your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own theories.
</em><br />
<br />I have no theory other than traditional computationalism (mind is  
<br />
turing emulable)
<br />
<br /><br />My theory is the standard &quot;mechanist&quot; thesis updated by Post, Godel,  
<br />
Church, Kleene, discoveries of the universal machine and its lobian  
<br />
theorem prover extension.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Naturally that included this extremely speculative concept of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schmidhuber's and others that that both time and our physical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; merely a manifestation of timeless bitstrings.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is perhaps the biggest difference between Schmidhuber and me. I  
<br />
give a detailed proof of the main proposition without making any  
<br />
speculation other than putting clearly the hypotheses on the table.
<br />
For many comp is obviously true and for many comp is obviously false.  
<br />
The least thing I illustrate is that comp is not obvious at all.  
<br />
Indeed, the mind-body problem is partially reduced to explaining how  
<br />
the physical appearances emerges from *all* computations through  
<br />
&quot;internal first person points of view (which makes sense by CT).
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;(2) Philosophical AI or Computationalism&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Secondly, and of more relevance to this discussion, is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalism or philosophical AI, (sometimes also known as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Strong AI),  which is the view that all human mental activities are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reducible to algorithms, and could therefore be implemented on a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is just wrong and is a typical confusion between p -&gt; q and q -&gt;  
<br />
p (which can be often seen as an abuse of OCCAM).
<br />
STRONG AI = machine can be conscious
<br />
COMP = me and humans are turing emulable. (+ humans are conscious).
<br />
STRONG AI does not logically imply COMP (machine could think does not  
<br />
logically entail that only machine could think! Of course with OCCAM,  
<br />
machine can think makes more plausible that we are perhaps machine,  
<br />
but given that I provide a proof we must distinguish deduction and   
<br />
inductive inference).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computationalism is an essential tenet of physicalism, which states  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there is no need to assume any spiritual or non-algorithmic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aspect to existence.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Comp *was*  an essential tenet of physicalism. That's explain why the  
<br />
reversal is &quot;shocking&quot;, for many, probably.
<br />
UDA shows that comp makes physicalism, materialism, naturalism wrong  
<br />
(or explicatively empty, like invisible horses pulling cars).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Computationalism  is thus diametrically opposed to Buddhist  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophy, which regards the subtle mind (that which survives death
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and goes on to the next life) as a fundamental aspect of reality,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Even before the reversal, YD is already quite close to the comp  
<br />
theology: you can save your soul on a disk, and survive a form of  
<br />
body transmigration, and the UDA shows that this put fundamental  
<br />
constraints on the nature of reality.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; not an epiphenomenon of matter. Buddhism views a sentient being,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human or animal and its mind, as a totally different kind of thing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from a machine or automaton.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Actually this is also an incredible simplification of Buddhism which  
<br />
has many different viewpoints on those matter. the &quot;Milinda question&quot;  
<br />
is arguably defending comp.
<br />
But then please again in consideration the reversal. I could accept  
<br />
that old, pre-reversal, comp can be thoughjt contrary to buddhism,  
<br />
but after the reversal I doubt such arguments remain valid.
<br />
<br />Please, Lee, in older posts you acknowledge the newness of what I  
<br />
pretend having done, it is up to you to verify the UDA if you think  
<br />
an error has been commited. Ask any question.I probably underestimate  
<br />
the hardness and radical novelty of what I consider to be the result  
<br />
of a not so hard (but not so simple too) hypotheses-deductive reasoning.
<br />
The translation and &quot;constructivisation&quot; of the UDA argument, AUDA or  
<br />
the machine interview, is admittedly much more involved and demanding  
<br />
in mathematical logic.
