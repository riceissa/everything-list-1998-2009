OOPS! I accidentally hit the &quot;send&quot; button on the wrong copy.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adequately.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your answer is very interesting - not quite what I expected:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RS:  In some Platonic sense, all possible observers are already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out there, but by physically instantiating it in our world, we are in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effect opening up a communication channel between ourselves and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; new consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think I must be missing something profound in your intended meanings of:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) 'out there'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) 'physically instantiating'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) 'our world'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My current 'picture' of it is as follows.  The 'Platonic sense' I assume 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equates to the 'bit-string plenitude' (which is differentiable from 'no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information' only by internal observers, like the Library of Babel - a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beautiful idea BTW).  But I'm assuming a 'hierarchy' of recursive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational emergence through bits up through, say, strings, quarks, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atoms, molecules, etc - in other words what is perceived as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter-energy by observers.  I then assume that both 'physical objects' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and any correlated observers emerge from this matter-energy level, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that this co-emergence accomplishes the 'physical instantiation'.  IOW, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the observer is the 1-person view, and the physical behaviour the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3-person view, of the same underlying complex emergent - they're 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different descriptions of the same events.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If this is so, then as you say, the opening of the 'communication 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; channel' would be a matter of establishing the means and modes of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interaction with any new consciousness, because the same seamless 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; underlying causal sequence unites observer-world and physical-world: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again, different descriptions, same events.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the above is accepted (but I'm beginning to suspect there's something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deeply wrong with it), then the 'stability' of the world of the observer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should equate to the 'stability' of the physical events to which it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; linked through *identity*.  Now here's what puzzles me.  ISTM that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imputation of 'computation' to the physical computer is only through the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systematic correspondence of certain stable aspects of its (principally) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electronic behaviour to computational elements: numbers, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical-logical operators, etc.  The problem is in the terms 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'imputation' and 'correspondence': this is surely merely a *way of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speaking* about the physical events in the computer, an arbitrary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ascription, from an infinite possible set, of externally-established 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; semantics to the intrinsic physical syntactics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently, ISTM that the emergence of observer-worlds has to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlated (somehow) - one-to-one, or isomorphically - with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding 'physical' events: IOW these events, with their 'dual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description', constitute a single 'distinguished' *causal* sequence.  By 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contrast, *any* of the myriad 'computational worlds' that could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ascribed to the same events must remain - to the computer, rather than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the programmer - only arbitrary or 'imaginary' ones.  This is why I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described them as 'nested' - perhaps 'orthogonal' or 'imaginary' are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better: they may - 'platonically' - exist somewhere in the plenitude, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but causally disconnected from the physical world in which the computer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; participates. The computer doesn't 'know' anything about them.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently, how could they possess any 'communication channel' to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer's - and our - world 'out there'?
</em><br />
<br />I think I agree with your concern and I think the answer is that &quot;conscious&quot; implies &quot;conscious of something&quot;.  For a computer or an animal to be conscious is really a relation to an environment.  So for a computer to be conscious, as a human is, it must be able to perceive and act in our environment.  Or it could be running a program in which a conscious being is simulated and that being would be conscious relative to a simulated environment in the computer.  In the latter case there might be an infinite number of different interpretations that could be consistently placed on the computer's execution; or there might not.  Maybe all those different interpretations aren't really different.  Maybe they are just translations into different words.  It seems to me to be jumping to a conclusion to claim they are different in some significant way.
<br />
<br />The importance of the environment for consciousness is suggested by the sensory deprivation experiments of the late '60s.  It was observed by people who spent a long time in a sensory deprivation tank (an hour or more) that their mind would enter a loop and they lost all sense of time.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course I'm not claiming by this that machines couldn't be conscious.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My claim is rather that if they are, it couldn't be solely in virtue of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any 'imaginary computational worlds' imputed to them, but rather because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they support some unique, distinguished process of *physical* emergence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that also corresponds to a unique observer-world: and of course, mutatis 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mutandis, this must also apply to the 'mind-brain' relationship.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I'm wrong (as no doubt I am), ISTM I must have erred in some step or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other of my logic above.  How do I debug it?
