From: &quot;Pete Carlton&quot; &lt;pmcarlton.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But even this goes way out in front of what we can possibly know.  You 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say we have no idea what these feelings are like to experience--but why 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should we assume we even are entitled to ask this question?
</em><br />
<br />And why assume that we are not? I prefer not to have
<br />
my right to ask waived. If I cannot ask it, then I should
<br />
understand why not, and that would be an answer in a
<br />
way.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To borrow a bit from Wittgenstein -- imagine you have completely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; translated these aliens' language, and they tell you that each of them 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has a box with something inside it.  Although they talk a lot in rather 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vague terms about what's in their box, they insist you can't really 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know what is inside it.   Now what is the logical conclusion here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a)  There may or may not be something in the box.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; b)  There's definitely something in the box, and I have absolutely no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea what it is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What on earth could possibly make someone conclude (b) here?  It's not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical at all.  Yet this is what people conclude when they bend over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; backwards talking about &quot;qualia&quot; and how ineffable they are.
</em><br />
<br />And you seem to conclude a (c) hypothesis: &quot;there is
<br />
definitely nothing inside the box&quot;. I stay with (a). And
<br />
to try to find out if there is something there or not, we
<br />
need to talk about it, and &quot;qualia&quot; is the word for the
<br />
hypothetical contents of the box.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So, in addition to the empirical data, there is this extra bit of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information, neither contained in the data nor able to be derived from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it using the laws of physics: what it actually feels like to be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one experiencing the subjective sensation. If someone can think of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; better way to describe it than &quot;extra bit of information&quot; or can come 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; up with a way to formalise it, I would be happy to hear about it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A better way to describe what, exactly?  &quot;What it actually feels like&quot;? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   But why do you first commit yourself to the view that this question 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes any sense?
</em><br />
<br />Suppose a blind man did understand all the chain of events
<br />
that lead from the light reaching the eyes to the retina, then
<br />
to the brain and finally to the qualia of red. Would he see the
<br />
red? Why not?
<br />
<br />I can imagine that I have my vision scrambled in such a way
<br />
that red is exchanged with blue. Red is the color that I associate
<br />
with an apple, and blue to the sky. I can imagine that the sky
<br />
appeared to have the color of an apple and an apple appeared
<br />
to have the sky's color. But if that happened, from then on, I 
<br />
could change the names of the colors in such a way that I still
<br />
called the apple 'red' and the sky 'blue'. If there is no such a
<br />
thing as 'qualia', then nothing really happened. But I could tell
<br />
that things are different. In what sense could they be different?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I suppose there will still be some who insist that if you know all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about the physiology etc. behind the alien response to gamma rays, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then you know all there is to know. I think this response is analogous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to the &quot;shut up and calculate&quot; attitude to the interpretation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; quantum mechanics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I am one of these people.  You say &quot;if you know all about&quot;, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you must be taken seriously here:  you would really have to know &gt;all&lt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about it.  But if you did, you would be able to entirely trace the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causal pathway from the receipt of the gamma rays, to whatever internal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; responses go on inside the alien's body, to the subsequent report of &quot;I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feel that pleasant, odd-multiple feeling&quot;.  Let's say you had that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entire explanation written out.  And &quot;subjective experience&quot; doesn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appear anywhere on this list.  So what reason on earth do you have to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assert that it exists?
</em><br />
<br />When the alien says &quot;I feel that pleasant feeling&quot;, he is just
<br />
saying that he knows that chain of events is happening
<br />
in his body right now. Suppose you are watching him with
<br />
equipments that let you know that same thing. Could you
<br />
also say &quot;I feel that pleasant feeling&quot; too? Why not, if there
<br />
is nothing beyond the chain of events? What could make the
<br />
alien's knowledge different from yours? One obvious answer
<br />
is that &quot;he is the organism where those events are happening&quot;.
<br />
But this means that each organism is entitled to &quot;feel
<br />
something&quot; about himself , an experience that is inaccesible to
<br />
others, no matter how comprehensive their knowledge is. But
<br />
that is something that you are claiming that does not exist.
<br />
How can we explain this without something as &quot;qualia&quot;?
<br />
<br />Sorry for making so many questions. I don't intend to be
<br />
pedantic, but I really don't know the answers.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course subjective experience exists in a way -- but it's just a way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of talking about things.  It isn't a &quot;primitive&quot;.  When I see red, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a subjective experience of red, sure -- but all this means is just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that my brain has responded to a certain stimulus in the way it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normally does.
</em><br />
<br />And maybe it is not all that this means...
<br />
<br />Eric.
