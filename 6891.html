Sorry, but I don't have much of an idea of what is being discussed
<br />
in this thread.  Could you try to enlighten me?
<br />
<br />Rmiller originally wrote
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Equivalence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the individual exists simultaneously across a many-world manifold, then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how can one even define a &quot;copy?&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Well, I would say this (i.e., those words mean the following to me):
<br />
<br />Are you asking what the *meaning* of copy is in this context?  That is,
<br />
are you suggesting that from a physics standpoint, if we have two
<br />
identical (or nearly identical) quantum states at different points
<br />
of the multiverse, then how can *one* of them be picked out as a
<br />
copy of the *other*?  I agree it seems reflexive; that is, if A is
<br />
a copy of B, then B is a copy of A.  But I don't see the significance
<br />
of where this is leading.
<br />
<br />1. An *exact* copy (which I think you are talking about) could in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;principle be obtained from a machine that made an exact molecular
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replicant of one.  Let us further stipulate that one's *exact*
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;environment (say out to a few light-seconds) is also duplicated.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the person has two copies both having identical experiences.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I would use this to help *define* what is meant by existing
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;simultaneously&quot; across a many-world manifold.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the words match at some points and differ at others, then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personality would at a maximum, do likewise---though this is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary---or, for some perhaps, not even likely.
</em><br />
<br />What?  What do you mean by &quot;the words match&quot;?  Do you mean that if
<br />
each copy happens to be speaking?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's been long established that the inner world we navigate is an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstraction of the &quot;real thing&quot;---even if the real world only consists of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one version.  If it consists of several versions, blended into one another, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then how can we  differentiate between them?
</em><br />
<br />By the &quot;inner world&quot; being an abstraction of the &quot;real thing&quot;, I guess
<br />
that you mean our perception of 3 space around us is not an identical
<br />
map of the 3 space around us.  Is that right?  But how could the
<br />
real world be one version? Or do you mean one instance from a set
<br />
of identical versions?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; From a mathematical POV, 200 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds that are absolute copies of themselves, are equivalent to one world. 
</em><br />
<br />Yes, it is a convention of set theory that the set {1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5}
<br />
really has only five elements, not six.  But a good number of us here
<br />
suppose that just as in probability and measure theory, a single point
<br />
can be associated with either a high or low probability.
<br />
<br />But one is free to observe, say, N electrons all in the same state. We
<br />
persist in regarding these as separate electrons, and I don't think 
<br />
that there is anything wrong with that.  It does depend on how you look
<br />
at it (is there only one electron in the universe? Feynman and Wheeler
<br />
suppose that there was in one paper).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If these worlds differ minutely in areas *not encountered or interacted 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with by the percipient (individual), then again we have one percipient, one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world-equivalent...
</em><br />
<br />I just couldn't follow any more of what you are saying.
<br />
<br />Thanks for any clarification, 
<br />
<br />Lee
