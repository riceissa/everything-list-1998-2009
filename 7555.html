<br />I don't know what you mean by &quot;random&quot; in this context.  If you mean
<br />
a string selected at random from among all strings of a certain length,
<br />
the chance that it will turn out to be the same program functionally is
<br />
so low as to be not worth considering.
<br />
<br />But ignoring that, here is how I approach the more general problem of
<br />
whether a given string creates or instantiates a given observer.  I made
<br />
a long posting on this a few weeks ago.  In my opinion it follows simply
<br />
from assuming the Universal Distribution (UD).
<br />
<br />In this model, all information objects are governed by this probability
<br />
distribution, the UD.  One way to think of it is to imagine all possible
<br />
programs being run; then the fraction of programs which instantiate a
<br />
given information object is that object's measure.
<br />
<br />So to solve the problem of whether your program instantiates an
<br />
observer is a two step process.  First write down a description of the
<br />
information pattern that equals that observer.  More specifically, write
<br />
the description of the information pattern that defines that observer
<br />
experiencing the particular moments of consciousness that you want to
<br />
know if your program is instantiating.  Doing this will require a much
<br />
stronger and more detailed theory of conciousness than we now possess,
<br />
but I don't think there is any inherent obstacle that will keep us from
<br />
gaining this ability.
<br />
<br />The second step is to consider your program's output and see if it
<br />
is reasonably similar to the information pattern you just defined.
<br />
The simplest case is where the output is identical.  Then you can
<br />
say that the program does instantiate that consciousness.  However it
<br />
could be that the program basically creates the same pattern but it is
<br />
represented somewhat differently.  How can we consider all possible
<br />
alternate ways of representing an information pattern and still let
<br />
them count, without opening the door so wide that all patterns count?
<br />
<br />The solution follows rigorously from the definition of the UD.  We append
<br />
a second interpretation program to the first one, the one which ran the
<br />
putative conscious program.  This second program turns the output from
<br />
the first one into the canonical form we used to define the conscious
<br />
information pattern.  The concatenation of the two programs then outputs
<br />
the pattern in canonical form and we can recognize it.
<br />
<br />The key point now is that the contribution to the measure of the
<br />
observer moments being simulated is, by the definition of the Universal
<br />
Distribution, based on the size of the program which outputs the
<br />
information pattern in question.  And the size of that program will be the
<br />
size of its two component parts: the first one, that you were wondering
<br />
about, which may have generated a consciousness; and the second one,
<br />
which took the output of the first one and turned it into the canonical
<br />
form which matched the OM pattern in question.
<br />
<br />In other words, the contribution which this program makes to the measure
<br />
of a given observer's experience will be based on the size of the program
<br />
(smaller is better) and on the size of the interpretation program which
<br />
turns the output of the first program into canonical form (again, smaller
<br />
is better).  Obviously a sufficiently large interpretation program can
<br />
turn any output into what we want.  The question is whether a small
<br />
one can do the trick.  That is what tells us that the pattern is really
<br />
there and not something which we are forcing by our interpretation.
<br />
<br />Standard considerations of the UD imply that the exact nature of the
<br />
canonical form used is immaterial, however it does matter how precisely
<br />
you need to specify the information pattern that truly does represent a
<br />
set of conscious observer moments.  That second question is a matter of
<br />
psychology and as we improve our understanding of consciousness we will
<br />
have a better handle on it.  Once we do, this approach will provide an
<br />
in-principle technique to calculate how much contribution to measure
<br />
any given program string makes to any given conscious experience.
<br />
<br />Most importantly, this follows entirely from the assumption of the
<br />
Universal Distribution.  No other assumptions are needed.  It is a simple
<br />
assumption yet it provides a very specific process and rule to answer
<br />
this kind of question.
