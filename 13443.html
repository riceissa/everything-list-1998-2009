</em><br />
<br />When reflective intelligence is applied to cognitive systems which
<br />
reason about teleological concepts (which include values, motivations
<br />
etc) the result is conscious 'feelings'.  Reflective intelligence,
<br />
recall, is the ability to correctly reason about cognitive systems.
<br />
When applied to cognitive systems reasoning about teleological
<br />
concepts this means the ability to correctly determine the
<br />
motivational 'states' of self and others - as mentioned - doing this
<br />
rapidly and accuracy generates 'feelings'.  Since, as has been known
<br />
since Hume, feelings are what ground ethics, the generation of
<br />
feelings which represent accurate tokens about motivational
<br />
automatically leads to ethical behaviour.
<br />
<br />Bad behaviour in humans is due to a deficit in reflective
<br />
intelligence.  It is known for instance, that psychopaths have great
<br />
difficulty perceiving fear and sadness and negative motivational
<br />
states in general.  Correct representation of motivational states is
<br />
correlated with ethical behaviour.  Thus it appears that reflective
<br />
intelligence is automatically correlated with ethical behaviour.  Bear
<br />
in mind, as I mentioned that: (1) There are in fact three kinds of
<br />
general intelligence, and only one of them ('reflective intelligence')
<br />
is correlated with ethics.    The other two are not.  A deficit in
<br />
reflective intelligence does not affect the other two types of general
<br />
intelligence (which is why for instance psychopaths could still score
<br />
highly in IQ tests).  And (2) Reflective intelligence in human beings
<br />
is quite weak.  This is the reason why intelligence does not appear to
<br />
be much correlated with ethics in humans.  But this fact in no way
<br />
refutes the idea that a system with full and strong reflective
<br />
intelligence would automatically be ethical.
