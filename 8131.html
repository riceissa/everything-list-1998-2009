I hope no one minds but it seemed to me that my last few posts re my model 
<br />
were very interesting [at least to me] and so should be joined together for 
<br />
a degree of completeness and so that any comments can use just one post for 
<br />
reference.
<br />
<br />Model
<br />
<br />Definitions:
<br />
<br />The list of all possibilities: The list of all the possible properties and 
<br />
aspects of things.  This list can not be empty since there is unlikely to 
<br />
be less than nothing and a nothing has at least one property - 
<br />
emptiness.  The list is most likely at least countably infinite.
<br />
<br />Information: Information is the potential to establish a boundary on the 
<br />
list of all possibilities.
<br />
<br />Kernel of information: The information relevant to a specific boundary.
<br />
<br />The All: The complete ensemble of kernels.
<br />
<br />The Nothing: That which is empty of all kernels.
<br />
<br />The Everything: The boundary which establishes the All and separates it 
<br />
from the Nothing and thus it also establishes the Nothing.  It could be 
<br />
said to contain both.
<br />
<br />A Something: A division [by a boundary] of the All into two subparts.
<br />
<br />True Noise: The inconsistency of the evolution of a Something reflected in 
<br />
the course of physical reality given to universes within it.
<br />
<br />Model
<br />
<br />Proposal: The Existence of our and other universes and their dynamics are 
<br />
the result of unavoidable definition and logical incompleteness.
<br />
<br />Justification:
<br />
<br />1) Notice that &quot;Defining&quot; is the same as establishing a boundary - on the 
<br />
list of all possibilities [1def] - between what a thing is and what it is 
<br />
not.  This defines a second thing: the &quot;is not&quot;.  A thing can not be 
<br />
defined in isolation.
<br />
<br />2) Given the definitions of the All, the Nothing, and the Everything:
<br />
<br />3) These definitions are interdependent because you can not have one 
<br />
without the whole set.
<br />
<br />4) These definitions are unavoidable because at least one of the [All, 
<br />
Nothing] pair must exist.  Since they form an [is, is not] pair they 
<br />
bootstrap each other into existence via a single combined definition - the 
<br />
Everything.
<br />
<br />5) The Nothing has a logical problem: since it is empty of kernels it can 
<br />
not answer any meaningful question about itself including the unavoidable 
<br />
one of its own stability [persistence].
<br />
<br />6) To answer this unavoidable question the Nothing must at some point 
<br />
&quot;penetrate&quot; the boundary between itself and the All [the only place 
<br />
information resides] in an attempt to complete itself.  This could be 
<br />
viewed as a spontaneous symmetry breaking.
<br />
<br />7) However, the boundary is permanent as required by the definitional [is, 
<br />
is not] pairing and a Nothing must be restored.
<br />
<br />8) Thus the &quot;penetration&quot; process repeats in an always was and always will 
<br />
be manner.
<br />
<br />9) The boundary &quot;penetration&quot; described above produces a shock wave [a 
<br />
boundary] that moves into the All as the old Nothing becomes a Something 
<br />
and tries to complete itself [perhaps like a Big Bang event].  This divides 
<br />
the All into two evolving Somethings - i.e. evolving multiverses.  Evolving 
<br />
Somethings are unlikely to reach completeness short of encompassing the 
<br />
entire All.  Notice that half the multiverses are &quot;contracting&quot; - i.e. 
<br />
losing kernels [but the cardinality of the number of kernels would be at 
<br />
least the cardinality of the list of all possibilities].
<br />
<br />10) Notice that the All also has a logical problem.  Looking at the same 
<br />
meaningful question of its own stability it contains all possible answers 
<br />
because just one answer would constitute an exclusion of specific kernels 
<br />
which is contradictory to the definition of the All as the complete kernel 
<br />
ensemble.   Thus the All is internally inconsistent.
<br />
<br />11) Therefore the motion of a shock wave boundary in the All must echo this 
<br />
inconsistency.  That is each step in the motion as it encompasses kernel 
<br />
after kernel [the evolution of a Something] can not be completely dependent 
<br />
on any past motion of that boundary.
<br />
<br />12) Some kernels are states of universes and when the boundary of an 
<br />
evolving Something passes about a kernel, the kernel can have a moment of 
<br />
physical reality.  [This moment can extend so that successor states can 
<br />
have a degree of overlapping physical reality resulting in a &quot;flow of 
<br />
consciousness&quot; for some sequences for universes that contain Self Aware 
<br />
Structures.]
<br />
<br />13)  From within any Something the future pattern of reality moments due to 
<br />
(11) would be non deterministic i.e. suffer True Noise.
<br />
<br />14) The All of course contains a kernel re the founding definition and thus 
<br />
there is an infinitely nested potential to have All/Nothing pairs.  This 
<br />
completes the system in that the origin of the dynamic basically destroys 
<br />
[Nothing, All] pairs but there is an infinite potential to form new Nothings.
<br />
<br />An analysis of the model:
<br />
<br />My model's foundation is not mathematics but the list of potential 
<br />
properties of things.  The only mathematical like concepts I then use are 
<br />
power set, incompleteness, and inconsistency and these are derived from 
<br />
simply parsing the list.  If my list is infinite and countable and its line 
<br />
items representable by finite bit strings then my starting point is just 
<br />
the natural numbers [including zero] along with an assignment of meaning to 
<br />
each.
<br />
<br />As I understand it the cardinality of the set of subsets of the natural 
<br />
numbers [i.e. the All and its kernels as power set] is the same as the 
<br />
cardinality of the reals i.e. c.   One can therefore form a one to one 
<br />
correspondence between the kernels and the reals.  In this pairing the real 
<br />
member of the pair can be thought of as representing the kernel half of the 
<br />
pair.  Therefore the All is just the set of reals with an assigned meaning 
<br />
for each.
<br />
<br />Self awareness and consciousness:
<br />
<br />If the All is just the set of reals with an assigned meaning for each then 
<br />
undoubtedly some of these meanings would be kernels that contain sub 
<br />
kernels describing Self Aware Structures [SAS].  Given the random nature of 
<br />
the dynamic I derive in my model for the evolution of Somethings, the 
<br />
Instantation of Reality given to kernels as they are encompassed by the 
<br />
Somethings will have dwells of all durations.  Some dwells for some kernels 
<br />
representing states of universes will have a duration that provides an 
<br />
apparent connection between states or &quot;flow of awareness&quot;  [a &quot;flow of 
<br />
consciousness&quot;] for its SAS.
