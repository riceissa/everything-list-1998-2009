Which approximates my ideas on the nature of reality and the possible role
<br />
of intelligence.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />(MARTIN REES:) This is a really good time to be a cosmologist, because in
<br />
the last few years some of the questions we've been addressing for decades
<br />
have come into focus. For instance, we can now say what the main ingredients
<br />
of the universe are: it's made of 4% atoms, about 25% dark matter, and 71%
<br />
mysterious dark energy latent in empty space. That's settled a question that
<br />
we've wondered about, certainly the entire 35 years I've been doing
<br />
cosmology. 
<br />
<br />We also know the shape of space. The universe is 'flat'-in the technical
<br />
sense that the angles of even very large triangles add up to 180 degrees.
<br />
This is an important result that we couldn't have stated with confidence two
<br />
years ago. So a certain phase in cosmology is now over. 
<br />
<br />But as in all of science, when you make an advance, you bring a new set of
<br />
questions into focus. And there are really two quite separate sets of
<br />
questions that we are now focusing on. One set of questions addresses the
<br />
more 'environmental' side of the subject-we're trying to understand how,
<br />
from an initial Big Bang nearly 14 billion years ago, the universe has
<br />
transformed itself into the immensely complex cosmos we see around us, of
<br />
stars and galaxies, etc.; how around some of those stars and planets arose;
<br />
and how on at least one planet, around at least one star, a biological
<br />
process got going, and led to atoms assembling into creatures like
<br />
ourselves, able to wonder about it all. That's an unending quest-to
<br />
understand how the simplicity led to complexity. To answer it requires ever
<br />
more computer modeling, and data in all wavebands from ever more sensitive
<br />
telescopes. 
<br />
<br />Another set of questions that come into focus are the following: 
<br />
<br />*	  Why is the universe expanding the way it is? 
<br />
*	  Why does it have the rather arbitrary mix of ingredients? 
<br />
*	  Why is it governed by the particular set of laws which seem to
<br />
prevail in it, and which physicists study? 
<br />
<br />These are issues where we can now offer a rather surprising new perspective.
<br />
The traditional idea has been that the laws of nature are somehow unique;
<br />
they're given, and are 'there' in a platonic sense independent of the
<br />
universe which somehow originates and follows those laws. 
<br />
<br />I've been puzzled for a long time about why the laws of nature are set up in
<br />
such a way that they allow complexity. That's an enigma because we can
<br />
easily imagine laws of nature which weren't all that different from the ones
<br />
we observe, but which would have led to a rather boring universe-laws which
<br />
led to a universe containing dark matter and no atoms; laws where you
<br />
perhaps had hydrogen atoms but nothing more complicated, and therefore no
<br />
chemistry; laws where there was no gravity, or a universe where gravity was
<br />
so strong that it crushed everything; or the lifetime was so short that
<br />
there was no time for evolution. 
<br />
<br />It always seemed to me a mystery why the universe was, as it were,
<br />
'biophilic'-why it had laws that allowed this amount of complexity. To give
<br />
an analogy from mathematics, think of the Mandelbrot Set; there's a fairly
<br />
simple formula, a simple recipe that you can write down, which describes
<br />
this amazingly complicated pattern, with layer upon layer of structure. Now
<br />
you could also write down other rather similar-looking recipes, similar
<br />
algorithms, which describe a rather boring pattern. What has always seemed
<br />
to me a mystery is why the recipe, or code, that determined our universe had
<br />
these rich consequences, just as the algorithms of the Mandelbrot set rather
<br />
than describing something rather boring, in which nothing as complicated as
<br />
us could exist. 
<br />
<br />For about 20 years I've suspected that the answer to this question is that
<br />
perhaps our universe isn't unique. Perhaps, even, the laws are not unique.
<br />
Perhaps there were many Big Bangs which expanded in different ways, governed
<br />
by different laws, and we are just in the one that has the right conditions.
<br />
This thought in some respect parallels the way our concept of planets and
<br />
planetary systems has changed. 
<br />
<br />People used to wonder: why is the earth in this rather special orbit around
<br />
this rather special star, which allows water to exist or allows life to
<br />
evolve? It looks somehow fine-tuned. We now perceive nothing remarkable in
<br />
this, because we know that there are millions of stars with retinues of
<br />
planets around them: among that huge number there are bound to be some that
<br />
have the conditions right for life. We just happen to live on one of that
<br />
small subset. So there's no mystery about the fine-tuned nature of the
<br />
earth's orbit; it's just that life evolved on one of millions of planets
<br />
where things were right. 
<br />
<br />It now seems an attractive idea that our Big Bang is just one of many: just
<br />
as our earth is a planet that happens to have the right conditions for life,
<br />
among the many many planets that exist, so our universe, and our Big Bang,
<br />
is the one out of many which happens to allow life to emerge, to allow
<br />
complexity. This was originally just a conjecture, motivated by a wish to
<br />
explain the apparent fine-tuning in our universe-and incidentally a way to
<br />
undercut the so-called theological design argument, which said that there
<br />
was something special about these laws. 
<br />
<br />But what's happened in the last few years, and particularly  sin the last
<br />
year, is that the basis for this so-called multiverse idea has strengthened,
<br />
and, moreover, the scale which we envisage for the multiverse has got even
<br />
vaster than we had in mind a few years ago. There's a firmer basis for the
<br />
'multiverse' concept because recent work on the best theory we have for the
<br />
fundamental laws of nature, namely superstring theory, suggests that there
<br />
should indeed be many possible forms for a universe, and many possible laws
<br />
of nature. 
<br />
<br />At first it was thought that there might be just one unique solution to the
<br />
equations, just one possible three-dimensional universe with one possible
<br />
'vacuum state' and one set of laws. But it seems now, according to the
<br />
experts, that there could be a huge number. In fact Lenny Susskind claims
<br />
that there could be more possible types of universe than there are atoms in
<br />
our universe-a quite colossal variety. The system of universes could be even
<br />
more intricate and complex than the biosphere of our planet. This really is
<br />
a mind-blowing concept, especially when we bear in mind that each of those
<br />
universes could themselves be infinite. 
<br />
<br />At first sight you might get worried about an infinity of things in
<br />
themselves infinite, but to deal with this you have to draw on a body of
<br />
mathematics called transfinite number theory, that goes back to Cantor in
<br />
the 19th century. Just as many kinds of pure mathematics have already been
<br />
taken over by physicists, this rather arcane subject of transfinite numbers
<br />
is now becoming relevant, because we've got to think of infinities of
<br />
infinity. Indeed, there's perhaps even a higher hierarchy of infinities: in
<br />
addition to our universe being infinite, and there being an infinite number
<br />
of possible laws of nature, we may want to incorporate the so-called many
<br />
worlds theory of quantum mechanics. 
<br />
<br />Each 'classical' universe is then replaced by an infinite number of
<br />
super-imposed universes, so that when there's a quantum choice to be made
<br />
the path forks into extra universes. This immensely complicated construct is
<br />
the consequence of ideas that are still speculative but are firming up. One
<br />
of the most exciting frontiers of 21st century physics, is to utilize the
<br />
new mathematics and the new cosmology to come to terms with all this. 
<br />
<br />What we've traditionally called 'our universe' is just a tiny part of
<br />
something which is infinite, so allows for many replicas of us elsewhere (in
<br />
our same space-time domain, but far beyond the horizon of our observations),
<br />
but even that infinite universe is just one element of an ensemble that
<br />
encompasses an infinity of quite different universes. So that's the pattern
<br />
adumbrated by cosmology and some versions of string theory.  What we have
<br />
normally called the laws of nature are not universal laws-they're just
<br />
parochial by-laws in our cosmic patch, no more than that, and a variety of
<br />
quite different regimes prevail elsewhere in the ensemble.
<br />
<br />One thing which struck me recently, and I found it a really disconcerting
<br />
concept, was that once we accept all that, we get into a very deep set of
<br />
questions about the nature of physical reality. That's because even in our
<br />
universe, and certainly in some of the others, there'd be the potential for
<br />
life to develop far beyond the level it's reached on earth today. We are
<br />
probably not the culmination of evolution on earth; the time lying ahead for
<br />
the earth is as long as the time it's elapsed to get from single-celled
<br />
organisms to us, and so life could spread in a post-human phase far beyond
<br />
the earth. In other universes there may be an even richer potentiality for
<br />
life and complexity. 
<br />
<br />Now life and complexity means information-processing power; the most complex
<br />
conceivable entities may not be organic life, but some sort of
<br />
hyper-computers. But once you accept that our universe, or even other
<br />
universes, may allow the emergence within them of immense complexity, far
<br />
beyond our human brains, far beyond the kind of computers we can conceive,
<br />
perhaps almost at the level of the limits that Seth Lloyd discusses for
<br />
computers-then you get a rather extraordinary conclusion. These super or
<br />
hyper-computers would have the capacity to simulate not just a simple part
<br />
of reality, but a large fraction of an entire universe. 
<br />
<br />And then of course the question arises: if these simulations exist in far
<br />
larger numbers than the universe themselves, could we be in one of them?
<br />
Could we ourselves not be part of what we think of as bedrock physical
<br />
reality? Could we be ideas in the mind of some supreme being, as it were,
<br />
who's running a simulation? Indeed, if the simulations outnumber the
<br />
universes, as they would if one universe contained many computers making
<br />
many simulations, then the likelihood is that we are 'artificial life' in
<br />
this sense. This concept opens up the possibility of a new kind of 'virtual
<br />
time travel', because the advanced beings creating the simulation can, in
<br />
effect, rerun the past. It's not a time-loop in a traditional sense: it's a
<br />
reconstruction of the past, allowing advanced beings to explore their
<br />
history.
<br />
<br />All these multiverse ideas lead to a remarkable synthesis between cosmology
<br />
and physics, giving substance to ideas that some of us had ten or 20 years
<br />
ago. But they also lead to the extraordinary consequence that we may not be
<br />
the deepest reality, we may be a simulation. The possibility that we are
<br />
creations of some supreme, or super-being, blurs the boundary between
<br />
physics and idealist philosophy, between the natural and the supernatural,
<br />
and between the relation of mind and multiverse and the possibility that
<br />
we're in the matrix rather than the physics itself. 
<br />
<br />Once you accept the idea of the multiverse, and that some universes will
<br />
have immense potentiality for complexity, it's a logical consequence that in
<br />
some of those universes there will be the potential to simulate parts of
<br />
themselves, and you may get sort of infinite regress, so we don't know where
<br />
reality stops and where the minds and ideas take over, and we don't know
<br />
what our place is in this grand ensemble of universes and simulated
<br />
universes.
<br />
<br />~~~
<br />
<br /><br />Considerations of the multiverse change the way we think about ourselves and
<br />
our place in the world. Traditional religion is far too blinkered to
<br />
encompass the complexities of mind and cosmos. All we can expect is to have
<br />
a very incomplete and metaphorical view of this deep reality. The gulf
<br />
between mind and matter is something we don't understand at all, and some
<br />
minds can evolve to the stage that they can create other minds, there's real
<br />
blurring between the natural and the supernatural. 
<br />
<br />My attitude towards religion is really two-fold. First, as far as the
<br />
practice of religion is concerned, I appreciate it and participate in it,
<br />
but I'm skeptical about the value of interactive dialogue There's no
<br />
conflict between religion and science (except, of course, with naive
<br />
creationism and suchlike) , but I doubt-unlike some members of the Templeton
<br />
Foundation-that theological insights can help me with my physics. I'm
<br />
fascinated to talk to philosophers (and with some theologians) about their
<br />
work, but I don't believe they can help me very much. So I favor peaceful
<br />
coexistence rather than constructive dialogue between science and theology
