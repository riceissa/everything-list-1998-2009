<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to explain this. I do identify machine and their godel numbers (or any

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finite description of the machine) at some point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />The question of the &quot;meaning of life&quot;, and also the problem of (the 
<br />
existence of) evil (whether you believe in God not), has at its core 
<br />
the question of what is this &quot;non-thing&quot; entity called a &quot;person&quot;?
<br />
<br />By the way, the problem of evil that I am referring to is simply the 
<br />
problem of the existence of evil.  We just know it exists.  We see 
<br />
people treated as things. We know it is wrong.  The simple existence 
<br />
of evil is a problem.  I'm not talking about the wrongness of a 
<br />
logical contradiction.  I'm talking about something that is even 
<br />
&quot;wronger than&quot; that.  When I talk about the problem of evil,  I'm 
<br />
talking about something that is *really* wrong, down at the core level 
<br />
of reality.  The reason that something defined by persons (such as a 
<br />
person being treated as a &quot;non-person&quot;) can be &quot;really wrong&quot; at the 
<br />
deepest level is that the essence of a person is something that lies 
<br />
at the deepest level of reality.  This is why the &quot;problem of evil&quot; in 
<br />
general has been so hard to &quot;figure out&quot;.  It's because the very 
<br />
definition of the problem is illusive without defining what a person 
<br />
is.  We try to define the problem by saying evil is a logical 
<br />
contradiction with whatever theory someone has, but this actually only 
<br />
proves even more how lost we are in figuring it out, and even more 
<br />
lost in solving it.
<br />
<br />In the same way the &quot;meaning of life&quot; question on one hand seems 
<br />
nebulous and unuseful from a scientific viewpoint.  But it is the 
<br />
ultimate question.  We may ask, &quot;What is the meaning of the 'meaning 
<br />
of life'?&quot; But that just illustrates the meaning of the question 
<br />
itself. Perhaps this is one of the attributes of a &quot;person&quot;, that we 
<br />
continually, recursively, as the question of meaning.  We just *know* 
<br />
what the meaning is of the question, &quot;What is the meaning of life?&quot; 
<br />
Thus, the essence of what a person is is key to this question, and key 
<br />
to the answer!
<br />
<br />Now when it comes to mathematical/logical systems, and Bruno's 
<br />
arguments, I think that we can see a &quot;type&quot;, or analogy, of what is 
<br />
going on here.  Through arguments that use things such as Church's 
<br />
Thesis, diagonalization, the excluded middle, we can see that there 
<br />
are always some systems or sets which are provably not describable by 
<br />
other systems or sets.  I don't think this ultimately resolves the 
<br />
problem of evil or the meaning of life.  But I do think that it is 
<br />
perhaps a &quot;picture&quot; of the limitlessness that is possible, even 
<br />
necessary.  It shows us the infinite proportions of these problems.  
<br />
They are intractable by human persons, and yet have at their core the 
<br />
essence of what a person is.
<br />
