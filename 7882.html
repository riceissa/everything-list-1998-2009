<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;     I would like for you to consider that we should not take OMs as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;objective processes&quot; but the result of &quot;objective processes&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course, I will bow to whatever word usage is favored by most of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the people, or by those who have the longest experience with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; term.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, but here we are divided. Those who thinks OM precede, logically,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physical world and those who thinks the physical world precedes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the OM. It is a main point of discussion.
</em><br />
<br />I think that you misunderstand. Stephen's contention as stated here is
<br />
whether they're *objective* or merely the result of such objective processes
<br />
and so subjective in nature.  I had said that I thought they ought to be
<br />
regarded as objective (I have little patience with subjective phenomena)
<br />
and he was asking me to consider whether they should be considered subjective.
<br />
So: you can suggest that the *meaning* of them be as subjective, or that the
<br />
*meaning* be as &quot;objective processes&quot;, e.g., those available for scrutiny
<br />
from a 3rd person point of view (even if it's kind of hard with our technology
<br />
today).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; For example, if I am poked with a needle and cry out, one may wish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to proclaim to me &quot;see, you do have a subjective reality&quot;.  &quot;Oh, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; really hurt,&quot; I'll admit &quot;but if you want to really know what happened
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then the needle caused some nerves in my finger to fire, which caused
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; other nerves to fire and so on. I am a process fashioned by evolution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to object to actions like poking me.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have no problem with that. Actually by admitting &quot;that hurts&quot; you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; admit the subjectivity. By dismissing discourse on it, you agree on its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ineffable aspect. And by admitting it is related to evolution, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; admit implicitly the mind-body problem: why nature would have associate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ineffable perception when only triggering neurons could make me behave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the right way.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, except the last sentence:  I for one cannot imagine any other way
<br />
that nature could have done it without the intervention of Higher Powers.
<br />
There has to be an ineffable perception: just what the hell is an entity
<br />
to say to itself and to others if there were not?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I shudder every time I read of notions that imply some kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; knowledge of &quot;reality in itself&quot;!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yeah, well now you know how it feels!  :-)   Feels, that is, every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; time that someone speaks of inner truths not accessible to anyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; else, not accessible in *principle* to anyone else.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this is the case of the *hurting* needle. If you can give me a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purely third person communication that the needle hurts you, just give
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me it.
</em><br />
<br />Sure, and I already did: the needle triggered nerves in my finger which
<br />
caused other nerves to fire which cause other nerves to fire in my brain
<br />
so that the machine (I mean me and my body) sought avoidance planning
<br />
and actions.  I spoke out loud to deter future such incidents. I remembered
<br />
the incident.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; those things to rank very highly on the scale of truth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Take someone. Put the needle in the finger of that someone. Tell him
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now that you don't rank very highly his personal feeling on the scale
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of truth!
</em><br />
<br />Of course, being a sensible fellow like you and me, he'll understand
<br />
what is meant: the nature of his pain is, as you say, ineffable.
<br />
Evolution also built in sympathy and altruism in us which causes me
<br />
to &quot;feel his pain&quot; in a sympathetic way.  I do &quot;feel his pain&quot;, if
<br />
we are to take that phrase in the right way.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Try to give him a third person proof of that!   Tell him &quot;Come on,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that's only some firing neurons!&quot;. You frighten me a little bit!
</em><br />
<br />That's ONLY SOME FIRING NEURONS!!???   You jest.  Or rather, you may
<br />
be putting up a straw man (that can be easily knocked down).  Any
<br />
doctor, for example, who is indifferent to &quot;firing neurons&quot; should
<br />
seek another profession, presumably one that a psychopath would be
<br />
comfortable in.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose you explain [to] me what is a succession of states and how that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could give some person a feeling of headache. And suppose you are so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good that you convince me. Now, 'to be convinced'  is a first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective experience. Is that convincing not also just a succession of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states? If you use that reduction for dismissing the headache, why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shouldn't we use to dismiss the convincing? But then how could we still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give sense to any argument?
</em><br />
<br />Remember: I'm not dismissing the headache any more than I would an
<br />
animal getting cruelly jabbed with a needle. You seem to assume that
<br />
a 3rd person description cannot be a sympathetic one.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Your real knowledge, (for example, that some people have been to Hawaii or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that you have two hands or that four gas giants revolve around the sun), has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; survived the tests of time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But that most humans suffer on the planet, and sometime somewhere more,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   this does not survive the tests of time?
</em><br />
<br />Of course it does. Even apes and elephants know it.  They know, that is,
<br />
that others can be in pain the way that they are. Naturally, they don't
<br />
have any language at all with which to discuss it.  Naturally, they cannot
<br />
strive to have what they say be objectively true.
