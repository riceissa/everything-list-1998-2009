<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IMHO, this latter situation seem to be what D. Deutsch proposes as a test
</em><br />
for his MWI. If we can create a physical implementation of a quantum
<br />
computation &gt;that has greater computational power than that allowed by the
<br />
classical (as per the Copenhagen Interpretation or other interpretations)
<br />
case, then it would &gt;verify .MWI. A failure of such would be a
<br />
falsification.
<br />
<br />Perhaps Stephen, but I offer that it would ultimately only lend support to
<br />
the view that the classical model is incomplete. This reasoning reminds me
<br />
of the anecdote about the eminent astronomer who, when his student commented
<br />
on how naive it was that for so long people believed the earth to be the
<br />
center of the universe , replied &quot;on the contrary, given a belief that one
<br />
is stationary relative to the celestial panoply and given no
<br />
additional hard evidence other than the sun, for instance, appearing in the
<br />
east -arcing across the sky - then sinking out of sight in the west, it
<br />
would be foolish to think otherwise&quot;. It was at the time the simplest
<br />
explanation, lacking any solid additional detailed observation. And it was
<br />
simply wrong.
<br />
<br />On the subject of consciousness, I wonder how fruitful it is to conduct
<br />
thought experiments that infer the observer's consciousness. The reason I
<br />
wonder this is (because I am? no, that's another story..) that I'm reading
<br />
more and more of late about the &quot;zombie within&quot; concept where it seems that
<br />
while we operate under the illusion of &quot;self&quot; control, in fact some entity
<br />
that is the product of one's integrated anatomical and physiological
<br />
pattern is actually acting and reacting measurably before &quot;I&quot; am aware; even
<br />
when I believe I thought of and &quot;initiated&quot; the action. Whether or not one
<br />
is hallucinating, we may in fact all be in the end delusional.
<br />
<br />My question is: if &quot;real&quot;, how does the above situation effect assumptions
<br />
that are founded on the assumption of a single conscious observer/actor's
<br />
&quot;first person&quot; experience? Perhaps all we can safely refer to is the
<br />
observerand make no additional claims as to their, or even my own,
<br />
conscious experience *lacking additional supportive empirical data*.
<br />
<br />Cheers
