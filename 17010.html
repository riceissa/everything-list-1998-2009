<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hi Brent,

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; You are asserting monism.  But the One, the ur-stuff, is ineffable/unknowable. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; So when we place ourselves in the world it is by making distinctions within the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; unity.  To become distinct from the background (the One) is what it means to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; RITSIAR.  Right?

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;       
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; How do you know that the One, the ur-stuff, is ineffable/unknowable?  If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your being, for example, was the ur-stuff (I assume you mean akin to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; urelements in set theory), then it is &quot;effable&quot; and knowable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You have written about it, and at least two of its properties, and so it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is not completely ineffable, yes?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So I think it is &quot;effable&quot; even if it is exceedingly difficult to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; describe fully.  What I'm having trouble believing is that it is unknowable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the above I was trying to paraphrase what David wrote.  I don't have a final 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory, but if I did it would include some ontology and that would be effable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (no point in having a theory you can't use to theorize).  But even if I did I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't think it would be possible to *know* that it was the final theory.  So 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's unknowable in that sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<br />That's a very interesting point.  The way science goes is that it 
<br />
continually doubts itself and consequently revises itself when new data 
<br />
come in, even if that data is paradigm-shattering.  They'll gleefully 
<br />
justify starting a new theory that is closer to the &quot;final theory.&quot;  Due 
<br />
to this aspect of the nature of science, science would never be able to 
<br />
prove its own final theory /is /a final theory.  Someone like me would 
<br />
say, &quot;no new data has contradicted our final theory for a thousand years 
<br />
does *not* imply there will be a need for revision after 1,001 years.&quot;  
<br />
That's a form of scientific uncertainty.  This uncertainty among the 
<br />
scientific community (ie science can't prove final theory is final) 
<br />
could possibly yield to other avenues of investigation such as AI, math, 
<br />
philosophy, and perhaps some theoretical physics (eg Tegmark).  Perhaps 
<br />
the final theory will be completely mathematical in nature, like how 
<br />
mathematical M-theory is now.  Then it stands to reason that the only 
<br />
people who could prove it is final are the mathematicians, the cog sci 
<br />
people, the AI computer science people, etc..  Whether it could be 
<br />
proven final depends on that final theory; ie the final theory should 
<br />
make as one of its predictions that it is the final theory.  Then 
<br />
mathematicians (and whoever else) try to prove that theory is 
<br />
&quot;satisfiable&quot; which would mean it (the theory) is consistent.  However, 
<br />
something surprising might be true, that the final theory is undecidable 
<br />
in the following sense: for the final theory, along with &quot;This theory is 
<br />
final&quot; as a statement in the theory, there is no &quot;effective procedure&quot; 
<br />
for determining if a generic statement is true or false.
<br />
<br />Consistency combined with undecidability is an interesting for a set of 
<br />
formulas (like the final theory), because while every statement is 
<br />
either true (or false), it may very well be that it is true (or false) 
<br />
and no matter how clever you are, you won't prove it true (or false, as 
<br />
the case may be).  If knowable means you have to know the proof, then 
<br />
there are some statements are true but you'll never have a proof that it 
<br />
is true.  However, there still might be an escape from not knowing:: an 
<br />
omniscient &quot;thing&quot; (like a perfect Turing-like machine) explaining to 
<br />
you how to know what was previously not known.  An answer key, if you 
<br />
will, on any statement.  You can ask &quot;what is God&quot; or &quot;what is my 
<br />
purpose&quot; and it will tell you something that is true but there is no 
<br />
proof for.
<br />
<br />But...  You can't prove the answer key is the answer key.  Then it 
<br />
becomes a question of doubt: why should I believe the answer key before 
<br />
me is correct?
<br />
<br />IDK, I think I'm going off on wild tangents now.  My apologies.
<br />
<br /><br />-Brian
