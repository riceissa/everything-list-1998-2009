On another list Wei Dai posted some questions.  At this time I wish to
<br />
attempt some answers to be placed on public record.  These were
<br />
excellent questions.
<br />
<br />Wei Dai wrote&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here are my questions:
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How does math really work? Why do we believe that P!=NP even though we don't
</em><br />
have a proof one way or the other?
<br />
<br />Math is composed of three levels of abstraction:
<br />
<br />(1) Patonic forms that exist outside of space and time
<br />
<br /><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/</a>
<br />
<br />(2) Cognitive systems that consist of information processing
<br />
(algorithms, logic, probability networks)
<br />
<br />Exmaples:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic</a>
<br />
<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Bayes/bayes.html">http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Bayes/bayes.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br />(3) Human artifacts that consist of human created categories and
<br />
representations of things (ontologies)
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_%28computer_science%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_%28computer_science%29</a>
<br />
<br />When doing human mathematics, we are attempting to match (2) - our
<br />
cognitive systems of logic which exist inside space and time to (1)
<br />
the platonic forms which exist outside space-time.  We can thus
<br />
legitimately assign true/false designations to mathematical
<br />
assertions. (a postulated platonic form may explain or fail to explain
<br />
the operations of our computations- if the postulated platonic form
<br />
fails to explain empricial properties of computational systems we
<br />
assign the designation 'false' to the mathematical assertion.  If the
<br />
postulated platonic form does explain empricial computational
<br />
properties we have empirical evidence for calling it 'true').     (3) -
<br />
ontologies - data models - programming languages - are 'secondary
<br />
mathematical properties' (analgous to 'secondary physical properties'
<br />
such as color in the physical domain).  These are human inventions
<br />
which we use to reflect upon (reason about) mathematics.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How does induction really work? Why do we intuitively know that, contra
</em><br />
Solomonoff Induction, we shouldn't believe in the non-existence of
<br />
halting-problem oracles no matter what evidence we may see?
<br />
<br />See above.  Be careful to seperate out the notion of induction as an
<br />
empirical  mathematical *procedure* (system which exists inside space
<br />
and time), from the notion of the abstract platonic form which that
<br />
procedure represents (this is the algebraic relation or category which
<br />
has a platonic existence outside space and time).
<br />
<br />When doing Induction we engaging in generalizations.  This is the
<br />
process of modifying our postulated explanations about platonic forms
<br />
(relations, categories) as new information comes in. (see above - we
<br />
are attempting to match our own finite information about platonic
<br />
forms with the platonic forms themselves).   The probabilities and
<br />
uncertainties are not properties of the platonic forms themselves.
<br />
They simply reflect our own uncertainities about these platonic forms,
<br />
arising from the fact that we are finite beings existing inside space
<br />
and time.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is there such a thing as absolute complexity (as opposed to complexity
</em><br />
relative to a Turing machine or some other construct)?
<br />
<br />Yes there is.  See above.  Asbolute complexity is a platonic notion
<br />
which exists outside space and time - it is what enbables one to fix
<br />
the 'mathematical identitiy' a given Turing machine existing inside
<br />
space and time.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How does qualia work? Why do certain patterns of neuron firings translate
</em><br />
into sensations of pain, and other patterns into pleasure?
<br />
<br />Qualia arise from the fact that there are many different ways to
<br />
*represent* the same reality in logical terms.  Ontology is the means
<br />
through which the mind *reflects* upon mathematics.  An ontology is a
<br />
way of *communicating* (representing) logical meanings.   To do this
<br />
the mind has to divide reality up into *objects*, *attribites* and
<br />
*relations*.  See wiki entry on ontology:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_%28computer_science%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_%28computer_science%29</a>
<br />
<br />But any given ontology is a *secondary mathematical property* - it is
<br />
an invention of the mind, not a feature of reality itself.  There are
<br />
many different ways of *dividing up* reality into an ontology, and
<br />
hence the mind ends up with many different ontologies.  An order to
<br />
create an integrated logical view of reality, the mind has to have a
<br />
way to translate between all the different ontology.  The logical
<br />
meaning of a concept is thus:
<br />
<br />A collection of ontologies
<br />
A way to translate between them in order to integrate them.
<br />
<br />And this way of representing logical concepts are what generate
<br />
Qualia.  To summarize:  Qualia are logical *represenations* of the
<br />
meaning of  concepts consisting of onotologies and ontology merging -
<br />
this is compatible with global workspace theory - see -

<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How does morality work? If I take a deterministic program that simulates a
</em><br />
neuron firing pattern that represents pleasure, and run it twice, is
<br />
that
<br />
twice as good as running it once? Or good at all?
<br />
<br />There are three levels of abstraction in morality, just as there were
<br />
in mathematics:
<br />
<br />(1) Objective platonic forms
<br />
(2) Calculational (cognitve) processes which perform moral
<br />
calculations
<br />
(3) The outputs of (2) - the human created ethica/political systems,
<br />
memes and rules
<br />
<br />Your question is asking about the value of utilitarianism.
<br />
Utilitarianism attempts to calculate an 'over-all' utility for many
<br />
different agents and in recommends the outcome that maximizes this.
<br />
As a caculational device (2) , it is a reasonable over-all guide to
<br />
morality  (a good 'rough approximation') but it is not a complete
<br />
theory of morality.  Here's what wrong with it:
<br />
<br />(a) it is merely a calculational device (2), which fails to get at the
<br />
underlaying explanatory principles of morality (the platonic forms).
<br />
<br />(b) Even as a pragmatic calculational device, utiliarianism fails
<br />
since it cannot handle *reflection* - utiliarianism only  deals with
<br />
external (operational behaviour) of agents and cannot say what an
<br />
agent should want (internally, in terms of internal mental states).
<br />
<br />As per your specific question above, in general the program run twice
<br />
would be better than the program run once, but this only 'in general'
<br />
- in a specific context it may be worse (due to the fact that
<br />
utilitarianism is only an approximation to morality and far from a
<br />
complete theory).   Nor would it be true even in general that the
<br />
outcome is twice as good.
<br />
<br />For your information, the three kinds of platonic telelogical forms
<br />
and the moral theories which deal indirectly with them are as follows:
<br />
<br />Virtues - Internal moral properties of agents.  (Characteristics -
<br />
exmaples  'tricky', 'generous', 'helpful').  Handled by deontological
<br />
theories of morality.  See for instance:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/v/virtue.htm">http://www.iep.utm.edu/v/virtue.htm</a>
<br />
<br />These theories have serious limitations.  They are a '1st
<br />
approximation' to morality only.
<br />
<br />Morals - Decision Making.  The process of decision making resulting in
<br />
external consqueneces. ie Interactions with others.  Consequentialist
<br />
and utilitarinaism theories of morality handled by decision theory.
<br />
See for instance:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism</a>
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism</a>
<br />
<a href="http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/Q023?&amp;authstatuscode=202">http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/Q023?&amp;authstatuscode=202</a>
<br />
<br />Decision theory/Utiliarianism/Consequentalism is a more general theory
<br />
of morality than the theories of Virtue ethics (in fact decision
<br />
theory superceded and subsumes theories of virtue ethics).  It's in
<br />
effect a '2nd order' theory of morality which is the current human
<br />
'state of the art' in morality.  But it has weakness (see above).  It
<br />
is not the last word.... (read on)....
<br />
<br /><br />Aesthetics - Aesthetical properties are the most general type of
<br />
values.  The theories capable of dealing with these properties are the
<br />
most general type of moral theories.  They are a '3rd order' moral
<br />
theory which includes and supercedes both virtue ethics and decision
<br />
theory.
<br />
<br />Aesthetics.  See:
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics</a>
<br />
<br />I do not choose to reveal you what these theories entail at this time,
<br />
since these theories are what supercede and resolve all the problems
<br />
of ordinary decision theory and utilitarianism (for instance solving
<br />
the puzzles of 'reflection').  Be patient.  All will be revealed to
<br />
this list in good time ;)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why am I me, and not one of the billions of other people on Earth, or one of
</em><br />
the many people in other parts of the multiverse?
<br />
<br />You are here asking for  an identity condition.  This requires the
<br />
advanced theory mentioned above (the one I'm not revealing yet) - I
<br />
have told you  that this theory deals with aesthetic values.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;makes me think that intelligence != optimization process. Does anyone have a
</em><br />
counterargument?
<br />
<br />Not at all, you are very astute Wei my friend. Intelligence is indeed
<br />
*not* reducible to an optimization process for reasons I tried to
<br />
explain above.
<br />
