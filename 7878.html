<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stephen writes

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     I would like for you to consider that we should not take OMs as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;objective processes&quot; but the result of &quot;objective processes&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, I will bow to whatever word usage is favored by most of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the people, or by those who have the longest experience with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; term.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, but here we are divided. Those who thinks OM precede, logically, 
<br />
the physical world and those who thinks the physical world precedes  
<br />
the OM. It is a main point of discussion.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I merely want to assert that I don't and never have found
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any real value in what is not objective.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would like to insist that most of us do the same assertion. It is 
<br />
just that we acknowledge the existence of subjectivity. Like you 
<br />
actually. Then, a reasoning shows that in some theory (like comp)  
<br />
subjectivity has a an objective role with objective, albeit indirect, 
<br />
verifiable consequences. (Where you think subjectivity is purely 
<br />
epiphenomenal. That cannot be! (unless you assume you are a subtantial 
<br />
infinite non turing emulable soul).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, if I am poked with a needle and cry out, one may wish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to proclaim to me &quot;see, you do have a subjective reality&quot;.  &quot;Oh, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really hurt,&quot; I'll admit &quot;but if you want to really know what happened
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then the needle caused some nerves in my finger to fire, which caused
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other nerves to fire and so on. I am a process fashioned by evolution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to object to actions like poking me.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have no problem with that. Actually by admitting &quot;that hurts&quot; you 
<br />
admit the subjectivity. By dismissing discourse on it, you agree on its 
<br />
ineffable aspect. And by admitting it is related to evolution, you 
<br />
admit implicitly the mind-body problem: why nature would have associate 
<br />
ineffable perception when only triggering neurons could make me behave 
<br />
in the right way.
<br />
And so you are perhaps closer to the mind-body &quot;solution&quot; which emerges 
<br />
by itself from computer science, which is that any machine which 
<br />
introspect itself discover soon enough an objectively ineffable 
<br />
gigantic a-spatial atemporal, but mathematically and &quot;physically&quot; 
<br />
explorable reality. Godel did not only discover incompleteness. He 
<br />
discovered that machine can discover their incompleteness.  That is 
<br />
what I exploit. The sufficiently rich (lobian) does discover the 
<br />
geometry of that incompleteness and why that geometry should operate in 
<br />
their most probable neighborhoods (in their most probable consistent 
<br />
extensions/ computational histories).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I shudder every time I read of notions that imply some kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; knowledge of &quot;reality in itself&quot;!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yeah, well now you know how it feels!  :-)   Feels, that is, every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time that someone speaks of inner truths not accessible to anyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else, not accessible in *principle* to anyone else.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But this is the case of the *hurting* needle. If you can give me a 
<br />
purely third person communication that the needle hurts you, just give 
<br />
me it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those things to rank very highly on the scale of truth.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Take someone. Put the needle in the finger of that someone. Tell him 
<br />
now that you don't rank very highly his personal feeling on the scale 
<br />
of truth!
<br />
Try to give him a third person proof of that!   Tell him &quot;Come on, 
<br />
that's only some firing neurons!&quot;.
<br />
You frighten me a little bit!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It boils down, as you hint, to what we mean by &quot;knowledge&quot;.  Casting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aside the incredibly mistaken quest for &quot;certainty&quot;, we ought to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speak of that which can be objectively known in principle.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here again I follow you completely.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ever do any good to speak of anything else.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Absolutely. But to exclude the possibility of objective theory *on* 
<br />
subjectivity from that would be a category error.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sure, ask someone if he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or she has a headache---but if you want to think about it strictly,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then it is a state (or a succession of states constituting a process)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in that person's brain.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Suppose you explain me what is a succession of states and how that 
<br />
could give some person a feeling of headache. And suppose you are so 
<br />
good that you convince me. Now, 'to be convinced'  is a first person 
<br />
subjective experience. Is that convincing not also just a succession of 
<br />
states? If you use that reduction for dismissing the headache, why 
<br />
shouldn't we use to dismiss the convincing? But then how could we still 
<br />
give sense to any argument?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I repeat my challenge: find *one* thing that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is subjectively &quot;known&quot; or investigable or knowable by introspection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that was not &quot;known&quot; by the ancients.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The first person comp indeterminacy. Theaetetus was close, but he 
<br />
missed it.
<br />
<br />:-)
<br />
(but are not all theorem in math new such things?)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Oh, here I agree with you.  I consider the speculations of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonic monists to be, er, speculations only.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No no. It is only reasoning from assumption. Unless there is an error 
<br />
in my proof, of course, but in the case there is no error, the result 
<br />
changes the &quot;speculation-target&quot;.
<br />
A physical universe? We don't need that hypothesis any more ... 
<br />
(assuming comp).
<br />
Materialism (the doctrine that matter exists): superstition!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Those conjectures have not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even *begun* to pass the test of time, i.e., have not endured much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criticism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as yet, and certainly cannot be said to have survived much criticism.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is like some job proposal. We ask a very young engineer having 90 
<br />
years experiences!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real knowledge, (for example, that some people have been to Hawaii or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you have two hands or that four gas giants revolve around the sun), has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; survived the tests of time.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But that most humans suffer on the planet, and sometime somewhere more,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;this does not survive the tests of time?
<br />
And does not the mathematical proved theorems not survive the tests of 
<br />
time?
<br />
