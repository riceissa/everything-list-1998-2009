<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is linked to something said by Russell Standish in his paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and in some posts. Russell Standish pretends that (I quote him):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Each self-consistent mathematical structure is completely described
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; by a finite set of symbols, axioms and rule.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is totaly incorrect, I'm afraid. It is known that you cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; find a recursively enumerable (RE) set of axioms to specify the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (N,+,x) structure (N) of the natural numbers with addition and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; multiplication. Each RE description of N admit plenty of non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; isomorphic models which belongs to any reasonable set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical structures. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't understand this.  Do you have a reference?  I thought that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such a system as N with operations of addition and multiplication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are easily definable as a formal system.  I must be missing what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you mean by &quot;structure&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />It is a consequence of either Lowenheim Skolem theorem or Godel'theor.
<br />
You can build easily a formal system sound for the standart structure
<br />
of the natural numbers, but you cannot build a *complete* theory
<br />
univoquely describing that structure. A good reference is Boolos and 
<br />
Jeffrey. (Or Davis 65 for the original paper).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If this hadn't been a reference to Goedel, I'd have been tempted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to dismiss it.  As it is, I'm merely quite skeptical.  It seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to me that computability is just a mathematical formalism like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any other, where you define symbols, axioms, and rules.  Whenever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I hear anyone say that mathematical truths are &quot;relative&quot;, my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;guard goes up.  It's one of the things I didn't like about David
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Deutsch's book.
</em><br />
<br />For theories and formal system with a notion of truth you have a
<br />
great numbers of non equivalent logics and theories. Even if you
<br />
confine yourself to classical first order logical theories, you 
<br />
enter in a real big zoo ...
<br />
ALL attempts to define the notion of computability has 
<br />
lead to the same class of functions. Even formalism as different as
<br />
the game of life, Fortran, prolog, the unitary quantum transformation
<br />
describe alaways the same set of function !
<br />
And recursion theory gives deep results which does not depend of the
<br />
formalism choosed. In fact definability and provability is completely
<br />
dependent of the formalism, but with computability, either your
<br />
formalism is to poor and you miss the universal class, or your formalism
<br />
give you the universal class and you can augment it as you want, you
<br />
get always the same class. With provability you can extend any formalism
<br />
to give you more powerfull systems.
<br />
I don't agree with David Deutsch when he relativize computability,
<br />
but beyond that I agree on a lot of points.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;IMO, mathematical truths are fundamentally tautologies.  They are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equivalent to &quot;If A then A&quot;.  I am not one to question formal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;propositional calculus (the rules for making sylogisms) and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;therefore I adhere to the belief that mathematical truths are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;absolute, because they are tautologies.  I.e. any correct proof
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of a theorem T based on axioms A, B, and C could be stated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simply, &quot;If A, B, and C, then T&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So I certainly don't see that computability theory could be in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any way more fundamental.
</em><br />
<br />Because of the miracle of Church's thesis being apparently true.
<br />
More on that point later. A good book on Church's thesis 
<br />
is Judson Webb (ref in my thesis).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That is why Tegmark or GSlevy approach, although very interesting,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is still ill-defined. Tegmark will need some powerfull constructive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; axiom to give a sufficiently precise sense to the &quot;whole set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of mathematical structures&quot; so that he can make the white
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rabbit disappearing, by isolating the right prior.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;His axiom was explicit:  there is one of each structure, up to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;isomorphism.  Making anything useful out of that might be difficult.
</em><br />
<br />The problem here is that if you succeed in making precise a set
<br />
of structures + the notion of morphisme, you will work in a 
<br />
mathematical structure itself isolated from a vast collection 
<br />
of other mathematical structures. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I was thinking that Hal and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;others weren't giving enough consideration to the explanatory power
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the principle of computational indeterminacy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I've since changed my mind.  I am now completely stumped to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;core.
</em><br />
<br />In what way ? With the UD the problem is not yet solved, but at least
<br />
it is clearly formulable, and you don't have the &quot;whole-of-math&quot; 
<br />
definition problem. I guess this come from your lack of appreciation
<br />
of Church'thesis and of the universality of the computability concept.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;For one thing, I reject Juergen's principle because it is ad hoc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I insist that any measure must result from zero information -- that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is the whole appeal of the AUH, after all.
</em><br />
<br />When you say &quot;I insist that any measure must result from zero 
<br />
information&quot; I would be glad if you make this more precise. Note that
<br />
I agree with you here, although I would replace zero by ... eh...
<br />
a little more (no time for details, but I explain elsewhere that
<br />
with the null theory you will stumb again upon the problematical
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;whole-math&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I also reject James Higgo's contention that the WAP can explain it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all.  After all, I can think of plenty of scenarios where I survive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but the universe nevertheless acts chaotically.
</em><br />
<br />I share Higgo's attraction for the WAP, if computational indeterminacy
<br />
(and also non-locality!) is taken into consideration. In that
<br />
case it can explain it all or it can refute comp. But you point on
<br />
the real problem which is that chaotic flying white rabbit are consistent.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tegmark says &quot;one of each structure up to isomorphism&quot;.  But now I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;keep thinking that that won't do at all, either.  As the newcomer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Fritz just recently said:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Considering that every possible state does exist in some world, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    it seems safe for me to conclude that there is only one world 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    corresponding to every state, and the chance of finding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    ourselves in any possible universe is just as likely as any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    other.  The result would be total chaos.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If there's one of each, and each has an equal measure, then how come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't find myself embroiled in a chaotic universe?
</em><br />
<br /><br />With the UD every possible state does appear in an infinity
<br />
of computational stories. The problem is to isolated the good
<br />
&quot;relative measure&quot;. The method is listening to the self-applied
<br />
UTM. With comp, hunting the noise or the rabbit is equivalent
<br />
to deriving the laws of physics from the laws of computation.
<br />
I prefer to say the &quot;laws of dream&quot; to keep in mind that it is
<br />
really the &quot;laws of computation&quot; as seen by computational being.
<br />
This induces modal nuances.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Same problem, as far as I can see, with any computational theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tegmark recently wrote that (paraphrasing) any Turing machine could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be described as a function on the natural numbers, f(n).  It's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state at any time would be n.  Then, it's state at the next time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interval would be f(n), then f(f(n)), and so on.  This is just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;HLUT (Huge Look-Up Table).  Now, if all Turing machines exist in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equal measure, then it seems to me, once again, that we should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;expect chaos.
</em><br />
<br />The measure must be defined on the computations, not on the 
<br />
machines.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I have still a question for Russell, what is the meaning of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; giving a &quot;physical existence&quot; to a mathematical structure ? This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not at all a clear statement for me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't have a problem with this at all.  Tegmark, again, was pretty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;clear:  ME == PE   (Mathematical Existence == Physical Existence).
</em><br />
<br />With comp there is a sense to say physical and psychological 
<br />
existence implies mathematical existence. But mathematics is too
<br />
much general for that. What would it means for the number
<br />
1 to exists physically ? Honestly that looks a little like
<br />
non sense. I can understand that the number 1 is incarnate or
<br />
implemented in a lot of (apparently) physical manners, but &quot;1&quot;
<br />
is a creation of (perhaps an atemporal and universal) mind.
