</em><br />
<br />There may be subjective reasons not to re-run favorable experiences,
<br />
such as that it makes you vulnerable to unexpected threats.  In any case,
<br />
we can't rule out a priori that making yourself happy in this way is
<br />
the best course of action.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This may make more practical sense if you consider the debate between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Juergen and I about Speed vs. more dominant priors. Even if I believed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the multiverse was instantiated by a Great Programmer running the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; FAST algorithm, why should I then care about each universe in proportion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to its Speed prior instead of any other arbitrary measure that I choose?
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure why it is inadequate to say that you care because you live
<br />
in the universe and its reality affects you.  You can't just choose
<br />
whatever reality you like.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Think of a single-universe model with ordinary probability, where you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have a bet with a 90% chance of outcome A and 10% chance of outcome B.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Conventionally you should take the bet which maximizes your expectations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; based on A occuring.  But you could imagine someone who only cared about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what happened if outcome B happened, and bet on B so that he would do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; well in that unlikely case.  It's rational in a certain sense, but it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is going to lead to bad consequences in practice.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think there is a significant difference in that in the single-universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model someone like that wouldn't survive very long and therefore evolution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would eliminate this kind of utility functions.  But in the multiverse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model, this person would continue to survive in the universes that he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cares about and actually he would do very well in those universes, whereas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you would do poorly in those universes but do well in the universes you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cared more about. So there is a symmetry between him and you that doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist in the single-universe model.
</em><br />
<br />That is true; in the multiverse, people in high-measure worlds will come
<br />
to expect and predict high-measure (high-likelihood) events, while those
<br />
in low-measure worlds may come to predict low-measure events.  So there is
<br />
some symmetry here.  However again I would break the symmetry by saying
<br />
that each of us is more likely to encounter the high-measure worlds and
<br />
people, because that is what measure means.  We are effectively unable
<br />
to observe the low-measure worlds.  So the universe that we are able to
<br />
perceive and predict will have the same properties as if there were only
<br />
a single world.
<br />
<br />Imagine that we create computer simulations of two worlds with conscious
<br />
inhabitants.  We can't just add a measure parameter and set it arbitarily
<br />
to say that the first world has measure .9 and the second .1.  When we
<br />
tweak our measure parameter it will not affect the subjective lives
<br />
of the people in the simulation.  Measure does not work that way.
<br />
Somehow it does relate to subjective probabilities.
<br />
<br />You can get this in one way by relating it to duplicate instantiations,
<br />
such that worlds of measure .9 have 9 times as many duplicates as worlds
<br />
of measure .1.  I don't personally find this to be helpful because
<br />
it requires assumptions which to my mind are equally as arbitrary as
<br />
directly requiring measure to have the required properties of subjective
<br />
probability.  But in the simple case where we are running simulations
<br />
on a computer that would probably work.  Run one 9 times as often and
<br />
you could plausibly suppose that the inhabitants will be more likely to
<br />
experience that world.
<br />
<br />However you get to it, you have to think of measure as more than a label
<br />
attached to a universe, devoid of other meaning.  That is the only way
<br />
to get predictions from the multiverse model.
<br />
