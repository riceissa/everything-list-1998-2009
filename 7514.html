</em><br />
<br />You have to keep in mind that every living organism is being continually 
<br />
remodelled by cellular repair mechanisms. Jesse Mazer recently quoted an 
<br />
article which cited radiolabelling studies demonstrating that the entire 
<br />
brain is turned over every couple of months, and the synapses in particular 
<br />
are turned over in a matter of minutes. The appearance of &quot;permanent&quot; 
<br />
anatomical structures is an illusion due to the constant expenditure of 
<br />
energy rebuilding that which is constantly falling apart. If anything, 
<br />
parameters such as ionic gradients and protein conformation are more closely 
<br />
regulated over time than gross anatomy. Cancer cells may forget who they 
<br />
are, what their job is, what they look like and where they live, but if an 
<br />
important enzyme curled up a little tighter than usual due to corruption of 
<br />
intracellular homeostasis mechanisms, the cell would instantly die.
<br />
<br />Recent theory based on the work of Eric Kandel is that long term memory is 
<br />
mediated by new protein synthesis in synapses, which modulates the 
<br />
responsiveness of the synapse to neurotransmitter release; that is, it isn't 
<br />
just the &quot;wiring diagram&quot; that characterises a memory, but also the unique 
<br />
properties of each individual &quot;connection&quot;. But let's suppose, for the sake 
<br />
of argument, that each distinct mental state were encoded by the simplest 
<br />
possible mechanism: the &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; state of each individual neuron. This 
<br />
would allow 2^10^11 possible different mental states - more than enough for 
<br />
trillions of humans to live trillions of lifetimes and never repeat a 
<br />
thought. In theory, it should be possible to scan a brain in vivo using some 
<br />
near-future MRI analogue and determine the state of each of the 10^11 
<br />
neurons, and store the information as a binary srtring on a hard disk. Once 
<br />
we had this data, what would we do with it? The details of ionic gradients, 
<br />
type, number and conformation of cellular proteins, anatomy and type of 
<br />
synaptic connections, etc. etc. etc., would be needed for each neuron, along 
<br />
with an accurate model of how they all worked and interacted, in order to 
<br />
calculate the next state, and the state after that, and so on. This would be 
<br />
difficult enough to do if each neuron were considered in isolation, but in 
<br />
fact, there may be hundreds of synaptic connections between neurons, and the 
<br />
activity of each connected neuron needs to be taken into account, along with 
<br />
the activity of each of the hundreds of neurons connected to each of *those* 
<br />
neurons, and so on.
