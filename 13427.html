<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The reference to Susskind is a paper we discussed here back
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in Aug 2002, Disturbing Implications of a Cosmological Constant,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0208013">http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0208013</a> .  The authors argued that in current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cosmological models the universe dies a heat death and falls into a steady
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; state of exponential expansion which goes on forever.  In that state,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; quantum gravity fluctuations will eventually cause macroscopic objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to appear.  This is extremely rare but still with infinite time to work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with, every object will appear an infinite number of times.  That includes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; disembodied brains, the so-called Boltzmann brains, as well as planets and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; whole universes.  But the smaller objects are vastly more common, hence it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is most likely that our experiences are due to us being a Boltzmann brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It isn't generally the case that given a non-zero probability of an event E
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occurring per trial (or per unit time period), then as the number of trials
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; n approaches infinity the probability of E occurring approaches 1. For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, if Pr(E) = 1/2^n, then even though Pr(E) is always non-zero, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability of ~E as n-&gt;inf is given by the infinite product of (1-1/2^n),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which converges to approximately 0.288788, not zero. So if the exponential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expansion is associated with a continuous decrease in the probability that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an event of interest will occur during a unit time period, that event may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still never occur given infinite time, even though at no point can the event
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be said to be impossible.
</em><br />
<br />Right, but apparently the physics doesn't work this way.  The papers
<br />
just seem to take the size of the necessary object in Planck units and
<br />
say the probability of it popping into existence is 1/e^size.  This is
<br />
constant and therefore it will happen an infinite number of times.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This has a few bad implications; one is that our perceptions should end
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and not continue (but they do continue) and another is that brains would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be just as likely to (falsely) remember chaotic universes as lawful ones
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (but we only remember lawful ones).  So this model is not considered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consistent with our experiences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another possibility is that Boltzmann Brains arising out of chaos are the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moments which associate to produce the first person appearance of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuity of consciousness and an orderly universe. Binding together
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moments thus generated is no more difficult than binding together
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moments generated in other multiverse theories.
</em><br />
<br />So how would this explain why we see an orderly universe?  I think we
<br />
would have to say that Boltzmann brains that remember an orderly universe
<br />
are substantially smaller (take up fewer Planck units) than those that
<br />
remember chaotic ones.
<br />
<br />I considered this possibility but I couldn't come up with a good
<br />
justification.  Now, keep in mind that the Boltzmann brain does not have
<br />
to literally be a brain, with lobes and neurotransmitters and blood;
<br />
it could be any equivalent computational system.  Chances are that true
<br />
&quot;Boltzmann brains&quot; would be small solid-state computers that happen to
<br />
hold programs that are conscious.  Shrinking the brain even a little
<br />
increases its probability of existence tremendously.
<br />
<br />(I am assuming that probability makes sense even though we are speaking of
<br />
events that happen a countably infinite number of times; both Boltzmann
<br />
brains and whole universes like ours will appear infinitely often in
<br />
the de Sitter state, but the smaller systems will be far more frequent.
<br />
I assume that this means that we would be more likely to experience
<br />
being the small systems then the big ones, even though both happen an
<br />
infinite number of times.)
<br />
<br />So to explain the lawfulness we would have to argue that Boltzmann brains
<br />
that remember lawful universes can be designed to be smaller than those
<br />
that remember chaotic universes, as well as slightly lawless flying-rabbit
<br />
universes.  It's not completely implausible that the greater simplicity
<br />
of a lawful universe would allow the memory store of the Boltzmann
<br />
brain to be made smaller, as it would allow clever coding techniques to
<br />
compress the data.  However one would think that memories of universes
<br />
even simpler than our own would then be that much more likely, as would
<br />
memories of shorter lifetimes and other possibilities to simplify and
<br />
shrink the device.  This explanation doesn't really seem to work.
