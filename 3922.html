<br /><br />I think small. Attempting to reason about entire &quot;worlds&quot; with huge 
<br />
amounts of state (put various ways: long description, high logical 
<br />
depth, high algorithmic complexity, big) is not useful...to me.
<br />
<br />So I use &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; for two possible worlds. The outcome of a coin 
<br />
toss, for example. The click of a geiger counter or not. Schrodinger's 
<br />
cat alive, or dead. These states are, as Russell notes, propositions. Or 
<br />
sets of propositions (or huge sets of propositions, for entire worlds).
<br />
<br />I prefer at this time to ignore the implied complexity of an entire 
<br />
world and just call them &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B.&quot; Two outcomes, two branches in the 
<br />
MWI sense, two possible worlds, two points in a lattice, two points in a 
<br />
pre-ordered set (see below), two points in a partially-ordered set 
<br />
(poset, see below).
<br />
<br />I picked &quot;WWIII happens this year&quot; (or doesn't) to illustrate the 
<br />
general point that modal logic applies, that classical logic cannot 
<br />
apply to find and implication from A to B or B to A, as they represent 
<br />
contradictory to each other worlds. I didn't mean it to imply that modal 
<br />
logic is going to somehow tell us how likely such a world is, or what 
<br />
life might be like in either of those worlds, etc. I just wanted to make 
<br />
&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; more tangible to MWI sorts of folks.
<br />
<br />(Goldblatt, in his book &quot;Topoi,&quot; uses &quot;Fermat's last theorem is true or 
<br />
false&quot; as the two contradictory possible worlds. At the time he wrote 
<br />
his book, 1979, the truth or falsity of FLT was unknown. These were two 
<br />
possible worlds, visualizable by mathematicians and others, each having 
<br />
a kind of tangible reality. In fact, something that was shown to be 
<br />
equivalent to FLT was the &quot;Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture&quot; about some 
<br />
curious relationships between elliptic functions and modular forms. And 
<br />
for many years before Taniyama was proved, papers would start with this 
<br />
perfect example of modal logic: &quot;Assuming Taniyama-Shimura is true, 
<br />
then....&quot; People _believed_ T-S was probably true, but it hadn't been 
<br />
proved formally until Andrew Wiles did so, thus proving Fermat's Last 
<br />
Theorem as almost a trivial afternote.)
<br />
<br />A series of moments or events is drawn as a graph, with vertices linked 
<br />
with edges, with some events clearly coming &quot;after&quot; others, because they 
<br />
are causally-dependent on &quot;earlier&quot; events. But also some events 
<br />
_independent_ of other events, with no known (and perhaps no _possible_ 
<br />
causal relationship, e.g., events outside each other's light cones, 
<br />
i.e., spacelike intervals).
<br />
<br />This graph, this set of vertices and edges, is a &quot;per-ordered&quot; set. More 
<br />
than just a set, any category with the property that between any two 
<br />
objects &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; there is AT MOST one arrow &quot;p --&gt; q&quot; is said to be 
<br />
&quot;pre-ordered.&quot; There are lots of examples of this: the integers (and the 
<br />
real numbers) are pre-ordered under the operation &quot;greater than or equal 
<br />
to&quot; or &quot;less than or equal to.&quot; Moments in time are pre-ordered. 
<br />
Containment of sets is pre-ordered.
<br />
<br />Following Goldblatt, I'll call the arrow &quot;R.&quot; So the &quot;p --&gt; q&quot; example 
<br />
above is written as &quot;pRq.&quot;
<br />
<br />Here are some properties of pre-orders:
<br />
<br />1. Reflexive: for every p, pRp.
<br />
<br />Example: For every p, p implies p.
<br />
<br />Example: For every real number, that real number is less than or equal 
<br />
(LTE) to itself. And also greater than or equal (GTE) to itself.
<br />
<br />Example: For every event, that event occurs before or at the same time 
<br />
as that event.
<br />
<br />(Here I'm using time, because time is the most interesting pre-order for 
<br />
our discussion of worlds, MWI, causality, etc.)
<br />
<br />Example: Every set contains itself (where containment is &quot;contains or is 
<br />
equal to&quot;). (This may say like a tautological definition. Draw pictures 
<br />
of sets as blobs. The motivation for this example will become clearer 
<br />
with later properties.)
<br />
<br />2. Transitive: Whenever pRq and qRs, then pRs.
<br />
<br />Example: If p implies q and q implies s, then p implies s.
<br />
<br />Example: if p is less than or equal (LTE)  to q and q is LTE  to s, then 
<br />
p is LTE to s.
<br />
<br />Example: if event A happens before (or at the same time as) event B and 
<br />
event B happens before (or at the same times as) event C, then even A 
<br />
happens before (or at the same time as) event C.
<br />
<br />Example: (short version--you know the drill by now): If A contains B and 
<br />
B contains C, then A contains C.
<br />
<br />Discussion: These are all simple points to make. Obvious even. But they 
<br />
tell us some important things about the ontological structure of many 
<br />
familiar things. I encourage anyone not familiar with these ideas to 
<br />
think about the points and think about how many things around us are 
<br />
pre-ordered.
<br />
<br />If a pre-order has an additional property we call it a partial-order:
<br />
<br />3. Anitsymmetric: Whenever pRq and qRp, then p = q.
<br />
<br />Example: If p implies q and q implies p, then p and q are the same 
<br />
thing. (Equality, isomorphism, identity.)
<br />
<br />Example: If p is LTE q and q is LTE p, then p = q.
<br />
<br />Example: the time example is left as an exercise!
<br />
<br />Example: ditto for set containment.
<br />
<br />A set with a partial-order is called a &quot;poset.&quot; These feature 
<br />
prominently in all sorts of areas. For our purposes, posets are 
<br />
essentially what _time_ is all about.
<br />
<br />In addition, we can define things like &quot;meets&quot; and &quot;joins&quot; and the 
<br />
result is a _lattice_, studied extensively by Dedekind, Von Neumann, and 
<br />
Garrett Birkhoff. Lattices look exactly like lattices, or trellises. Two 
<br />
vertices have at most one link (arrow, R, etc.) between them, though 
<br />
many links may point to any particular vertex.
<br />
<br />In this view, it doesn't really matter (at this level) whether the 
<br />
vertices are the outcomes of a coin toss or entire worlds.
<br />
<br />This was the sense in which I was using &quot;WWIII happens this year&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;WWIII doesn't happen this year&quot; for my MWI-type example.
<br />
<br />The essential point is that the natural logic of such posets is not 
<br />
necessarily Boolean. There are several names for this &quot;not necessarily 
<br />
Boolean&quot; aspect, depending on the interest of the researcher or writer:
<br />
<br />* He may call it &quot;non-Aristotelean logic,&quot; as even Aristotle was said to 
<br />
have realized that a statement like &quot;The fleet at Carthage will either 
<br />
be sunk tomorrow or it won't be&quot; is not always meaningful, and that 
<br />
attempting to force future or time-varying truth into the Stoic model of 
<br />
&quot;A or not-A&quot; is not the most useful thing to do.
<br />
<br />* He may call it &quot;Intuitionist&quot; or &quot;Constructivist,&quot; asking that 
<br />
mathematical proofs be _constructive_ in nature rather than using proof 
<br />
by contradiction. (&quot;Assume the proposition not to be true, then we see 
<br />
that,...then, and this is a contradiction, therefore the proposition 
<br />
must be true.&quot;) This turns out to be fairly important when proofs use 
<br />
the so-called &quot;Axiom of Choice.&quot; (Which is equivalent to many other 
<br />
axioms and theorems.) Some important results of the past 40 years have 
<br />
come about by challenging the  role of the Axiom of Choice. (BTW, as an 
<br />
aside which may be of interest to some list members, John Nash used the 
<br />
Axiom of Choice to prove that certain solutions to multi-party protocols 
<br />
must exist, but he did not give a constructive proof of what those 
<br />
solutions are.)
<br />
<br />* He may call it a &quot;Heyting algebra,&quot; as opposed to a Boolean algebra. 
<br />
I've discussed Heyting algebras and logic here in the past, and I refer 
<br />
readers to the Web for many articles of varying levels of assumed 
<br />
background.
<br />
<br />* He may call it &quot;possible worlds semantics,&quot; after the work by the 
<br />
logician Saul Kripke on the logic implicit in possible worlds.
<br />
<br />* And most generally of all, at this time, he may call it topos theory.
<br />
<br />Does it relate specifically to the speculations of Max Tegmark, Greg 
<br />
Egan, and others on &quot;all mathematics&quot; and &quot;all topologies&quot; models?
<br />
<br />I can't say for sure, but it's the direction *I* am taking. As I said, I 
<br />
think small. I can't &quot;reason about&quot; entire worlds and draw meaningful 
<br />
conclusions. I _think_ this kind of thinking about posets, lattices, and 
<br />
toposes is the right way to think about systems with varying choices, 
<br />
even varying mathematics (*).
<br />
<br />* Because toposes are essentially mathematical universes in which 
<br />
various bits and pieces of mathematics can be assumed. A topos in which 
<br />
Euclid's Fifth Postulate is true, and many in which it is not. A topos 
<br />
where all functions are differentiable. A topos in which the Axiom of 
<br />
Choice is assumed--and ones where it is not assumed. In other words, as 
<br />
all of the major thinkers have realized over the past 30 years, topos 
<br />
theory is the natural theory of possible worlds.
<br />
<br />So, I think small. I think about flips of coins, about simple lattices 
<br />
and simple posets.
<br />
<br />These are not the Universe, let alone the Multiverse, but it seems clear 
<br />
to me we cannot reason about the entire Universe or Multiverse unless we 
<br />
can reason about very simple sub-parts of it.
<br />
<br />In any case, it's my particular interest at this time.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps clarify things a bit.
