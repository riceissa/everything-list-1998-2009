<br />Yes, this is part of the definition of utility.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now consider a single-universe model.  He can choose one of two

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternatives.  In one alternative he is guaranteed to get E1, and in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other alternative he has a 50-50 chance of getting E1 or E2.  Is there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a rational way to prefer the second alternative?  That is, can it be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better to have a chance of getting E2 rather than the certainty of E1?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would like to rule this out for rational choosers, but I'm not 100%
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure.  Some people seek risk, although a risk which has only a down side
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still seems irrational.
</em><br />
<br />I agree with you here, because if he prefers the second alternative, he 
<br />
should not prefer E1 to E2. If faced with a choice between E1 and E2 he 
<br />
would do better to throw a mental coin and decide between them randomly.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is an argument that there should be no differences, because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information available in any sub-part of the multiverse is the same as in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the single universe case.  In fact maybe we can never tell which theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is correct, therefore the differences are entirely hypothetical.  If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we accept this then what is irrational in the single universe case is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also irrational in the MWI.
</em><br />
<br />I disagree with you here. Although we have no direct sensory information 
<br />
about what happens in other branches of the multiverse, theory gives 
<br />
information about what happens in them, and that can be sufficient to 
<br />
change what we value in this branch.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe you could expand on your argument about how diminishing utility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relates to evolutionary advantage across copies; I'm not sure what you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are getting at there.  I see the reason higher quantities have less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; marginal value to you as because of how they interact with each other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and with you; putting them all into separate universes would eliminate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the effects which I see as causing diminishing marginal value.
</em><br />
<br />You're right, the evolutionary advantage argument only applies to copies
<br />
within a universe, not across universes (or non-interacting branches). The 
<br />
idea is that if you are content to have experiences similar to your 
<br />
copies, then the collection of your copies as a whole will contain less 
<br />
information (i.e. knowledge and skills) than the copies of someone who 
<br />
wants to have experiences different from his copies. So if your copies 
<br />
were to compete with his copies you would be at a disadvantage.
<br />
<br />P.S. I retract my claim that the self-sampling assumption is incorrect. I 
<br />
think I was just using it incorrectly. More on this in another post.
