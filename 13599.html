<br />I agree with this, but I would prefer to stop using the term
<br />
'consciousness' at all.  To make a decision (to whatever degree of
<br />
certainty) about whether a machine possessed a 1-person pov analogous
<br />
to a human one, we would surely ask it the same sort of questions one
<br />
would ask a human.  That is: questions about its personal 'world' -
<br />
what it sees, hears, tastes (and perhaps extended non-human
<br />
modalitiies); what its intentions are, and how it carries them into
<br />
practice.  From the machine's point-of-view, we would expect it to
<br />
report such features of its personal world as being immediately
<br />
present (as ours are), and that it be 'blind' to whatever 'rendering
<br />
mechanisms' may underlie this (as we are).
<br />
<br />If it passed these tests, it would be making similar claims on a
<br />
personal world as we do, and deploying this to achieve similar ends.
<br />
Since in this case it could ask itself the same questions that we can,
<br />
it would have the same grounds for reaching the same conclusion.
<br />
<br />However, I've argued in the other bit of this thread against the
<br />
possibility of a computer in practice being able to instantiate such a
<br />
1-person world merely in virtue of 'soft' behaviour (i.e.
<br />
programming).  I suppose I would therefore have to conclude that no
<br />
machine could actually pass the tests I describe above - whether self-
<br />
administered or not - purely in virtue of running some AI program,
<br />
however complex.  This is an empirical prediction, and will have to
<br />
await an empirical outcome.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Part of what I wanted to get at in my thought experiment is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bafflement and confusion an AI should feel when exposed to human ideas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about consciousness.  Various people here have proffered their own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ideas, and we might assume that the AI would read these suggestions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; along with many other ideas that contradict the ones offered here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It seems hard to escape the conclusion that the only logical response
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is for the AI to figuratively throw up its hands and say that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; impossible to know if it is conscious, because even humans cannot agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on what consciousness is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Augustin said about (subjective) *time* that he knows perfectly what it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is, but that if you ask him to say what it is, then he admits being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unable to say anything. I think that this applies to &quot;consciousness&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We know what it is, although only in some personal and uncommunicable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now this happens to be true also for many mathematical concept.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Strictly speaking we don't know how to define the natural numbers, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we know today that indeed we cannot define them in a communicable way,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is without assuming the auditor knows already what they are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So what can we do. We can do what mathematicians do all the time. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can abandon the very idea of *defining* what consciousness is, and try
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instead to focus on principles or statements about which we can agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they apply to consciousness. Then we can search for (mathematical)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; object obeying to such or similar principles. This can be made easier
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by admitting some theory or realm for consciousness like the idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness could apply to *some* machine or to some *computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events&quot; etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We could agree for example that:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) each one of us know what consciousness is, but nobody can prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he/she/it is conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) consciousness is related to inner personal or self-referential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is how I proceed in &quot;Conscience et Mécanisme&quot;.  (&quot;conscience&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the french for consciousness, &quot;conscience morale&quot; is the french for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; english &quot;conscience&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In particular I don't think an AI could be expected to claim that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; knows that it is conscious, that consciousness is a deep and intrinsic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; part of itself, that whatever else it might be mistaken about it could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not be mistaken about being conscious.  I don't see any logical way it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could reach this conclusion by studying the corpus of writings on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; topic.  If anyone disagrees, I'd like to hear how it could happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As far as a machine is correct, when she introspects herself, she
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot not discover a gap between truth (p) and provability (Bp). The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine can discover correctly (but not necessarily in a completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicable way) a gap between provability (which can potentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads to falsities, despite correctness) and the incorrigible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowability or knowledgeability (Bp &amp; p), and then the gap between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those notions and observability (Bp &amp; Dp) and sensibility (Bp &amp; Dp &amp;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; p). Even without using the conventional name of &quot;consciousness&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines can discover semantical fixpoint playing the role of non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expressible but true statements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can *already* talk with machine about those true unnameable things,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as have done Tarski, Godel, Lob, Solovay, Boolos, Goldblatt, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And the corollary to this is that perhaps humans also cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; legitimately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; make such claims, since logically their position is not so different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from that of the AI.  In that case the seemingly axiomatic question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; whether we are conscious may after all be something that we could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mistaken about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is an inference from &quot;I cannot express p&quot; to &quot;I can express not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; p&quot;. Or from ~Bp to B~p.  Many atheist reason like that about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of &quot;unameable&quot; reality, but it is a logical error.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even for someone who is not willing to take the comp hyp into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consideration, it is a third person communicable fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-observing machines can discover and talk about many non 3-provable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and sometimes even non 3-definable true &quot;statements&quot; about them. Some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true statements can only be interrogated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Personally I don' think we can be *personally* mistaken about our own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness even if we can be mistaken about anything that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness could be about.
