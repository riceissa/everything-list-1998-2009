<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  observer-branch-moments which she, for all she  knows, might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  currently be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This looks like a natural suggestion but it is not possible in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;version of the many-minds interpretation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[snip]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thus we cannot define ``birth rank as [ ] position in the class of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[ ] observer-branch-moments''.  The best we can do is to look at an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer's own personal current evidence as to his birth rank.  This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can be quite ambiguous and, in general, will be a matter for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpretation rather than mathematical definition.
</em><br />
<br />Are you saying that it is not possible in your model to define the class of 
<br />
all points in time on all branches of the universal wave function which are 
<br />
at a temporal distance of, say, 10 years from the start of the world 
<br />
(assuming there was a point when the world (i.e. the whole tree of 
<br />
branching possibilities) started? (This is not a rhetorical question but a 
<br />
clarificationary one. And I'm not asking whether we could identify those 
<br />
points, but whether the class of such points is defined.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  Only if there was a class of observers all of whom are like Eve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  except that they have different birth ranks would there be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  objective probability which Eve could use as a genuine measure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  the improbability of her birth rank.  But such classes are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  undefinable, even in my theory in which the set of all observers is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  well-defined and countable, because hints about her birth rank
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  have been built into everything Eve has ever known about herself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bostrom replied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  That wouldn't make it undefinable, just small. But for reasons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  spelled  out in my dissertation, I think observer-moments should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  be grouped in the same reference class even when they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  subjectively distinguishable, and I'm aware of no reason to limit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  this only to observer-moments that are subjectively distinct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  only regarding their knowledge of their birth ranks but not in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  other ways.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;When I said ``undefinable'', I was speaking as a mathematician.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meant that I believe that there is no conceivable algorithm which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could take elements of the set of observers as I define it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(well-defined and countable although that is) and attach
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unambiguous birth ranks to each one of them.
</em><br />
<br />Do you mean effectively computable algorithm?
<br />
<br />I don't see why it would make a difference if the reference could not be 
<br />
exactly computed in a finite time.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   It is even less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;plausible that there is an algorithm which will tell us whether a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible observer is ``like Eve'' or not.  And even at the handwaving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;level, I claim that ``like Eve'' can only be interpreted either
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a wide sense as ``like a woman'' or in a much more narrow sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as ``like a woman who has considerable and lifelong evidence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;social isolation''.   This implies that, although it may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reasonable for Eve to find her birth rank or social isolation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;improbable, she should not expect to be able to define a precise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quantification of that improbability.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I agree that with the reference class defined as &quot;all observer-moment 
<br />
that are like Eve's present one&quot;, then no precise quantification is 
<br />
possible. But this is just another way of saying that we don't yet know 
<br />
exactly how to define the reference class. Given a choice of reference 
<br />
class, it seems that exact probabilities exist. In absence of a unique 
<br />
definition of the reference class, we can still get exact probabilities in 
<br />
some cases, namely if we assume that the world happens to be kind to us in 
<br />
the sense that there are no observer-moments of the sort where different 
<br />
plausible reference class definition would give different verdicts. Such 
<br />
cases can be stipulated in thought experiments, and might be approximated 
<br />
in the real world.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Moreover, we understand probability best when it is applied to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;situations in which we can distinguish sequences of simple repeated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;events with different possible outcomes which have occurred, or at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;least could occur, under the observation of a single individual.  My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comments are also intended to stress how little Eve's social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;isolation is like that paradigm.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, sure, the probabilities are different from the straightforward ones 
<br />
involved in tossing a coin many times etc. That's why we are having this 
<br />
discussion.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  You know what you are; no matter how improbable, you just have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  to take that for granted. The question is what else is true about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  the world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As I see it, *the question* is rather ``Given what I have learned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from my life up to now, how should I predict my future?''
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure whether we are really disagreeing on this point, although I 
<br />
would insist that one sort of question we may meaningfully ask is not just 
<br />
what my own future will be but also what the world is like (and was like in 
<br />
the past) in general.
