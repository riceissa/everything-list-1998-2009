<em class="quotelev1">&gt;who undergo your thought experiment.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Some people might argue that death is not intrinsically bad; rather, it is 
<br />
the pain and anxiety associated with dying and the grief the dying person's 
<br />
loved ones will go through that is bad. I don't agree, and it appears you 
<br />
don't either: death *is* intrinsically bad. Knowing that I will never again 
<br />
have any experiences of any kind is something I find deeply disturbing, and 
<br />
I think that most people, if they are honest with themselves, would feel the 
<br />
same way. Therefore, in the example you have given, if God creates someone 
<br />
and then kills him, painlessly or not, that is bad. In my thought 
<br />
experiment, if the 10^100 copies are allowed to diverge after they are 
<br />
created and then all but one killed, that would be very bad indeed. 
<br />
Similarly, if the 10^100 copies were created, stayed perfectly synchronised, 
<br />
and then all of them killed, that would be very bad.
<br />
<br />Before continuing, it is worth looking at the definition of death. The 
<br />
standard medical definition will not do for our purposes, because it doesn't 
<br />
allow for future developments such as reviving the cryogenically preserved, 
<br />
mind uploads, teleportation etc. A simple, general purpose definition which 
<br />
has been proposed before on this list is that a person can be said to die at 
<br />
a particular moment when there is no chance that he will experience a &quot;next 
<br />
moment&quot;, however that experience might come about. Equivalently, death 
<br />
occurs when there is no successor observer moment, anywhere or ever.
<br />
<br />One consequence of this definition is that everyone who appears to be dead 
<br />
can only be said to be provisionally dead, until it can actually be shown 
<br />
that there will never be a successor OM anywhere in the multiverse (or 
<br />
whatever larger mathematical structure contains it). Even people who are 
<br />
unconscious or in the dreamless phase of sleep, having no guarantee that 
<br />
they will ever wake up again, can be said to be provisionally dead. Taking 
<br />
this idea further, a person can be said to be provisionally dead with the 
<br />
passing of every conscious moment, since (QTI aside) it is never certain 
<br />
that there will be a successor OM. You could say that death happens to us 
<br />
all the time and is no big deal; it's not living again which is the problem.
<br />
<br />Returning to your example, if God creates a person, call him A, and a day 
<br />
later kills him, A will be really dead (as opposed to provisionally dead) if 
<br />
there will never be any successor OM's to his last conscious moment. Now, 
<br />
suppose God kills A and then creates an exact copy of A along with his 
<br />
environment, call him B, on the other side of the planet. B has all of A's 
<br />
memories up to the moment before he was killed. This destruction/creation 
<br />
procedure is, except for the duplication of the environment, exactly how 
<br />
teleportation is supposed to work. I think most people on this list would 
<br />
agree that teleportation (if it could be made to work, which not everyone 
<br />
does agree is possible) would be a method of transportation, not execution: 
<br />
even though the original dies, the copy has all his memories and provides 
<br />
the requisite successor OM in exactly the same way as would have happened if 
<br />
the original had continued living. So in the example above, if B is an exact 
<br />
copy of A in an exact copy of A's environment, A would &quot;become&quot; B and not 
<br />
even notice that there had been any change.
<br />
<br />Now, consider the same situation with one difference. Instead of creating B 
<br />
at the instant he kills A, God creates A and B at the same time, on opposite 
<br />
sides of the planet but in exactly the same environment which will provide 
<br />
each of them with exactly the same inputs, and their minds at all time 
<br />
remain perfectly synchronised. God allows his two creatures to live for a 
<br />
day, and then instantly and painlessly kills A. In the previous example, we 
<br />
agreed that the creation of B means that A doesn't really die. Now, we have 
<br />
*exactly* the same situation when A is killed: B is there to provide the 
<br />
successor OM, and A need not even know that anything unusual had happened. 
<br />
How could the fact that B was present a day, a minute or a microsecond 
<br />
before A's death make any difference to A? All that matters is that B is in 
<br />
the correct state to provide continuity of consciousness when A is killed. 
<br />
Conversely, A and A's death cannot possibly have any direct effect on B. It 
<br />
is not as if A's soul flies around the world and takes over B; rather, it 
<br />
just so happens (because of how A and B were created) that B's mental states 
<br />
coincide with A's, or with what A's would have been if he hadn't died.
<br />
<br />The above mechanism would still work even if, as in my thought experiment, 
<br />
there were 10^100 exact copies running in lockstep and all but one died. 
<br />
Each one of the 10^100-1 copies would experience continuity of consciousness 
<br />
through the remaining copy, so none would really die.
