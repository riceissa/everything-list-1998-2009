<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The typical setup for a DA [doomsday argument]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is two possible universes with some a priori
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability for one of them being the real one. It doesn't seem to apply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directly to a theory where all objects/universes exist. 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't see any difference how many universes exist.  The DA is
<br />
simple: considering yourself to be a random selection among humanity,
<br />
the fraction of human lives that have passed, compared to the the amount
<br />
over the lifetime of the species, can be assumed to have a uniform
<br />
probability distribution on the interval (0,1).  This is true whether or
<br />
not there are other universes.  So the median future lifetime of the human
<br />
species can be expected to be fairly short.  (Due to the recent population
<br />
boom, most human lives have occurred in this century.  So has yours.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course this can be modified in the usual Bayesian way if you
<br />
have any additional information, such as good predictions of what exactly
<br />
will happen in world history based on any other observations.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The way I see it, the premise should not be used to draw conclusions, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rather serves as an explanation. Because you already know you are a human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; being named Hal Finney, it no longer matters that you are a random sample
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of all beings. However, the premise helps explain why you are Hal Finney
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and not some bug-eyed alien, namely that Hal has a larger measure than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; alien (assuming that is actually true). 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing about effective probabilities that argues against
<br />
the existance of aliens.  What it does argue is that humans are not likely
<br />
to be a very atypical species, if there are any major regularities among
<br />
intelligent species.  For example if there are A bipedal species and B
<br />
quadrapedal species among the group of intelligent species in the galaxy,
<br />
we would be more likely to be in the larger group, if one group is much
<br />
larger (A &gt; B more likely than B &gt; A).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Here's an analogy: suppose you have just been dealt a hand in a card game. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Since you know what cards you have, the distribution from which they were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; chosen no longer matters and won't help you play, but that distribution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; helps explain why you got the cards you did. 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do have a problem with the way explanations use probability.  In your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; card game example, what happens when you are dealt an unlikely hand?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What kind of explanation can the theory offer?  If you are playing many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times, you can say that the theory does give the frequency with which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such hands will appear.  But in life, it seems like we only play once.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what?  It tells you how likely that hand was.  Luck explains
<br />
the rest.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I look around the world and see that the vast majority of people are poor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third-worlders struggling with difficult lives.  I am fortunate enough to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; live in a wealthy country, have a good education, and tremendous riches
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the standards of most people.  What kind of explanation is there for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this based on the assumption that I am a random selection from among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all people?  We can't run the universe again and let me be a different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; random selection next time.  This is the same conceptual problem I keep
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; encountering with this notion.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't see the problem.  You are obviously not in the group of
<br />
maximum probability; that just means you were lucky.  It is not as if the
<br />
fraction of people in wealthy countries is even that small, compared to
<br />
many of the issues considered; that fraction is about .1, of order 1.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It gets worse if you consider not just me as a random sample from among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all observers, but if you consider me-now as a random sample from among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all observer-instants.  Now it seems that I have to adopt an atemporal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective where my consciousness dwells here in Hal Finney, 1999, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an instant, then jumps back to a slave in ancient Rome, then dwells for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a moment in our bug-eyed alien.  I can't make sense out of this.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it doesn't jump at all.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This view is especially perplexing if my measure changes drastically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over time.  With some of our thought experiments, I could boost the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure of an instant of my consciousness by making copies of my brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state (say, a high-resolution X-ray).  But the next instant, my measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; drops again.  Would I somehow expect to notice myself spending more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time in that amplified instant?  Suppose I spent half my days with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; big brain and half my days with a small brain.  Am I to be puzzled on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those days I am in the small brain, faced with the mystery of why I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not experiencing the measure-enhanced big-brain days?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making copies would not enhance your measure unless they are
<br />
functional copies, according to computationalism.  Even if they are, it
<br />
would just mean you could expect an enhanced a priori chance of being on a
<br />
'big brain day'.  'Small brain' days would not be of zero measure, so
<br />
would still occur, and if you find yourself in one, fine.  It won't feel
<br />
any different, just as it wouldn't feel any different if you had an exact 
<br />
twin you didn't know about.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is related to the quantum immortality question.  As time goes on,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my measure becomes less.  But it is hard to understand what I should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expect to experience as a result of this.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it's easy.  You should expect most of your experiences to be
<br />
in the region of time where you have significant measure.
