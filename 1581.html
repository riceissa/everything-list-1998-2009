<em class="quotelev1">&gt;forms,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;given the appropriate starting configuration.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This rapidly became a question of whether the Turing-machine-computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;aspect of this universe would be sufficient to generate the self-aware
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;substructures (SAS's). Through the most recent postings, we have heard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;supporters of a whole spectrum of responses to this question. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Conservatively, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't think we will know enough (in 3rd person perspective) to capture all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;aspects of human consciousness in a single machine, and if we did somehow,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;accidentally, I don't think we'd be able to realize it. This is just Godel's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;result.
</em><br />
<br />Exactly. With comp it is even provable that we cannot provably 
<br />
capture ourself. It is not Godel's result, but is a consequence of 
<br />
Godel's 
<br />
result. (And it is provable by G of course, where G is the modal system
<br />
axiomatizing completely the propositional consequences of Lob's theorem,
<br />
which means that it is not only a theorem in the psychology of 
<br />
machines, but that it is a theorem in the machine's psychology of 
<br />
machines).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The evolutionary aspect of life as we know it is probably a pretty crucial 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of developing the self-awareness that we ourselves experience. Evolution is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;based on survival, so this would tend to nurture the emergence of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-awareness geared toward preservation of self. 
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am not sure this is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proof that even the lower evolved life forms have consciousness, since they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could be operating by involuntary reflex-type behavior.
</em><br />
<br />Mmh... This is indeed certainly not a proof that the lower evolved life 
<br />
forms have
<br />
consciousness. But *that* is not a disproof either. Think about Hal 
<br />
Finney's
<br />
contemplative spectator ... I am open that consciousness appear with the
<br />
involuntary reflex-type behavior. Probably the more voluntary less 
<br />
reflex-type
<br />
behavior involves a more elaborate &quot;self-consciousness&quot;. 
<br />
I think Hal Finney's distinction is relevant here (independently that we 
<br />
disagree on the fabric of the spectacle).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is difficult to imagine if a straightforward Turing approach would be able
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to capture the evolutionary process, which would seem to require random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;environmental inputs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<br />Grrr... Firstly, and this is linked to Chaitin's theorem, a machine 
<br />
having localy
<br />
some complexity C1 cannot distinguish randomness with the output of a 
<br />
machine with complexity C2, with C2 &gt; C1. This gives some Turing type 
<br />
approaches 
<br />
for relative randomnes.
<br />
Secondly, with self-multiplication (cf the SSA, UDA), computationalism 
<br />
(the belief
<br />
that you can survive with a digital brain) forces an Everett-like 
<br />
phenomenology of randomness, which can be share among &quot;entangled&quot; 
<br />
computational
<br />
histories. 
<br />
<br />The turing realm is closed for the diagonalisation operator, that's why it
<br />
escapes all possible axiomatisable theories. 
<br />
There are ten thousand sort of randomnes available.
<br />
<br />(The truth is that with comp (but a fortiori with Tegmark and any 
<br />
everything 
<br />
approaches) there is *too much* randomnes, we must explain away white 
<br />
rabbits 
<br />
and white noises and justify the apparent determinism).
