Hi Tom, Hi George,
<br />
<br />I recall the (four) diagonalization problems. I show each time the 
<br />
diagonal functions, which I will always call g, except for the Fi where 
<br />
I call it G. In each case the existence of that g proves something 
<br />
different. I have change r1, r2, r3 ... into R1 R2 R3 ... because rn 
<br />
looks to much like m in many fonts.
<br />
<br />[Apart for Norman and the &quot;non-mathematician&quot;: please keep this posts, 
<br />
I will send preliminary posts for you to read before]
<br />
<br /><br />Le 22-juin-06, à 17:03, I wrote:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question is: what does diagonalization prove on those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; following list of functions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 0) R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8 ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is an arbitrary list of functions from N to N  (not necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable one);
</em><br />
<br /><br />g(n) = Rn(n) + 1
<br />
<br />All Rn are well defined function from N to N, so all Rn(n) + 1 are well 
<br />
defined number, and so g is a function from N to N. But g cannot be in 
<br />
the given (arbitrary) list, and this show that the set of functions 
<br />
from N to N is not enumerable.
<br />
<br />Proof by contradiction.
<br />
Indeed, if this was the case, there would be a (precise) number k such 
<br />
that g = Rk. I will say that k is the index of Rk = g. Let us apply g 
<br />
on its own index k. In that case g(k) = Rk(k) + 1 = Rk(k). Again Rk(k) 
<br />
is a precise number, so, by subtraction in the last equality: 1 = 0. So 
<br />
g does not belong to the list R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 ... Now that list 
<br />
was arbitrary, so this proved that ALL sequences of functions from N to 
<br />
N will miss its corresponding &quot;g&quot;, that is will miss a function from N 
<br />
to N.
<br />
This is the celebrate proof by Cantor of the non enumerability of the 
<br />
functions from N to N.
<br />
<br />Exercise: show that the functions from N to {0,1} are not enumerable, 
<br />
by a similar proof. Hint: find the appropriate slight change in the 
<br />
definition of g.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) h0 h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a list of total computable functions from N to N that we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generate mechanically (I mean we can generate their codes). It means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we can generate the codes of each hi, written in some language,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that, for some reason, we are sure that each hi is total
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable. Examples: Caylor last funny enumeration; all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (transfinite collection of) sequences of growing functions we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined in this thread (since &quot;Smullyan Smullyan ...&quot;);
</em><br />
<br /><br />g(n) = hn(n) + 1
<br />
<br />All hn are well defined function from N to N, and now we are told they 
<br />
are also computable. And then we are also told that we can generate 
<br />
mechanically their codes, for example: C1 C2 C3 C4 ... where each Ci 
<br />
computes the functions hi. (Meaning the program/codes Ci with input n 
<br />
will gives the result hi(n). In particular all hn(m) can be computed.
<br />
Well, this means in particular that I can compute hn(n). Just apply Cn 
<br />
on n. So obviously, for any n, I can compute hn(n)+1. Just generate the 
<br />
Ci up to Cn, apply it to n and add one. But this is g(n), and so g is a 
<br />
computable function from N to N.
<br />
But now g cannot belong to the list h1 h2 h3 ....  The hi does not 
<br />
exhaust the computable functions.
<br />
<br />Proof by contradiction.
<br />
Indeed if g belongs to that list, then it exists a precise number k 
<br />
such that g = hk. G would have a program Ck. Let us apply g on its 
<br />
index k. g(k) = hk(k) = hk(k)+1. Now hk(k) is the result of appying the 
<br />
program Ck, which computes a total, well defined function, so it is a 
<br />
number which I can subtract  on each side of the last inequality giving 
<br />
0 = 1.
<br />
This show that all mechanically generable set of total computable 
<br />
functions will miss a total computable functions.
<br />
Obviously, the set of total computable function *is* enumerable. We 
<br />
have just proved that this set cannot be mechanically enumerable. 
<br />
Logicians says such sets are not recursively enumerable; they write 
<br />
that they are not RE.
<br />
Actually we have show more: such set are constructively not recursively 
<br />
enumerable. This is because the diagonalization is effective. Given any 
<br />
attempt to enumerate a set of total computable functions can lead 
<br />
mechanically to the counterexample. Such sets are called productive.
<br />
We have met already three examples of such sets: the set of (code of) 
<br />
total functions, the set of formal arithmetical truth, the set of all 
<br />
computable growing functions, etc.
<br />
Any RE set approximating such a set can be extended into the 
<br />
constructive transfinite (reread perhaps the posts on the growing 
<br />
functions).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) f0 f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is an arbitrary list of *all* total computable functions;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Given that the set of the (code) of the total function is enumerable 
<br />
(although not *recursively* enumarable), we can use the bijection 
<br />
between that set and the set of natural numbers to give to such 
<br />
function the indices 0, 1, 2, 3, ... getting f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, ....
<br />
The preceding reasoning has already shown that such a bijection cannot 
<br />
be computable, indeed it would make the set of total functions 
<br />
recursively enumerable. But you can got the contradiction by direct 
<br />
construction of g, and it is instructive to do so:
<br />
<br />g(n) = fn(n) + 1
<br />
<br />Does that g belongs to the list of the fi ? Put in another way: is g a 
<br />
total computable function?
<br />
Suppose it is, then it exists a k such that g = fk, and applying g on 
<br />
its own indice will give gk(k) = fk(k) = fk(k) + 1. And g has been 
<br />
assumed total so that fk(k) is a number, and so I can subtract it 
<br />
getting 0 = 1 as usual.
<br />
This shows that g is not computable, and given that all fi are, it 
<br />
means that it is the bijection i -&gt; fi is itself not computable. We 
<br />
knew that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) F0 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the list of all programmable things in some &quot;universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language&quot; like fortran.  CT asserts fortran is universal so that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; total computable function fi will be dispersed *among* those Fi things,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so that a universal machine can really compute all the fi, among other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now the same diagonalization argument proves 4 different propositions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; according to which list we are talking about. Which one?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Before answering, I let people muse a little about what are those 4
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different consequences,  given that the only way to really grasp those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions consists in rediscovering them by oneself,  ... or at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least in searching enough so as to be curious listening to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solutions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I let you think on this one. The most important one. We will get a 
<br />
precise definition of universal function and of relative universal 
<br />
machine/code/index/number from the list of the Fi.
<br />
<br />Must go now,
<br />
<br />Bruno
