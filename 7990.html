Hi Stephen,
<br />

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why does this &quot;bet&quot; remind me of Pascal's Wager?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Because there is a resemblance. This is related to the paradox of the  
<br />
pro-life doctor. He is committed to save his patient life, using the  
<br />
available technic and at the same time he does not believe that his  
<br />
patient is a machine, but then he transforms his patient into a machine!
<br />
But YD and (comp) is far less demanding than Pascal Wager. It can be  
<br />
seen a a self-finiteness principle saying I am not actually infinite  
<br />
from some possible correct third person point of view. Caution: the  
<br />
first person is arguably actually infinite. This you can explained by  
<br />
the fact that the first person is related to its infinity (continuum)  
<br />
of arithmetically realizable &quot;observer-moments&quot;. The first person of  
<br />
a machine cannot feel to be a finitely describable machine!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the main source of my irritation with your thesis, it ask  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me to believe some postulate without even a hope that it can be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proven.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is the main irritation I have with some physicist. They ask me  
<br />
to believe F = ma or things like that. No hope to give proves, except  
<br />
by deeper postulates. All theory ask you to be believed, or assumed  
<br />
for the sake of refutability.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (This is not about your *proof* that a machine is unable to *know*  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what it's program is. That is easy to derive from the idea that a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; map can not be created of a dynamic territory that includes a copy  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the map... I accept your idea here without trepidation.)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sorry but here you make a mistake, if you are willing to bear my  
<br />
frankness. All my work, and actually one halve of computer science  
<br />
and 100% of the Godel Lob provability logic is based on the fact that  
<br />
machine can refer to themselves relatively to a universal (probable)  
<br />
neighborhood. The reason why the machine cannot identify itself with  
<br />
such a presentation, although intuitively easy (your copy looks like  
<br />
some other!) is far more difficult to explain and is related to the  
<br />
&quot;Theaetetical moves&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Being raised by Fundamentalist parents has something to do with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this &quot;allergy&quot; of mine. Please do not take this personally, but you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must admit that there is a lot at stake in this bet!
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree and I even insist on that!  But in the literature only  
<br />
Penrose has made explicit a &quot;non-comp&quot; assumption. Even Searle  
<br />
follows the comp hyp in the weak sense I take it here. He would  
<br />
probably not accept this statement, but it can be derived from the  
<br />
larger consistent part of his writing.
<br />
But I told you I respect all hypothesis. Given that you seem to  
<br />
belief in some physical multiverse, you are quite coherent by  
<br />
refusing the comp hyp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; or some other equivalent that can be implemented in a finite  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; number  of steps in a physically realizable machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No. YD does not presuppose the existence of any &quot;physically   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; realizable machine&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Ok, then what connects the idea of YD to the real world  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility of uploading my subjective sense of self into a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; blinking and whirring cube of silicon?
</em><br />
<br /><br />But this is really what the UDA is supposed to explain. In a nutshell  
<br />
the whirring cube of silicon is dreamed by a continuum of very  
<br />
similar lobian machine in Platonia. The constraints of theoretical  
<br />
computer science are enough to explain how coherence conditions arise  
<br />
from the computations making some collective dreams first plural  
<br />
person sharable. Numbers by themselves defined a sort of &quot;natural&quot;  
<br />
video game&quot;, if you want. But such image is too much restrictive and  
<br />
should not handle with some care. Time, and space and energy- 
<br />
information are defined indexically and internally (in arithmetical  
<br />
terms).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; It is my belief that such TM are equivalent to Boolean algebras    
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; which have been proven to not be able to faithfully represent  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; any  QM system having more than 2 dimensions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK, but YD asks only that the mind can be implemented in some   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (classical or quantum) digital machine. And we know that all  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; digital  machine (classical or quantum) can be runned on a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; classical (and  immaterial) Turing machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    That tears it! I can accept a computational system that does not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a &quot;where&quot; or &quot;there&quot; assosiated with it, but I am being asked  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to accept an &quot;immaterial&quot; one? Ok, I will let that slide, but I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really need to understand your insistence that the &quot;Machina sans  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corpus&quot; be a &quot;classical machine&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    A quantum machine can do far more exponentially faster, so why  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the insistence? Can we safely assume that we all agree that the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Multiverse is Quantum Mechanical at its primal core?
</em><br />
<br /><br />You remember me a joke. It concerns a math student who decide to  
<br />
follow a course on Group Theory. At the last lesson the student asked  
<br />
its professor if we could safely assume the existence of a neutral  
<br />
element in Group and what would happen if some group appears to lack  
<br />
a neutral element. Of course a group has a neutral element by  
<br />
definition of group! It is a joke because it shows the student has  
<br />
not understand the axiomatic method.
<br />
Look, your theory assumes a quantum multiverse and assume non-comp.  
<br />
My theory assumes no multiverse (nor no-multiverse, the theory is  
<br />
agnostic) and assumes comp. And my results guarantee your relative  
<br />
consistency. So, why do you argue? It looks you want to convince me  
<br />
that comp is false?, unreasonable? or what? (Ah!, I see below).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Your point is well taken so long as one assumes that no aspect  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of consciousness requires QM aspects, such as entanglement and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum statistics (Bose, Fermi, etc.). I am still waiting  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; patiently for something that looks like a derivation of QM's  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wierdness from Classical logics.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I disagree. My point is well taken so long as one assumes that no  
<br />
aspect of consciousness requires uncomputationnal (gravitation a la  
<br />
Penrose like) feature of some physical theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am still waiting patiently for something that looks like a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derivation of QM's wierdness from Classical logics.
</em><br />
<br /><br />What has been proved: If comp is true then QM follows from Classical  
<br />
logic and Arithmetic.
<br />
What has been already verified: the non booleanness of the comp- 
<br />
observability logics, and more things hard to explain without digging  
<br />
in the details. But comp has already succeeded some tests.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Bruno, you can do better than this! Please understand that I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would very much like your theory to be true (it is beautiful!), but  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will not let my desire over come my need for falsifiabilty. (back  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; off, Chris Peck!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Stephen, you can be skeptical on my claims but all my point is that  
<br />
the comp hyp is refutable/falsifiable. It is hard to imagine a more  
<br />
naive and vulnerable theory.
<br />
The Universal Dovetailer Argument (UDA) shows that necessarily comp  
<br />
makes physics a branch of number theory/computer science.
<br />
And then I eliminate the use of YD (alias folk or grandmother  
<br />
psychology) to make the proof constructive and I have done the  
<br />
extraction of physics.
<br />
<br />Physics with comp = COMP-PHYS = SOL(THEAE(COMP(G))). Where G is a  
<br />
precise mathematical object  and SOL, THEAE, COMP are precise  
<br />
mathematical transformation. COMP-PHYS can be shown non-boolean, and  
<br />
even quantum, although some discrepancies exist, which are either  
<br />
hinting to the falsity of comp or of some SWE ...
<br />
<br />So please, you can refer to my results with all the possible  
<br />
skepticism of someone who has not *thoroughly* study my work with all  
<br />
the details, but the *result* is that comp is falsifiable. But not  
<br />
yet falsified.
<br />
<br />Bruno
