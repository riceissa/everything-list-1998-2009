<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Existing mathematically doesn't have any ontoloigcal meaning.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Both formalists and Platonists can agree that 07 exists,

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes, but I still don't see what difference the word 'ontological'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; makes in this context.  Surely whatever world-conjuring power numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; may possess can't depend on which label is attached to them?  If a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical scheme fulfils a deep enough explanatory role (a moot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; point I admit) isn't that 'ontological' enough?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; David
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sure.  There are different models of the world.  Each model takes some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things as existing and tries to explain the rest in terms of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes, interactions, or whatever.  The Standard Model takes quarks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and leptons and does a pretty impressive job of explaining everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but gravity and consciousness (which is probably what inspired Penrose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to try to explain mind in terms of gravity).  String theory tries to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain both particles and gravity in terms of strings (or branes);  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it has it's own 'white rabbit' problem.  Bruno wants to take  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithemetic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as basic.
</em><br />
<br />Not really. I am just saying that if you say yes to the digital  
<br />
doctor, then ontologically, we need no more than the mathematical  
<br />
existence of the natural numbers, with their laws of addition and  
<br />
multiplication. To believe that there is something more &quot;ontological&quot;  
<br />
than this is not only absolutely undecidable, but provably irrelevant,  
<br />
except for shortening the proofs (but that is already pragmatical or  
<br />
epistemological).
<br />
Then for the inside/personal views, the whole of human math including  
<br />
Cantor paradise cannot be enough to describe the human mind. It is  
<br />
more general:
<br />
Above the &quot;universal&quot; threshold of complexity, all universal machines  
<br />
are no more enough clever to understand themself. But above the Löbian  
<br />
threshold, all universal machine are clever enough know that! They are  
<br />
clever enough to understand completely why they can no more understand  
<br />
themselves. And they can understand that their physical realities have  
<br />
to emerge from the web of their intrinsical ignorance, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But so far I don't see that his theory has predicted (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opposed to retrodicted) anything except that it has a white rabbit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem too.
</em><br />
<br />Computationalism reduces the mind body problem to the body problem,  
<br />
and it reduces the body problem to a &quot;white rabbit measure&quot; problem.
<br />
The shape of the solution may be provided by the 08 arithmetical  
<br />
hypostases, including an explanation of both measurable and sharable  
<br />
quanta and measurable and non sharable qualia.
<br />
OK, up to now, nothing new in physics has been discovered from the  
<br />
comp-physics. I don't expect it soon (centuries). Yet, it is the first  
<br />
explanation of consciousness and its relation to matter, and this by  
<br />
using one of the oldest rational theory of mind (mechanism). It comes  
<br />
from India, China. But those who get the points were the rationalists,  
<br />
like the platonists Greek,  with an open mind for mystical experiences  
<br />
(consciousness is the most basic one (we are blasé), dreams, and  
<br />
entheogenic experience, or brain damaged experiences are others).  
<br />
Unfortunately we are still a bit brainwashed, I' afraid, by  
<br />
Aristotelian theology (used by late 88% Christians, late 70% Muslims  
<br />
and 70% Jews, due to Maimonid, but 30% Buddhist, 20% Indian, according  
<br />
to a rough early 20th century evaluation). It is really the Plato/ 
<br />
Aristotle difference, although &quot;Aristotle&quot; refers to the followers of  
<br />
Aristotle. Aristotle himself was more Platonist than we thought today.
<br />
<br />The problem is:  &quot;is there a universe, and the minds emerge from it&quot;  
<br />
versus &quot;is there a mind, and the universes emerges from it&quot;. With comp  
<br />
there are numbers, and from this is the mind of the universal numbers  
<br />
and the (internal) explanation how those minds wreathe (braid, plait,  
<br />
twine, weave) the fabric of realities.
<br />
<br />I just try to explain that comp needs us to bactrack to the Platonists  
<br />
and even the Pythagorean neoplatonist theologian. But, as you know,  
<br />
the field &quot;non confessional theology&quot; is still a bit taboo ...  
<br />
Enlightenment restituted one half of the Greek Science. The rest is  
<br />
still coming ...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The discussion seems to have gotten stuck on whether it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has been proven that physics can't be fundamental because it can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; include consciousness.  I consider that a diversion.  Since we don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really have a definite idea of what consciousness is let's see what  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory does tell us - then we can worry about where physics fits.
</em><br />
<br />In a sense, each of us (the universal being) know rather well what  
<br />
consciousness is, despite we cannot define it.
<br />
But the same could be said about sensible matter.
<br />
<br />Now what the comp theory does tell us is that whatever we observed is  
<br />
a sum on infinity of computations, structured by the constraints of  
<br />
self-consistency.
<br />
At first sight this predicts some solipsistic multidreams, unless  
<br />
collection of independent universal entities succeed in sharing  
<br />
dreams. Those dreams have to be deep (in Bennett sense) so as to be  
<br />
relatively rare, and yet expands continuously in the continuum so has  
<br />
to develop normally (in Gauss sense) partial computable realities.
<br />
<br />With comp, there is a &quot;simple&quot; meta-definition of consciousness. The  
<br />
conscious state is the &quot;belief in a reality&quot;  state of a universal  
<br />
machine. There is also a meta-definition of awakeness: it is the  
<br />
&quot;belief in *the* reality&quot; state, and all lobian machine can prove that  
<br />
if they are consistent they can never be sure to distinguish their own  
<br />
consciousness and awakeness state. The Gödal-Löb-Solovay logic of self- 
<br />
reference shed an incredible light on many very old debates orignating  
<br />
most from the dream argument. Alas, mainly for reason of fashion,  
<br />
theoretical computer science is not very well known by those concerned  
<br />
I'm afraid.
