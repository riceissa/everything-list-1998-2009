<br />Do you agree that under ASSA, the fact that you find yourself as an
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer who was spared from torture should give you no relief, as

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your next OM is equally likely to sample the tortured perspective as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is to experience the spared perspective?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I guess the ASSA does imply that because it doesn't seem to respect the
<br />
subjective sensation of the passage of time. For example, the ASSA seems to
<br />
imply that if my measure were somehow increased a zillionfold for today
<br />
only, then I would somehow find myself stuck in today forever. ASSA
<br />
advocates might argue that as the clock strikes midnight, I will suddenly
<br />
die (again, I'm guessing, because it doesn't make a lot of sense to me). I
<br />
would expect that as the clock strikes midnight, I will notice nothing at
<br />
all unusual as I find myself alive and well on April 21, 2007. This exactly
<br />
mirrors my experience on the stroke of midnight the previous day: I notice
<br />
nothing unusual at all as I find myself alive and well as one of the zillion
<br />
copies on April 20, 2007. As long as there is a continuous path of OM's that
<br />
can be drawn on the tree mapping my duplications and mergings, it is
<br />
impossible for me (i.e., for any of the OM's at any point) to know whether I
<br />
am living a branching or a linear life. It could be happening right now.
<br />
<br />Shouldn't you be equally
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as worried if anyone in the world (your copy or not) was to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tortured, as the next sampled OM could be that person's.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No, neither under ASSA nor RSSA. Suppose in the next moment God suddenly
<br />
switches my mind and body for George Bush's mind and body. Would it be best
<br />
to describe the change I experience as (a) I suddenly find myself at home
<br />
typing this email, but with George's thoughts and body, or (b) I suddenly
<br />
find myself in the White House, surrounded by people I don't recognise and
<br />
poised to sign a document I've never seen before?
<br />
<br />Identity is determined by the content of a person's mind. Even if some
<br />
magical soul-substance existed, there is no sense in which I could suddenly
<br />
become someone who shares none of my thoughts.
<br />
<br />RSSA has never appealed to me because I see no logical reason to link
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two observer moments from one time to another when those two observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moments are not the same.  Intuitively it feels that each mind is on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set track to only experience those OM's that follow from the birth of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an observer, but logically there are too many problems with this.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But you do link two OM's from one time to another when those two OM's are
<br />
not the same. Your immediate successor OM contains most of the thoughts of
<br />
your previous OM, plus a little bit more. This is just a description of what
<br />
normal life feels like, whether the underlying reality is linear or
<br />
branching.
<br />
<br />Possible problems with RSSA:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quantum mechanics means each observer follows multiple paths, some of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which intersect with what might have been considered a different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer previously, this forms a spectrum linking all observers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; together.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If we live forever such that we have every possible experience, then we will
<br />
eventually become every possible person. However, it doesn't really matter
<br />
that in a million years my personality will be completely different and I
<br />
won't remember any of my present experiences. After all, I don't really
<br />
remember the experiences I had as an infant, and that doesn't upset me.
<br />
<br />Time by its nature implies change, an observer's brain state is in
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different from one time to another, if the brains are different the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers are different.  By what rule set can two different observers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be said to be the same?
</em><br />
<br /><br />In ordinary life, although two instances of a person many years apart might
<br />
seem completely different, there is a continuous progression whereby every
<br />
OM has a successor differing from it only marginally. This progression is
<br />
maintained even in a branching universe by following a single path along the
<br />
tree diagram. Continuity is disrupted by memory loss caused eg. by head
<br />
injury, and it is disconcerting when this happens.
<br />
<br />Common intuition and experience play many tricks on us.  It makes us
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think that the current time (present) is special, because it is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only thing point in time we are aware of.  It makes us think that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current laws of physics and universe we see around us is special,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because it is the only set of laws we are aware of.  I propose the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same is true of personal identity, it makes us think that the self is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; special, because it is the only observer's perspective we are aware
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of.  For those who believe in block time, the present is no more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; special or real than any other time.  To those on the Everything list,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe we perceive now is no more real than any other.  Our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current OM remembering previous OM's experienced from the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer's viewpoint creates the illusion that said observer is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; travelling into the future and bound to experience the next logical OM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for this observer, but I hold this is only an illusion.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Indeed, but it's an *important* illusion, and I don't want anything to
<br />
happen that disrupts it. People continued behaving in much the same way they
<br />
always have despite Copernicus, Darwin, Einstein and quantum mechanics, so
<br />
why should they be upset by any radical new theory about personal identity?
<br />
Even if it turns out that the world is a simulation on some alien kid's PC
<br />
people will probably still go about their business as before, provided there
<br />
were some guarantee that the simulation wouldn't suddenly end.
<br />
<br />ASSA is closer to a one mind/all perspectives experienced
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simultanesouly view because it removes the notion of observers that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; travel through time from one OM to the next and treats only observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moments.  Consider the infinite set of all OMs, by definition, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existance of an OM necessitates its being experienced, but without a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiplicity of observers who can say &quot;who&quot; is experiencing them?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no who, just the fact that each is being experienced.  Since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this set exists in the plentitude (which is timeless) then it follows
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that all perspectives are being experienced simultaneously.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would agree with this last statement, but nonetheless there is at least
<br />
the *illusion* of an observer travelling through time, and it is this
<br />
illusion which most people are concerned with preserving.
<br />
<br />The existance of a spectrum of related OM's means there is a choice in
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation of this infinite OM set.  Either you can hold that each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OM constitues its own mind, or if you believe there is any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship between OM's (i.e. You experience now AND you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience 10 seconds from now) then you must conclude there is only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one mind.  This is just my viewpoint on the issue and I invite others
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to give their opinions on it and poke holes in it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I believe that the only way to look at the situation objectively and
<br />
consistently is to say that each OM is an entity on its own, but because of
<br />
their particular content certain OM's can be grouped together to form the
<br />
illusion of a single person travelling forward through time. The illusion is
<br />
very robust in the world in which we have evolved, but duplication thought
<br />
experiments show it up in the same way as Einstein's thought experiments
<br />
showed up the illusion of absolute time.
