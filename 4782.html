Eric Hawthorne, &lt;egh.domain.name.hidden&gt;, writes some great and thought-provoking
<br />
questions, to which I can offer only partial answers.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. What test could determine if a computational hypothesis holds?
</em><br />
<br />I assume in the context of this list you mean some version of the
<br />
hypothesis that the universe we live in is actually the execution of a
<br />
computer program.  List member Jacques Mallah argued that this question
<br />
is not falsifiable in <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1951.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1951.html</a>.
<br />
He suggests that any observation is consistent with the hypothesis.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Is it enough that a theory be elegant and explain all the known physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations, or does the test of the theory also have to rule out all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; competing theories, or at least force all known competing theories to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; add ugly complex terms to themselves to continue to work?
</em><br />
<br />Most people accept the principle of Occam's Razor, so that the simplest
<br />
successful theory will be accepted.  Therefore the &quot;ugly complex terms&quot;
<br />
necessary for other theories to work would disqualify them.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. Is it not true that the kind of computation that computes the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or multiverse must be an energy-free computation, because energy itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is INSIDE the computed universe, and it would be paradoxical if it also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had to be OUTSIDE.
</em><br />
<br />That makes sense.  Energy as we know it is a conserved quantity, and
<br />
our deepest theories relate it to a symmetry of the mathematics that
<br />
appears to describe the universe.  Other universes would have different
<br />
symmetries, or none at all, and the putative computation that creates
<br />
the universe would be entirely outside of the system.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4. What range of energy regimes and physical laws are required to produce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spontaneous order where the order retains the dynamism required for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life. (e.g. as opposed to producing one big, boring crystal.)
</em><br />
<br />Max Tegmark has published some speculations along these
<br />
lines.  He argues that we need to have the 3+1 dimensionality in
<br />
<a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/dimensions.html">http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/dimensions.html</a>, and about the strengths
<br />
of various physical constants in <a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html">http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html</a>.
<br />
His conclusion is that our universe is quite &quot;special&quot; and that even
<br />
small variations would not plausibly produce the balance between order
<br />
and chaos that would seem to be necessary for life.
<br />
<br />I also find relevance in Stephen Wolfram's work,
<br />
<a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/">http://www.wolframscience.com/</a>, where he runs computer simulations of a
<br />
wide variety of different simple computational systems to see which ones
<br />
might have a sort of dynamism.  My interepretation is that, depending
<br />
on the computational framework, from about one in a million to one in
<br />
a hundred randomly selected computational systems appear to allow for
<br />
some semblance of structure (i.e. particle-like objects) to exist.
<br />
However I suspect that of these, only a small fraction will have the
<br />
further properties necessary for life.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5. Do these &quot;special&quot; energy regimes and physical law sets NECESSARILY
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; produce spontaneous order with the required dynamism?
</em><br />
<br />Presumably the question of spontaneous order is a function of the laws
<br />
and the initial conditions.  If the IC's are random, then it would
<br />
come down to how big the universe is.  If we assume that all possible
<br />
universes exist, so that all initial conditions are realized for any
<br />
given set of physical laws, then I would say that the answer is yes,
<br />
if the laws allow it, order will necessarily arise somewhere among the
<br />
universes that follow those laws.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 6. Why does spontaneous order emerge in these energy/law regimes?
</em><br />
<br />Extending Wolfram's work, it appears to be a property of mathematics
<br />
that a substantial fraction of computational systems allow for some
<br />
kind of structure.  Let us further suppose that some smaller fraction of
<br />
these systems allow for spontaneous order.  Then this is fundamentally
<br />
an inherent property of mathematics; not contingent on the properties
<br />
of our universe, or any universe.  It is not something that could be
<br />
controlled even by God, for He could not have created mathematics to be
<br />
different from it is.  It is simply inevitable, that among chaos there
<br />
is automatically a subset called order.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7. If we were in a &quot;possible world&quot; where thermodynamics ran backwards
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (entropy decreased), would the time-perception of observers within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that world also run backwards? Would these backwards worlds (as far as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classical physical observations go, anyway) thus be equivalent to and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretically equatable with the corresponding possible world which was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same except that thermodynamics runs forwards as we are used to?
</em><br />
<br />I suppose so, although your question assumes a sort of &quot;absolute time&quot;
<br />
relative to which we can say that entropy is decreasing.  It might be
<br />
more correct to say that &quot;time&quot; is simply that direction towards which
<br />
entropy increases and that there is no inherent arrow of time that we
<br />
can compare entropy changes to.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 8. What is the significance of the fact that observers like ourselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (possibly with some notion of free will) are separated in space and can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only communicate / cooperate with each other at the speed of light. They
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot interfere with some decisions that the other makes, because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other has already made the decision before a lightspeed communication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can tell them or force them to stop. Imagine Jane on Venus and Joe on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mars getting into an argument.  Immediately after receiving Joe's last
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication (which he sent an hour ago), Jane decides to detonate her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solar-system bomb in frustration and spite. Nothing Joe can say or do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can stop her, because it will take two hours for him to know she's about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to push the button, and communicate his desperate and well-crafted plea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for forgiveness. The idea of FUNDAMENTALLY independent decision makers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;co-existing&quot; seems interesting. Open ended question.  It's just as if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Joe and Jane lived at different times. (And yet they CAN communicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with each other, just slowly. Hmmm)
</em><br />
<br />I speculate that the speed of light limitation preserves diversity by
<br />
preventing an intelligence from expanding infinitely fast throughout
<br />
the universe and turning the whole thing into a single consciousness.
<br />
Elsewhere in the universe are expanding minds, but they have not gotten
<br />
here yet because of the speed of light limitation; and further, that
<br />
limitation makes those minds themselves become fragmented.  Perhaps,
<br />
on some versions of the anthropic principle, this could increase the
<br />
&quot;mental measure&quot; of our universe relative to those that become singleton
<br />
minds, making it more likely.
<br />
<br />A perhaps more plausible speculation is simply that relativity theory
<br />
exists as a side effect of a simple set of equations that guides our
<br />
universe (the unified theory our physicists seek).  Once that set
<br />
of equations is found, it will be seen to be very simple, but the
<br />
ramifications of that theory lead to all of the complexity and order
<br />
that is necessary for life to evolve.  The speed of light limitation
<br />
just falls out of the theory as a side effect of its inherent simplicity,
<br />
one which doesn't impair the formation of life and hence has no anthropic
<br />
implications.  It just happened to happen.
