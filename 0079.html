Mathematically, probability is defined as a measure applied to the set of
<br />
subsets of some base set.  Each subset has a measure, which is a number
<br />
that must satisfy the property that measure of the union of two disjoint
<br />
subsets is the sum of the measure of the two subsets.  If the measure of
<br />
the universal subset is 1, then this is considered a probability measure.
<br />
<br />In applying this to the world, each subset corresponds to a possible
<br />
outcome of some event or experiment.  From the definitions above, you
<br />
can show for example that the probability of the complement of an event
<br />
is 1 - the probability of the event, and other familiar results.
<br />
<br />Wei Dai &lt;weidai.domain.name.hidden&gt; writes:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On what basis do we choose a theory of probability? Does probability have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any meaning outside the context of decision theory? It seems to me the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer is no. If this is true then the real question is how do we choose a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision theory. Is decision theory a positive theory? Is it supposed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make predictions about agents in the real world? At first I thought yes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can accept or reject decision theory based on whether or not it makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct predictions about real agents. But if probability theory is part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of decision theory, then it would be circular to use probabilistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguments on decision theory itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does anyone see a way out of this?
</em><br />
<br />I think you can still look at evolution and see what kinds of
<br />
decision theory and probability theory will evolve.  We know that we
<br />
are replicators and have developed our instinctive understanding of
<br />
probability over a long period of time.  This should be able to be
<br />
analyzed and understood.  You might be able to create a toy universe
<br />
of evolving replicators and see what kinds of probability theories are
<br />
most useful and successful.
<br />
<br />The fact that we may apply probabilistic reasoning in understanding
<br />
evolution does not seem circular or paradoxical to me.  Probability and
<br />
logic are tools which are applied successfully in a wide range of areas.
<br />
It may be that in some of our discussions we are extending them into areas
<br />
where they don't work so well (like your copying paradoxes).  But that
<br />
does not mean that they are useless in general.  Sticking to well defined
<br />
and explored areas, like evaluating the behavior of evolutionary systems,
<br />
we can confidently use probability theory, logic, and other tools to
<br />
develop our theories and understanding.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; P.S.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe the answer is that a decision theory has two roles, one as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normative theory about how one should act, and the other as a positive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory about how others do act. Perhaps the two roles could even be filled
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with two different theories. Once we accept a decision theory as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normative theory, the probability theory part of it would tell us which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision theory we should accept as a positive theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If this is the right way to think about probability theory, then we should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make clear in our discussions whether we're talking about it as a positive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory or a normative theory. But it is still not clear on what basis we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should choose a normative probability (or decision) theory.
</em><br />
<br />I don't really understand this.  Assuming that we are like other people,
<br />
and if we have a theory that tells us how we should act, and we actually
<br />
follow the theory, then this same theory should tell how other people do
<br />
act.  Maybe I'm missing the point here.
