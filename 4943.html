<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The association between non-locality and &quot;retrocausality&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (for lack of a better word) is anything but simple! In any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case it has less to do with the flow of time than with its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; negation! [...]
</em><br />
<br />Bell's theorem shows that, given the hidden variable lambda,
<br />
the result of the experiment at B is dependent on the angle
<br />
of the measurement at A, *or* the the result of experiment at 
<br />
A is dependent on the angle of the measurement at B, *or* both.
<br />
Now, because of symmetry, it must be both. Thus, if there are
<br />
&quot;retrocausations&quot; (or &quot;influences&quot;, or &quot;weak signals&quot; as Ian
<br />
Percival calls them) they are in both directions (and with the 
<br />
same probabilities). 
<br />
<br />So yes, it is difficult to show that the flow of time is 
<br />
involved. Antoine Suarez (and the Geneva Group) speaks of 
<br />
a-temporal quantum effects.
<br />
<br />Now let us imagine this set-up. 
<br />
<br />I suppose it can be useful also within the MWI, at
<br />
least as a possible answer to the question &quot;If we live
<br />
in all of them can we pick the cheapest one?&quot;. So I go
<br />
on trying to describe this gedanken experiment (or 
<br />
perhaps lunacy).
<br />
<br />There is the usual SPDC source, two correlated photons,
<br />
mirrors m1 and m2, one human observer, polarization detectors
<br />
(measuring photon-1) and, very close, 4 boxes to collect photon-2.
<br />
<br />Of course the path of photon-1 is shorter that the path of
<br />
photon-2, so there is a time-delay, for photon-2 going
<br />
into one of those boxes (possible delayed choice here?).
<br />
<br />m1
<br />
/----------&lt;-----------&lt;--source--&gt;------&gt;- detectors
<br />
|
<br />
|
<br />
|
<br />
\------------------&gt;-----------------&gt;----- boxes (1,2,3,4)
<br />
m2
<br />
<br />Now the observer can measure, with his detectors, or the
<br />
linear polarization of his photon-1, or the circular
<br />
polarization of his photon-1.
<br />
<br />Of course the observer, having measured his photon-1,
<br />
can predict what is the polarization state of photon-2.
<br />
There are 4 possibilities: linear/x, linear/y, circular/+,
<br />
circular/-.
<br />
<br />Being very short the distance between detectors and
<br />
boxes, the observer has time (due to that time-delay)
<br />
to move there and pick up the right box (that one with the
<br />
right label: linear/x, linear/y, circular/+, circular/-)
<br />
and collect, into the right box, the photon-2 which
<br />
is arriving.
<br />
<br />This is possible because he *knows* what was his *choice*
<br />
while measuring, with detectors, the polarization state
<br />
(linear *or* circular) of photon-1. And he also *knows*
<br />
what was the measurement outcome for photon-1: i.e.
<br />
linear/x, or circular/+, or ...
<br />
<br />This is also possible because the observer has *time* to
<br />
move to the other location and pick up the right box,
<br />
to collect photon-2.
<br />
<br />But before observer makes his *choice* the photons 
<br />
(and especially photon-2, which is &quot;late&quot;) were 
<br />
already flying.
<br />
<br />So you could ask: what was the polarization state of
<br />
photon-2, before the observer made his choice measuring, 
<br />
with his detectors, the polarization state of photon-1?
<br />
<br />The answer seems to be that photon-2 fits equally well
<br />
in both categories, that is to say: linear polarization
<br />
and circular polarization. Thus neither of these
<br />
properties can be ascribed to it as an objective property.
<br />
<br />Now you can also ask: what if I cut the path lenght
<br />
of photon-2 and I make it equal to the path lenght 
<br />
of photon-1? It happens that the observer becomes
<br />
unable to move from the detectors location to
<br />
the boxes location, because there is no time-delay
<br />
now. So, in these conmditions, the observer, loses
<br />
control of the situation. His information remains 
<br />
hidden, or useless, ot impossible. But this, imo, 
<br />
does not mean that photons gain some objectiveness.
<br />
Or not?
<br />
<br />Of course you excluded the possibility of (weak or strong) 
<br />
signals traveling FTL, from detectors or from photon-1
<br />
to photon-2. In example making the path lenght of 
<br />
photon-2 much much longer than the coherence lenght 
<br />
of the photon(s).
<br />
<br />But imagine that your procedure (here above) is not
<br />
enough, and actually there is some FTL effect.
<br />
The interesting point here is that any FTL effect
<br />
from detectors or photon-1 makes actual, objective
<br />
the state of photon-2 *before* its measurement.
