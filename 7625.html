<br />
I wrote a few days ago about the use of the Universal Distribution
<br />
(UDist) in the context of a Schmidhuberian approach to the multiverse,
<br />
in the UD+ASSA thread.  I think it is a very attractive ontology which
<br />
can go a long way to account for what we experience, as well as providing
<br />
in-principle solutions to most of the thought experiments we discuss.
<br />
<br />Wei Dai implicitly showed a challenge to this by his thought experiment
<br />
about whether halting problem oracles could exist.  The UDist gives such
<br />
entities probability zero, which suggests that unless we are absolutely
<br />
certain they can't exist, we should not adopt the UDist as the foundation
<br />
for the multiverse.
<br />
<br />I want to describe a few other problems that I know about with the UDist,
<br />
so as to put the proposal to base the multiverse on it into perspective.
<br />
<br />The first problem is that the UDist is uncomputable, which makes it
<br />
hard to use in practice because we can't actually compute the measure
<br />
of any objects.  However, we can approximate the measure by doing enough
<br />
computation.  I don't know if there are any known bounds on the accuracy
<br />
of the approximation that would shed light on how feasible and practical
<br />
this is.
<br />
<br />It occurs to me as I write that this problem may be worse than I have
<br />
been thinking, because at least when we add the ASSA or otherwise try
<br />
to tie measure to our perceptions, it means that we actually experience
<br />
the effects of an uncomputable formula.  And really that means that we
<br />
are interacting with actual infinities, which I just spent a long time
<br />
yesterday explaining was impossible.  This is a new idea to me so I need
<br />
to think about it more.
<br />
<br />Another problem is that the UDist is not unique.  Every Universal Turing
<br />
Machine (UTM) produced a different UDist.  The one thing you can say is
<br />
that the various flavors of UDist do agree with each other up to some
<br />
constant that is independent of the object whose measure being calculated.
<br />
That's a good sign, but I am worried that it is not enough.
<br />
<br />We want to use the UDist to calculate probabilities for our experiences.
<br />
We want to calculate the probability of a universe which looks like
<br />
ours vs some other universe.  But if these probabilities are non-unique,
<br />
then we can't come up with meaningful comparisons between the measures of
<br />
particular information objects.  One UTM may make the first object have
<br />
higher measure, while the second UTM may make the second object higher.
<br />
How can we relate that to our experience?  Subjectively, we experience
<br />
probabilities which are well defined.  But if one UTM says that flipping
<br />
a coin is more likely to come up heads and another UTM says it is more
<br />
likely to come up tails (i.e. that the information patterns of one or
<br />
the other have higher measure), they can't both be right.
<br />
<br />This suggests that there is in fact one particular UTM which creates the
<br />
multiverse, but so far as I know computability theory does not pick out
<br />
one UTM as obviously the best.  I don't know a solution to this problem.
<br />
My hope is that someday it will become obvious that a particular UTM is
<br />
the &quot;unit UTM&quot; and that all others are variants on it.  This may sound
<br />
like a relatively unlikely prospect but it is the best I have at present.
<br />
<br />Another problem is that the MWI does not seem to fit too well into
<br />
this model.  Basically, the universe described by the MWI is too big.
<br />
It's vastly bigger than the classical universe.
<br />
<br />The way I think of the universe and the measure of observer moments,
<br />
based on a proposal from Wei Dai, is that a universe's contribution to the
<br />
measure of an OM is based on two factors: the universe's measure, and the
<br />
fraction of the universe's resources involved in the OM.  This relates to
<br />
the UDist, as I have explained recently, because it represents arguably
<br />
the highest measure way to produce the information pattern for conscious
<br />
observers like ourselves.  First you create and run the universe,
<br />
which requires a relatively short program, then you locate and output
<br />
the observer pattern from within the output of the universe program,
<br />
which also requires a relatively short program.  The result is that you
<br />
get an entire observer-moment or whole observer from a short program.
<br />
<br />My guess is that no other program so short could produce a pattern as
<br />
complex as an observer-moment.  Although all programs which output a
<br />
given OM contribute to its measure, this framework seems likely to be by
<br />
far the shortest program and hence the main contribution to the measure.
<br />
This is simply a consequence of the UDist.
<br />
<br />The problem arises when we try to apply this reasoning to the MWI.
<br />
The MWI universe is enormously bigger than a Newtonian style universe,
<br />
or even one with conventional QM with state reduction, as long as that
<br />
is done using a short program to create its randomness.  The MWI is
<br />
exponentially bigger than a single-thread universe because it splits at
<br />
every quantum event.
<br />
<br />This means that the amount of information needed to localize an observer
<br />
within an MWI universe is exponentially greater than in a simple universe,
<br />
and that implies that the size of the locating program described above
<br />
changes from small to enormous.  The consequence is that the contribution
<br />
of an MWI that contains an observer to that observer's measure appears
<br />
to be essentially zero.  The observer is just too small a fraction of
<br />
the MWI, or in other words, the MWI is so profligate in its creation of
<br />
universes that each individual branch has essentially zero measure.
<br />
<br />(This objection was also pointed out originally by Wei Dai.)
<br />
<br />Well, there are several possible solutions to this, none of them
<br />
terribly attractive.  One is the possibility that our measures within
<br />
the MWI are much higher than they seem, because somehow our existence
<br />
is much more inevitable than we would suppose.  Rather than all the
<br />
quantum branches producing totally different worlds, somehow most of
<br />
them produce worlds with us in them, the specific people on this list,
<br />
Bruno and Russell and all the others.  It may seem absurd or bizarre,
<br />
but I suppose it's not impossible.  In that case we occupy many of the
<br />
quantum branches rather than an infinitesimal fraction of them, and our
<br />
measures in the MWI are high.
<br />
<br />A more attractive solution is that the MWI is false, or more precisely,
<br />
that most of our measure comes from universes with true state reduction,
<br />
with essentially none coming from universes that don't reduce states,
<br />
where the MWI would be true.  The biggest problem with this one for
<br />
me is that I don't know of any QM interpretations other than the MWI
<br />
that are truly coherent.  Certainly Copenhagen isn't; it doesn't define
<br />
precisely when state reduction occurs.  Maybe some of the other ones,
<br />
Cramer's or Bohm's, can be made to work.  In this case, ironically,
<br />
a multiverse model could be taken to disprove the MWI.
<br />
<br />The really weird part of this solution is that for it to work, for the
<br />
universe program to be small, quantum randomness can't be truly random.
<br />
Otherwise the program for the universe would have to be loaded up
<br />
with random bits, one for each quantum state reduction, and it would
<br />
be enormous.  No, the only way this can work is for quantum randomness
<br />
to be generated by a numeric pseudo random number generator (PRNG).
<br />
We all live in von Neumann's &quot;state of sin&quot;.  I guess this is the AUH
<br />
version of original sin.
<br />
<br />Plus it means that we are pretty special after all.  Each different seed
<br />
for the PRNG, each variant on a PRNG, would generate a different version
<br />
of this universe, each with its own set of observers.  Probably many of
<br />
them would generate no observers at all.  So somehow we, the particular
<br />
people living on earth, are the ones lucky enough to be generated from
<br />
a PRNG that had a particularly short description and seed.  All the
<br />
seemingly random events which created each of our lives, back to the
<br />
race among the spermatozoa, were in a sense pre-ordained based on a
<br />
relatively small seed for a PRNG that goes back before the big bang.
<br />
There really was no other way things could happen, once we got human
<br />
civilization going.  That would have long since used up all of the
<br />
randomness.  From then on everything has been predetermined.  In effect
<br />
we live in a deterministic universe after all, just as much as the most
<br />
rigid Newtonian clockwork.
<br />
<br />So these are the major problems that I know of with the concept of basing
<br />
measure for all objects on the UDist, which then leads to Schmidhuber's
<br />
multiverse.  In exchange for these though we do get some interesting
<br />
predictions and explanations, which I have largely posted before, but
<br />
here are a few of them repeated:
<br />
<br />1. The physical laws of our universe should be expressible as a relatively
<br />
simple computer program, and likewise with the initial conditions.
<br />
<br />2. The universe should not be much bigger than it needs to be in order
<br />
to allow human beings to exist.
<br />
<br />3. There should be no substantially simpler computer program that can
<br />
produce observers nearly as easily as our universe does.
<br />
<br />4. There should not be vastly greater numbers of aliens in the universe
<br />
than humans.
<br />
<br />5. There should not be vastly more human beings (or anything we would
<br />
consider observers) in the entire future of the universe than are
<br />
alive today.
<br />
<br />6. There should not be vastly more conscious animals in the world than
<br />
humans.
<br />
<br />7. If it ever becomes possible to miniaturize and/or greatly speed-up the
<br />
human mind, we should be surprised to find ourselves as such a person
<br />
(unless that number of such minds is greatly increased to compensate
<br />
for these factors).
<br />
<br />8. We will almost never find ourselves experiencing human observer-moments
<br />
that have much lower measure than typical ones (such as being a one million
<br />
year old cave man).
<br />
<br />I see these as very powerful predictions for such a simple model, and
<br />
my hope is that the problems with the UDist will be able to be cleared
<br />
up with continual improvements in our understanding of the nature of
<br />
computation.
