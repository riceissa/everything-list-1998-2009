But there is no true/false in saying that prime numbers exist, unless 
<br />
there is another deeper assumption such as &quot;natural numbers obeys such 
<br />
and such principles, in which case the question becomes, why are 
<br />
natural numbers obeying those principles. Ultimately you get to &quot;it 
<br />
just is, that is why I take those axioms, I feel it to be true, etc.&quot; 
<br />
Ultimately, you assert that you think that those axioms looks better 
<br />
than others because that's just what you feel confident about.
<br />
Only before Godel (and Dedekind) could people believe that some axiom 
<br />
in arithmetic have to be true in some absolute sense. The difference 
<br />
between numbers and &quot;bad/good&quot; is that they are simpler and after many 
<br />
centuries of reflection we know them better. About good/bad the 
<br />
scientific study has not yet begin, probably because it is extremely 
<br />
complex and also because it touches the religion and the social stuff 
<br />
(religare = to make link (between subjects)).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What would you say to the Romans who attended events at the Colliseum,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and thought there was nothing wrong at all with feeding people to wild 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; animals?


</em><br />
That they are barbarian having not the slightest humility in human 
<br />
affair, and that I am not astonished by such behavior from the people 
<br />
who did make the infinite blaspheme of mixing state and theology. We 
<br />
are still paying the high price of such an inconsiderable confusion.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What would you say to an alien species which had reached a high level 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technological development by routinely killing the less intelligent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; portion of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; population in order to control their numbers and improve the gene pool?


</em><br />
The same.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would you say to a citizen of Nazi Germany 70 years down the track if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hitler had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; succeeded in conquering Europe and every schoolchild had grown up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what a great man he was?


</em><br />
Unless complete revisionism, I don't believe anyone would have take the 
<br />
industrial murdering as something great. Of course such an event would 
<br />
have maintained such a barbarism for a longer time, except that they 
<br />
would have been revisionist.
<br />
It is not a coincidence that today the same who shows sign of 
<br />
willingness to eliminate the jews (again) are those who shows 
<br />
willingness to pretend the shoah has never happened.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You could try to persuade them that your values were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better and nobler, but you couldn't persuade them that your values are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rational or more consistent with the facts, because they aren't.


</em><br />
They could be more universal (like number theory or computer science or 
<br />
the whole lobian interview).
<br />
What makes you so sure that civilization will not help all people to 
<br />
understand the non normativeness of social values, so that, although we 
<br />
cannot impose such value, we can still hope to teach them by example 
<br />
and making them available to more and more individuals.
<br />
About ethical questions I am not a relativist, at all. Relativists 
<br />
confuse hardness and unnameability of the concepts involved with 
<br />
impossibility to give sense to those concepts.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are several differences between the axioms of ethics and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aesthetics on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the one hand and those of logic, mathematics and science on the other. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you can bet that any sentient species would arrive at exactly the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same rules
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of arithmetic and chemistry, but might have completely bizarre, or at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different, notions of ethics and aesthetics.

</em><br />
Of course I disagree. We could have different interest in the use of 
<br />
resource in the universe, but I bet we could agree on general ethic 
<br />
(like your beautiful formula: gratuitous (if that means something) 
<br />
suffering is bad).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another is that matters of ethics and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aesthetics are not really third person communicable:


</em><br />
I agree. But mathematical truth is already like that. We can agree on 
<br />
the truth of many mathematical sentences like 17 is prime, but also on 
<br />
ethical sentences, again like your &quot;it is bad to inflict gratuitous 
<br />
pain&quot;, and still been unable to define &quot;true&quot; &quot;good&quot;, etc.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an alien species may have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notions about these that can only be understood by someone with their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychology.


</em><br />
This could be true for some piece of math, even piece of arithmetics.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is because ethics and aesthetics at a fundamental level involve 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emotion, whereas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science and logic do not.


</em><br />
You say so. I doubt it. Math is full of emotion. For contingent reason 
<br />
we have to hide them (if only for publishing motivation). And it is too 
<br />
early to explain the intrinsic emotion &quot;in&quot; the math (although this 
<br />
will develop by itself with the evolution of machines).




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An unconscious machine might systematically churn out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical theorems, but it won't ever provide an honest opinion as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eating beans is good or bad.


</em><br />
Why? If the machine has a built in fuzzy program like &quot;do anything to 
<br />
preserve self-integrity&quot;, and if it happens that &quot;eating beans&quot; seems, 
<br />
for such a machine to be dangerous (for correct or incorrect reason), 
<br />
then the machine could develop some &quot;honest&quot; opinion on that matter.
<br />
Robot on Mars could develop opinion like &quot;martian sand is not good for 
<br />
the working of our wheels&quot;.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Finally, although in scientific discourse people might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually concede that they are dealing with axioms, in ethics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; especially this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; often taken as offensive, and part of the purpose of religion is to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give an absolute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; status to which at some level everyone knows is not absolute.


</em><br />
This just illustrates my main point here. It is only with Vatican II 
<br />
that modern catholic theologians have agreed that it is impossible that 
<br />
faith could be in opposition with reason(*), and this despite it can be 
<br />
argued that christian theology is 2/3 plotinian (and thus rationalist). 
<br />
This cannot be used to forget that Christian religion has been 
<br />
normative on ethic during many centuries and this explain why axiomatic 
<br />
thinking on ethical questions can still today seems offensive. With 
<br />
comp, just speculating a little bit, ethical questions are as absolute 
<br />
as they are NON normative.
<br />
(*) see also the encyclic by Jean Paul II (Fides and Ratio). See also 
<br />
Al Ghazali for a deep muslim explanation of that very idea. Of course 
<br />
fanatics of any obedience (christian, marxist, muslims, ...) mock such 
<br />
ideas. That's why all &quot;intellectuals&quot; are enemy of any fanatics.



<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Not in any normative sense. But once we bet on a theory (like comp),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; then we get mathematical tools which can provide general explanation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what is bad, and also explain why such definition cannot be normative,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; making the bad/good distinctions an ideal goal for complex 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sufficiently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; self-sustaining machines societies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What if they're Nazi machines?


</em><br />
In &quot;Conscience and Mécanisme&quot;, well actually in this list too (a long 
<br />
time ago) I have proposed a simple recursive axiomatic of &quot;conscience&quot; 
<br />
(moral consciousness or moral superiority, or moral goodness).

<br />
1) A machine is said to be good if the machine is not bad.
<br />
2) And there exist to kind of bad machines: those who asserts they are 
<br />
good and those who asserts their are bad.
<br />
Given that the main assertion of the nazi is that they are good (see 
<br />
mein kampf) , it follows they are bad.
<br />
Better to fight or run away from such nazi machines ...



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am touched by your confidence that the rational will lead to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I wish it were so, but it isn't and it never has been.


</em><br />
G* proves that rationality lead to the good. Like Plotinus I hope 
<br />
and/or bet that rationality lead to the good. It is my faith, if you 
<br />
want.
<br />
But G* proves also that any machine believing strongly or just 
<br />
asserting (without interrogation mark) that rationality leads to the 
<br />
good will be irrational and will be lead to the bad.
<br />
G* is full of &quot;true propositions&quot; which when asserted, proved, or 
<br />
institutionalized, become false. (cf BDt -&gt; ~Dt)
<br />
This, imo, explains many confusions and even many suffering when lobian 
<br />
machines try to argue on those matter and forget the interrogation 
<br />
mark. With comp there is a sense to say that we are at best &quot;divine 
<br />
hypotheses&quot;, and God will &quot;rightly&quot; abandon us the day &quot;we&quot; take for 
<br />
granted that we are His/Her/It  *last* word. This could really be a 
<br />
sort of cosmic fatal error for &quot;us&quot;, but a chance for more humble 
<br />
different divine hypothesis (spider? bacteria? ...).
<br />
More on the ground, I do believe &quot;democracy&quot; is a progress, and that we 
<br />
are making some ethical progress on this planet, albeit slowly. In 
<br />
particular if a &quot;random &quot;child is thirsty then the probability that he 
<br />
will drink water is bigger in a democracy than in a non democracy. And 
<br />
that is good, no?. Democracy is even a meta-progress in the non 
<br />
normative comp sense. It does not tell us what is good or wrong, on the 
<br />
contrary, it shows us a way to doubt political ideas by letting us try 
<br />
different political programs and revising them (by democracy I mean 
<br />
only repeated &quot;honest&quot; elections). But of course democracy does not 
<br />
*necessarily* lead to the good.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I would only be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a little less frightened of a rational murderous regime than of an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irrational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one.

</em><br />
That remark is related with many conceptual difficulties including the 
<br />
free will question (like your use of the term &quot;gratuitous&quot; which is the 
<br />
only weakness I see in your axiom for &quot;bad&quot; above). To be short I will 
<br />
just ask you how could a murder be irrational? It seems to me that a 
<br />
murder without ratio can only be a sort of accident, or a non sense 
<br />
(like a really gratuitous act perhaps).
<br />
I would be frightened to be killed in *any* situation, but in any case 
<br />
I would prefer to know the ratio. If the killer is just insane, this is 
<br />
equivalent as bad luck (like to be killed by a natural catastrophe). If 
<br />
the killer is a sadist, I would prefer the killer acknowledging it 
<br />
(instead of inventing pretext or confusing lies). If the killer is a 
<br />
racist, then it will hurt me morally much more (bad ratio, promise of 
<br />
many other victims, etc.), if the killer decides to kill me for 
<br />
ideological ratio, well it is like racism (bad ratio).
<br />
As doctor you probably know that victim who survive some natural 
<br />
disaster recover quite more easily, for equivalent 3-wounds, than 
<br />
victims who have been the target of purposefully human organized 
<br />
disaster.
