<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you built a model society and set its citizens instincts, goals,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws-from-heaven (but really from you) and so on, would that suffice to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provide &quot;meaning&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />It would not provide ultimate meaning for two reasons.  (Note that I
<br />
am not the originator of these reasons, although I'm just shooting
<br />
from the hip without citing references which don't come to me right
<br />
now.  They have been expounded many times by people who are more
<br />
intellectually strong than I am.)  But here goes.   One reason is on
<br />
the &quot;logical&quot; level (i.e. repeatable facts, propositions and
<br />
inference).  The other reason on the &quot;spiritual&quot; level (i.e. you have
<br />
to &quot;see&quot; it with your intuition, &quot;expanded consciousness&quot;, faith [not
<br />
blind faith],..).
<br />
<br />1) Logical reason, but still important and inescapable:  If the source
<br />
of meaning was from within the &quot;system&quot;, i.e. the observable/
<br />
controllable universe, then we can always ask the why question when we
<br />
find the source. This is not acceptable as part of a scientifically
<br />
observable causal universe, as it contradicts it.  A closed system
<br />
which is supposedly totally explainable will always have at least one
<br />
fixed point that is unexplainable.  This is the old positivism
<br />
problem.  This is actually part of the problem with a straw-man
<br />
caricature god, in our image, i.e. any thing that we (as part of the
<br />
universe) can think up.
<br />
2) Spiritual reason, but no less important and inescapable:  Perhaps
<br />
this one is more for people (like Bruno, and Jesse Mazer?) who accept
<br />
the possible existence of difference levels of reasoning, based on
<br />
different ways of &quot;seeing&quot; truth (a la G and G*).  We just know
<br />
somehow that there is something inexplicable about personhood.  There
<br />
is a hunger in us that wants to always ask the question why, a hunger
<br />
for the meaning behind whatever layer of stuff we just discovered.
<br />
Perhaps it's like looking for our true home, or for the reason why
<br />
this is or is not our true home.  It's like Neo in the Matrix.  And
<br />
there have been signs the meaning behind this existence poking in this
<br />
existence now and then, and seen by different people.  Yes, we can
<br />
always imagine how someone could have thought these signs up, or
<br />
interpretted them up, and thus explain everything back down to the
<br />
purely logical level, dealing only with repeatable things.  Like a 2-
<br />
dimensional shadow world can make up laws that somehow explain the
<br />
behavior of shadows and say that there are only shadows, but it is not
<br />
seeing the whole reality.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes. Now we're startin' to talk!  I don't know much of the language,

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but I think that when people experience what some may call words like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;enlightenment&quot;, &quot;cosmic consciousness&quot;, etc. they are experiencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; something that is really there.  In fact, they use words like &quot;seeing&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reality as it &quot;actually&quot; is, etc.  They speak of &quot;wholeness&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;integralness&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Except that people would still have the same experiences whether or not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something were really there, just as they would still experience the sky as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a dome whether or not it is in fact a dome. In other words, if you imagine a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being in a universe without meaning, cosmic consciousness, enlightenment and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the other significant things which are supposed to be there, but with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; otherwise the same physical laws etc., can you think of any reason why such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a being would or wouldn't come up with the same ideas as humans have,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assuming similar evolutionary provenance?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<br />This is like saying &quot;If you imagine a being in a universe who cannot
<br />
see the true reality of the universe, but with otherwise the same
<br />
reality, can you think of any reason why such a being would or
<br />
wouldn't come up with the same ideas as humans have, assuming similar
<br />
evolutionary provenance?&quot;  If he/she cannot see the true reality, then
<br />
the ideas would not reflect the whole reality, regardless of how he/
<br />
she came up with them.  The ideas may be locally useful, but as I said
<br />
above, there is more to it than that.  Humans are deeper than that.
