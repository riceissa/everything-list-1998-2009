Hi Tom, Hi George,
<br />
<br />George, and others, you can skip the &quot;partial answer to Tom&quot;,  and go 
<br />
directly to &quot;K, the master set&quot; below.
<br />
Tom seems to propose an alternate proof, which does not convince me, 
<br />
although I cannot right now provide a full counter-example. Note that 
<br />
the section &quot;K, the Master Set&quot; could already put some light on that 
<br />
matter.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />1) Partial answer to Tom:
<br />
<br />Le 17-juil.-06, &#x2c6; 22:42, Tom Caylor a &#x17d;crit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now *your* G is just defined by G(n) = GEN2(n).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But doesn't G output the range of one of the set of *all* partial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recursive functions, whereas GEN2 outputs the code of a *fortran*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program?  So shouldn't it be the following, where execute() actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; executes the fortran program generated by GEN2(n)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; G(n) = execute(GEN2(n))
</em><br />
<br /><br />I should have written G(n) = Gen2(n) (n)  (= execute Pn on n)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Tell me if you are convince that &quot;your&quot; and &quot;my&quot; G are programmable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They are both programmable, but I think they are both non-*executable*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on &quot;k&quot; (if G=Fk), for the same reason, self-reference.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Let me give you a counterexample with a sequence of total functions.
<br />
<br />Let Hi be a RE sequence of (codes) of total functions. (so the seq. Hi 
<br />
is ­  from the seq. Fi)
<br />
<br />Let GBruno be defined by GBruno(n) = Hn(n) +1
<br />
Let GTom be defined by GTom(n) = Hn(n)
<br />
<br />Could GBruno belongs to the sequence Hi?
<br />
If GBruno belongs to the Hi, it means there is a number kbr such that 
<br />
GBruno = Hkbr, thus
<br />
GBruno(kbr) = Hkbr(kbr) = Hkbr(kbr)+1. So I can be sure that GBruno 
<br />
does not belong to the sequence Hi. OK? (the usual simple subtraction 
<br />
would lead to 0 = 1)
<br />
Does GTom belongs to Hi?
<br />
If GTom belongs to the Hi, it means there is a number kto such Gtom = 
<br />
Hkto, thus
<br />
Gtom(kto) = Hkto(kto), which is the case by definition of &quot;your&quot; Gtom. 
<br />
No contradiction occurs, so in principle the total function Gtom could 
<br />
belongs to the list, and indeed is equal to the sequence Hi, despite 
<br />
self-reference.
<br />
<br />The same could be true for the partial recursive Fi.
<br />
I don't see any reason why, if G(n) is defined by Fn(n), G should be 
<br />
necessarily undefined on its own index. Your argument could rely on the 
<br />
way you implement G.
<br />
<br />Actually I could perhaps build an ad hoc counterexample working for 
<br />
some particular enumeration of the Fi, but I need some time to do it, 
<br />
if it is possible....
<br />
<br />So I propose we come back on this after a while. Probably you will 
<br />
figure out what is happening by yourself. Actually your intuition is 
<br />
right: something happens with self-application (see below). If I try to 
<br />
explain all of it here, this could be a little confusing. What you need 
<br />
to be sure of is the fact that when G(n) is defined by Fn(n)+1, then 
<br />
G(k) will be necessarily undefined on all k such that G = Fk.
<br />
(Independently of the fact that you could be right that G'(k') is also 
<br />
undefined when G' (n) is defined by Fn(n), and k' is a code or index of 
<br />
G'; but your argument is not a proof because it depends on the precise 
<br />
way G is implemented). I must think ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />2) K, the Master set
<br />
<br />Emil Post, the founder of Recursion Theory, introduced the following 
<br />
set (of numbers) which will appears to be fundamental. It will 
<br />
correspond, in term of set, to the universal machine. K will be an 
<br />
universal RE set, capable of &quot;generating&quot; all RE sets.
<br />
<br />I recall the code of the RE sets are generable, and the RE sets are the 
<br />
domain Wi of the Fi.
<br />
<br />Definition: K is the set of numbers x such that Fx(x) is defined.
<br />
<br />So K is the set of natural number x such that the xth programs in the 
<br />
enumeration of the codes of all programs does stop when apply on 
<br />
itself. I prefer to talk about self-application instead of 
<br />
self-reference (to follow standard terminology).
<br />
<br /><br />I give exercises (if only because my office is an oven and my brain is 
<br />
boiling hot):
<br />
<br />1) Is K an RE set?   Answer: yes  (why?)
<br />
<br />2) Is N \ K an RE set?  Answer: no  (why? Hint: diagonalization)
<br />
<br />3) From this conclude that the halting problem is insoluble.
<br />
<br />4) try to justify that someone having an algorithm for generating K 
<br />
will be able to generate any Wi. Put in another way, from a mechanical 
<br />
solution to the problem &quot;does Fx(x) stop&quot; we can construct an algorithm 
<br />
solving the apparent more general problem &quot;does Fx(y)&quot; stop.
<br />
<br />5) From &quot;2)&quot; show that N \ K is productive (like the set of codes of 
<br />
the computable growing functions). That is N \ K is not only not-RE, 
<br />
but is constructively not-RE. You need to find an algorithm A such that 
<br />
for any Wi included in N \ K, A(i) will give an element in N \ K which 
<br />
is not in Wi.  If you look at that Wi as an attempt to enumerate all N 
<br />
\ K, you can see the algorithm A as providing a counter-example. 
<br />
Conclude that N \ K can be better and better approximated by iterations 
<br />
in the constructive transfinite (like we done with the fairy).
<br />
<br /><br />MAIN DEFINITION (Emil Post):
<br />
<br />A set E (of numbers) is called CREATIVE if
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) E is RE
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) N \  E is productive
<br />
<br />So the exercise can be sum up into: show that K is a creative set. 
<br />
There are deep relations between creative sets, universal machines, and 
<br />
lobian &quot;theories/machines&quot; which we will exploit soon or later.
<br />
<br />Take all your time, and (to all) don't hesitate to ask any question or 
<br />
to make any remarks.
<br />
<br />Bruno
