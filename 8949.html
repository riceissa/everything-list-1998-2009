Georges: please, hgave merci on me! 'my' English is
<br />
the 5th of my acquired languages, so to read - and
<br />
realize what it stands for - that long a post is
<br />
(almost) beyond my mental endurance. 
<br />
I try to pick some of your remarks as non-conform to
<br />
how I feel. Consider please the rest as agreed. (At
<br />
least for now - ha ha - which means the &lt;G&gt; I wrote, a
<br />
usual WEB-abbreviation for &lt;Grin&gt;. 
<br />
I will leave those passages of yours which I want to
<br />
address and will try to respond to them right there,
<br />
in 
<br />
UNMARKED lines, while your copied text-line carry a &gt;
<br />
.
<br />
<br />Thanks for taking so much time to respond.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;especially with quotes).
</em><br />
Matching the sophistication of your thoughts I think.
<br />
I  also implied the thinking 'level' of the
<br />
list-topics.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think I have the same kind of feeble thinking tool
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as you have. However I am not sure that common sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is of much help for questions like &quot;why is there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something?&quot;. Rather it is likely that it would
</em><br />
confuse &gt;us on such topics. It simply did not evolved
<br />
for that. &gt;Our common sense is more a handicap than a
<br />
good guide &gt;to understand quantum mechanics. The
<br />
situation is even &gt;worse here. My common sense also
<br />
says that to me. Of &gt;course it does not follows that
<br />
nothing (or everythng) &gt;makes sense.
<br />
<br />QM is not for me: it is a linear way to perpetrate the
<br />
reductionist model of physical sciences in ways not
<br />
too approachable for common sense - as you said.
<br />
Q-science:  IMO (=in my opinion) an extension of the
<br />
QM-nightmare.
<br />
A physicist once retorted: &quot;I can live with paradoxes&quot;
<br />
<br />well, I cannot. I rather rely on MY common sense, even
<br />
if it is &quot;not on the level&quot;.
<br />
<br />I skip older discussion parts about my numberculus,
<br />
the 'homunculus' of the numbers' self-activity.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; --(meaning: Georges-text):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would not say that. I don't believe that numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are &quot;there&quot; for any purpose. They just are there (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist). But&gt; their existence might be all that we
</em><br />
need &gt;to explain the (perceived) existence of
<br />
everything &gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;else.
</em><br />
<br />Right you are: not the 'numbers' are there for any
<br />
purpose, we use the idea of numbers in our logic for
<br />
explanations substituting paradoxes with other ones. 
<br />
My question: &quot;Are they (numbers) really there?&quot; 0r
<br />
they only exist in our sophistication and usage? Do we
<br />
ever 'perceive' a counted item in our 1st person
<br />
impact? Or we just get percepts and in our view
<br />
'number' them?
<br />
&nbsp;*
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [JM earlier]:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What else must be there to provide such existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -
</em><br />
wrong word: it should ask: what else MAY be there...
<br />
&nbsp;*
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We come here to the hard part of the story. My point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that nothing else needs to be there to provide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such existence (this is a speculation indeed). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I will try to keep it simple. Let's assume that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;numbers exist (this is a speculation at that point),
</em><br />
<br />Of course they exist: we invented them so they exist. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; not only natural numbers but also real numbers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hilbert spaces and all the &quot;higher level objects&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that &quot;comes with&quot;. 
</em><br />
<br />As you said above: &quot;this is speculation indeed&quot;.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's also consider the possibility that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe in which we live strictly follows some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;mathematical rules&quot; and that it is completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;determined by them (this is another speculation).
</em><br />
<br />I don't think this is attributable to English: in all
<br />
languages people speak in reverse: The universe (or
<br />
whatever Bruno may call it) does not FOLLOW any rules
<br />
that humans derive from their ways of thinking -
<br />
explaining the (easily misunderstood) observations. We
<br />
observe, evaluate (right or wrong) and deduct &quot;rules&quot; 
<br />
(again right or wrong). As long as they do not bounce
<br />
into contradiction, we pride ourselves by &quot;nature is
<br />
following our rules&quot;. When the tachyons showed higher
<br />
speed than 'c' the verdict was &quot;wrong observation&quot;,
<br />
not a speed exceeding Einstein's assumed limit for
<br />
nature.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is equivalent to say that this universe is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isomorphic to one of the above mentionned &quot;higher
</em><br />
level objects&quot;.
<br />
<br />Nice words. Do they mean something? 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The last and hard point is that, from a mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point of view, all the objects that are isomorphic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one to another are the same mathematical object (just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as there is only one set of natural numbers, no
</em><br />
matter &gt;how is is built) and, if the universe is
<br />
isomorphic to &gt;a mathematical object, it could just be
<br />
this
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical object.
</em><br />
<br />I think I can decipher what you wrote (?), firstly:
<br />
&quot;from a mathematical point of view&quot;  (if not, not).
<br />
Isomorphic requires the ONE set of characteristics we
<br />
are 'allolwed' to use, while 'nature' is unrestricted.
<br />
<br />Then do not miss your &quot;IF&quot; - and 'if not'? 
<br />
I still do not understand &quot;mathematical object&quot; but
<br />
that is the feebleness of my common sense mind.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's consider an outrageously simplified view of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe as particles interacting with each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;others according to a set of mathematical laws. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical structure of the universe is likely to
</em><br />
be &gt;much more complex than that but the following
<br />
might &gt;still be correct when applied to a more complex
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structure.
</em><br />
<br />I don't know about 'particles', they are the figments
<br />
of the explanations for ununderstood phenomena. Try to
<br />
reduce them into their ingreients: no particle is
<br />
left, 
<br />
unless you call a (hypothetical?) quark a particle. I
<br />
&quot;made&quot; macromolecules for 50 years: now I see that
<br />
there are no such 'things' - only we assume them for
<br />
effects (phenomena?) we think to perceive. No atoms
<br />
either. But they have their mathematics.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem with the idea that the universe could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply be a mathematical object is that our common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sense strongly suggest that a physical universe has
</em><br />
to &gt;be different from a mathematical object because
<br />
there &gt;is to be &quot;something in the particles&quot; to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;make them real&quot;. ...
</em><br />
<br />I skip the rest, this is NOT my way of thinking, so I
<br />
do not discuss it here. 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;...why should there be some &quot;magical substance&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inside the particles? Isn't that enough that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;follow the rules? What more could bring the presence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of &quot;something else&quot; inside the particles? What the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;idea of an &quot;internal substance&quot; could add to any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explanation? Isn't this idea just irrational and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;similar to the concept of &quot;soul&quot; in a dualist view? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Isn't even that a kind of dualism?
</em><br />
<br />I like that a lot, thank you Georges.
