Stathis writes
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I did not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; mean that there is no explanation possible for consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; It is likely that in the course of time the neuronal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; mechanisms behind the phenomenon will be worked out and it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; will be possible to build intelligent, conscious machines.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine that advanced aliens have already achieved this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; through surreptitious study of humans over a number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; decades. Their models of human brain function are so good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; that by running an emulation of one or more humans and their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; environment they can predict their behaviour better than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; humans can themselves.
</em><br />
<br />Well put.
<br />
<br />An interesting point to add is that since human behavior
<br />
is almost surely not compressible, the *only* way that they
<br />
can learn what a human is going to do is to, in effect, run
<br />
one (the mocked up one in their lab). As you say, they run
<br />
an *emulation*.
<br />
<br />But this could mean that they had *no* special insight into
<br />
consciousness,  because by adjusting the teleporter, Scotty
<br />
can &quot;find out&quot; things too just by making a physical copy of
<br />
the Captain, and, for example, finding out what he'd say
<br />
about giving the engineers a raise.
<br />
<br />But you have described Martian science very well. Here is
<br />
what I think that they are capable of that *is* important:
<br />
they could tell (or announce) with very high accuracy
<br />
whether a species was conscious, and to what extent, in
<br />
its natural environment, and do all this just from the
<br />
creature's DNA (and perhaps a little info on the inter-
<br />
uterine environment).
<br />
<br />Here is an analogy: in a cold hut in the Scottish highlands
<br />
in 1440, two bright, but shivering, people are debating the
<br />
nature of warmth. Says one: &quot;Brrr. Some day the scientists
<br />
will be so advanced that the can objectively measure hotness,
<br />
and you and I will more closely agree.&quot;  And he turned out
<br />
to be right, as we know now.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, I think you will agree (although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Jonathan Colvin may not) that despite this excellent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; understanding of the processes giving rise to human conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; experience, the aliens may still have absolutely no idea what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the experience is actually like.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but what does that mean?  What does it mean for, say,
<br />
you to know what it's like when I play 1. e4 in a game of
<br />
chess?  I can tell you that it's probably nothing at all
<br />
like when *you* play 1. e4.  But it's strickly a function of
<br />
how similar our chess careers have been, whether we both 
<br />
have the same opinion of the Alapin counter to the Sicilian,
<br />
and so forth.  So in effect, it really comes down to how 
<br />
much you are already me when you play 1. e4.
<br />
<br />Somebody here said it much better than I: they said that
<br />
you have to almost be someone to in order to know what
<br />
it's like to be them.
<br />
<br />Jonathan then says
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No, I'd agree that they have no idea what the experience is like. But this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is no more remarkable than the fact that allthough we may have an excellent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; understanding of photons, we can not travel at the speed of light, or that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; although we may have an excellent understanding of trees, yet we can not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; photosynthesize. Neither of these &quot;problems&quot; seem particularly hard.
</em><br />
<br />I totally agree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are thus at an impasse, agreeing on all the facts but differing in our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appraisal of the facts.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe. But since you (Stathis) write so well, could you summarize 
<br />
what your adversaries seem to be saying and what you say? I'm less
<br />
sure (than you) that no progress can be made.
<br />
<br />thanks,
<br />
Lee
