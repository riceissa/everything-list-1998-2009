<br />
Lee,
<br />
<br />What you are describing here is panpsychism. If I insist that it is 
<br />
impossible to know whether and in what way an entity is conscious without 
<br />
actually *being* that entity oneself, then to be consistent I have to admit 
<br />
that anything and everything might be conscious. OK; I admit it; 
<br />
technically, I'm a panpsychist. However, I can treat this belief in the same 
<br />
way as I treat a belief in solipsism. Looking at the world around me, other 
<br />
humans behave in roughly the same way I do, so by analogy with my own 
<br />
experience, I assume they are conscious. Rocks, on the other hand, display 
<br />
no behaviour, so I assume they are not conscious. Animals fall somewhere 
<br />
between humans and rocks, so I assume they have varying levels of 
<br />
consciousness depending on the complexity of their nervous system. The 
<br />
implicit theory behind this classification scheme is that consciousness is 
<br />
associated with the sort of information processing that occurs in organisms 
<br />
with central nervous systems. Using empathy as a substitute for direct 
<br />
experience, I can't be absolutely sure of this, of course, but then I can't 
<br />
be absolutely sure that the world doesn't disappear when I turn my back on 
<br />
it, either.
<br />
<br />Now to my aliens. It is a nuisance when discussing philosophy of mind that 
<br />
we cannot switch our consciousness off in order to study it as disinterested 
<br />
observers. Addressing this problem, my hypothetical aliens are intelligent 
<br />
but non-conscious or differently-conscious. I did not state this in my last 
<br />
post, so you may have assumed that any intelligent entity would be 
<br />
conscious. Maybe this is so; maybe it is even the case that any aliens able 
<br />
to study us at all must have enough in common with us to recognise us as 
<br />
fellow conscious entities. However, for the sake of argument, I wanted to 
<br />
eliminate the kind of empathy that allows us to believe that other humans or 
<br />
animals are conscious. The point I wanted to make is that *only* through 
<br />
empathy (as a substitute for direct experience) would the aliens recognise 
<br />
us as conscious. There is nothing they could go on from our behaviour alone, 
<br />
no matter how well they understood it, that would provide them with an idea 
<br />
of what it is like to be human from the point of view of a human. Even if 
<br />
they had derived some rule through contact with multiple species, eg. &quot;any 
<br />
organism able to count to ten is conscious&quot;, this would only be understood 
<br />
as an abstraction unless they were in some way able to empathise with us.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; photon or to *be* a tree photosynthesising. Most people would say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; photons and trees aren't conscious, and therefore they *can* be entirely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; understood from a 3rd person perspective.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;On this list??  You think that most people *here* presume that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;photons and trees are not conscious?  On what grounds could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they possibly think that?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;After all, Consciousness is Deeply Mysterious, and thus might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;penetrate anything or everything to an unknown degree.  In fact,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it may turn out that there exists an inverse square law:  something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is Conscious precisely to the square of the degree that it *appears*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to us  not to be conscious.  (The appearance of consciousness and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evidently conscious exchanges between Conscious entities, you see,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;serves as an outlet, and diminishes True Consciousness.) Why not?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Perhaps this is true, but it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not logically consistent to say that it must be true and still maintain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1st person/ 3rd person distinction we have been discussing. This is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the whole point of the distinction is that it is not possible to deduce 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; understand that which is special about 1st person experience (namely,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness) from an entirely 3rd person perspective.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, in other words, it is ineffable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The aliens I have described in my example [who were very clever and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; who could manufacture consciousness in objects under their control]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could be as different from us as we are different from trees, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; they could easily conclude that an emulation of our minds is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not fundamentally different from an emulation of our weather.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Oh my.  So while I understood earlier from you that your Martians were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wizards at creating human consciousness in objects, I didn't gather that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they *themselves* were possibly not anything-like-conscious. Have I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;misunderstood anything?
</em><br />
