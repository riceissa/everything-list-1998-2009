Part of what I wanted to get at in my thought experiment is the
<br />
bafflement and confusion an AI should feel when exposed to human ideas
<br />
about consciousness.  Various people here have proffered their own
<br />
ideas, and we might assume that the AI would read these suggestions,
<br />
along with many other ideas that contradict the ones offered here.
<br />
It seems hard to escape the conclusion that the only logical response
<br />
is for the AI to figuratively throw up its hands and say that it is
<br />
impossible to know if it is conscious, because even humans cannot agree
<br />
on what consciousness is.
<br />
<br />In particular I don't think an AI could be expected to claim that it
<br />
knows that it is conscious, that consciousness is a deep and intrinsic
<br />
part of itself, that whatever else it might be mistaken about it could
<br />
not be mistaken about being conscious.  I don't see any logical way it
<br />
could reach this conclusion by studying the corpus of writings on the
<br />
topic.  If anyone disagrees, I'd like to hear how it could happen.
<br />
<br />And the corollary to this is that perhaps humans also cannot legitimately
<br />
make such claims, since logically their position is not so different
<br />
from that of the AI.  In that case the seemingly axiomatic question of
<br />
whether we are conscious may after all be something that we could be
<br />
mistaken about.
<br />
