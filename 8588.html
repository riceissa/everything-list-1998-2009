<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may be easy to find logical flaws in the above credo, but I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maintain that it is so deeply ingrained in each of us that it would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very difficult to overcome, except perhaps on the intellectual level.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />OK but that would not make sense. I don't think any third person 
<br />
(intellectual) belief can put any doubt on a first person conviction. 
<br />
To learn that the sun is not the one going around the earth will never 
<br />
change our  conviction that the sun apparently turns around us.
<br />
Many difficulties are easier to be approached when we keep up 
<br />
explicitly the 1-3 distinction.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One could imagine other beliefs about personal identity that might 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have evolved if there were the appropriate selection pressure; for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, identifying as part of a group or swarm organism. The point 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is, our belief is not scientifically or philosophically &quot;right&quot;; it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just our belief.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />All right. I will say more because some people ask me out of line what 
<br />
are G, G*, and G* \  G.
<br />
I am thinking to define &quot;machine science&quot; by what machine can prove 
<br />
correctly about themselves, and by machine theology what machine can 
<br />
hope correctly about themselves ; where a machine proves a proposition 
<br />
p correctly when the machine proves p and p is true, and a machine 
<br />
hopes p correctly when the machine hopes p and p is true.
<br />
This is a non normative definition of science and theology because such 
<br />
definition does not forces us to revise any scientific or theological 
<br />
prejudices we could have, a priori.
<br />
<br />Now let M be a sound machine. By definition a sound machine is a 
<br />
machine which proves only true propositions. Let us write &quot;Bp&quot; the 
<br />
proposition that the machine M proves p. To say that the machine is 
<br />
sound is equivalent as saying that IF the machine proves p THEN p is 
<br />
true. This means the proposition Bp -&gt; p is always true, whatever 
<br />
particular proposition p represents (assuming of course that p is 
<br />
written in some language the machine can understand or at least 
<br />
manipulates formally).
<br />
<br />So for each p the proposition Bp -&gt; p is true for M, and this is just 
<br />
equivalent as saying that the machine is sound. Question: is it true 
<br />
that for each p B(Bp -&gt; p) will be true?
<br />
Let p b any obviously false sentence like a contradiction (like q &amp; ~q, 
<br />
or better the constant f). If B(Bp -&gt; p) was always true, we would have 
<br />
B(Bf -&gt; f); which means (giving that &quot;Ba&quot; means that the machine proves 
<br />
a) that the machine proves Bf -&gt; f. But Bf -&gt; f is equivalent with ~Bf. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Verify with a thruth table in case of doubt). But ~Bf means that the 
<br />
machine does not prove the false, but this means that the machine is 
<br />
consistent.  So if B(Bp -&gt; p) was true for any p, then the machine 
<br />
could prove its own consistency: the machine would prove
<br />
Bf -&gt; f, that is ~Bf (consistency; you can write it also Dt). And this 
<br />
is in contradiction with Godel's second incompleteness theorem.
<br />
So soundness (Bp -&gt; p) or more particularly consistency (Bf -&gt; f) are 
<br />
typical example of true propositions about the sound machine M, that 
<br />
the machine M is unable to prove. So soundness and consistency, thanks 
<br />
to the second incompleteness theorem of Godel, are example of 
<br />
proposition that such a machine can hope for, and hope correctly, as WE 
<br />
know (giving that we talk by definition about a sound machine).
<br />
<br />A natural question is the following: does such a B follow some modal 
<br />
logical laws? The answer is affirmative.
<br />
<br />Basically, the theorem of SOLOVAY is just that for such sound machine, 
<br />
the modal logic G formalises completely the science of the machine, and 
<br />
the modal logic G* formalizes completely the theology of the machine.
<br />
<br />G has the following axioms and rules:
<br />
K   B(p -&gt; q) -&gt; (Bp -&gt; Bq)
<br />
L   B(Bp -&gt; p) -&gt; Bp
<br />
Rules : modus ponens (if the machine proves A and if the machine proves 
<br />
A -&gt; B then the machine will prove B) and necessitation (if the machine 
<br />
proves A then the machine will prove BA).
<br />
<br />G* has the following axioms and rules:
<br />
As axioms: all theorems of G, +
<br />
Bp -&gt; p  (the machine is sound)
<br />
Rules: modus ponens (ONLY!).
<br />
<br />In general G (and G*)  are thought as being the set of theorems which 
<br />
can be derived from the axioms and rules given, and thus are infinite 
<br />
sets of formulas. What I note G* \ G is the set difference of the 
<br />
(infinite) set G* and G, that is: &quot;pure theology&quot;: the set of 
<br />
everything which is true for the machine but that the machine cannot 
<br />
prove. The machine can only hope such proposition, and WE know that 
<br />
such machine can correctly hope those propositions.
<br />
<br />I must go. Here are important formulas (and their standard name) that 
<br />
we will meet again and again. I let you think about which sort of 
<br />
&quot;multiverse&quot; (Kripke frame) makes each of those formula automatically 
<br />
true, whatever the illumination (the valuation of the sentence letters) 
<br />
is.
<br />
<br />K = B(p-&gt;q) -&gt; (Bp -&gt; Bq)
<br />
t = Bp -&gt; p,
<br />
4 = Bp -&gt; BBp,
<br />
B = p -&gt; BDp,
<br />
D = Bp -&gt; Dp,
<br />
5 = Dp -&gt; BDp,
<br />
C = Dp -&gt; ~ BDp,
<br />
L = B(Bp-&gt;p)-&gt;Bp,
<br />
Grz = B(B(p -&gt; Bp) -&gt; p) -&gt; p.
