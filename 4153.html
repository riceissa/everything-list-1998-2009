<br />
The following is a new effort to present my model in a more traditional 
<br />
way.
<br />
<br />The basic idea is that the concepts of &quot;nothing&quot; and &quot;everything&quot; [i.e. a 
<br />
maximum expression of &quot;something&quot;] are not totally antagonistic but are 
<br />
actually synergistic.
<br />
<br />DEFINITIONS:
<br />
<br />1) Information: The potential to parse [herein &quot;parse&quot; is used to mean to 
<br />
divide as with a boundary].
<br />
<br />2) Factual: A particular parsing. [like: {red, green, blue}]
<br />
<br />3) Counterfactual: A factual [factual B] that to some degree effects the 
<br />
parsing of another factual [factual A] {like: brown}.  Note that a factual 
<br />
that has a counterfactual is itself a counterfactual.
<br />
<br />4) Complete set of counterfactuals: A set of counterfactuals that leaves no 
<br />
member factual uneffected in any of its aspects. {like: gray}
<br />
<br /><br />AXIOMS:
<br />
<br />1) A void consisting of the absence of factuals herein called the &quot;Nothing&quot; 
<br />
exists.
<br />
<br />2) A collection of all complete sets of counterfactuals herein called the 
<br />
&quot;Everything&quot; exists.
<br />
<br />3) There are no other existences at or above the level of the Everything 
<br />
and the Nothing.
<br />
<br /><br />PROPOSITIONS:
<br />
<br />Proposition 1: The Everything and the Nothing are counterfactuals.
<br />
<br />Proof: The Everything is a parsing since it is a collection of a particular 
<br />
kind of factual.  The Nothing is a parsing since it excludes all factuals 
<br />
from itself.  These two parsings effect each other to some degree.  The 
<br />
existence of the Everything would tend to put a factual in the void and 
<br />
thereby suppress the concept of the Nothing and the existence of the 
<br />
Nothing would tend to suppress the necessity for the Everything - no 
<br />
factuals equals no parsing potential.  Thus Proposition 1 is true by 
<br />
Definitions 2 &amp; 3 and Axioms 1 &amp; 2.
<br />
<br />In addition to the suppression, The Everything and the Nothing also enhance 
<br />
each other to some degree as follows.
<br />
<br />Proposition 2: The Everything contains the Nothing.
<br />
<br />Proof: True by Proposition 1 and Axioms 1,  2, &amp; 3.   Axiom 3 makes the 
<br />
Everything/Nothing pair a complete set of counterfactuals.
<br />
<br />Proposition 3: The Everything contains itself:
<br />
<br />Proof: True by Proposition 1 and Axioms 2 and 3.
<br />
<br />Proposition 4: The Everything is infinitely nested with itself and the Nothing.
<br />
<br />Proof: True by Propositions 2 and 3.
<br />
<br />Interpretation: The Everything and the Nothing form a synergistic pair - 
<br />
their simultaneous existence is &quot;easier&quot; than either existence by itself.
<br />
<br />Proposition 5: The nesting has a dynamic.
<br />
<br />Proof: A fixed parsing between the Nothing and the Everything would 
<br />
constitute the presence of an uneffected factual within the Everything 
<br />
contradicting Axiom 2.
<br />
<br />Possible interpretation:
<br />
<br />Proposition 5 can be realized if the Nothing/Everything parsing &quot;surface&quot; 
<br />
is composed of a dynamic mix of the &quot;surfaces&quot; of the counterfactuals 
<br />
constituting the Everything.  The counterfactuals on this &quot;surface&quot; are - 
<br />
while so situated - slightly less effected than when they are remote from 
<br />
this &quot;surface&quot;.   It is the patterns formed by the shifting mix of 
<br />
&quot;surface&quot; counterfactuals that are interpreted as universes.
<br />
<br />To support this interpretation the following axioms are incorporated into 
<br />
the model.
<br />
<br />Axiom 4: The members of a complete set of counterfactuals must be 
<br />
intertwined as in a foamy fractal to sustain the effectiveness of the set.
<br />
<br />Axiom 5: Universes sustain themselves by finding a succeeding pattern on 
<br />
this &quot;surface&quot; that is consistent with their individual rules of state 
<br />
succession as their current pattern vanishes with the dynamic.
<br />
<br />Proposition 6: There is no restriction on the structure of the various 
<br />
individual universe state succession rules.
<br />
<br />Proof: Same form of proof as for Proposition 5.
<br />
<br />Interpretative consequent: Some of the rules would have a &quot;Do not care&quot; 
<br />
component in terms of the selection of a succeeding pattern.  This is the 
<br />
same as the rules of these universes allowing an external random oracle 
<br />
input or true noise into the state succession process for such universes.
<br />
<br />Proposition 7: All universes are subject to true noise.
<br />
<br />Proof: Same form of proof as for Proposition 5.
<br />
<br />Interpretation:  Even if their rules have no &quot;Do not care&quot; component such 
<br />
universes must nevertheless be subject to an external random oracle.
<br />
