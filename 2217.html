<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My first point is just a matter of setting probabilistic scales:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Even with her property of seeing herself as having birth rank 2,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Eve exists on many many branches of the universal wavefunction. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;These include, for example, lots of equiprobable branches in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;she sees stars in different constellations.  She also exists on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;atypical branches in which her nuclear physics is incorrect because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whenever she has placed Uranium near a Geiger counter it has failed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to decay and even on branches in which there are particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;circumstances in which she has seen heat regularly flow from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hotter to colder without energy input.  We only deduce that such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;branches are atypical from our assumption that our branch is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;typical.  Eve too needs to assume (rightly or wrongly) that her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;branch is typical.  The chance of her seeing the laws of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thermodynamics disobeyed significantly (assuming our beliefs about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;them are correct) is much much smaller than the chance of her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seeing the constellations in the precise way that she does, but even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that is much much smaller than 2 in a trillion.
</em><br />
<br />I think I agree with all of that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My second point is that knowledge of atypical birth rank is not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simple branch-causing property.  Information relevant to birth rank
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is distributed all over Eve's possible histories, and in different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ways in different histories.  It is not possible to take birth rank as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a fact independent of any of the other properties which make Eve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;who she is.
</em><br />
<br />Take each Eve-observer-branch-moment, i.e. each point in time on each 
<br />
branch containing Eve, and define its birth rank as its position in the 
<br />
class of all such observer-branch-moments. As to what Eve should think, 
<br />
she then average over all observer-branch-moments which she, for all she 
<br />
knows, might currently be.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course, I do not dispute that Eve is correct to see her birth rank
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as interestingly atypical.  The question is whether that knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;should lead her to believe that she is incapable of becoming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pregnant, or, more plausibly, should lead her to believe in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;immanence of inevitable planetary catastrophe.  
</em><br />
<br />That would depend on the prior probabilities. If, prior to her taking 
<br />
the Self-Sampling Assumption into account, she thought it more probable 
<br />
that she would not get pregnant than that the planet would soon be 
<br />
destroyed, she should continue to believe that after accounting for SSA. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My first point says that Eve's birth rank is not even close to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being as improbable as lots of other (in general less interesting)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;specific facts which any observer knows about herself. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sure, but something improbable happening is by itself not a remarkable 
<br />
fact. Every specific sequence of outcomes of one thousand coin tosses is 
<br />
extremely improbable (2^-1000), but only a small subset (all heads; 
<br />
alternating heads and tails; etc.) are surprising. The key is instead to 
<br />
look at the conditional probabilities of the observed event given each 
<br />
of the rival hypotheses. The conditional probability of being among the 
<br />
first two observers is greater given that there are two observers than 
<br />
given that there are billions. (Assuming all these observers would 
<br />
belong to the same reference class - which I would question.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The second says that on a technical level, Eve cannot simply apply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bayes' theorem to prior probabilities of conception and subsequent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information about birth rank.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Firstly, the prior probabilities will be branch-dependent, being, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;example, smaller in branches in which Eve is amenoretic.  
</em><br />
<br />The prior Eve should use is simply the weighted average of all the 
<br />
branches she, for all she knows, might be on (assuming she is 100% 
<br />
convinved about MWI).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Secondly, only if there was a class of observers all of whom are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;like Eve except that they have different birth ranks would there be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an objective probability which Eve could use as a genuine measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the improbability of her birth rank.  But such classes are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;undefinable, even in my theory in which the set of all observers is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;well-defined and countable, because hints about her birth rank have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;been built into everything Eve has ever known about herself.
</em><br />
<br />That wouldn't make it undefinable, just small. But for reasons spelled 
<br />
out in my dissertation, I think observer-moments should be grouped in 
<br />
the same reference class even when they are subjectively 
<br />
distinguishable, and I'm aware of no reason to limit this only to 
<br />
observer-moments that are subjectively distinct only regarding their 
<br />
knowledge of their birth ranks but not in other ways.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;By analogy, there might be an objective probability for me to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;win the British national lottery next week, but I do not believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there is an objective probability for me being able to communicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a language with a vocabulary significantly influenced by more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than one prior language.  My knowledge of word pairs from different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sources; dog/canine, book/literature, meal/banquet is pretty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;well-worked into my mental life but, even with a perfect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;description of my early mental life, you couldn't say with any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;accuracy when it became clear that that was the sort of language I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was learning.
</em><br />
<br />You've lost me here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I wrote
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  One cannot separate birth rank from the other facts about Eve's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  mental life.  Birth rank is not the sort of fact that one could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  imagine Eve ever being asked to guess, as if she had no idea of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  answer.  As long as she has been aware, she has had lots of clues
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  that her birth rank was expectional, just as we have always had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  lots of implicit clues of our birth rank (e.g. the taste of 
</em><br />
powdered
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  baby milk).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bostrom replied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  I, for one, am quite uncertain about my birth rank. It looks like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  there  have been infinitely many observers before me, but what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  cardinality I do  not know. Even if the world were finite, I'd 
</em><br />
still
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  not know my rank,  since I don't know (even approximately) how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  many intelligent aliens have  existed before me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  In the case of Eve, it is very easy indeed to describe a situation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  where  she is utterly ignorant as to her rank - just imagine she is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  living on  an isolated island, and she doesn't know whether there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  are other islands  in the world and if so whether they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  inhabited.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;These look like fairly good arguments for saying that the Doomsday
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Argument, for example, is empty in your cosmology.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I've been stressing that for years. Even in the best (worst!) case, 
<br />
it has very limited empirical power in its original form.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Whatever her future, Eve currently has reason to believe that she
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has an interesting birth rank, based for example on the purity of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;air she breathes, the lack of archaeological remains around her, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what she has been told by her partner.  Whether she is correct or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not about her birth rank, she is certainly isolated.  Should she
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;deduce from that that most humans are as isolated, and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;therefore her island will never be crowded with lots of her 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;descendants?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that would rather be the conclusion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;We also seem to be somewhat isolated in as far as, if our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;species were to continue indefinitely, then we might expect most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;humans to live in societies in which the past appeared
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interminable; with origins at best mythic and most of history
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unknown. (Fictions by Gene Wolfe come to mind.)
</em><br />
<br />Basically, we should think a non-negligable fraction of all observers in 
<br />
our reference class observe the same kind of things that we observe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do suspect that it is possible that our species will continue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indefinitely.  Nevertheless, I don't think that this makes us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinitely improbable, because, in my theory, in which observers are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;defined entirely by their mental lives, there can only be finitely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;many possible observers of complexity less than any given bound.  In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;particular, I do not suppose that observers can always be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distinguished by spatial-temporal position.  (I suspect that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hypothesis may well be needed if we are ever to understand what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quantization of general relativity might mean.)
</em><br />
<br />I have some as yet unarticulated ruminations that seem to resemble what 
<br />
you are saying here, perhaps.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am also not sure whether observers with long species histories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are not a priori less likely than observers with short species
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;histories on the grounds that longer species-histories means more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible different histories with each of these possibilities made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;less likely precisely by its greater detail.  (Information always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;costs probability in many-minds theory.)
</em><br />
<br />Well, you know what you are; no matter how improbable, you just have to 
<br />
take that for granted. The question is what else is true about the 
<br />
world.
