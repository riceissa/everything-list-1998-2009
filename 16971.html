<br />So what are your thoughts on my question as to whether abstract
<br />
concepts other than numbers also exist in a platonic sense?  For
<br />
example, the idea of &quot;red&quot;?
<br />
<br />So obviously we can cast everything as numbers and say, &quot;In this
<br />
program, 0xff000000 represents red&quot;.  But RED is what we're really
<br />
talking about here, and 0xff000000 is just a place holder...a symbol
<br />
for what actually exists.
<br />
<br />In your view, Bruno (or David, or anyone else who has an opinion),
<br />
what kinds of things actually &quot;exist&quot;?  What does it mean to say that
<br />
something &quot;exists&quot;?
<br />
<br />It seems to me that maybe consciousness is actually very simple.  It
<br />
is just a group of platonic ideals, like red, that are related to each
<br />
other by a point of view:  &quot;I like red&quot;, or &quot;I see a red sphere.&quot;
<br />
<br />Maybe what is complicated is constructing or identifying a causal
<br />
structure (e.g., a machine, a brain, a program, etc) whose evolving
<br />
state can be interpreted as representing a series of &quot;connected&quot; or
<br />
&quot;related&quot; instances of consciousness.  But the machine (physical or
<br />
otherwise) is NOT that consciousness, the machine just represents that
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
<br />In this view, consciousness itself consists directly of the abstract
<br />
platonic ideals that form the contents of a given moment of
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It remains to explain the relative stability of that illusion. How and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why some dreams glue, in a way sufficiently precise for making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predictions about them.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe unstable illusions exist, but, being unstable, don't ponder such
<br />
questions?
<br />
<br />Obviously we have such conscious beings here in this world, with
<br />
schizophrenics and the like.
<br />
<br />So your questions about &quot;why are my perceptions so orderly&quot;, would NOT
<br />
be universally valid questions, because there are conscious entities
<br />
whose perceptions are NOT orderly.
<br />
<br />And I would say that even my perceptions are not consistently orderly,
<br />
as when I dream I often experience strange scenarios.
<br />
<br />To say that dreaming and hallucinating are special cases I think is to
<br />
make an unfounded assumption.  It would seem to me that orderly
<br />
perceptions are the special case, and dream-logic realities would be
<br />
the norm.
<br />
<br />If consciousness is in some way a result of computation, then a
<br />
program that generates all possible mind-simulations will surely
<br />
result in the vast majority of resulting minds experiencing
<br />
dream-logic realities, not &quot;law-and-order&quot; realities like ours.
<br />
<br />I think Sean Carroll (who I'm reasonably sure would disagree with
<br />
everything I've proposed above, but still) had a pretty good point on
<br />
such &quot;counter-intuitive&quot; predictions:
<br />
<br />&quot;The same logic applies, for example, to the highly contentious case
<br />
of the multiverse. The multiverse isn’t, by itself, a theory; it’s a
<br />
prediction of a certain class of theories. If the idea were simply
<br />
“Hey, we don’t know what happens outside our observable universe, so
<br />
maybe all sorts of crazy things happen,” it would be laughably
<br />
uninteresting. By scientific standards, it would fall woefully short.
<br />
But the point is that various theoretical attempts to explain
<br />
phenomena that we directly observe right in front of us — like
<br />
gravity, and quantum field theory — lead us to predict that our
<br />
universe should be one of many, and subsequently suggest that we take
<br />
that situation seriously when we talk about the “naturalness” of
<br />
various features of our local environment. The point, at the moment,
<br />
is not whether there really is or is not a multiverse; it’s that the
<br />
way we think about it and reach conclusions about its plausibility is
<br />
through exactly the same kind of scientific reasoning we’ve been using
<br />
for a long time now. Science doesn’t pass judgment on phenomena; it
<br />
passes judgment on theories.&quot;
<br />
<br />So, I could continue further and go into a lengthy defense of why I
<br />
think this supports what I'm saying, BUT maybe you'll come to the same
<br />
conclusion I have and I can save myself a lot of typing!  So, I'll
<br />
just try that approach first.
