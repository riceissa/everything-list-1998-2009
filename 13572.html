<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Brent,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you had the most extravagent MRI machine in history, which trapped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complete maps of all electrons, neuclei and any photons and then plotted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them out - you would have a 100% complete, scientifically acquired
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; publishable description and in that description would be absolutely no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prediction of or explanation of why it is necessarily 'like it is' to 'be'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the brain thus described, what that experience will be like. 
</em><br />
<br />I think that is mere prejudice on your part.  It may be true, but I see no reason to assume it in advance.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It would not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enable you to make any cogent claim as to why it is or is not 'like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something' to be a computer except insofar as it doesn't have neurons. Why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am I saying this....Please read David Chalmers. This is not new.
</em><br />
<br />I have.  Please read Daniel Dennett's answer to Chalmers.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Science does not and never has EXPLAINED anything. It merely describes.
</em><br />
<br />So what is your idea of explanation?  Is it not a description of cause or purpose?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Read the literature. For the first time ever, to deal with qualia, science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has to actually EXPLAIN something. It is at the boundary condition where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you have to explain how you can observe anything at all.
</em><br />
<br />If I can explain how a cat or a robot observes something, does that count?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As to your EM theory beliefs... please read the literature. Jackson
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Classical electrodynamics&quot; is a brilliant place to start. 
</em><br />
<br />Yes, it was my textbook in graduate school.  I don't think Jackson would endorse your theory that is nothing but EM fields.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;For nobody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; around here in electrical engineering agrees with you... and I have just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been grilled on that very issue by a whole pile of very senior academics -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who agree with me. Even my anatomy/neuroscience supervisor, who are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generally pathologically afraid of physics....tells me there's nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there but space and charge....
</em><br />
<br />Have they not heard of quarks and electrons and gluons? It's really hard to make atoms without them.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you want to draw a line around a specific zone of ignorance and inhabit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it...go ahead. If you want to believe that correlation is causation go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ahead. &quot;This is what we do&quot;  is what you say when you are a member of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; club, not a seeker of truth. You have self referentially defined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth....and you are welcome to it. ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Meanwhile I'll just poke around in other areas. I hope you won't mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please consider your exasperation quota reached. Job done.
</em><br />
<br />I hope you haven't given up on explaining observation.
<br />
<br />Brent Meeker
