<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Imagine a Life universe that contains, among other things, two SASes

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talking to each other (and showing each other pictures, and in general 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having a very lucid, conscious, conversation.)  Imagine that instead of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being implemented on a computer, it's implemented by a large 2d array 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of coins:  heads represents &quot;live&quot;, and tails represents &quot;dead&quot;.  Each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; timestep, the coins are flipped over in concordance with the Life 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does this setup implement a universe?
</em><br />
<br />Let's say it does.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   If you say it does, how about the next step:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Instead of doing flipping operations on one set of coins, each new 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generation is laid down in the proper configuration on top of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preceding one with a new set of coins.  Does this &gt;process&lt; of laying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down coins also implement a universe?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, it would seem that laying down coins isn't conceptually different
<br />
from flipping them, from the point of view of performing a calculation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you say it does, then what about the stack itself?  (One can imagine 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pointing to each layer in succession, saying &quot;This is the current 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step&quot;, &quot;Now this is the current step&quot;, etc..) Does the stack's bare 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence suffice for the implementation of a universe?
</em><br />
<br />The problem with this example is that you can't create the stacks without
<br />
laying them down first.  So there has definitely been an implementation
<br />
during the lay-down phase.  What you have to be asking is, in some sense,
<br />
is the implementation still going on?
<br />
<br />This assumes a certain time-bound nature to the concept of implementation
<br />
which may not be valid.  You are assuming that the region of our universe
<br />
where the implementation occurs can be bounded in time, and asking if
<br />
the boundary only encloses the active lay-down phase, or also encloses
<br />
the passive stack phase.
<br />
<br />You get the same problems if you try to describe the exact physical
<br />
boundaries of the implementation in space.  Does the implementation
<br />
encompass the spaces between the coins, for example?  Assuming you also
<br />
need some small calculator to compute how to flip each coin (a simple
<br />
lookup table for the 512 possibilities of 9 coins in a square), is that
<br />
part of the implementation?  What about the space between the coins and
<br />
the calculator?  Or perhaps the coins themselves don't have well-defined
<br />
boundaries, etc.
<br />
<br />These questions suggest that it is difficult to consider &quot;whether
<br />
a particular implementation is going on&quot; to be a yes-or-no question
<br />
that can be asked at each point-event in space-time.  So it may not be
<br />
meaningful to ask whether the stack is also an implementation.
<br />
<br />Having said that, I'll give two contradictory answers:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If not, then can you say what it is about the active process of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flipping or laying down that &quot;counts&quot; as computation but does not count 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when the stack is a static block?
</em><br />
<br />In the philosophical literature on implementation (a good jumping-off
<br />
point is David Chalmers paper at
<br />
<a href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/rock.html">http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/rock.html</a>) it is considered that
<br />
a mere &quot;trace&quot; of a program execution does not count as an implementation,
<br />
for two reasons: first, there are no causal connections between the
<br />
layers, they're just sitting there; and second, the trace does not
<br />
represent counterfactuals, i.e. if you were to change a cell's value,
<br />
what would happen is not clear from the trace.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you think the static block &quot;counts&quot; as the implementation of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, then I think you can go all the way to abstract Platonism.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because since the stack's just sitting there, why not knock it down?  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or melt it into a big ball?  Or throw it into a black hole...the two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SASes won't care (will they?)
</em><br />
<br />On the other hand, if I apply what I have been calling the Wei Dai
<br />
heuristic (about which I wrote a few messages in the past few days; BTW
<br />
Wei suggested the idea but it's not necessarily something he advocates),
<br />
I'd say that the presence of the stack does increase the measure of
<br />
the simulated universe, because it increases the percentage of our
<br />
universe's resources which are used by the simulation.  More precisely,
<br />
its presence would allow a shorter program to locate the implementation
<br />
among all the vastness of our universe.
<br />
<br />However, in that case, knocking down or destroying the stack would
<br />
eliminate this property; the stack would no longer contain the
<br />
information which would allow shortening the program which would localize
<br />
the implementation.
