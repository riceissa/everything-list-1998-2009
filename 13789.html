<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do think that we have no evidence at all for it. Still, my way of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deriving physics works also for that (ridiculous) hypothesis, so

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;supergodness&quot; like &quot;comp&quot; are refutable by deriving the physics and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compare with observation. Of course if comp really implies an inflation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of white rabbit provably bigger than the &quot;observed quantum one&quot;, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be a case that we are supergods, perhaps.
</em><br />
<br />How will I ever know?  I suppose I'm asking: what specifically are the
<br />
critical tests?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  IOW, if computation is to be the basis for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'reality', it must be 'computations all the way down'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not if you are realistic on numbers with + and *. You can stop there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course you can take combinators or n-categories or whatever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal system you like. Ontically they are all equivalent. And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemologically, well there are many differences, but those should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerge from any ontic reality (like the N,+,*) from inside.
</em><br />
<br />OK, I wasn't precise enough!  Well then: &quot;computations all the way
<br />
down, with the number realm at the bottom&quot;.  It's interesting that if
<br />
we concede ontic realism to the number realm in this way, then
<br />
everything else becomes epistemology.  This is metaphysically rather
<br />
economical, ISTM, in a way that is apparently increasingly attractive
<br />
to physicists (i.e. the numbers, if not necessarily the
<br />
computationalism).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course I know that if you are isolated, the &quot;ah ah&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can take time. perhaps in august we can come back at least on the proof
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of incompleteness based directly on Church thesis?
</em><br />
<br />By all means.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the real difficulty now consists in understanding that we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provide rules for transforming those strings in a truth preserving way,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without any understanding of those strings. This is the difficulty of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic: to understand where you have to not try to understand strings.
</em><br />
<br />In my former work as a technical director in commercial computing I
<br />
often struggled to convince business colleagues that confidence in the
<br />
(transformational) equivalence of a new compiler to the one it was
<br />
replacing was more fundamental (and much more reliable) than
<br />
attempting an explicit re-confirmation of the logic of the entire
<br />
suite of compiled applications (i.e. the 'strings').
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps you could search and peruse the archive with key words like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;godel number&quot;, for example quickly:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/browse_frm/thread/">http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/browse_frm/thread/</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; f5c02229299f1a02/e135df20765c927d?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lnk=gst&amp;q=godel+number&amp;rnum=8&amp;hl=en#e135df20765c927d
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or buy the book by Mendelson or the last (fourth) edition of Boolos and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jeffrey (and Burguess now).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before buying those books (or searching them in a library) try to know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you are willing to do the effort to understand the real technic. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not, try to force me to explain in english the main idea.
</em><br />
<br />Thanks for the pointers.  As to the 'effort', I can't yet know whether
<br />
the variability of my lamentably dilettantish energy in the
<br />
logico-mathematical sphere will be adequate to the attempt, but
<br />
nonetheless I'm willing to commence to find out.  Either way, could I
<br />
implore, cajole, wheedle, or simply ask (but never force) you to
<br />
explain the main thrust in English with as few preconceptions as
<br />
possible?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a sense, it is not funny to be a lobian machine. That consists in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being a universal machine with all the cognitive abilities necessary to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worry about the length of its &quot;tape&quot;, and the poorness of what she can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicate through it, compared to what she can observe, feel, resent,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc.
</em><br />
<br />Would you say that what can be directly communicated through the
<br />
'tape' is essentially what we may characterise as 'physics',
<br />
understood as the third person (or first person plural) narrative per
<br />
se?  But then by using the contents of the tape to *refer* back to the
<br />
first person we obtain the *ostensive* possibility of sharing (with
<br />
others, but also actually with 'ourselves') our observations,
<br />
feelings, resentments - i.e. the first-personal world: &quot;Look!  *This*
<br />
is what I see, feel, hear.&quot;  This seems to be perhaps the fundamental
<br />
distinction between ontology and epistemology: the ontic 'origin'
<br />
self-manifests fleetingly within the first-person, and although this
<br />
is not *communicable* - even to the 'self' - communication can *refer*
<br />
to it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then Art will develop among such machine too, as a way to pint on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the uncommunicable we are all living.
</em><br />
<br />Just so.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes two different persons discussing in the list seems to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; different ideas where I can see that they are both correct, but just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn't not look at things from the same angle or perspective. All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; is obviously related with the very intrinsical difficulty of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; subject itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Difficult indeed.  It would be very helpful if we could all find a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; shared method to make the perspectives commensurable.  I suspect for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you this would be comp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, or just the numbers (with their additive and multiplication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures). The mimit discourse (John would say &quot;narrative&quot;) can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; studied mathematically (thanks to Goel, Lob, Solovay, ...). &quot;comp&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; points obviously to computer science (and mathematical logic)..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Have you understand that the UDA literally gives no choice about what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; has to be taken as primitive element for any TOE once we assume the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; comp hyp?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think so, although my personal expressions of the intuition have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; been different.  For example I was thinking recently of arguments of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the sort that seek to refute computationalism as a theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness by contrasting, say, a (however 'complete')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computational model of digestion with a 'real' stomach digesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'real' food.  No one could mistake one for the other, runs the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; argument.  This seems true.  But it occurred to me that it wouldn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; necessarily be a mistake if 'real' stomachs and 'real' food were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'computational' too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course. Imagine that the comp substitution level is so low that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opnly way to &quot;restore&quot; your consciousness artificially consts in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplicating at the level of elementary fermions and bosons the entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum state of the milky way. You can easily see (I think, just tell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me if not) that the simulation of you in that galaxy simulation will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call &quot;real stomach&quot; what we, from outside know to be parts of a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; detailled computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  IOW, if computation is to be the basis for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'reality', it must be 'computations all the way down'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not if you are realistic on numbers with + and *. You can stop there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course you can take combinators or n-categories or whatever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal system you like. Ontically they are all equivalent. And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemologically, well there are many differences, but those should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerge from any ontic reality (like the N,+,*) from inside.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ISTM that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; UDA demonstrates rigorously the consequences of assuming otherwise,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and hence is a reductio of 'materialistic computationalism'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is true for the last (8 steps version) of the UDA. To be sure, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my theses I separate the UDA and the movie graph. UDA(+Movie-graph)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shows the absurdity in believing in both primitive matter and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalism indeed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Concerning the math, do you know the book by Torkel Franzen on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; uses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; and misuses of Godel theorems? Despite some big mistake I will talk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; about, it is a quite excellent book which I would recommend the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; reading.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't know it, and having perused the Davis book, I suspect it may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be beyond me without a lot of steering in the right direction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You have to have the &quot;ah ah&quot; tilt. You have to understand that those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter are simpler than what your prejudice (about yourself probably)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes you think. Somehow, Godel original papers is the simpler and best
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presentation of his results.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now the Franzen book can certainly give a big help. A good treatise is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mendelson book. Of course I know that if you are isolated, the &quot;ah ah&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can take time. perhaps in august we can come back at least on the proof
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of incompleteness based directly on Church thesis?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Do you have a (passive) knowledge of first order logic? Do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; see that (with x, y ... belonging to the natural numbers).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (x div y) &lt;-&gt; Ez(x * z = y)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; prime(x) &lt;-&gt; (~(x = 1) &amp; Ay((y div x) -&gt; (y = 1 V y = x)))
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I have a wiki-aided ('just-in-time') understanding, from which I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; appreciate the validity of these propositions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the real difficulty now consists in understanding that we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provide rules for transforming those strings in a truth preserving way,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without any understanding of those strings. This is the difficulty of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic: to understand where you have to not try to understand strings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Do you have an idea how Godel manages to define in a similar way the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; provability predicate in the arithmetical language (= first order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; logical language + the symbols =, 0, +, *, s).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It would really help to have the precise steps pointed out.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps you could search and peruse the archive with key words like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;godel number&quot;, for example quickly:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/browse_frm/thread/">http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/browse_frm/thread/</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; f5c02229299f1a02/e135df20765c927d?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lnk=gst&amp;q=godel+number&amp;rnum=8&amp;hl=en#e135df20765c927d
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or buy the book by Mendelson or the last (fourth) edition of Boolos and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jeffrey (and Burguess now).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before buying those books (or searching them in a library) try to know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you are willing to do the effort to understand the real technic. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not, try to force me to explain in english the main idea.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Perhaps you could think of making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; some short summary of your points. Your last posts, imo,  were a bit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; fuzzy by over-determination, I said even close to the 1004 fallacy ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'll try - it may not be until I return from Scotland where I will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all of next week.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have a good trip :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; What could go possibly wrong in your approach, with respect of comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (and/or the lobian interview) is that sometimes I understand that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; want that your most primitive element belongs to the first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; realm. My problem here is that this is consistent with the comp hyp,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; but this consistency is irrelevant as far as we are trying to make a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; communicable and refutable theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think that Plotinus' theology has been helpful for me here in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distinguishing the 'primitive' as the 'solipsism of the One' rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; than the 'first person'.  The point here is that there is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ineliminable identification of the individual self with the One, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the sense of a part being identified with, and deriving its primitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; characteristics from, the whole of which it is an aspect.  However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; although the One is (0) 'personal', it is not 'a person': only the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'parts' are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exactly. From the point of view of the unameable self (alias the third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypostasis, the first person, S4Grz, the third God, etc.) there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed no difference between the One and itself. But, us, who are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; studying in a third person way the theology of a simpler lobian machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (simpler than us), and who know, by hypothesis, we are taliking on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ciorrect (sound) Lobian machine, we can see the gigantic difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the one and the self. But, astonishingly the self does not see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that difference, cannot even describe it, and is 100% correct about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; This one has to have communicable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (or at lest axiomatizable) third person primitive element. The lobian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;soul&quot; (alias first person or third hypostase) disagrees somehow with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; this, but that lobian soul is not completely willing to make science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the start!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Since communicability and refutability must indeed occur exclusively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in terms of the third person, this places severe limits on what can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'relevant' in this sense.The disagreement, I think, comes from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'soul's' intuition that no amount of such third person discourse seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to yield an explanation of first person experience as such - only a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible justification of the belief in it.  Is it 'unscientific' to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be dissatisfied with this?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not at all. Because it is a first person statement. What would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unscientific, would be to conclude from that first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dissatisfaction that such lack of explanation refutes the comp hyp,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when precisely the comp hyp makes it possible to explain why each first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person associated to any (correct) machine has to live with that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; frustration. We cannot explain qualia, but we can explain why, in case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the comp hyp is true, qualia cannot be completely explained in a purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third person way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a sense, it is not funny to be a lobian machine. That consists in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being a universal machine with all the cognitive abilities necessary to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worry about the length of its &quot;tape&quot;, and the poorness of what she can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicate through it, compared to what she can observe, feel, resent,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then Art will develop among such machine too, as a way to pint on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the uncommunicable we are all living.
