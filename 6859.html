<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't see how this follows. I can't even imagine what it might mean to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;higher benefit&quot; from higher measure days. What I assumed Hal meant was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on even days his total measure was higher, so that double the usual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of versions of Hal were generated in other branches of the multiverse, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would go on to have separate and distinct lives. Aiming for more good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiences on even days would then be an altruistic thing for Hal to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; since it would result in greater happiness in the multiverse as a whole. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; instead, it was more like my example, where a copy of Hal's mind is run 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computer in lockstep with his biological mind on even days, and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; switched off on odd days, then what possible difference could it make to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or anyone else, given what we have just said about the definition of an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OM?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To clarify, I did indeed mean the equivalent of this latter case,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;where by some means on even numbered days I had more measure, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on odd numbered days my measure was then reduced to a lower amount.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This might be done as you say by running a computer in lockstep with my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mind on even days and shutting it off on odd days, if you accept that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;doing so will increase the measure of the even days.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My message is at <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m6592.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m6592.html</a> .
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The argument is fundamentally that creating a bunch of good experiences is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;better than creating a bunch of bad ones.  Shutting the computer down 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;matter.  That just means that the good experiences won't be remembered.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they were still real, they were still experienced.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;After all, many people believe our own lives are finite in extent and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that after we die we will have no more memories of our lives.  But they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(mostly) don't conclude from that that it is irrelevant whether people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suffer or experience pleasure.  Even finite lives deserve to be as happy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as possible.  This is true whether they last for one day or 100 years.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And worse, almost all of the moments of our lives are forgotten within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;days if not minutes.  Most moments make essentially no impact on our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;memories.  We can't remember what it felt like to brush our teeth on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;February 9.  Yet, even knowing this, we still try to make our lives as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pleasant and comfortable as we can.  Even though we would have known
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(had we thought about it) as we were brushing our teeth that day, that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would not remember that moment, that it would soon be forgotten as surely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as if we had never lived it, we would still try to make the experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as pleasant and non-painful as possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;All these examples are meant to show that we act as though we care about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;giving good experiences even though we know they will be forgotten and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not have lasting impact.  If we extend that principle more generally,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think it follows that we should try to have good experiences on days
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;when we have high measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hal Finney
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Note that there are two Hals on this list)
</em><br />
<br />My issue was not with the fact that the experiences will be forgotten, but 
<br />
with the fact that there is no conceivable way, from a first person 
<br />
perspective, to distinguish the high measure days from the low measure days. 
<br />
You could have a million people sharing one instantiation of an OM or one 
<br />
person experiencing a million instantiations of an OM: for *that OM* it is 
<br />
all the same.
