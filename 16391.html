<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Narrative conceptions of agency have attracted considerable 
<br />
philosophical interest in recent years, and both of these books make 
<br />
significant contributions to the growing literature on this theme. Each 
<br />
treats a wide range of related concepts, including not just narrative 
<br />
agency itself but also personal and practical identity, temporality and 
<br />
the self, practical reasoning, and autonomy.
<br />
<br />Kim Atkins' /Narrative Identity and Moral Identity/ is a book about the 
<br />
nature of human selfhood. Atkins uses the terms &quot;selfhood&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;identity&quot; interchangeably, and approaches her subject in part through a 
<br />
discussion of theories of personal identity. Her central interest, 
<br />
however, is in practical rather than metaphysical identity. A person, in 
<br />
the sense of interest to Atkins, is a practical unity of first-, 
<br />
second-, and third-personal perspectives (more on this below), and 
<br />
questions about personal identity, in her sense, are questions about the 
<br />
continuity of this practical unity over time.
<br />
<br />Atkins adopts Christine Korsgaard's conception of practical identity as 
<br />
&quot;a description under which you value yourself, a description under which 
<br />
you find your life to be worth living and your actions to be worth 
<br />
undertaking&quot; (1). Like Korsgaard, Atkins takes practical identities to 
<br />
give rise to reasons. As she puts it, &quot;who I think I am provides the 
<br />
reasons for what I do and how I think, including how I think about 
<br />
myself&quot; (66). Her central thesis, however, is that practical identities 
<br />
are /narrative/ identities: &quot;the description under which we value 
<br />
ourselves and our lives takes a narrative form&quot; (1). Here Atkins goes 
<br />
beyond Korsgaard in specifying that the kind of unity required for human 
<br />
agency is specifically narrative unity. On this picture, our reasons 
<br />
flow from the narratives we construct in response to the self-directed 
<br />
questions &quot;Who am I?&quot; and &quot;How should I live?&quot;.
<br />
<br />The book has seven chapters in addition to Atkins' introduction. The 
<br />
first chapter explores the roots of contemporary debates about personal 
<br />
identity in Locke, Hume, and Kant, and culminates in a discussion of 
<br />
Kant's distinction between transcendental and empirical apperception. 
<br />
Selfhood, for Kant, is bi-perspectival in the sense that it involves 
<br />
both awareness of the 'I' as a principle of the unity of consciousness 
<br />
and awareness of the 'I' as appearance. In the second chapter, Atkins 
<br />
draws on Marcel and Merleau-Ponty to argue that the bi-perspectival 
<br />
nature of human selfhood is explained by the fact of human embodiment. 
<br />
The human subject is both a body that sees and perceives and a body that 
<br />
is capable of /being/ seen and perceived, including, significantly, by 
<br />
itself. In Atkins' terminology, this is to say that human selfhood is a 
<br />
unity of (at least) two perspectives, namely, the first- and the 
<br />
third-personal. Further, these perspectives imply one another: if I were 
<br />
not an object /in/ the world, I would not be capable of having a 
<br />
first-personal perspective /on/ the world, and if I did not have a 
<br />
first-personal perspective /on/ the world, I would have no point of view 
<br />
from which to perceive myself, third-personally, as an object /in/ the 
<br />
world. In Chapter 03 Atkins argues that the first- and third-personal 
<br />
perspectives that are unified in human selfhood also imply a 
<br />
second-personal perspective. Developmentally speaking, human selfhood is 
<br />
a product of /shared/ embodiment: it is acquired through bodily and 
<br />
social engagement with others who care for us, teach us, and, 
<br />
ultimately, subject us to interpersonal standards of evaluation and 
<br />
justification. Being held to such standards presupposes second-personal 
<br />
competence to answer to specific others in relation to whom we 
<br />
articulate our identities.
<br />
<br />The upshot of the first three chapters is that an adequate account of 
<br />
personal identity (in Atkins' practical sense) will have to explain how 
<br />
these three perspectives are integrated in temporally extended, human 
<br />
selfhood. Chapter 04 is the core of the book, since it is here that 
<br />
Atkins defends the thesis that only a narrative conception of practical 
<br />
identity can successfully do this. Using Marya Schectman's account of 
<br />
narrative self-constitution as a springboard, Atkins argues that my 
<br />
continuing to be who I am cannot be fully explained by impersonal causal 
<br />
relations that hold between person-stages, but requires the continuity 
<br />
of a first-personal perspective from which I am able to own or attribute 
<br />
actions to myself &quot;from the inside&quot;. She agrees with Schectman that the 
<br />
continuity of the first-personal perspective must be understood in 
<br />
narrative terms, and argues, further, that only a narrative model can 
<br />
make sense of selfhood as a unity of /all three/ of the perspectives she 
<br />
distinguishes in earlier chapters.
<br />
<br />Atkins argues that continuity of selfhood depends on the activity of 
<br />
&quot;secondary reflection&quot; -- a form of reflection that responds to, and 
<br />
seeks to resolve, disturbances to my sense of self. Secondary reflection 
<br />
is a kind of inner dialogue in which I attempt to answer questions about 
<br />
who I am and what I should do by &quot;appropriat[ing] my third-personal 
<br />
attributes as my own from my first-personal perspective to myself in the 
<br />
second person&quot; (65). Atkins also refers to this as a process of 
<br />
&quot;self-constancy&quot;, through which I undertake to continue* *as the person 
<br />
I think I am. When one engages in this process, one looks both forward 
<br />
and backward, attempting to integrate one's past, present, and 
<br />
anticipated future into a coherent, chronologically ordered whole that 
<br />
is intelligible from one's own point of view. This is where narrative 
<br />
comes in: the accounts we give of ourselves, when we engage in secondary 
<br />
reflection, achieve such integration between past, present, and future 
<br />
insofar as they take a narrative form. Borrowing from Ricoeur, Atkins 
<br />
argues that the coherence of our experience depends on its being ordered 
<br />
in a rule-governed succession, and that narrative interpretation brings 
<br />
such an ordering to our experience by allowing us to experience events 
<br />
not just as falling into chronological sequences but as bearing causal 
<br />
relations to one another and as following trajectories from beginning, 
<br />
to middle, to end. This narrative view integrates all three perspectives 
<br />
involved in human selfhood in something like the following way: accounts 
<br />
of oneself are given /from/ a first-personal perspective, addressed /to/ 
<br />
an actual or implied other, and serve to link third-personally 
<br />
describable elements of a life (actors, objects, motives, circumstances, 
<br />
and so forth) into a &quot;temporally extended, causally related coherent 
<br />
whole, with a beginning, a middle, and an end&quot; (76).
<br />
<br />In Chapter 5, Atkins goes on to argue that narrative selfhood has an 
<br />
ethical aim: &quot;the aim of living a good life with and for others in just 
<br />
institutions&quot; (80). Here Atkins argues that continuity in identity is 
<br />
/agential/ continuity, that agents are &quot;subjects of imputation&quot; (that 
<br />
is, they can be held to account for their actions), and that in this 
<br />
sense agents &quot;always already&quot; operate within a moral community. 
<br />
Practical identity is articulated within a moral sphere -- or, more 
<br />
accurately, within a plurality of moral spheres. (Atkins regards family, 
<br />
ethnicity, religion, and so forth as demarcating distinct moral 
<br />
spheres.) Against the backdrop of these multiple spheres of 
<br />
interpretation, moral identity is rendered coherent by the overall 
<br />
narrative unity of a life. Substantively speaking, good lives may differ 
<br />
widely from one another depending on cultural and other affiliations. 
<br />
But formally speaking, a good life just is a narratively unified, 
<br />
well-integrated one. The achievement of such unity requires protection 
<br />
from various sources of fragmentation and violation, which in turn 
<br />
requires both solicitude (&quot;spontaneous receptivity and responsiveness to 
<br />
each other&quot; (93)) and a framework of just institutions.
<br />
<br />In Chapter 6, Atkins considers how we handle situations of tragic 
<br />
conflict and other threats to our agential unity or integrity, and 
<br />
argues that Jan Bransen's account of how we choose &quot;alternatives&quot; of 
<br />
ourselves aptly captures the kind of practical wisdom we need to 
<br />
exercise in such situations. Finally, in Chapter 07 Atkins places her 
<br />
account of narrative agency within the literature on relational 
<br />
autonomy, drawing in particular on Diana Meyers' view that autonomy 
<br />
consists in &quot;a set of socially acquired practical competencies in 
<br />
self-discovery, self-definition, and self-direction&quot; (125). Atkins 
<br />
argues that the practical competencies or skills we need for autonomous 
<br />
or self-governed agency are, precisely, narrative competencies -- the 
<br />
very skills we exercise in giving narratively structured self-accounts 
<br />
that unify our agency over time.
<br />
<br />Atkins' book is ambitious and wide-ranging, and contains much of 
<br />
interest not only to narrative theorists but also to anyone interested 
<br />
in theories of agency and moral psychology more generally. I cannot 
<br />
possibly do justice to all of her arguments here. But I would like to 
<br />
press a line of questioning about her central thesis: Why must our 
<br />
practical identities be narrative identities? Otherwise put, why must 
<br />
the answers we give to questions asked in secondary reflection be 
<br />
narrative in form, if they are to secure the continuity of our agency 
<br />
over time?
<br />
<br />In a pivotal passage in Chapter 4, Atkins gives roughly the following 
<br />
argument for her thesis:
<br />
<br />1. Selfhood is a unity of first-, second-, and third-personal 
<br />
perspectives on one's attributes.
<br />
<br />2. These three perspectives mutually imply and explain one another.
<br />
<br />3. Attributes that make up the agent's identity must cohere with this 
<br />
multi-perspectival structure.
<br />
<br />4. So, the attributes that make up the agent's identity must also 
<br />
mutually imply and explain one another.
<br />
<br />5. Only narrative accounts can capture these relations of mutual 
<br />
implication and explanation.
<br />
<br />Premises 01 and 2 are defended in Chapters 2 and 3, as outlined above. 
<br />
Premise 3 does not seem problematic. But how exactly does 4 follow?
<br />
<br />Let's consider what it would be for an attribute (say, my being a 
<br />
devoted parent) to cohere with the multi-perspectival structure of 
<br />
selfhood that Atkins lays out. As I understand the view, the attribute 
<br />
would have to be capable of figuring in an account that I could give in 
<br />
response to questions about who I am and what I should do, as these 
<br />
arise in the process of secondary reflection. This account would have to 
<br />
be intelligible both from my own point of view, as I look forward and 
<br />
back, and to the (implied or actual) audience I address. Finally, it 
<br />
would have to be consistent with basic facts accessible from a 
<br />
third-personal perspective. My self-accounts are thus constrained in 
<br />
various ways -- by my own history and aspirations, my embodied nature, 
<br />
my social context and relations, and by what Atkins calls, simply, reality.
<br />
<br />It is not clear why the attributes internal to my temporally extended 
<br />
practical identity would themselves have to stand in relations of mutual 
<br />
explanation and implication in order to meet these various constraints. 
<br />
Consider Atkins' example of Susan, a woman who is fixated on the 
<br />
(mistaken) idea that she has royal ancestry. Atkins points out that this 
<br />
purported attribute is not implied or explained by any of Susan's other 
<br />
attributes. But Susan's self-account also fails to meet the constraints 
<br />
imposed by the tri-perspectival structure of selfhood in more 
<br />
straightforward ways. For example, it manifestly fails the reality test 
<br />
(as Atkins herself points out), and it just as clearly cannot satisfy 
<br />
interpersonal standards of justification.
<br />
<br />It is plausible that, even apart from such social and factual 
<br />
requirements, /consistency/ with one's other attributes is necessary in 
<br />
order for an agent to successfully appropriate an attribute as her own. 
<br />
But a set of attributes might be internally consistent without its 
<br />
members actually standing in relations of mutual implication or 
<br />
explanation with one another. My being a devoted parent is neither 
<br />
explained nor implied by my being a professional philosopher, nor is the 
<br />
latter explained or implied by the former. Yet these aspects of my 
<br />
practical identity are (I hope) at least consistent with one another, 
<br />
and may form part of an identity that is intelligible overall. 
<br />
Certainly, in some circumstances practical conflicts will arise between 
<br />
the demands imposed on me by these two aspects of my identity, and in 
<br />
such cases I will have tough decisions to make. But these are conflicts 
<br />
that arise for me /as/ a unified agent confronted with reasons to act in 
<br />
different ways -- not the kind of conflict that undermines the unity of 
<br />
my agency in the first place. Being a parent and being a philosopher may 
<br />
both be sources of genuine reasons for me, even if they do not explain 
<br />
or imply one another.
<br />
<br />Of course, Atkins need not claim that each of my attributes must stand 
<br />
in relations of mutual explanation or implication with every other. Her 
<br />
view seems rather to be that each attribute that is internal to my 
<br />
identity must be explained or implied by /some/ other attribute of mine. 
<br />
But it is not clear why even this must be so, given that (as I 
<br />
understand it) it does not seem to be demanded by the tri-perspectival 
<br />
structure of selfhood itself.
<br />
<br />Even setting aside such questions about 4, certain questions remain 
<br />
about 5. Atkins sees narrative as uniquely suited to integrate one's 
<br />
attributes into a unified identity because of the way (on the model of 
<br />
narrative she favors) it articulates causal links between aspects of the 
<br />
agent's experience and organizes them teleologically. But even if 
<br />
self-accounts that take a narrative form are in fact capable of 
<br />
constituting or preserving agential unity, it is not yet clear that 
<br />
/only /narrative accounts can do this. Consider a young, recently 
<br />
married man who is out late with friends and hasn't thought to call his 
<br />
wife to let her know where he is. One of his friends asks him why he 
<br />
hasn't called her -- &quot;You're married now,&quot; he says. &quot;You have to call!&quot; 
<br />
Our young man may well be brought up short by this disruption to his 
<br />
sense of self, and (pausing to engage in secondary reflection) realize 
<br />
that he does indeed have reason to act differently. But in this kind of 
<br />
case, his self-account might simply cite, and re-affirm, his identity as 
<br />
husband: &quot;That's right, I'm married. And calling in this kind of 
<br />
situation /is/ part of what being married requires of me.&quot; This snippet 
<br />
of secondary reflection is not narrative in form (he does not, for 
<br />
example, refer to the history of his relationship with his wife, nor 
<br />
does he connect the requirement to call to a projected future of marital 
<br />
harmony), but it does seem to meet the intelligibility-constraints 
<br />
imposed by the tri-perspectival structure of the self: the account he 
<br />
offers makes sense to himself, his audience, and from an impersonal 
<br />
point of view. So why should it be ruled out?
<br />
<br />The diachronic nature of human agency has attracted considerable 
<br />
philosophical attention of late, and has inspired several alternative 
<br />
models of agential unity. To mention a few examples, Michael Bratman's 
<br />
planning theory of agency, Agnieszka Jaworska's care-based conception of 
<br />
minimal autonomy, and John Christman's historical account of autonomy 
<br />
all attempt to do justice to the temporal extension of agency without 
<br />
invoking narrative -- or, at least, without invoking it in any very 
<br />
substantial way. (As I note below, Christman does invoke narrative in 
<br />
his historical account, but only in a much thinner sense.) The challenge 
<br />
for Atkins is to show not only that narrative /can/ make sense of 
<br />
ourselves and our lives, but that without it we /cannot/ achieve the 
<br />
agential unity required to lead coherent or good lives. While I would 
<br />
not go so far as to claim that Atkins is wrong about the role of 
<br />
narrative in self-constitution, I do think that a substantial burden of 
<br />
proof remains on her shoulders.
<br />
<br />Atkins and Mackenzie's edited volume, /Practical Identity and Narrative 
<br />
Agency/, is organized around many of the same themes that are central to 
<br />
Atkins' own book. Its papers treat topics including the relationship 
<br />
between metaphysical and practical identity, the relationship between 
<br />
practical reasoning and practical identity, the reflective capacities 
<br />
required for practical reasoning and autonomy, and, of course, the role 
<br />
of narrative in all of the above. For the most part I will limit myself 
<br />
to brief summaries of the main claims defended in each paper, and will 
<br />
reserve my more extended remarks for those that most centrally involve 
<br />
the concept of narrative.
<br />
<br />The first part of the book is devoted to three papers on personal 
<br />
identity and continuity. Marya Schectman's paper &quot;Staying Alive: 
<br />
Personal Continuation and a Life Worth Having&quot; probes the relationship 
<br />
between personal identity and practical concerns. In response to Eric 
<br />
Olson, Schectman develops a non-animalist account of the kind of 
<br />
personal unity that underlies the very possibility of raising questions 
<br />
about a person's autonomy and responsibility for past actions. Her 
<br />
account of this underlying unity is neither purely biological nor purely 
<br />
psychological but, rather, based on her notion of a &quot;person-life&quot; -- a 
<br />
cluster concept that incorporates a range of biological, psychological, 
<br />
and higher order reflective capacities that typically make up a person's 
<br />
life. Caroline West's paper &quot;Personal Identity: Practical or 
<br />
Metaphysical?&quot; is also a critical response to Olson's animalism. West 
<br />
argues that the metaphysical facts of personal identity cannot be 
<br />
severed from practical questions about (for example) the conditions of 
<br />
obligation, entitlement, responsibility and regret. She argues that 
<br />
&quot;person&quot; is a social kind, with persistence conditions that are partly 
<br />
determined by individual and community practices. Kim Atkins' 
<br />
contribution, &quot;Narrative Identity and Embodied Continuity,&quot; is of a 
<br />
piece with the more extended arguments in her book. Here she argues that 
<br />
the complex structure of first-, second-, and third-personal 
<br />
perspectives that constitutes a unified self cuts across the 
<br />
psychological/bodily divide, and that continuity of one's embodied 
<br />
identity is a matter of continuity in one's self-narrated life story.
<br />
<br />The papers in the second part of the book all focus in one way or 
<br />
another on the deliberative, reflective, and imaginative capacities 
<br />
involved in constituting the identities of temporally extended agents. 
<br />
In &quot;Personal Identity Management,&quot; Jan Bransen is concerned with 
<br />
deliberative situations in which I am faced not with the question &quot;What 
<br />
should I do?&quot; but &quot;Who should I be?&quot; and, more particularly, with the 
<br />
question &quot;How can I determine the best alternative of myself?&quot;. Bransen 
<br />
argues that to determine the best way of continuing &quot;as the person one 
<br />
is&quot; (102), one must try to develop and empathically access a range of 
<br />
different motivational profiles and, in a sort of imaginative &quot;dry run&quot;, 
<br />
assess which will result in the optimal balance of agent satisfaction 
<br />
over agent regret -- or, otherwise put, which will give one peace of 
<br />
mind. Catriona Mackenzie's paper, &quot;Imagination, Identity, and 
<br />
Self-Transformation,&quot; also concerns the role of imaginative projection 
<br />
in self-transformative decisions. Drawing on Bransen's view that 
<br />
conflicts /within/ the self require us to select among possible 
<br />
alternatives /of/ oneself, Mackenzie argues that agents resolve such 
<br />
conflicts by generating a series of different self-narratives and 
<br />
attempting to determine which makes the most sense. But such narratives 
<br />
help rather than mislead the deliberating agent only when they can stand 
<br />
up to assessment from an external perspective that is constrained by the 
<br />
agent's embodied subjectivity, autobiographical memory, cultural context 
<br />
and social interactions, and practical identity. In his paper &quot;Why 
<br />
Search for Lost Time? Memory, Autonomy, and Practical Reason,&quot; John 
<br />
Christman shifts the focus from imaginative projection to 
<br />
autobiographical memory. Drawing on cases of anterograde amnesia, 
<br />
Christman argues that autobiographical memory appears to be necessary to 
<br />
the construction of a temporally extended self-concept. Without 
<br />
autobiographical memory one cannot interpret past events and actions as 
<br />
forming part of a coherent self-narrative, and cannot identify prior 
<br />
plans or normative commitments as /one's own/ in the affective and 
<br />
experiential sense required for non-alienated, autonomous 
<br />
decision-making and action.
<br />
<br />Part three of the book collects four papers under the heading &quot;Selfhood 
<br />
and Normative Agency&quot;. In &quot;The Way of the Wanton,&quot; J. David Velleman 
<br />
offers an alternative reading of Harry Frankfurt's analysis of 
<br />
identification, on which the phenomenology of agency, rather than the 
<br />
problem of agential authority, takes center stage. On Velleman's 
<br />
interpretation, reflective consciousness itself has the effect of 
<br />
distancing us from our motives, and the role of second-order volitions 
<br />
is to bridge this reflective gap and put us back in touch with the 
<br />
mechanisms that guide our behavior. Velleman suggests, further, that we 
<br />
can eliminate the gap entirely (rather than merely bridging it) by 
<br />
losing ourselves in skilled activities. This sort of &quot;higher 
<br />
wantonness&quot;, as Velleman calls it, is similar both to the sort of 
<br />
spontaneous activity recommended in the Daoist /Zhuangzi/ and to the 
<br />
&quot;flow&quot; experiences described by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. In 
<br />
her paper &quot;Losing One's Self,&quot; Cheshire Calhoun explores other 
<br />
experiences that might be described as involving a loss of self, but in 
<br />
a very different sense. Calhoun considers cases of depression, 
<br />
demoralization, and other volitionally disabling conditions under which 
<br />
persons might be &quot;unmoved by their own reasons for action or have ceased 
<br />
to be able to see any point in deliberating about what to do&quot; (193). She 
<br />
argues that our having motivating reasons for action depends on certain 
<br />
background &quot;frames of agency&quot; being in place, including a lack of 
<br />
estrangement from one's normative perspective, a belief in the 
<br />
effectiveness of instrumental reasoning, and confidence in one's 
<br />
security against tragic misfortune or indecent harm. In their paper 
<br />
&quot;Normative Agency,&quot; Jeanette Kennett and Steve Matthews argue that 
<br />
agents unify themselves over time by adopting normative reasons for 
<br />
action, and that narratives that constitute or approximate the best 
<br />
continuation of an agent's life story are an important source of such 
<br />
reasons. Moreover, they argue, moral competence is inseparable from the 
<br />
more general normative competence required for temporally extended 
<br />
agency. They argue that these theses are confirmed by cases of 
<br />
Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and psychopathy, whose sufferers 
<br />
display disunified agency (and, in the latter case, severe moral 
<br />
deficits) along with broad failures of practical reason and normative 
<br />
understanding. Individuals with such deficits are unable to secure the 
<br />
special goods that are available to narratively unified agents, 
<br />
including, centrally, the good of &quot;living a valuable life understood as 
<br />
a coherent biography&quot; (213). Christopher Cordner's paper &quot;Remorse and 
<br />
Moral Identity&quot; argues that one's moral identity is derived from 
<br />
obligations to others that are revealed in the experience of remorse. As 
<br />
Cordner understands it, remorse is a negative, affective experience in 
<br />
which one is shocked by the recognition of another to whom one is &quot;tied&quot; 
<br />
or obligated, and whose claims one has violated. The experience of 
<br />
remorse is &quot;transsocial&quot; in the sense that the bonds it reveals are no 
<br />
less than the bonds of common humanity, and the capacity for this 
<br />
experience is required for &quot;any serious understanding of the moral 
<br />
equality of all human beings&quot; (247).
<br />
<br />The two papers in the final part of the book both draw directly on 
<br />
narrative concepts to illustrate complex relationships between different 
<br />
temporal perspectives within (or on) a life. In &quot;Shaping a Life: 
<br />
Narrative, Time, and Necessity,&quot; Genevieve Lloyd connects Spinoza's 
<br />
&quot;vision of freedom as the joyful acceptance and appropriation of 
<br />
necessity&quot; (257) back to the ideals of the ancient Stoics and forward to 
<br />
Sartre's reflections on &quot;posthumous living&quot; in his autobiography 
<br />
/Words/. Lloyd suggests that we can get a grip on Spinoza's idea through 
<br />
the concept of /narrative/ necessity, particularly as it operates in 
<br />
autobiographical writing. The autobiographer writes as though from a 
<br />
future perspective on his or her own life as a completed whole, in which 
<br />
the contingency of the present is transformed into the fixity of the 
<br />
past and the end is prefigured in the beginning. The sort of &quot;backward 
<br />
living&quot; exemplified in the form of autobiographical narrative is, Lloyd 
<br />
suggests, familiar to us as narrators of our own lives: we exercise 
<br />
freedom in &quot;impos[ing] a pattern of necessity on the fragments&quot; (264) 
<br />
that make up our lives, treating them as having a sort of fixity that in 
<br />
fact eludes us as long as we continue to live. Finally, in &quot;How to 
<br />
Change the Past&quot; Karen Jones investigates the role of narrative 
<br />
interpretation in shaping our emotions, with a particular focus on love. 
<br />
Jones argues that being in love is an interpretation-sensitive, 
<br />
trajectory-dependent property. It is trajectory-dependent because it has 
<br />
temporally-extended truth-makers: whether one counts as being in love at 
<br />
a particular time (as opposed, for example, to simply having a stomach 
<br />
ache) depends, in part, on what happens &quot;elsewhen&quot; -- and, in 
<br />
particular, on the eventual place of one's thoughts, feelings, and 
<br />
actions in a narratively structured whole. It is 
<br />
interpretation-sensitive because conceptualizing one's experience as 
<br />
being in love makes it more likely that the relevant truth-making 
<br />
trajectory will actually unfold, by providing one with a set of 
<br />
culturally available scripts to follow.
<br />
<br />Along with Mackenzie's introduction, which helpfully contextualizes and 
<br />
thematizes the volume, these papers treat a rich array of interrelated 
<br />
topics. They are not only individually worth reading, but also resonate 
<br />
with one another and work well together as a collection. As Mackenzie 
<br />
points out, a significant number of contributors treat narrative, and 
<br />
especially narrative self-interpretation, as central to &quot;the 
<br />
intelligibility and value of our lives as persons&quot; (24). I will use the 
<br />
remainder of this review to consider some of the themes and issues that 
<br />
arise in these papers in more detail.
<br />
<br />One recurring theme is the way in which the construction of 
<br />
self-narratives can help to guide us through deliberative predicaments 
<br />
by providing us reasons for proceeding in one way rather than another -- 
<br />
including predicaments that destabilize our practical identities and 
<br />
lead to self-transformation. Kim Atkins, Jan Bransen, Catriona 
<br />
Mackenzie, and Jeanette Kennett and Steve Matthews all develop 
<br />
variations on this theme. Atkins, as already noted, commits herself to 
<br />
the view that agential continuity over time /depends/ on the continuity 
<br />
of a self-narrated life story. But it is not clear that we need to go 
<br />
this far in order to make the point that our self-narrations can be a 
<br />
source of reasons -- indeed, as Kennett and Matthews put it, an 
<br />
/important/ source of reasons (213) -- and so contribute to a fuller 
<br />
picture of human agency and practical reasoning. Each of the papers on 
<br />
this theme brings to light, in its own way, the agential significance of 
<br />
our capacity to imaginatively project ourselves into the future, along 
<br />
with the constraints of coherence and intelligibility to which such 
<br />
projections are subject.
<br />
<br />Christman's paper stands apart from those just mentioned insofar as it 
<br />
focuses instead on our relationship to our pasts -- on autobiographical 
<br />
memory rather than on imaginative projection into the future. In it 
<br />
Christman develops a new twist on a historical conception of autonomy 
<br />
that he has defended elsewhere, suggesting that narrative 
<br />
self-understanding in the form of autobiographical memory is required 
<br />
for us to meet the authenticity condition on autonomous choice and 
<br />
action. It is worth noting that the concept of narrative itself is not, 
<br />
by Christman's own lights, doing much of the heavy lifting here. In a 
<br />
related paper, to which he refers in the work under discussion, 
<br />
Christman argues that on the most common substantive accounts of 
<br />
narrative connectivity (including, in particular, causal, teleological, 
<br />
and thematic accounts), &quot;the condition of narrativity for the unity of 
<br />
selves, persons, and personalities is either implausible or otiose&quot;.^[1] 
<br />
&lt;file:///Users/agutting/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/westlund=atkins.doc%28TF8C%29/westlund=atkins.doc%28TF8C%29#_edn1&gt; 
<br />
He argues there that narrative unity is a plausible condition for 
<br />
selfhood or unity of consciousness only when interpreted so broadly that 
<br />
any agent who engages in reflective self-interpretation on a sequence of 
<br />
events within her life, and is able &quot;to make sense of these according to 
<br />
socially mediated semantic rules,&quot; will meet it. It is this thin, highly 
<br />
flexible notion of narrative that Christman employs in his paper in this 
<br />
volume.
<br />
<br />This is not the place to engage in detailed discussion of Christman's 
<br />
critique of narrativity. I mention it, however, because I think it poses 
<br />
a useful challenge to all who want to make use of the concept: we must 
<br />
be specific about the notion(s) of narrativity we are employing, and be 
<br />
mindful of apparent limitations of its (their) canonical forms. The 
<br />
authors in this volume are not unaware of these issues. Atkins is among 
<br />
the most explicit about the notion of narrative connectivity she 
<br />
embraces, which incorporates both causal and teleological elements. 
<br />
Aspects of both are, I think, present in Kennett and Matthews as well. 
<br />
Kennett and Matthews also take up the question of how /much/ narrative 
<br />
unity a life requires, and defend the idea that normatively speaking, 
<br />
unity of a /whole/ life (as opposed to local unity within a plurality of 
<br />
narrative strands) is important. Other authors (including Mackenzie, in 
<br />
her introduction) seem attracted to a more flexible notion of 
<br />
narrativity. Mackenzie acknowledges critiques by Christman and by Galen 
<br />
Strawson, but thinks these critiques target an overly narrow conception 
<br />
of narrativity. She argues that narrative theorists of agency are not 
<br />
committed to the view that we &quot;live our lives as stories&quot; (15), and that 
<br />
to read them in this spirit is to miss the important points they have to 
<br />
make about the nature of practical reason and self-constitution. As 
<br />
Mackenzie depicts it, narrative is a very general sort of unifying 
<br />
structure that allows us to identify and forge &quot;patterns of coherence 
<br />
and psychological intelligibility within our lives, connecting our 
<br />
first-personal perspectives to our history, actions, emotions, desires, 
<br />
beliefs, character traits, and so on&quot; (12). It may well be that such a 
<br />
broad and flexible notion of narrative is most useful in discussions of 
<br />
practical identity and unified agency. But if so, it does begin to seem 
<br />
that the term &quot;narrative&quot; is serving, as Christman suggests, as 
<br />
shorthand for /whatever/ emerges from the process of making sense of our 
<br />
lives -- and that if we are not careful, we may be misled by the 
<br />
traditional, literary connotations of the term.^[2] 
<br />
&lt;file:///Users/agutting/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/westlund=atkins.doc%28TF8C%29/westlund=atkins.doc%28TF8C%29#_edn2&gt; 
<br />
<br /><br />The final two papers in the volume, however, do make interesting use of 
<br />
the term's specifically literary connotations: Lloyd draws on the 
<br />
literary genre of autobiography, which organizes different temporal 
<br />
perspectives on oneself in specific ways, while Jones focuses on 
<br />
trajectories or &quot;scripts&quot; that are characterized by the sense-oriented 
<br />
structure of story-telling. (In the kind of structure that Jones has in 
<br />
mind, the meaning of earlier events or episodes is derived from their 
<br />
place within a temporally extended whole.) It is striking that these two 
<br />
papers also mark a shift in emphasis in the volume, from a preoccupation 
<br />
with questions of practical identity and agential authority to a concern 
<br />
with the potentially liberating experience of a certain kind of 
<br />
necessitation. This theme is most explicit in Lloyd's paper, which, as 
<br />
discussed above, attempts to make sense of a Spinozistic vision of 
<br />
freedom as the joyful embrace of necessity. Lloyd seeks to shed light on 
<br />
an alternative to the dominant, Cartesian account of freedom as a matter 
<br />
of control by the will, and, in the process, writes quite movingly about 
<br />
the human confrontation with the unavoidable. But Jones, too, implicitly 
<br />
draws on a form of narrative necessitation insofar as she argues that 
<br />
understanding one's experiences under a certain description triggers the 
<br />
organizational and guiding force of associated stories or scripts. 
<br />
Necessitating as they are, these scripts are ones that we often 
<br />
willingly embrace, and whose structuring force in our lives we also want 
<br />
others to recognize and acknowledge.
<br />
<br />The connection between freedom and necessitation that emerges in the 
<br />
last part of the book resonates in interesting ways with themes 
<br />
developed in the later work of Harry Frankfurt, including, in 
<br />
particular, Frankfurt's concept of volitional necessity. It is perhaps 
<br />
surprising that Frankfurt's work remains so much off-stage in this 
<br />
volume. After all, many of the papers presented in this volume are 
<br />
deeply informed and influenced by the work of Korsgaard and Velleman, 
<br />
work that is itself shaped in significant ways by engagement with 
<br />
Frankfurtian themes. (Velleman's own paper in this volume, though not 
<br />
about narrative, is a case in point.) Frankfurt's earlier work did much 
<br />
to reorient moral psychology around questions of identification, 
<br />
alienation, and agential authority, the enduring import of which is 
<br />
evident in many of the contributions to the first three parts of the 
<br />
book. The papers in the last part of the book point, I think, in a 
<br />
somewhat different direction, more in accord with the preoccupations of 
<br />
the later Frankfurt. They suggest that narrativity may be of particular 
<br />
use in fleshing out the still less-widely discussed theme of freedom in 
<br />
necessitation, a theme which, as Lloyd reminds us, has long been at the 
<br />
core of an alternative philosophical narrative about the nature of human 
<br />
agency.
