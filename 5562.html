Hi Bruno

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi George,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mainly agree with your remarks. Some ambiguity remains but I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like to take some time to succeed making them clear. A priori
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our approaches differs methodologically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Concerning your UDA question, could tell me if you were referring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the UDA presentation in 11 steps, or to the one in 15 steps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (that is to the conversation with Joel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or to the older presentation in one post I made for Russell)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah you mention step 12, so it is the old one OK. But what do you mean by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a reduced universe? 
</em><br />
<br />I got the argument at <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html</a>
<br />
<br />Step 12 is the step when you introduce the UDA.
<br />
<br />By reduced universe, I mean a many-world universe where the number of 
<br />
worlds is less than that of the plenitude or even finite. Your example 
<br />
of teleportation between Washington and Moscow describes a reduced 
<br />
universe: The number of options is limited to only two places. Note that 
<br />
even though the example mentions only one world where this experiment 
<br />
occurs, this description is by the 3rd person. The first person 
<br />
experiences two worlds.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, could you explain what you mean by &quot;frame of reference&quot; and this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without physicalist assumptions. Remember I try to deduce the whole of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (including geometry but not geography) from the &quot;numbers' dreams&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Frame of reference is difficult to define. I have used the analogy with 
<br />
relativity because it is a convenient model for what I want to express. 
<br />
However, I do not restrict frame of reference to spatio-temporal 
<br />
characteristics. At a first level I include quantum measurements: if two 
<br />
experimenters observes the &quot;apparent collapse of the wave functon&quot; in 
<br />
the same way then they occupy the same world in the plenitude.  At a 
<br />
higher level I also include logical processes governing consciousness.  
<br />
Two observer sharing the same logical system experiences the same 
<br />
consciousness. Unfortunately I do not know enough about logic to  
<br />
express logic in a relativistic fashion.  I have gone as far  as 
<br />
recognizing that conditional probabilities can be viewed as a 
<br />
relativization of information.
<br />
<br />I found it convenient to view relativity as a road map. One of  the 
<br />
first things Einstein did was to recognize the principle of invariance 
<br />
of c (for special relativity) and the equivalence of acceleration with 
<br />
gravity (for general relativity). Other things he did was to express the 
<br />
concept of simultaneity and to derive a spatio-temporal metric.
<br />
<br />We could define the invariance of the plenitude as seen by any observer 
<br />
as a starting point. This principle led me to argue in the past on this 
<br />
list that conditional suicide or even more simply &quot;death&quot; does not alter 
<br />
measure.
<br />
<br />The analogy to simultaneity can be expresses by the conditional suicide 
<br />
experiments that we have discussed on this list a few years ago in which 
<br />
different observers see different outcomes depending on how many 
<br />
contingencies they share in their survival.
<br />
<br />The analogy with the metric can be expressed by thought experiment that 
<br />
I have presented on this list a few years ago in which the probability 
<br />
of achieving a goal such as winning at a  lottery can be calculated 
<br />
using conditional probabilities which are contingent on the survival of 
<br />
the player. This topic I believe was of interest to Wei but I don't 
<br />
think I got him interested in my point of view.
<br />
<br />I would also like to include logical systems but as I have mentioned 
<br />
above, I do not know enough about logic to relativitize it. I also would 
<br />
like to set up a thought experiment involving relativistic logical 
<br />
systems but I don't know how to proceed.
<br />
<br />All this is just scratching the surface. There is a need for 
<br />
establishing strong links with physics and mathematics and to make this 
<br />
theory falsifiable. There is also the need for unifying all these 
<br />
relativities - make them into one single coherent whole: Einstein's 
<br />
Relativity, Everett's Relative Many-World interpretation, and 
<br />
(Relative?) Logic.
<br />
<br />Have a good weekend. I will also be busy till Tuesday.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;  when you say that the first person is all there is I am not sure it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; fits nicely with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the methodology I am following. I am not sure I understand why you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; don't need the UD,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; given that the UD is just a nice third person description of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; comp plenitude.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; [That such a thing could exist is a highly non trivial consequence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of the closure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the set of programmable functions for the diagonalization: the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; existence of a universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; machine. (The Post Turing discovery)]. Cf the diagonalization posts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; These are difficult issues... First it seems that the UD does not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have to be a basic assumption from which the plenitude can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; derived. I think you agree with that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Another issue is that if we begin with the basic assumption of first 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person perspective (from which the third person can be derived when 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; first persons share the same frame of reference) then the plenitude 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; should necessarily be regarded from the first person perspective.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Is it correct to say that the plenitude is invariant when seen from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the first person? In other words, are all the future potentialities 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; present in the same amount as seen by any observer (no matter how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; little or how much his life is compromised by his circumstances)? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This may be a basic invariance law in the MWI similar to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; invariance of c in relativity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If this invariance is true, then your statement that the UD is a nice 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; third person description for the plenitude is OK however it would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; only be a derivation from the plenitude invariance principle The UD 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would also be invariant to describe or generate the plenitude, for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; any observer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Please recall me your feelings about the comp hyp in the cognitive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; science/philosophy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of mind, if you mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is a hard question to answer, but I'll give it a try. I am very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; committed to the first person &quot;relativistic&quot; or &quot;relative&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; perspective. I believe that science has been gradually moving toward 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it from the days of Galileo and Copernicus. Einstein made the &quot;I&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relative in space and time. Everett made it relative in the quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; realm. I want to push that to its ultimate conclusion: that the &quot;I&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; should be the basic axiom from which everything else derives. In &quot;I&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I include consciousness and its logical process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I reviewed your Universal Dovetailer Argument. at your internet site 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and I agree very much with it. However, I have some questions. Step 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1-11 forces the reader to consider the first person perspective. Step 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 12  may have been taken too hastily. It presumes that the observer in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; steps 1-11 exists in a plenitude (for example a closed set of the set 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of programmable functions). This is not clear. In fact step 1-11 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could have been taken in a reduced universe.
