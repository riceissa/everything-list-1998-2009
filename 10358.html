<br />
Stathis,
<br />
<br />thanks for a reply in reason - you said the million
<br />
dollar word. (I will come back to 'quote' it).
<br />
&nbsp;First:
<br />
As Norman, I, too, was a very smart kid (and am still
<br />
very modest - ha ha) and had ALL my experiences of a
<br />
5-year old at 5. Since then I collected 2-3 additional
<br />
'experienced' features into my 'mind'. Still unsure if
<br />
they 'match' some outside &quot;real reality&quot; or just being
<br />
manufactured by my incredible(!) fantasy. 'Unsure' is
<br />
the word. 
<br />
Now in your wise position (worth remembering) you
<br />
wrote
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; The best we can do in science as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in everyday life is to accept provisionally that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things are as they seem.  &lt; 
</em><br />
I agree and thank you for it.
<br />
The BIG word is PROVISIONALLY. Then others pick it up,
<br />
not only in reply-button list-posts, but in books, in
<br />
teaching - over 2500 years and already after some
<br />
hundred quotations people grow into believeing it - no
<br />
provisioanlly, - as the TRUTH. It became science and
<br />
even coomon knowledge.Taught at colleges for
<br />
centuries.
<br />
When did you last learn that the tenets of ongoing
<br />
physics are only &quot;provisionally&quot; accepted as 'real'? 
<br />
(I just wanted to tease members of this list. 
<br />
Of course on THIS list 'thinking' people gathered and
<br />
such thoughts are not unusual. We are the exception.)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
An example is the Big Bang. Many scientists almost put
<br />
it into their evening prayer. Doubting is heresy. 
<br />
This is why I scrutinize what we 'believe in' and try
<br />
alternate narratives: do they hold water? Are the new
<br />
(alternate) ideas palatable to what (we think) we
<br />
experience? 
<br />
<br />We shoul not forget that we are products of a long
<br />
long 'evolutioary' line of development and responses
<br />
arose to phenomena otherwise unexplained like the
<br />
hardness of a figment we call 'tble' or the 'pain'
<br />
when kicked, all fotted into the most ingenious
<br />
edifice of &quot;existence&quot; - whatever THAT may be. 
<br />
<br />Bruno and the numberologists wisely reduce the problem
<br />
into 'numbers - math': - that is all. We really cannot
<br />
encompass the known and unknown varieties of
<br />
everything but I try to face our ignorance-based awe
<br />
and 'hope' to open (small) windows into more than we
<br />
had earlier. 
<br />
The 'number-line' is a good variant, I find it still
<br />
insufficient. I don't want to 'numerify' my pleasure
<br />
to listen to musical 'art', laugh at a good joke, or
<br />
enjoying a Black Forest Cake. Would make me sorry if
<br />
it turns out to be true. As George said: I am crazy,
<br />
too.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In a discussion about philosophy, Nick Prince
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said, &quot;If we are living in a simulation. . .&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; To which John Mikes replied, &quot;I think this is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; usual pretension. . .   I think 'we simulate what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are living in' according to the little we know. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Such 'simulation' - 'simplification' - 'modeling' -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'metaphorizing' - or even 'Harry Potterizing' things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we think does not change the 'unknown/unknowable' we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; live in.  We just think and therefore we think we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This interchange reminded me of thoughts I had as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a child - I used to wonder if if everything I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experienced was real or a dream.  How could I know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which it was?  I asked my parents and was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discouraged, in no uncertain terms, from asking them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nonsensical questions.  I asked my playmates and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; friends, but they didn't know the answer any more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than I did.  I had no other resources so I concluded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the question was unanswerable and that the best
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I could do was proceed as if what I experienced was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now, many years later, I have this list - and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wikipedia - as resources.  But, as John Mikes (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others) say, I still cannot know that what I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience is reality.  I can only assume that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality is how things appear to me - and I might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the young Norman Samish got it right: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (a) I used to wonder if if everything I experienced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was real or a dream.  How could I know which it was?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (b) I had no other resources so I concluded that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question was unanswerable and that the best I could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do was proceed as if what I experienced was reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To &quot;know the truth&quot; is to become godlike, standing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outside of the world and seeing everything for what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it really is... and even then you might ask yourself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether you really are omniscient or only *think*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are omniscient. The best we can do in science as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in everyday life is to accept provisionally that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things are as they seem. There is no shame in this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as long as you are ready to revise your theory in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the light of new evidence, and it is certainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better than assuming that things are *not* as they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem, in the absence of any evidence.
