<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with Quentin.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are just showing that the naive notion of set is inconsistent.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cantor already knew that, and this is exactly what forced people to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; develop axiomatic theories. So depending on which theory of set you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will use, you can or cannot have an universal set (a set of all sets).  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In typical theories, like ZF and VBG (von Neuman Bernay Gödel) the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collection of all sets is not a set.
</em><br />
<br />It is not the naive notion of set that is inconsistent.  It is the naive 
<br />
*handling* of sets that is inconsistent.
<br />
<br />This problem has two possible solutions.  One possible solution is to 
<br />
deny that it is possible to create the set of all sets.  This solution 
<br />
is chosen by ZF and VBG.
<br />
<br />The second possible solution is to be very careful of the domain of the 
<br />
All quantificator.  You are not allowed to substitute an object that is 
<br />
not included in the domain of the quantificator.  It is this second 
<br />
solution that I have chosen.
<br />
<br />What is illegal in the two deductions below, is the substitutions.  
<br />
Because the sets A and B do not belong to the domain of the All 
<br />
quantificator.
<br />
<br />You can define &quot;existence&quot; by saying that only that which is incuded in 
<br />
the domain of the All quantificator exists.  In that case it is correct 
<br />
to say that the sets A and B do not exist, because they are not included 
<br />
in the domain.  But I think this is a too restrictive definition of 
<br />
existence.  It is fully possible to talk about the set of all sets.  But 
<br />
you must then be *very* careful with what you do with that set.  That 
<br />
set is a set, but it does not belong to the set of all sets, it does not 
<br />
belong to itself.  It is also a matter of definition; if you define 
<br />
&quot;set&quot; as the same as &quot;belonging to the set of all sets&quot;, then the set of 
<br />
all sets is not a set.  This is a matter of taste.  You can choose 
<br />
whatever you like, but you must be aware of your choice.  But if you 
<br />
restrict yourself too much, then your life will be poorer...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In NF, some have developed  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure with universal sets, and thus universe containing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves. Abram is interested in such universal sets. And, you can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpret the UD, or the Mandelbrot set as (simple) model for such  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; type of structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your argument did not show at all that the set of natural numbers  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads to any trouble. Indeed, finitism can be seen as a move toward  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that set, viewed as an everything, potentially infinite frame (for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; math, or beyond math, like it happens with comp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem of naming (or given a mathematical status) to &quot;all sets&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is akin to the problem of giving a name to God. As Cantor was  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely aware of. We are confused on this since we exist. But the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural numbers, have never leads to any confusion, despite we cannot  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; define them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<br />The &quot;proof&quot; that there is no biggest natural number is illegal, because 
<br />
you are there doing an illegal deduction, you are there doing an illegal 
<br />
substitution, just the same as in the deductions below with the sets A 
<br />
and B.  You are there substituting an object that is not part of the 
<br />
domain of the All quatificator.

&gt; You argument against the infinity of natural numbers is not valid. You  
&gt; cannot throw out this &quot;little infinite&quot; by pointing on the problem  
&gt; that some &quot;terribly big infinite&quot;, like the &quot;set&quot; of all sets,  leads  
&gt; to trouble. That would be like saying that we have to abandon all  
&gt; drugs because the heroin is very dangerous.
&gt; It is just non valid.
&gt;
&gt; Normally, later  I will show a series of argument very close to  
&gt; Russell paradoxes, and which will yield, in the comp frame,  
&gt; interesting constraints on what computations are and are not.

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;       
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you think about the following deduction?  Is it legal or  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; illegal?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Define the set A of all sets as:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For all x holds that x belongs to A if and only if x is a set.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is an general rule saying that for some particular symbol- 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; string x
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you can always tell if x belongs to A or not.  Most humans who think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about mathematics can understand this rule-based definition.  This  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rule
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; holds for all and every object, without exceptions.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So this rule also holds for A itself.  We can always substitute A  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; x.  Then we will get:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A belongs to A if and only if A is a set.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And we know that A is a set.  So from this we can deduce:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A beongs to A.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Quentin, what do you think?  Is this deduction legal or illegal?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         
&gt;&gt;&gt; It depends if you allow a set to be part of itselft or not.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you accept, that a set can be part of itself, it makes your
&gt;&gt;&gt; deduction legal regarding the rules.
&gt;&gt;&gt;       
&gt;&gt; OK, if we accept that a set can be part of itself, what do you think
&gt;&gt; about the following deduction? Is it legal or illegal?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; -------------------
&gt;&gt; Define the set B of all sets that do not belong to itself as:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; For all x holds that x belongs to B if and only if x does not belong  
&gt;&gt; to x.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This is an general rule saying that for some particular symbol- 
&gt;&gt; string x
&gt;&gt; you can always tell if x belongs to B or not.  Most humans who think
&gt;&gt; about mathematics can understand this rule-based definition.  This  
&gt;&gt; rule
&gt;&gt; holds for all and every object, without exceptions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So this rule also holds for B itself.  We can always substitute B for
&gt;&gt; x.  Then we will get:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; B belongs to B if and only if B does not belong to B.
&gt;&gt; -------------------
&gt;&gt; Quentin, what do you think?  Is this deduction legal or illegal?
