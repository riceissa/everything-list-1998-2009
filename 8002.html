<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the reason we don't realise we are only dreaming is precisely because

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of our absence of self-awareness or critical self-insight. The

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relevant module of the brain has effectively shut down. Yet it would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be misleading to call dreams &quot;non-conscious&quot;? Some dreams e.g. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nightmares, can be intense and frightening while they last.
</em><br />
<br />Thanks for this comment, it is an important point. Indeed dreams seem
<br />
to be precisely the area where the Anthropic Principle breaks down (I
<br />
think). Although, something is still lingering there, as usually you seem to
<br />
wake up just before being killed by that monster chasing you...
<br />
<br />I'll have to think some more about how to address what dreams mean in
<br />
this context (even if the answer is I don't quite know yet).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. More seriously, the idea that self-awareness is a necessary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feature of consciousness has profound implications for the moral 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; status of babies, the severely mentally handicapped - and most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-human animals. Clearly, they don't have a sophisticated sense of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self. Arguably they lack all self-awareness. But surely, if they have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nociceptors and a central nervous system, then they do feel pain - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sometimes intensely?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I don't think the moral question of how to treat babies and other
<br />
non-human species hinges on whether they have consciousness. However,
<br />
it is true that this area of moral enquiry has deep problems of its
<br />
own, independent of the issue of self-awareness.
<br />
<br />Obviously, this is issue is parallel to the issue of free will and
<br />
moral responsibility. Do you think I should be mounting a similar sort
<br />
of lambast against the idea of connecting our moral behaviour towards
<br />
other creatures to their consciousness (or lack thereof)?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tellingly, perhaps, our most intense experiences - e.g. extreme 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agony, orgasm, blind panic, etc -  are marked by an absence of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-consciousness. 
</em><br />
<br />I vaguely recall a New Scientist article about this recently - I'll
<br />
look it up...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Conversely, some of our most sophisticated forms 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of self-awareness have a very subtle phenomenology indeed [e.g 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; examples so called &quot;higher-order intentionality&quot; -  I think that she 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hopes that he believes that I want...etc etc]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Generalizing to other creatures with central nervous systems, one may 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be sceptical that whales, say, are very intelligent. They may or may 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not possess rudimentary self-awareness. 
</em><br />
<br />I suspect that Cetaceans as a group are quite possibly self-aware. We
<br />
know bottlenose dolphins are. Recently, Orcas were found to have
<br />
&quot;culture&quot; (a trick of vomiting up squid parts to attract birds for
<br />
capture was passed on between individuals).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it's at least possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they experience pain more intensely than we do - their &quot;pain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; centers&quot; are larger for a start.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Self-awareness may be intimately linked to intelligence; but it's not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clear (to me at least) that consciousness per se is linked to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Is pain linked to consciousness? Who knows? Certainly, quite simple
<br />
animals experience all the physiological hallmarks of pain. But maybe
<br />
they aren't conscious of the pain, because they aren't conscious at
<br />
all. Does that mean we are free to inflict pain on these creatures?
<br />
Who knows? Unfortunately, I don't see that the considerations of the
<br />
&quot;everything list&quot; actually adds anything of substance to the debate -
<br />
hence my preference to remain silent.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. Also, I think it may be premature (re Russell's comment in ToN on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Susan Greenfield) to say that the notion of levels of consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is devoid of meaning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, there is an absolute &quot;binary&quot; distinction between consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and non-consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this absolute distinction doesn't entail that the idea of degrees 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of consciousness itself is meaningless. Thus pain can be mild, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moderate or intense. 
</em><br />
<br />Pain can be graded, I agree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One can be dimly self-aware or acutely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-aware. 
</em><br />
<br />I've never noticed this distinction. I've always been self-aware, or
<br />
not aware at all.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And  there are even cases of awareness even while under 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surgical general anesthesia - though fortunately they are quite rare.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [etc]
</em><br />
<br />True, but then one is aware. It is apparently a very alarming
<br />
experience, as anaesthetists usually add a paralysis drug to prevent
<br />
dangerous movements on the operating table.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Apologies if I've misunderstood the argument here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I believe anaesthetists talk about levels of awareness when referring
<br />
to physiological signs. One can be partially aware of one's
<br />
surroundings - like the noise that you only suddenly became conscious
<br />
of because something changed to cause you to pay attention. The
<br />
feeling of &quot;being drugged&quot; after waking up with too little sleep is
<br />
like this - you are barely aware of your environment, because you're
<br />
too tired to pay attention to it. This is how I imagine anasthetists
<br />
&quot;level of awareness&quot; - the amount of the environment one is
<br />
consciously (or even unconsciously?) responding to. But to be
<br />
self-aware is a binary thing, as selfness is very much a unified
<br />
thing. Similarly, consciousness seems to be an all-or-nothing thing to
<br />
me.
<br />
<br />Greenfield, as I understand her, would argue that all animals have
<br />
some degree of consciousness, regardless of their intelligence
<br />
levels. This seems to be a totally different sort of claim from
<br />
anaesthetist's level of awareness. And one that I cannot understand at
<br />
all.
<br />
<br />Cheers
