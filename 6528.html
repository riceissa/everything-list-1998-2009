Dear Stathis,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for reading the paper in its entirety. Pratt's idea is very 
<br />
subtle but the difference between the form of dualism that he is explaining 
<br />
is very different from Descartes'. Pratt is considering &quot;Mind&quot; and &quot;body&quot; as 
<br />
&quot;process&quot;, not &quot;substance&quot;. It is the difference between a &quot;Being&quot; based 
<br />
paradigm and a &quot;Becoming&quot; based paradigm.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please continue and take a look at some of the other papers 
<br />
(<a href="http://chu.stanford.edu/">http://chu.stanford.edu/</a> ) and notice how Category theory is being used, 
<br />
notice the contravariant morphisms, notice how non-well founded logic is 
<br />
being used. BTW, non-well founded logics handle the circularity that you 
<br />
appear to protest. This circularity is also a key feature that has to been 
<br />
explained in models of consciousness because, at a minimum, we have to 
<br />
explain &quot;self-awareness&quot;!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pratt doesn't seem to have address the key notion of forgetfulness in 
<br />
the previously referenced paper, which is necessary to deal with 
<br />
irreversibility, but I am sure that that will be dealt with soon enough.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;interaction&quot; between the &quot;hand&quot; and the &quot;abstraction&quot; in your 
<br />
example [or better the information representing the physical hand] is 
<br />
obvious. It is not an &quot;interaction&quot;, it is an identity in the same way that 
<br />
there is an identification beween a physical object and the class of 
<br />
representations that it can have, be they &quot;bitstrings&quot; or whatever! 
<br />
Interactions, as Pratt explains, need to be explained between the &quot;bodies&quot; 
<br />
and between the &quot;minds&quot;. How is it that my mind can interact with yours, or 
<br />
to put it into COMP terms, how does one bitstring interact with another 
<br />
without some physical instantiation?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interaction problem becomes even more pronounced when we start 
<br />
thinking about QM systems! If you look at the formalism carefully, it is 
<br />
obvious that QM systems are separate from each other in such a way that even 
<br />
the notion of &quot;substance exchange&quot; between them will simply not work. QM 
<br />
systems are exactly like Leibniz' monads: &quot;windowless&quot;.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this fact how do we propose to explain interactions in general and 
<br />
communication between observers in particular? We can not have theories of 
<br />
our universe of experience that only include a single observer! I know well 
<br />
about particle physics theories talking about vector bosons being exchanged 
<br />
but if you look carefully at the QM system involved, the vector bosons are 
<br />
part of the single QM system being considered and not a separate system. 
<br />
There are technical nuances involved here to be sure, but these ideas are 
<br />
not being advanced without careful consideration. I understand all too well 
<br />
the importance of Occam's Razor. ;-)
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
<br />
<br />Stephen

Subject: RE: What do you lose if you simply accept...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Stephen,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have to confess that the mathematical intricacies of Chu spaces are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quite beyond me. However, this passage appears at the introduction to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cited article:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;We propose to reduce complex mind-body interaction to the elementary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interactions of their constituents.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Events of the body interact with states of the mind. This interaction has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two dual forms. A physical event a in the body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A impresses its occurrence on a mental state x of the mind X, written 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a=|x.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dually, in state x the mind infers the prior occurrence of event a, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written x |= a.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tell me if I have completely misconstrued it, but it seems that this is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still discussing how the two entities (mind and body) are interacting, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differs only in detail from the 17th century solutions. *Why* do you need 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to &quot;prove the necessity of epiphenomena&quot;, and *how* is such a &quot;proof&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; providing any more information than the simple observation that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epiphenomena exist? You could go mad seeing dualism everywhere. If I wave 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my hand in a circular pattern, we have (a) the physical action of moving 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my hand in a circular pattern, and (b) the circular pattern. Arguably, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these are two completely different things. One is an event in the physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world, and the other is a theoretical or mathematical abstraction. How is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it that these two completely different entities interact? How can you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prove that the physical action of moving my hand in a particular way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessitates the epiphenomenon of the circular pattern? And if you manage 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to explain that one, how can you explain the experience of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being-a-circular-pattern from the inside, or, conversely, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-experience of being-a-circular-pattern from the inside, whichever is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the case? There comes a point where theory and explanation makes us more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confused and no more informed than we were before.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; --Stathis
