<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I see identity in a larger sense.  Consider the example proposed

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;infinite number of exact, perfect, indistinguishable copies of me spread

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;throughout the universe.  (Each of those copies exists within a region

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of space, billions of light years across, which is observationally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;indistinguishable from our own.)

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Gilles HENRI, &lt;Gilles.Henri.domain.name.hidden&gt;, replied:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I dislike this analogy. If there exist some part of the Universe &quot;perfectly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; indistinguishable&quot; from another one, it means that this part has the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; surrounding, and by continuity that the Universe is in fact periodic, each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; part having the same copy at the same distance. It is equivalent to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that the topology of the Universe is closed (torus-like), and you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assimilate it to a finite one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;No, it doesn't mean this.  We see only a finite-sized bubble of space.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the universe is infinite, there are an infinite number of such bubbles,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each spatially separated from the others.  Among this infinite number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bubbles will be all physically possible arrangements of matter, with each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;arrangment occuring an infinite number of times.  In particular, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;arrangement of matter we see around us will also be repeated an infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number of times, as well as all variations on it.
</em><br />
<br />This can be true only during a finite time for two given regions. If two
<br />
bubbles are identical up to some distance R, the differences in their
<br />
surroundings will produce different electromagnetic and gravitational
<br />
perturbations that will propagate to the centre in a time R/c. So while it
<br />
is true that at a given time they are an infinite number of identical
<br />
regions, it also true that this identity must cease for all pairs after a
<br />
given time. It is not justified to assimilate as identical two parts (or
<br />
beings) that share only temporarily the same history.
<br />
Furthermore an infinite deterministic universe is not equivalent to MWI. If
<br />
there are exact copies of yourself, they must by definition follow the same
<br />
history, so you cannot consider different evolutions of yourself. If
<br />
evolutions are different, it means that they are not copies of yourself.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is not periodicity, it is merely the repetition of a finite sequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;within an infinite sequence, like finding the string &quot;141&quot; an infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number of times among the digits of pi.
</em><br />
<br />The equivalent is that the density of identical sequences decreases with
<br />
their length.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How about if we have the computers also simulate an environment for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intelligence to interact with.  There can be a whole simulated world,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with other organisms, complex environments, dramatic variations in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conditions, etc.  The simulated world can be as complex and intricate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as we desire.  Can't intelligence exist in such a world?
</em><br />
<br />I doubt that it is conceivable to simulate a whole Universe WITHIN this
<br />
Universe. The only logical possibility would be that we are ACTUALLY the
<br />
product of a computation in a larger, meta-Universe with computers much
<br />
larger than our own universe (But how were they built?). Of course you can
<br />
conceive simplest versions of a Universe with simpler organisms. This is
<br />
actually realized in any computation. The problem again is that we call
<br />
consciousness a property that MUST have (by definition) about the same
<br />
complexity as our own behavior, and we are adapted to the complexity of our
<br />
world, not of a simpler simulation (you can of course extend the definition
<br />
of intelligence to much simpler behaviors, but it won't help to understand
<br />
us!)
<br />
<br />So for me an intelligent computer (in our world) must NOT include the
<br />
simulation of its own environment, to be considered as intelligent (the
<br />
brain itself does not !). It must be adapted to the external world, which
<br />
means also that two different intelligent computers must be considered as
<br />
different.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Gilles, I agree strongly that 'consciousness is not an objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;property.... but a functionality' but you do not need i/os -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interfaces with some external reality -  because other mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objects can act on yet other mental objects. Budhist thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about consciousness is helpful here, as is Liebnitz.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I have more sympathy for budhism than for other religions, but I do
<br />
not take it without discussion!
<br />
I don't know what is a mental object without i/os. I don't know how to
<br />
think of something that I cannot relate to some perception in any way. For
<br />
me consciousness IS the capability of reactivating perceptions that we have
<br />
had from our interaction with the outer world, or our own body. &quot;Mental
<br />
creation&quot; is only a rearrangement or an extrapolation of these known
<br />
sensations.
