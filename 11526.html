In an excellent and clear post Peter Jones writes:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Matter is a bare substrate with no properties of its own. The question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may well be asked at this point: what roles does it perform ? Why not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dispense with matter and just have bundles of properties -- what does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter add to a merely abstract set of properties? The answer is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not all bundles of posible properties are instantiated, that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What does it mean to say something exists ? &quot;..exists&quot; is a meaningful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predicate of concepts rather than things. The thing must exist in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense to be talked about. But if it existed full, a statement like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Nessie doesn't exist&quot; would be a contradiction ...it would amount to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;the existing thing Nessie doesnt exist&quot;. However, if we take that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;some sense&quot; in which the subject of an &quot;...exists&quot; predicate exists is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only initially as a concept, we can then say whether or not the concept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has something to refer to. Thus &quot;Bigfoot exists&quot; would mean &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept 'Bigfoot' has a referent&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What matter adds to a bundle of properties is existence. A non-existent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bundle of properties is a mere concept, a mere possibility. Thus the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of matter is very much tied to the idea of contingency or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;somethingism&quot; -- the idea that only certain possible things exist.
</em><br />
<br />So on this basis alone are you opposed to a *physical* multiverse, in which 
<br />
every possibility is physically instantiated somewhere, but some possibilities 
<br />
are more common/ have greater measure than others?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The other issue matter is able to explain as a result of having no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties of its own is the issue of change and time. For change to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguishable from mere succession, it must be change in something.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It could be a contingent natural law that certain properties never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change. However, with a propertiless substrate, it becomes a logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessity that the substrate endures through change; since all changes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are changes in properties, a propertiless substrate cannot itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change and must endure through change. In more detail here
</em><br />
<br />Why must &quot;change... be change in something&quot;? It sort of sounds reasonable 
<br />
but it is our duty to question every assumption and weed out the superfluous 
<br />
ones. If there is an object with (space, time, colour) coordinates (x1, t1, red) 
<br />
and another object (x1, t2, orange), then we say that the object has changed 
<br />
from red to orange. This could describe a poker left in a fire, for example. We 
<br />
only need to talk about properties (and we can add as many as we like to be 
<br />
sufficiently specific); we don't need the propertiless substrate.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Case Against Mathematial Monism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematical monism is both too broad and too narrow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Too broad: If I am just a mathematical structure, I should have a much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wider range of experience than I do. There is a mathemtical structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding to myself with all my experiences up to time T. There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a vast array of mathematical structures corresponding to other versions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of me with having a huge range of experiences -- ordinary ones, like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuing to type, extraordinary ones like seeing my computer sudenly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turn into bowl of petunias. All these versions of me share the memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the &quot;me&quot; who is writing this, so they all identify themselves as me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remember, that for mathematical monism it is only necessary that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible experience has a mathematical description. This is known as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the White Rabbit problem. If we think in terms of multiverse theories,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we would say that there is one &quot;me&quot; in this universe and other &quot;me's&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in other universes,a nd they are kept out of contact with each other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question is whether a purely mathematical scheme has enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resources to impose isolation or otherwise remove the White Rabbit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see how a physical multiverse would be distinguishable from a virtual 
<br />
reality or a mathematical reality (assuming the latter is possible, for the sake 
<br />
of this part of the argument). The successive moments of your conscious 
<br />
experience do not need to be explicitly linked together to &quot;flow&quot; and they do 
<br />
not need to be explicitly separated, either in separate universes or in separate 
<br />
rooms, to be separate. If you died today and just by accident a possible next 
<br />
moment of consciousness was generated by a computer a trillion years in the 
<br />
future, then ipso facto you would find yourself a trillion years in the future.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Too narrow: there are a number of prima-facie phenomena which a purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical approach struggles to deal with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * causality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * necessity/contingency
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why space ? It is tempting to think that if a number of, or some other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical entity, occurs in a set with other numbers, that is, as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were, a &quot;space&quot; which is disconnected from other sets, so that a set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forms a natural model of an *isolated* universe withing a multiverse, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe which does not suffer from the White Rabbit problem. However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maths per se does not work that way. The number &quot;2&quot; that appears in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of even numbers is exactly the same number &quot;2&quot; that appears in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list of numbers less than 10. It does not acquire any further
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characteristics from its context.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The time issue should be obvious. Mathematics is tradionally held to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deal with timeless, eternal truths. This is reflected in the metpahor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of mathematical truth being discovered not found (which, in line with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my criticism of Platonism, should not be taken to seriously). It could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be objected that physics can model time mathematically; it can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objected right back that it does so by spatialising time, by turning it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into just another dimension, in which nothing really changes, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing passes. Some even go so far as to insist that this model is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what time &quot;really&quot; is, which is surely a case of mistaking the map for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the territory.
</em><br />
<br />But if you had the successive moments of your consciousness implemented 
<br />
in parallel, perhaps as a simulation on a powerful computer, it would be impossible 
<br />
to tell that this was the case. For all you are aware, there may not *be* any past 
<br />
moments: your present experience may include false memories of your past, and 
<br />
whole world may have been created a second ago.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Consciousness is a problem for all forms of materialism and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physicalism to some extent, but it is possible to discern where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem is particularly acute. There is no great problem with the idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that matter considered as a bare substrate can have mental properities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any inability to have mental properties would itself be a property and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore be inconsistent with the bareness of a bare substrate. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;subjectivity&quot; of conscious states, often treated as &quot;inherent&quot; boils
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down to a problem of communicating one's qualia -- how one feels, how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things seem. Thus it is not truly inherent but depends on the means of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication being used. Feelings and seemings can be more readily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicated in artistic, poetic language, and least readily in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific, technical language. Since the harder, more technical a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science is, the more mathematical it is, the communication problem is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at its most acute in a purely mathematical langauge. Thus the problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with physicalism is not its posit of matter (as a bare substrate) but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its other posit, that all properties are physical. Since physics is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical, that amounts to the claim that all properties are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical (or at least mathematically describable). In making the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transition from a physicalist world-view to a mathematical one, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of a material substrate is abandoned (although it was never a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem for consciousness) and mathematical properties become the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible basis for qualia. Qualia have to be reducible to, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identifiable with, mathematical properties, if they exist at all. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means that the problem for consciousness becomes extreme, since there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no longer the possibility of qualia existing in their own right, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties of a material substrate, without supervening on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematically describable properties.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The interesting thing is that these two problems can be used to solve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each other to some extent. if we allow extra-mathemtical properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into our universe, we can use them to solve the White Rabbit problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are two ways of doing this: We can claim either:-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * White Rabbit universes don't exist at all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * White Rabbit universes are causally separated from us (or remote in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first is basically a reversion to a single-universe theory (1).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematical monists sometimes complain that they can't see what role
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter plays. One way of seeing its role is as a solution to the WR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem. For the non-Platonist, most mathematical entitites have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;merely abstract&quot; existence. Only a subset truly, conceretely, exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is an extra factor that the priveleged few have. What is it ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Materiality. For the physicalist, matter is the token of existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Material things, exist, immaterial ones don't.
</em><br />
<br />Physical existence is only an improvement on the WR problem as compared 
<br />
to mathematical existence if you don't believe in a multiverse. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second moves on from a Mathematical Multiverse to a physical one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (3). The interesting thing about the second variety of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-just-mathematical monism is that as well as addressing the White
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rabbit problem, it removes some further contingency. If the matter,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical laws, and so on, are logically possible, then the general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach of arguing for a universe/multiverse on the grounds of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; removing contingency must embrace them -- otherwise it would be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contingent fact that the universe/multiverse consists of nothing but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics.
