<br />
I've finally had time to read Maudlin's paper, and I've gradually
<br />
been catching up on your discussions on the Implementation thread,
<br />
and I'd like to add my opinions to the mix.  I've concluded that
<br />
Maudlin's proof of the incompatibility between physical supervenience
<br />
and a computational theory of consciousness, is without merit.  I'll
<br />
try to show where I think he made the errors in his argument.
<br />
Hopefully soon I'll have time to apply this same analysis to some of
<br />
the recent posts.
<br />
<br />First I want to thank all of the participants for a lively
<br />
discussion.  I don't think it gets said often enough here:  thank you
<br />
very much for taking the time to write such well crafted posts.  They
<br />
are a joy to read.
<br />
<br />I found Maudlin's paper to be very well written, and powerfully
<br />
argued.
<br />
<br />Maudlin's main error is a subtle one, and the seeds for it can be
<br />
found in this introduction to the concept of physical supervenience,
<br />
on page 408:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computational structure supervenes on physical structure, so
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physically identical brains are also computationally identical.
<br />
<br />Indeed, he defines the _supervenience thesis_ thus:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two physical systems engaged in precisely the same physical
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;activity through a time will support the same modes of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consciousness (if any) through that time.
<br />
<br />He doesn't provide any evidence to support this conjecture, he
<br />
assumes it as fairly obvious.  In the case of human brains, it is
<br />
fairly obvious, and probably true.  But in the case of his final
<br />
computational machine, Olympia, it is clearly false, as I will show.
<br />
As a summary: the great lengths that Maudlin goes to in contriving
<br />
Olympia are precisely those which invalidate the supervenience
<br />
thesis, as he has defined it.
<br />
<br />Maudlin elaborates on his definition, as Hal pointed out in his post:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we introduce into the vicinity of the system an entirely inert
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;object that has absolutely no causal or physical interaction with
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the system, then the same activity will still support the same
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mode of consciousness.
<br />
<br />But this is clearly incorrect, as a moment's reflection will verify.
<br />
Computation supervenes on physical processes precisely to the extent
<br />
that, to put it simply, the outputs depend on the inputs.  As Maudlin
<br />
(and everyone on this group) accepts, correct handling of some set
<br />
of counterfactuals are essential to be able to call an implementation
<br />
an instantiation of a computation (say _that_ three times fast!)  So
<br />
this definition of physical supervenience is where the error lies.
<br />
In fact, &quot;objects that have absolutely no causal or physical
<br />
interaction&quot; could affect the ability of the mechanism to deal with
<br />
counterfactuals, and so they would change the nature of the
<br />
computational device.
<br />
<br />To put it simply, as Jacques Mallah has pointed out many times, you
<br />
must consider the entire physical system whenever you are talking
<br />
about exactly what computation is instantiated.  The parts of the
<br />
system that don't happen to interact with other parts during a
<br />
particular run are still part of the system, and thus still have an
<br />
affect on which program is actually being run.
<br />
<br />I enjoyed Maudlins discussion, on pages 413ff, of &quot;the ploy of funny
<br />
instantiation&quot;, and other arguments, including Searle's &quot;Chinese
<br />
Room&quot;.  I agree with his assessments of these arguments as basically
<br />
non-substantive.  So it's ironic (to me, anyway) that I've reached
<br />
the conclusion that his argument falls into exactly this same class.
<br />
<br />In particular, he mentions, on p. 416, a trick that can be played
<br />
when discussing a proposed computational system:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone might suggest that no activity is needed.  Let a rock
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sitting on a table be the machine.  Now let Si be:  sitting on
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the table from 12:00 to 12:01.  Let Sj be:  sitting on the table
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from 12:01 to 12:02.  The machine will effect a transition
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between the two states without undergoing any physical change at
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all.  I shall take such tricks to be inadmissable.
<br />
<br />But the trick he makes in defining Olympia is of exactly this
<br />
variety!  It doesn't go quite as far, but it is the same in that it
<br />
encodes information about a _particular run of the device_ into the
<br />
definition, or structure, of the device itself.
<br />
<br />For those who haven't read the article, here's a brief recap of the
<br />
definition of Olympia.  Olympia is a standard Turing machine with a
<br />
program and a tape.  In place of the tape, he uses troughs of water,
<br />
which can be either empty or full.  Now, the basic machine has an
<br />
infinite line of such troughs, and the mechanism will jump back and
<br />
forth among them, filling some, draining others, and leaving others
<br />
alone, in an order determined by the program.
<br />
<br />Now, in his definition of Olympia, he employs the following trick:
<br />
first, record exactly what the mechanism does on a particular run,
<br />
when presumably the conscious entity was experiencing something (say,
<br />
a toothache).  I'll call this the &quot;reference run&quot; (not a term used by
<br />
Maudlin.)  Now, reorder all of the troughs such that they are in the
<br />
same order as they were visited during the reference run.  If the
<br />
mechanism visited the same trough twice, then that trough will be
<br />
split into two troughs connected by a pipe.
<br />
<br />It should be obvious how this trick is of the same sort as the rock
<br />
trick above.  In the original machine, the order of the troughs had a
<br />
particular significance.  He has then redefined the significance of
<br />
the order of the troughs, ad hoc, to have a new significance which
<br />
relates directly to information from the reference run of the device.
<br />
<br />He then goes further, to invent a mechanism which dumbly fills,
<br />
empties, or leaves each trough alone.  Again, this mechanism is set
<br />
up according to the results of the reference run.  In affect, he has
<br />
created a simple replay device, which reproduces the reference run.
<br />
He then states that at this point, a computationalist (and most of
<br />
us) would say that the machine is no longer implementing a
<br />
computation, and could not be said to be conscious, because it
<br />
doesn't handle counterfactuals at all.
<br />
<br />Then he makes &quot;Maudlin's move&quot;.  He contrives a mechanism such that
<br />
if any of the troughs are not in the initial states that they were in
<br />
at the begining of the reference run, then an external device will
<br />
intervene and cause the counterfactual to be correctly implemented.
<br />
At this point, then, we must say that the computation is
<br />
instantiated, and that Olympia is now conscious.  We must admit, he
<br />
argues, that she is conscious even though none of the counterfactuals
<br />
ever actually occurs.  Thus, in the previous example and in this,
<br />
there existed the identical physical activity, but in that case, the
<br />
mechanism was not conscious, and this case, it is.
<br />
<br />The hole in this argument is rather glaring:  as mentioned above,
<br />
whenever considering the physical instantiation of a computation, the
<br />
complete system must be taken into account, and translated as a whole
<br />
into the computer program which is being instantiated.  The presence
<br />
or absence of parts which happen to play no role in a particular run
<br />
of the program, nevertheless can, and obviously do, change the nature
<br />
of the program itself.  The error is in assuming that identical
<br />
physical activity necessarily means that the same computation is
<br />
instantiated.
<br />
<br />Note also that his thought experiment can only be brought to this
<br />
point by contriving some mechanism which encodes the information
<br />
about a particular reference run.  It really is not a large step from
<br />
his Olympia to the rock, where we can define the states of the rock
<br />
in such a way that it implements a reference run of a consciousness.
<br />
We could then build a whole computer around this rock, which would be
<br />
responsible for implementing the computation if the inputs happened
<br />
to be anything other that those encountered during the reference run.
<br />
<br />Other examples brought up during discussion on this list have the
<br />
same flaw.  For example, Bruno's brain that breaks, and gets fed by
<br />
cosmic rays during the down-time.  When he applied Maudlin's move in
<br />
this scenario, he once again assumed a device which had, already
<br />
encoded into it, significant information about a reference run.
<br />
<br />The same argument also applies when Maudlin discusses his &quot;second
<br />
block&quot;, which causes the gears to jam if ever the counterfactual is
<br />
encountered.  Again, this changes the overall structure of the
<br />
device, and thus changes the program which is instantiated.
<br />
<br />Toward the end of Maudlin's paper, he introduces a term that I like,
<br />
&quot;dispositional&quot;:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more dispositional a property appears, the easier it is to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contend that it supervenes not only on the activities but also on
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dipositions of a system.  And, since the dispositions of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olympia are changed by the presence or absense of the second
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;block, Olympia may not threaten a computational account of these
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other properties.
<br />
<br />&quot;These other properties&quot; are, for example, intelligence and
<br />
intensionality, rather than experience.  In this sentence it seems
<br />
clear that he recognizes that by changing the &quot;disposition&quot; of the
<br />
system, he changes the program, so it's mystifying why he would argue
<br />
that it has no affect on conscious experience.
<br />
<br />I also wanted to add a thought or two about the concept of &quot;replays&quot;.
<br />
Olympia is contrived such that her default behavior will be a replay
<br />
of the reference run.  Then, with the addition of the &quot;second blocks&quot;
<br />
(which cause her gears to jam if there are any differences between
<br />
her input and the reference run) she is turned explicitly into a
<br />
replay device.  But note that there is a continuous spectrum of
<br />
possibilities between a program which can handle, say, any set of
<br />
inputs at all, and one which &quot;breaks&quot; if any but one precise input is
<br />
encountered.  There could be programs which can handle some subset of
<br />
counterfactuals, but break on others.
<br />
<br />My point is that it is meaningless to talk of whether any of these
<br />
instantiations is &quot;conscious&quot;.  As many have pointed out recently,
<br />
consciousness is a subjective phenomenon.  We can study it from the
<br />
outside, just like we can study a computer program, but the actual
<br />
conscious entity experiencing the experiences will not be sensitive
<br />
to whether the machine breaks.
<br />
<br />And one final note, which I think is the most powerful argument yet:
<br />
to make this conjecture stand, you'd have to show that physical
<br />
processes are incapable of instantiating a computation, ever.  I
<br />
don't think Maudlin attempted this.  The reason is clear:  if you
<br />
agree that consciousness is computational, and you agree that
<br />
physical processes can instantiate computations, then it follows that
<br />
physical processes can instantiate consciousnesses.  I don't know how
<br />
Maudlin would address this.  Would he say that conscious computations
<br />
are of a high enough order of complexity that they fall apart?  Just
<br />
hand-waving about a whether a particular contrived instantiation is
<br />
conscious or not cannot lead you to any conclusions about the general
<br />
case.
