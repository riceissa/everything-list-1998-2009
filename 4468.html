Dear Stephen,
<br />
<br /><br />At 10:27 -0500 16/01/2003, Stephen Paul King wrote:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as it may be, I would like to interleave some comments to your post.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
Thank you very much. What upsets me with Tim leaving the list is that
<br />
there is nothing that I appreciate more than to discuss with people who
<br />
disagrees. Apparently you are willing to play that role, so certainly
<br />
you or me will learn something (non necessarily exclusive &quot;or&quot;!) if we
<br />
pursue that correspondence deeply enough.
<br />
<br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;WARNING: Ranting and raving may occur.;-)
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
Ah? Here you are confessing that you have some emotional attachment
<br />
to some principle. It is your right of course. But don't look at me
<br />
as a defender of comp. Sure I am willing to defend that comp is interesting,
<br />
non trivial, worth scrutinizing, ... But I never pretend comp is true.
<br />
My personal relation with comp, if I may talk about it, can be described
<br />
by the bad days and the good days. The bad days I wake up believing comp
<br />
false and hoping it true, or believing comp true and hoping it false. The
<br />
good days I believe it true and I hope it true, or I believe it false and
<br />
hope it false. As you know my work could still lead to a refutation of
<br />
comp. For example if the physics which must be extracted from comp is
<br />
different from the empirical physics, this would give evidences that comp
<br />
could be wrong.
<br />
Now, about my thesis, the only thing which has been done, is an argument
<br />
(a proof) that IF comp is true THEN physics is a branch of machine psychology.
<br />
<br />The expression &quot;Machine Psychology&quot; is defined by the collection of statements
<br />
machines can correctly prove and/or infer about themselves.
<br />
<br />I recall that by definition comp is the conjunction of the following
<br />
three hypotheses:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The personal implication PI
<br />
This is the thesis that, not only I can survive with an artificial skin,
<br />
liver, kidney, but also with an artificial digital brain, once this artificial
<br />
brain is a faithful copy of my brain build from a description, done at
<br />
*some* level, of my brain. The meaning of words like &quot;survive&quot; and &quot;I&quot; are
<br />
based on some amount of &quot;grandmother&quot; psychology.
<br />
(Note that this used will be ultimately eliminated in the arithmetical
<br />
translation of the argument).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Church thesis:
<br />
All digital computer computes the same class of
<br />
computable function from N to N) N = set of natural numbers.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Arithmetical Realism.
<br />
All proposition pertaining on natural numbers
<br />
with the form Qx Qy Qz Qt Qr ... Qu P(x,y,z,t,r, ...,u) are true independently
<br />
of me. Q represents a universal or existential quantifier, and P represents a
<br />
decidable (recursive) predicate. That is, proposition like the Fermat-Wiles
<br />
theorem, or Goldbach conjecture, or Euclide's infinity of primes theorem are
<br />
either true or false, and this independently of the proposition &quot;Bruno Marchal
<br />
exists&quot;. It amounts to accept, for the sake of my argument, that 
<br />
classical logic
<br />
is correct in the realm of positive integers. Nothing more.
<br />
<br />COMP is PI+TC+AR.    PI is an hypothesis in the cognitive science. CT and AR
<br />
are hypothesis in the foundation of mathematics.
<br />
Do you believe COMP is meaningless?
<br />
<br />Now my thesis presents two things:
<br />
<br />a) An argument, based on a thought experiment, showing that COMP entails
<br />
physics is a branch of machine psychology. This is the UDA.
<br />
b) And then AUDA, the arithmetical version of UDA.
<br />
You can see AUDA as UDA without the PI! AUDA is UDA with the folk-psychological
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(or grandmother) &quot;I&quot; substituted by the Godelian self-reference. This provides
<br />
more information including the shadow of the quantum.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I, for one, DO believe that &quot;we are being dogmatical&quot;. I see a lot of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;statements of &quot;belief&quot; and very few reasoned arguments. The infamous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;arithmetical realism&quot; is one of them! I may be severely mistaken and please
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point out my errors, but this notion of &quot;arithmetical realism&quot; seems to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that &quot;counting is fundamental&quot; and yet disallows for the existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;objects&quot; that are counted. We can forget about all the other problems that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have with such appeals to &quot;Platonism&quot;, this one is the most agregious!
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
The main motivation of my work is to explain either the existence of
<br />
objects or the apparent existence of objects. So I don't postulate
<br />
their existence at the start. I am open to the idea that objects are
<br />
unconscious theoretical constructions, probably arising from very long
<br />
and deep computational histories .... If you want to maintain those
<br />
objects' existence in some absolute sense, then abandon comp, or find an
<br />
error in UDA.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     If by &quot;measurement is not something special&quot; you mean that there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nothing intrisically mysterious and unable to be represented mathematically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about the process of measurement, then I agree. I even agree with the basic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;notion that &quot;observation&quot; and &quot;simulation&quot; are one and the same, assuming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that you believe that notion...  But it is one thing to say that measurement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;= observation = simulation and another thing to limit the class of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simulations to only those that are recursively enumerable, by UDA, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;example. The &quot;pre-specifiability&quot; criterion of UTMs is, IMHO, the greatest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problem that you do not face.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
I see you have a problem with CHURCH thesis too. I will come back on this.
<br />
But let me tell you that I do NOT believe AT ALL that physical reality,
<br />
whatever it is, can be generated by a UTM. This idea is self-contradictory.
<br />
If (physical) reality can be generated by a UTM, then the invariance lemma
<br />
in the UDA (we will come back to this) forces reality to be much vaster than
<br />
what a UTM can generated. It seems paradoxical, but that follows from the
<br />
distinction between first and third person point of view. We will come later
<br />
to that, only when you tell me you understand what I mean by COMP, and that
<br />
you are willing to accept it if only for the sake of the argument.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I have a serious problem with the Kroneckerian dogma that you seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;espouse. I do not understand how you can believe that the totality of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;existence is limited to those aspects that are one to one and onto with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;TM enumerable numbers.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
You should not confuse &quot;DOGMA&quot; and hypothesis. Also, I am not Kroneckerian.
<br />
I tend to accept the whole Cantor paradise. I postulate AR, but I am neutral
<br />
about bigger form of mathematical realism. More: I believe most of math
<br />
not only can make sense for machines, but even that most of math are necessary
<br />
for the self-extending first person notion of machines. The Universal
<br />
dovetailer dovetails on the reals from a 1-person point of view, the UD even
<br />
dovetail on all element of any division algebra. This follows form the
<br />
invariance lemma. You confuse perhaps my work with Schmidhuber or Wolfram
<br />
type of approach. But they attach 1-person to 3-person in a naive way which
<br />
is just incompatible with their own comp hypothesis. See the step 11 and 13
<br />
in the UDA in 15 steps: <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html</a>

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I share you enthusiasm about Everett's paper and thinking but ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  BM: But the misunderstanding between us is perhaps deeper. Everett
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  deduced the MANY (branches, relative-alternative states, worlds,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  histories, .... call it like you want) FROM the Schroedinger Wave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Equation (SWE) + the computationalist theory of mind. Perhaps it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  is comp which trouble you (you would not be the first!).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     No, Bruno, you cannot make that claim without serious caveats. You seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to be claiming that SWE is the output of UDA and thus any and all QM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;phenomena is derived from UDA actions but do not consider mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;formal and computational complexity issues that are inherent in such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;notion. Unless I am mistaken, this is equivalent to claiming that one and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all aspects of QM can be derived or generated by a UTM. I have pointed you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to a paper that shows that this is impossible (for finite classical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machines?) and yet you ignore it!
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
Let us not confuse the UD, which is a program (existing by Church thesis)
<br />
and the UDA which is an Argument, based on the &quot;UD infinite work&quot; (UD*).
<br />
The UD has no output! it is a program which does not stop.
<br />
All what I say is that IF comp is true, then if the SWE is true (or
<br />
approximately true), then for a typical observer, which computational state
<br />
is generated (infinitely often) by the UD, SWE must appear as a stable
<br />
description of his apparent neighborhood.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     That is not so problematic in itself, but there is the &quot;small&quot; issue of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;how it is that an abstract machine, existing in Platonia and exempt from all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;limitations such as thermodynamics, can compute a simulation of a SWE that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is extremely sensitive to the order of operations - ala the non-commutivity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the canonically conjugate operators - and does not even consider the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;notion of concurrency.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
I just do not postulate the physical laws, for I show how to recover them
<br />
from comp.
<br />
<br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     You are making the same mistake that Julian Barbour is making. You are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;using the notion of a priori orderings or measures without taking into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consideration the non-enumerability and the infinite computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intractability implicit in such orderings and measures.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
I do take that into account, if only because the machine psychology
<br />
is divided into a deductive (G) and purely inductive part (G* minus G).
<br />
It is a consequence of Church thesis (as POST has discovered in the 1920!)
<br />
that the universal machine's fate is inescapably related to incompleteness,
<br />
infinite, innumerable structures, intractability, uncountable sets, etc...

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Oh, that paper that only French reading people can access? Please don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mention it until you at least post an English version of it! Please point us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to a step-by-step argument that &quot;whole quantum must follow from the comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hyp&quot;;
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
I don't stop doing that (to the point I feel often a little ashamed boring the
<br />
co-listers with that). Just look at
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html</a>
<br />
or other links to this list in my web page. I propose explicitly
<br />
a step-by-step argument. If you want we can go through it step-by-step,
<br />
I mean one-step/one-post, like the one I proposed to Joel in ten steps.
<br />
<br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I simply cannot see how this can be done given the Kochen-Specker and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Gleason theorems.
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
I suspect you have not yet well understood the difference between first
<br />
and third person point of view.
<br />
Here is what happens: you believe in a physical world. You believe that
<br />
there are empirical evidences that the physical world (which you grant)
<br />
is described by QM. Now Kochen-Specker have indeed proved that there is
<br />
no boolean map on the quantum reality.
<br />
I don't postulate a physical world, I show that with comp we must to
<br />
recover the physical world *appearances* from the logic of some
<br />
first person appearances. I do show that such logic is a sort of
<br />
quantum logic. I too can show that machine's physical world appearance is
<br />
necesarily non boolean.
<br />
The distinction between 1-views and 3-views is fundamental
<br />
to understand that comp entails the stability of indeterminacy, non-locality
<br />
non-contextuality, *and* non-booleanity from all &quot;inside view&quot; (1-view) in UD*.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     My problem is this: How can a computation be said to &quot;exist&quot; if there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no &quot;physicality&quot; to the tape and read/write head, e.g. the physical objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which the formal UTM definition refers to?
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
&nbsp;From that specific point of view, Turing's paper are not to good. In an
<br />
excess of pedagogical concern, Turing describe its machine in a rather
<br />
physicalistic way. The UTM can be seen as a purely mathematical object.
<br />
It exists in many shape including purely arithmetical one (Turing's results
<br />
depend on that!). It exists like the number 187987 exists.
<br />
I explain, or at least go toward an explanation of, the &quot;existence&quot; of atoms
<br />
big bangs and galaxies, as stable memory-pattern, in the dreams 
<br />
(1-computations)
<br />
of typical arithmetical (and immaterial) universal machines. &quot;Typical&quot; is used
<br />
in a Everett-related sense.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I still remember your idea about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;David Bohm's notions in one of your papers that seemed to say that we don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;need particles. While I agree with you in a very &quot;hair splitting&quot; way about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the unreality of particles, we cannot just dismiss physicality.
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
You cannot say I dismiss it when all I give is an argument explaining where
<br />
such physicality comes from, in case of the comp hyp is true.
<br />
I even show what no physicist (in the actual sense of the word) will ever
<br />
be able to show. Indeed I show that physicality is necessary. It's a part
<br />
of math (and even arithmetic + intensional logic for the inner views).
<br />
The physical laws are psychological laws, which are basically the mathematical
<br />
laws of correct self-references.
<br />
All the rest is geography or history, which appearance can be explained, but
<br />
which details cannot be explained.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     There is a phrase in the Caves et al paper that comes to mind:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0204157">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0204157</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;A Hilbert space gets its connection to the world we live in through the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical quantities - position, linear momentum, energy, angular momentum -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the system that is described by that Hilbert space. These physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;resources arise naturally from spacetime symmetries and the system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hamiltonian, and they are the physical resources that must be supplied to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;access various parts of the system Hilbert space.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  We might be able to make some kind of hand waving appeal to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simulability of the properties of these physical resources by a UTM ...
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
Absolutely not. If comp is true, then &quot;physical reality appearances&quot;
<br />
are not emulable by any UTMs. Physical reality appearances with all its
<br />
non-computable aspects (like indeterminacy) appears from the whole
<br />
UD*. For example we cannot program a UTM to generate a single infinite
<br />
random sequence. But we can program a UTM for generating all infinite
<br />
sequences. By the invariance lemma that set of infinite sequences
<br />
will make appear the appearances of non computable sequences in
<br />
the neighborhood of the observers, from their point of views.
<br />
Remember that with comp the mystery is the appearance of the computable, not
<br />
the appearance of the uncomputable. A priori (without Godel's
<br />
incompleteness) comp predicts uncomputable white rabbits and uncomputable
<br />
white noise. That's part of the reversal.
<br />
<br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;... and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assume that that is all we need but you seem to assume much more than you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are telling us! I go back to my earlier statement: We cannot just have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ability to count without some kind of prior existence of &quot;objects&quot; to count.
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
That is *your* postulate. But I don't postulate that, I prove it. Indeed
<br />
most immaterial machine will believe their mathematical abilities stem
<br />
from their empirical observations. But in the whole picture the couple
<br />
observer/object emerges from the immaterial relation between numbers.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We can dismiss the Heisenberg cut without to many problems but we cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hand wave the categorical distinction between subject and object (Cartesian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cut?)!

<br />
Yes we can! There are a lot of so-called materialist monist. I just show
<br />
that comp leads to immaterialist monism. A good thing given that nobody has
<br />
ever been able to just define what could be a material thing. Physicists does
<br />
not even try.
<br />
<br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Tim does not see this &quot;agnosticism&quot; and neither do I! I see a bunch of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;True Believers&quot; that are unwilling to contemplate the contradictions that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are inherent in their thinking. I was raised by missionaries and have a keen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sense of &quot;religiosity&quot; when it comes around!
</em><br />
<br /><br />The agnosticism comes from the fact that we try (at least) to put all our carts
<br />
(= the postulates, not the dogmas) on the table.
<br />
I suspect that the contradictions you see come from
<br />
the fact that you don't yet distinguish completely the 1-person and the
<br />
3-person. (like Schmidhuber or Wolfram, but unlike Tegmark, Rossler, 
<br />
Everett, etc.)
<br />
<br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     On the other hand, I totally agree that we, at least, need to understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;where we disagree&quot;. ;-)
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
That's the most important meta-point :-)
<br />
Don't hesitate to ask any questions.
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
