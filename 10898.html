<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, it follows from the idea that anything can be a computation. I think this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is trivially obvious, like saying any string of apparently random characters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is a translation of any English sentence of similar or shorter length, and if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you have the correct dictionary, you can find out what that English sentence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But that is actually quite a dubious idea. For one thing there is an objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;basis for claiming that one meaning is the &quot;real&quot; meaning, and that is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;meaning intended by the writer.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [Stathis Papaioannou] 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;There might have been a particular meaning intended by the writer, but remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;materialism: all you have really is ink on paper, and neither the ink nor the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;paper knows anything about where it came from or what it means. Suppose a stream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of gibberish is created today by the proverbial monkeys typing away randomly, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;just by chance it turns out that this makes sense as a novel in a language that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;will be used one thousand years from now. Is it correct to say that the monkeys' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;manuscript has a certain meaning today? Or is it meaningless today, but meaningful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;in a thousand years? If the latter, does it suddenly become meaningful when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;new language is defined, or when someone who understands the new language actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;reads it? What if the manuscript never comes to light, or if it comes to light and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;is read but after another thousand years every trace of the language has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;disappeared?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I don't think it makes sense to say that the manuscript has intrinsic meaning;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;rather, it has meaning in the mind of an observer. Similarly, with a computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;implemented on a computer, I don't think it makes sense to say that it has meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;except in its interaction with the environment or in the mind of an observer. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;But then, as you'v noted before, you can regard the environment+computer as a bigger 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;computer with no external interaction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;You've used this argument as a reductio absurdum against the idea that a manuscript 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;or any arbitrary object has a meaning.  Yet you seem to accept the similar argument 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;that any object implements a computation - given the right 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;dictionary/interpretation/manual&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Perhaps I have been inconsistent in my use of terms. What I meant is that any object implements 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a computation, but in a useless/trivial/meaningless way unless it interacts with an environment or is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; understood by a conscious observer. But now that I think about it, we can arbitrarily say that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; left half of the object is the computer and the right half is the environment with which it interacts - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which is again true in a useless/trivial/meaningless way. The answer would seem to be that &quot;meaning&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is not a concept that is basic to physics, but exists only in the mind of a conscious observer. That can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be an external observer or, if the computer is self-aware, itself. The same could be said of the terms 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;trivial&quot; and &quot;elegant&quot; applied to mathematical theorems: they are only meaningful to mathematicians, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not basic to mathematics.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;string of characters or any physical process can be seen as implementing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;language or a computation, if you have the right &quot;dictionary&quot;. There is a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;interesting special case of this if we allow that some computations can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;self-aware, in the absence of any environmental interaction or external observer:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;by definition, they are their own observer and thus they bootstrap themselves into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;Suppose some computation, such as what's happening in your brain, implements 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;consciousness.  How much could it be changed and still be conscious?  Could we slice 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;it up into segments and rearrange them?  How long a segment?  Is there &quot;something it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;is like&quot; to be conscious and insane?  I think if we can answer this and then limit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;our discussion to sane consciousness then some of these theoretical possibilities go 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;away.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If every computation is implemented everywhere anyway, this is equivalent to the situation where every 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computation exists as a platonic object, or every computation exists implemented on some computer or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; brain in a material multiverse. This gives rise to the issues of quantum immortality and the white rabbit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; problem, as discussed at great length in the past on this list.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; One way to discredit all this foolishness is to abandon computationalism...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see how assuming consciousness is non-computational solves any of these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conundrums about every object implementing every possible computation.  ISTM that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's acceptable to say an object implements a computation - a rock &quot;computes&quot; what a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rock does in repsonse to &quot;input&quot;, i.e. it's interaction with the environment.  The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem arises when we suppose there are &quot;meanings&quot; tha can be associated  with this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (thru dictionaries or manuals) so that it is computing something with a &quot;meaning&quot;. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we say that &quot;meaning&quot; is something we make up, and it is never in the objects 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outside our heads, not in computers and not in manuals; then the problem disappears.
</em><br />
<br />I mostly agree with what you say. Every physical object implements every computation in a trivial sense, like 
<br />
every dictionary contains every novel in a trivial sense. The interesting thing is when meaning is attached to 
<br />
words or computations by an observer, which involves picking a subset of all the words or all the computations, 
<br />
for example by extracting pure silicon from the rock, doping it with other elements, attaching conductors, etc. 
<br />
None of this is problematic - until we consider consciousness. Suppose you find a machine of alien manufacture 
<br />
which goes chugalug, chugalug when you plug it in. You find the manual, and realise by observing the details 
<br />
of its internal states that when it makes this noise, it's calculating pi. However, you realise that there is another 
<br />
possible manual, which may or may not actually exist, under the interpretation of which the device is calculating 
<br />
e. So what is it doing, calculating pi or calculating e? Perhaps the answer is both, but it isn't meanigful or 
<br />
interesting unless you have the relevant manual (most likely the manual according to which it is calculating pi 
<br />
will be simpler, but that's just a contingent fact about how engineers work). Now, what if the machine is 
<br />
implementing a self-aware computation? Again you would need the manual to observe it (and perhaps to 
<br />
communicate with it), and again you can see that if you had a different manual you might be able to observe 
<br />
a different self-aware computation. From you point of view which computation the machine implements is the 
<br />
same as the pi/e situation, meaningless unless you have the relevant manual. But from the computation's point 
<br />
of view, which manual you have or whether there is a manual at all is irrelevant: it is still *self-aware* by definition. 
<br />
So *if* there is some interpretation under which a physical system implements a conscious computation, *then* 
<br />
that conscious computation is implemented, even though it might be cut off from interacting with the world in 
<br />
which the substrate of its implementation exists. Moreover, the computation may be nested many layers up from 
<br />
the physical substrate, emulation upon emulation upon emulation, and we who believe ourselves to be grounded 
<br />
in physical reality cannot be sure that we are not actually one of these emulations, selected out because its 
<br />
isomorphism with physical reality provides the moment to moment stability required for a sane mind enduring in time.
