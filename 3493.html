<br />This may be true but I don't think utility functions should be based on
<br />
subjective experiences. Otherwise everyone would endlessly re-run
<br />
simulations of their most favorable subjective experiences. Utility
<br />
functions should be based on external reality, so you'd choose actions
<br />
based on their overall effects on the multiverse. In that case it's not
<br />
clear why we should care about each universe in proportion to its measure. 
<br />
<br />This may make more practical sense if you consider the debate between
<br />
Juergen and I about Speed vs. more dominant priors. Even if I believed
<br />
that the multiverse was instantiated by a Great Programmer running the
<br />
FAST algorithm, why should I then care about each universe in proportion
<br />
to its Speed prior instead of any other arbitrary measure that I choose?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Think of a single-universe model with ordinary probability, where you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a bet with a 90% chance of outcome A and 10% chance of outcome B.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Conventionally you should take the bet which maximizes your expectations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based on A occuring.  But you could imagine someone who only cared about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what happened if outcome B happened, and bet on B so that he would do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well in that unlikely case.  It's rational in a certain sense, but it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is going to lead to bad consequences in practice.
</em><br />
<br />I think there is a significant difference in that in the single-universe
<br />
model someone like that wouldn't survive very long and therefore evolution
<br />
would eliminate this kind of utility functions.  But in the multiverse
<br />
model, this person would continue to survive in the universes that he
<br />
cares about and actually he would do very well in those universes, whereas
<br />
you would do poorly in those universes but do well in the universes you
<br />
cared more about. So there is a symmetry between him and you that doesn't
<br />
exist in the single-universe model.
