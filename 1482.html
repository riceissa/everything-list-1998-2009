<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; this new development and the realisation would be made that their universe

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Would it?  This is a questions I've thought about some.  Would the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fundamental mechanism of the life simulation be deducible by these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; SAS's?  Perhaps the only things that would be &quot;knowable&quot; by these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; SAS's would be higher level structures, which they might interpret
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as, for example, eleven dimensional quantum mechanical strings, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; something.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I didn't say that the fundamental life simulation would be deducible by these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Life SAS's, just that they would begin to play around with the 'Life' game and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then notice a correspondence between some of the structures they were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discovering in their Life simulations and some of the structures their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particle physicists were discovering. Once such a coincidence had been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; noticed they'd be able to develop testable hypotheses that would go to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; show that their universe was a Life world, and then they'd be left with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to calculate the boundary conditions (probably impossible in their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case).
</em><br />
<br />But, what you've just described is the deduction by these Life SAS's that
<br />
they live within a fundamental life simulation!  So you've contradicted
<br />
yourself.
<br />
<br />I was trying to suggest that this deduction might be completely 
<br />
impossible to them -- that their life world might look like something
<br />
completely different, because, as I suggested, only &quot;higher level
<br />
structures&quot; might be available.  I don't know what that means,
<br />
exactly.  I'm sure there's been research on this idea -- I know 
<br />
there's a vast body of literature on the game, and I'm not knowledgable
<br />
about it at all.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But, assuming that the lowest level structure of their world is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; discernable, I would expect there to be a significant difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; between the measure of those creatures and the measure of other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; creatures - us perhaps.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know on what grounds you make that assumption but I'll go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; along with it. I'm definitely not assuming that our universe is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; game of Life.
</em><br />
<br />Right, well, I'm guessing from this response that you didn't 
<br />
understand what I was trying to say.  Mea culpa.  I explicitly
<br />
assumed that our universe is *not* a game of life, and 
<br />
then I went on to conjecture about why we don't find ourselves
<br />
in such a world.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So if we further assume that our universe is *not* a game of life,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and if the AUH is true, then by the SSA I would conclude that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probability of any SAS finding itself to be in a game of life is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probably zero.  That is, the set of SAS's inside a game of life is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of measure zero relative to the set of SAS's inside universes like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ours.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can you please define SSA for me...
</em><br />
<br />SSA = Self-Sampling Assumption.
<br />
Broadly speaking, it says, for me (it really only can be described
<br />
from a 1st person perspective) that I am a random SAS from among
<br />
the set of all SAS's.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In the bizarre nature of infinite sets, not all SAS's are in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universes like ours, but in fact the probability of being in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universe like ours is 100%.
</em><br />
<br /><br />And here I make a desperate, arm-waving leap, from the idea that
<br />
I am a random sample, to the conclusion that SAS's &quot;like me&quot; are
<br />
the most numerous.  Whatever &quot;like me&quot; might mean, I think it's
<br />
fair to guess that it wouldn't include SAS's inside a game of life,
<br />
unless you're talking about the ones generated within the UD.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't believe in infinite sets. But I'd accept a rephrasing along the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lines of &quot;the probability of being in a universe like ours is very close
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to 100%&quot;. Still like to see the reasoning though. (Or perhaps a reference).
</em><br />
<br />What does this mean, &quot;I don't believe in infinite sets?&quot;  Do you
<br />
believe in the number 42?  Do you believe in green?  Do you believe
<br />
in (pick any human)?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; More interestingly still: when are *we* going to discover some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; CA or similar which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; turns out to be *our* universe? In my lifetime I hope.
</em><br />
<br /><br />What does &quot;CA&quot; stand for??
