Jesse, I always appreciated your posts as considerate, logical and most
<br />
professional. Now I a not so sure...
<br />
Brent mixed up a bit the concepts, even stirring in interpretation into
<br />
meaning, you speak about &quot;our real world&quot; - a joke. All because both of you
<br />
are infected with a physicalistic-computerminded thinking, product of our
<br />
XX.c. aberration by too much epistemic enrichment without the necessary base
<br />
to use it properly. The old Greeks had it easy: with that minuscule
<br />
'knowledge-base' they had it was just dandy to use their pure logic - what
<br />
is tarnished in today's thinking when a preschooler knows more about the
<br />
universe than a Greek sage did. Not that I would vouch for the trueness of
<br />
our knowledge, it is &quot;interpreted&quot; perceived reality, with lots of
<br />
explanatory artifacts (figments) to match the 'equations'.
<br />
<br />Let me épater le bourgois: there is no such thing as *meaning* we put it out
<br />
by our ways of thinking. Vocabularies are not God-given(!). Loaded words are
<br />
real. Diverse meanings are context-dependent. Information is also not an
<br />
'existing thing', it is something we absorb from relations that reach our
<br />
cognizance. Context dependent again. Now what is thei mysterious context? it
<br />
is our setup in our perceived reality what we apply in a certain case. Again
<br />
our doing.
<br />
Not two minds(?) work identically in ALL respects (this caution is for
<br />
Bruno, who may (I don't know) posit that anybody (with a mathematically
<br />
inclined mind would work similarly with numbers, I amnot sure). So if you
<br />
identify a dog as a cat, it is your meaning - not mine.
<br />
<br />I agreed with Brent that meaning is based on action - I was in the mindset
<br />
of considering everything as 'action' until the question arose: what
<br />
triggers such action, what provides the necessities to it (I don't know what
<br />
to call energy) and the ways it proceeds? so what we see is what we
<br />
supposed/assumed. Is that your &quot;real world&quot;?
<br />
I THINK we are part of an existence all interconnected in ways about which
<br />
we have no idea, but explain it to the ever actual level of our epistemic
<br />
cognitive inventory. There are relations that may be viewed in diverse
<br />
aspects and the change of our views is interpreted in our physics impeded
<br />
thinking as movement, action, change, function, etc.
<br />
It is hard to separate our figments from our own thinking: we think in them.
<br />
KNOW we don't. Our perception is limited and we cannot include the totality
<br />
*(I think thinking in numbers is also only an aspect to try so).*
<br />
It is comfortable to stay within our capbilites - we are not ready to accept
<br />
that all we know is a fraction that fits our assumptions.
<br />
<br />Sorry, I am far from expressing myself clearly, and that is not only a
<br />
language problem. Human language - maybe.
<br />
<br />John M
<br />
<br />PS. My version of consciousness (universal): the course of responding to
<br />
information (that is: in the above described sense). ANY. JM

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, suppose you have an A.I. computer program that's running a robot

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that suggests humanlike intelligence, do you grant that it probably has

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness and that its statements have meaning? If so, suppose take the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same program and let it run a simulated body in a simulated world, and when

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some other simulated fellow asks it &quot;what's a cat&quot;, it now points at a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness/meaning-creation of this program changed because it's only

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taking actions in a simulated world rather than our &quot;real&quot; world?
