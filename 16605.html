<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; When I read quantum mechanics and listen to those invested in the many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; places the mathematics leads, What strikes me is the extent to which the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; starting point is mathematics. That is, the entire discussion is couched 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as if the mathematics is defining what there is, rather than a mere 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; describing what is there. I can see that the form of the mathematics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; projects a multitude of possibilities. But those invested in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; business seem to operate under the assumption - an extra belief  - about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the relationship of the mathematics to reality. It imbues the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; discussion. At least that is how it appears to me. Consider the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pragmatics of it. I, scientist X,  am in a position of adopting 02 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; possible mindsets:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Position 1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1a) The mathematics of quantum mechanics is very accurately predictive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of observed phenomena
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1b) Reality literally IS the mathematics of quantum mechanics (and by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; extension all the multitudinous alternative realities actually exist). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Therefor to discuss mathematical constructs is to speak literally of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reality. My ability to mentally manipulate mathematics therefore makes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; me a powerful lord of reality and puts me in a position of great 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; authority and clarity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know many physicist who takes this position. I guess Max Tegmark would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be one.  But most physicists seem to take the math as descriptive.  It is more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; often mathematicians who are Platonists; not I think because of ego, but because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics seems to be &quot;discovered&quot; rather than &quot;invented&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
I know that most physicists would, when asked, likely deny that their 
<br />
mathematics has been taken as real. It's more that their behaviour is 
<br />
'as if' they have, because  position2 has not been adopted and there .
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Position 2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2a) The mathematics of quantum mechanics is very accurately predictive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of observed phenomena
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2b) Reality is not the mathematics of (a). Reality is constructed of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something that merely appears/behaves quantum-mechanically to an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; observer made of whatever it is, within a universe made of it. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematics of this &quot;something&quot; is not the mathematics of kind (a).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What about the mathematics is as complete a description as we have of whatever 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; underlying reality there may be.  So we might as well, provisionally, identify 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it with the real.

<br />It's not complete and it has 01 chronic abject failure: to explain 
<br />
scientists (scientific observation). The position 1a 'laws of nature' 
<br />
presuppose the scientist and scientific observation in the sense that 
<br />
they merely 'organise appearances' in a scientist - the scientist is 
<br />
built into the laws and the explanation as to why there are any 
<br />
'appearances' at all (as delivered in brain material) goes 
<br />
unexplained... thrown away in the act of objectivity.
<br />
<br />If there's a perfectly servicable alternative (position 2), and a 
<br />
chromic problem in cognitive science, the more reasonable (in terms of 
<br />
doubt management) position 2 might be thought to be deserving more 
<br />
attention....
<br />
<br />Hmmm. Just in case there's a misunderstanding of position 2, here's 
<br />
their contrast rather more pointedly:
<br />
<br />Position 1
<br />
1a There's a mathematics which describes how the natural world behaves 
<br />
when we look.
<br />
1b Reality is literally made of the mathematics 1a. (I act as if this 
<br />
were the case)
<br />
<br />Position 2
<br />
1a There's a mathematics which describes how the natural world behaves 
<br />
when we look.
<br />
1b There's a *separate* mathematics of an underlying reality which 
<br />
operates to produce an observer who sees the reality behaving as per 1a 
<br />
maths.
<br />
1c There's the actual underlying reality, which is doubted (not claimed) 
<br />
to 'be' 1b or 1a.
<br />
<br />Position 2 is justified because when you simulate 2b it on a computer 
<br />
you can see, operating inside it, what constitutes the observation 
<br />
system of the scientist) ... it produces a scientist with a scientific 
<br />
observation system. That observation system reveals the natural world to 
<br />
be behaving 'as-if' math 1a was driving it, when in reality it is not. 
<br />
Thus the chronic problem is of position 1 behaviour is solved. Instead 
<br />
of &quot;many&quot; extra worlds... you only need 1. ... all the while MWI remains 
<br />
just as predictive.
<br />
======================
<br />
<br />I understand your position on the matter, but I wonder as to the 
<br />
psychology of it in general.
<br />
<br />Let's posit position 2 as the real epistemic option for scientists 
<br />
inside a natural world. Lets say the 'hard problem' of explaining 
<br />
scientists is solved by position 2 work in the year 2050 when simulation 
<br />
can handle 40 orders of magnitude of detail....Let's say in 2075 a 
<br />
historian is characterising the mindset of 20th century physics. What 
<br />
they describe is an entire century of unjustified self-deception 
<br />
promulgated by a kind of systemic practical religious behaviour which is 
<br />
denied, by the physicists/mathematicians, in *omission*. That is, their 
<br />
tacit subscription to position 1 is affirmed by a failure to act 
<br />
according to position 2 when the explanatory failure of position 1 has 
<br />
been in place for over 2000 years, but &quot;was well defined and broadcast 
<br />
widely in a cross-disciplinary sense, only in the last decade of the 
<br />
20th century&quot;.
<br />
<br />MWI is an example of a position 1 belief system (tacitly held because 
<br />
position 2 is not even discussed). I am fairly sure that there's going 
<br />
to be a whole pile of &quot;what were we thinking!??&quot; exclamations in the 
<br />
future.
<br />
<br />I am also fairly sure that physics and mathematics are going to have to 
<br />
change the way people are recruited. Those whose mental dexterity is (a) 
<br />
confined to abstract symbol manipulation are going to have to be more 
<br />
balanced by (b) those who's multidimensional visualisation and other 
<br />
projection/imaginative skills, who might find abstract symbolic math a 
<br />
pain in the butt.. Neither is 'best', it's just that (a) seems to 
<br />
dominate for quite understandable reaons.... I am fairly sure that the 
<br />
education tends to weed out (b)-style thinkers.. That would be my 
<br />
'diagnosis' in this little hypothetical 2075 history.
<br />
<br />food for thought.... I hope that position1 (eg MWI) thinkers (yes even 
<br />
tacitly!) have a think about what a position-2-future may write about 
<br />
you. It's a fascinating state of affairs.
<br />
<br />cheers
