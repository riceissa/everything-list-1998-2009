<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to arrive at a class of events and

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; processes that I approve of, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; classes that I disapprove of.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; decided that it was bad for me to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; suffer.  Then since by physics, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seem to be any sufficiently similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physical process, it is bad for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any of them to suffer.  (That one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; me ends up being prejudiced as regards
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; his own special skin seems to be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unfortunate legacy of evolution, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one that doesn't support much consistency.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You're looking for sense and consistency where there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isn't any. My moment of enlightenment was when I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realised the whole thing is a crazy mess. But I can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no more ignore the effects of the crazy mess on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my psychological processes than I can command my body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to grow an extra head.
</em><br />
<br />and
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But come the future, I don't really care what happens
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to my duplicates, because I can only be one person at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once (that isn't really consistent, but I can't shake
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that feeling either).
</em><br />
<br />Well, you probably still *feel* that the Earth is flat
<br />
as you walk around on it; but you *know* better.
<br />
You *could* adopt the point of view I espouse in my
<br />
first paragraph, above, and then it wouldn't be an
<br />
inconsistent mess, would it?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [It's] a matter of definition. What if tomorrow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all my memories are replaced with different memories,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps those of a made up person?
</em><br />
<br />Well, it would *definitely* be someone else, not you!
<br />
It simply definitely true that if your body woke
<br />
tomorrow with all Bush's memories, and yours were
<br />
expunged from the Earth, then you'd be dead (here).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the bricks have been replaced. Is it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same building or a different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one? Philosophers could scratch their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heads and write papers in the learned 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; journals for years to come debating this.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, the good old Ship of Theseus. IN the ship case
<br />
we know all the facts; the problem is which one we
<br />
want to call the &quot;real&quot; Ship of Theseus. As for me,
<br />
both are the Ship of Theseus in this way or that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are getting to the heart of the disagreement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here. There is *no* correct answer! You could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably come up with a definition to cover all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventualities, but even if it actually did this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistently (which I think would be very, very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficult), in the final analysis, it would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be an arbitrary one.
</em><br />
<br />Well, yes, it would be arbitrary to say whether
<br />
or not you are the same person you were ten years
<br />
ago.  Or at age 10.  But there *are* important
<br />
FACTS OF THE MATTER, in my opinion.  One fact of
<br />
the matter is that you are the same person you
<br />
were yesterday, and will be tomorrow. It's perfectly
<br />
clear that what is up for grabs is the *degree* to
<br />
which one is an earlier or a later version.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the viewpoint of physics, your duplicate across
</em><br />
the room created a moment ago much more vastly 
<br />
resembles you than the &quot;you&quot; of a month ago. Since
<br />
you are the same person that you were a month ago,
<br />
then it follows that you are the same person as
<br />
your duplicate across the room.  That it doesn't
<br />
*seem* that you are the same person is just one of
<br />
those things (like MWI itself) that physics is 
<br />
trying to tell us and that we have to just get used to.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well, I take as more inescapable the assertion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that I am the same person I was yesterday, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; will be the same person tomorrow. Further,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physics seems to grab me by the throat and FORCE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; me to accept that my duplicate across the room
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and I don't differ significantly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you mean duplicate as in identical twin?
</em><br />
<br />Not quite!  It turns out that everyone who knows them
<br />
regards identical twins as different persons. And so
<br />
regards them, I am pretty certain as different people
<br />
in a way that they were *NOT* so regard you and your
<br />
duplicate.  You and your duplicate---created yesterday,
<br />
say---would be SO SIMILAR I claim, that people would
<br />
regard you as the same person.  It seems that identical
<br />
twins always do have slightly different personalities,
<br />
and that a lot of the differences they exhibit were
<br />
created during the nine months before birth.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course, if you can't affect it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that's a reason for non-concern.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But if you could, then, I contend,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one intervenes to prevent one's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; duplicate from suffering for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; entirely *selfish* reasons.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How do I stop my duplicate from suffering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in another universe?
</em><br />
<br />Okay, you can't.  But you might be able to
<br />
save your duplicate across the room several
<br />
hours' torture at the cost of a few minutes
<br />
torture to your local version, and you should
<br />
sign up for that.  You should continue to 
<br />
sign up for that so long as you have the
<br />
will-power.
