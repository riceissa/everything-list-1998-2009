<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one of Bruno's logic machines, complicated enough to have a representation

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of itself.  We want to ask it if it is conscious.  So we have to define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness in logical terms.  That seems quite daunting.  If we allow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; room for indeterminacy in our definitions, the machine might also have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeterminacy in its estimation of whether it is conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or, imagine we meet aliens.  How do we know if they are conscious?  Or,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turning it around, how would they know if they possess what humans call
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;consciousness&quot;?  How would we describe consciousness to them, who have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very different brains and ways of information processing, such that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they can know for sure whether they are conscious in the same way that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; humans are?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question of whether someone is conscious is far more problematic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than is often supposed, given that we cannot even define consciousness!
</em><br />
<br />I think we can define it for AI systems.  We know, for example, that the Mars 
<br />
rover is conscious of its position relative to its landning point, its conscious 
<br />
of its available power, the slope of the terrain, the temperature, the wind, the 
<br />
ambient light level, which way its pointing,...  It's even aware of whether its 
<br />
programs have satisfied various checksums.  Now you may object that I'm using 
<br />
&quot;conscious&quot; and &quot;aware&quot; in a different sense than you meant - since you meant it 
<br />
to apply to humans.  But I would say that I'm using it in the sense that the 
<br />
rover acts based on these perceptions that it has, including internal 
<br />
perceptions of its own state and its goals.   And this sense applies to humans too.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I tend to think that it is simply a convenient assumption, that everyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is conscious, to avoid facing up to the overwhelming difficulties that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a true analysis of the question brings.  The mere fact that we cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; define consciousness ought to be a pretty big red flag that we should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not be making facile assumptions about who has it and who doesn't!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Or, if you say that we can in fact define consciousness, tell me how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to know which AI programs have it, and which don't?)
</em><br />
<br />If we define consciousness as have defined it for application to a Mars rover, 
<br />
then it's clear that humans and all animals are conscious, but to different 
<br />
extents.  But by my defintion something is only conscious if it is conscious of 
<br />
being an entity within a larger context and is able to act to satisfy some 
<br />
internal goals.  An AI system like the Mars rover may be much more self-aware 
<br />
than a human being in the sense that it can compare copies of its programs and 
<br />
do error correction.  I think a lot of the difficulty in trying to define 
<br />
consciousness is that we try to think of a definition that includes both the 
<br />
Mars rover's consciousness and our own internal narrative stream of thought in 
<br />
one concise definition - while they are two different kinds of consciousness. 
<br />
Our internal stream of thoughts is primarily verbal and in terms of a Mars rover 
<br />
is a kind of log-book recording things I classify as worth attending to and 
<br />
putting into at least short-term memory.  Experiments point to it being largely 
<br />
a rationalization and 'after-the-fact' relative to decision making.  It's 
<br />
probably not even the part of the program in the Mars rover that we would point 
<br />
to as 'what provides the consciousness'.
