<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Answer No.1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In Greek, `heis' means `one' numerically (masc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; `hen' means `one' in unity or essence (neut.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here the word used by John is `hen' and not `heis'. The marginal notes

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in New American Standard Bible (NASB) reads; one - (Lit.neuter) a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unity, or, one essence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If one wishes to argue that the word `hen' supports their claim for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jesus being &quot;co-equal&quot; in status with his Father, please invite his/

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her attention to the following verse:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jesus said: &quot;And the glory which Thou hast given me, I have given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to them (disciples); that they may be one, just as we are one.&quot; (John
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 17:22).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If he/she was to consider/regard/believe the Father and Jesus Christ
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be &quot;one&quot; meaning &quot;co-equal&quot; in status on the basis of John 10:30,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then that person should also be prepared to consider/regard/believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;them&quot; - the disciples of Jesus, to be &quot;co-equal&quot; in status with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Father and Jesus (&quot;just as we are one&quot;) in John 17:22. I have yet to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find a person that would be prepared to make the disciples (students)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;co-equal&quot; in status with the Father or Jesus.
</em><br />
<br />I'd say that they were better than co-equal; since they actually existed.
