<br />
Hi all,
<br />
<br />I'm writing something that touches on issues of quantum measurement (though
<br />
the main theme is  something different), and I want to be sure I'm not
<br />
saying anything wrong about this very tricky  subject.
<br />
<br />So I'm going to pose some thought-experiments to the physics experts on this
<br />
list.  I apologize if  this is slightly off-topic but I think these issues
<br />
are interesting and relevant enough that I don't  feel like I'm exploiting
<br />
the list improperly.
<br />
<br />The questions I have in mind pertain to the nature of quantum measurement in
<br />
general, but for sake  of concreteness I'm going to pose them in the context
<br />
of a particular quantum phenomenon, the  &quot;quantum eraser.&quot;
<br />
<br />Specifically, I'll refer to the quantum eraser thought experiment summarized
<br />
at
<br />
<br /><a href="http://grad.physics.sunysb.edu/~amarch/">http://grad.physics.sunysb.edu/~amarch/</a>
<br />
<br />though the same point could be made in regard to other similar (real or
<br />
gedanken) experiments.
<br />
<br />The questions I have regard the replacement of the Coincidence Counter (from
<br />
here on: CC) in the  above experiment with a more complicated apparatus.
<br />
<br />What if we replace the CC with one of the following:
<br />
<br />1) a carefully sealed, exquisitely well insulated box with a printer inside
<br />
it.  The printer is  hooked up so that it prints, on paper, an exact record
<br />
of everything that comes into the CC.  Then,  to &quot;erase&quot; the printed record,
<br />
the whole box is melted, or annihilated using nuclear explosives, or
<br />
whatever.
<br />
<br />2) the same as 1, except the box has a person (let's call him Fred) inside
<br />
who reads the printout.
<br />
<br />3) a printer that is not encapsulated in a box.  There is a person (Fred)
<br />
standing near the printer  who, when he takes each sheet of paper out of the
<br />
printer, puts it in an envelope and seals the  envelope, but without ever
<br />
looking at the paper.  Then, to erase the printed record, the envelopes  are
<br />
burned, or nuclearly annihilated, or whatever.
<br />
<br />4) the same as 3, except that Fred looks at each sheet of paper before
<br />
putting it in the envelope.  But Fred never communicates anything about what
<br />
he sees to Bob, who is the guy looking at the screen  to see if there's a
<br />
wavelike or particlelike output pattern on it.  The erasure occurs by
<br />
annihilating both Fred and the envelopes.
<br />
<br />5) the same as 4, except that Fred and Bob are not individual people but the
<br />
two brain-lobes of a  person who has experienced a severance of the corpus
<br />
callosum.  Thus Fred cannot communicate  information to Bob even though they
<br />
are &quot;in the same head.&quot;   (OK, this one is proposed purely for
<br />
entertainment value ;)
<br />
<br />6) one can redo the experiments with Fred using a pigeon instead of a human,
<br />
where the printer is  replaced by an apparatus that flashes colored
<br />
rectangles on a touch screen, and the animal is  encouraged to pay attention
<br />
to the screen by being forced to touch the rectangles to get food.
<br />
<br />What will the outcome be in these experiments?
<br />
<br />Has anyone performed experiments like these?  (1, 3 and 6 are the onIes that
<br />
could be humanely  carried out, obviously.)
<br />
<br />My own understanding is that whether Fred, a pigeon or a printer is involved
<br />
in the experiment  should be basically irrelevant.  That is, I don't think
<br />
&quot;registration in consciousness&quot; (whatever  that means) is the important
<br />
thing, but rather registration in the sense of &quot;statistical correlation
<br />
with some macroscopic system effectively obeying classical probability
<br />
theory.&quot;  However, I realize  that not everyone agrees with me on this; my
<br />
reading of Penrose, for instance, is that he would  predict a different
<br />
outcome for 2 versus 1, because he believes that Fred's brain (via
<br />
unspecified  quantum gravity related effects) does something special to
<br />
collapse the wave function, which the  printer does not.
<br />
<br />Furthermore, my own understanding is that, so long as
<br />
<br />a) the information from the CC is not statistically correlated with the
<br />
observer (Bob) who is  observing the screen, prior to its &quot;erasure,&quot; and
<br />
<br />b) the erasure is complete, i.e. there is really no way to reconstruct the
<br />
information after the  erasure is carried out
<br />
<br />then the situation should be just like in the original quantum eraser
<br />
experiment.
<br />
<br />Regarding a, note that statistical correlation is transitive to a
<br />
significant degree, so that if the  information from the CC is correlated
<br />
with some entity Y (such as Fred, or a printer) that is in  turn correlated
<br />
with Bob, then this means the information from the CC is correlated with
<br />
Bob.
<br />
<br />The main open question I see regarding this &quot;statistical correlation&quot;
<br />
interpretation is whether it's  really possible to adequately annihilate a
<br />
macroscopic entity like Fred or a printer, and whether  it's really possible
<br />
to adequately isolate two macroscopic entities (like Bob vs. the printer or
<br />
Bob  vs. the envelope or Bob vs. Fred). One could argue that there will
<br />
always be subtle correlations  between Bob and these  other things (since
<br />
e.g. both Bob and Fred almost surely contain atoms that  once belonged to
<br />
George Washington), and that these subtle correlations mean that in all
<br />
these  scenarios there actually is some statistical correlation between the
<br />
screen and the contents of the  CC, via transitive correlations such as
<br />
<br />CC --&gt; printer --&gt; George Washington --&gt; Bob --&gt; screen
<br />
<br />I don't like this argument because it seems to me that these correlations
<br />
should be too small to  make any difference, but I recognize it as an
<br />
apparent mathematical loophole, according to which my  variant scenarios may
<br />
be considered as different from the original quantum eraser experiment.
<br />
<br />Comments?
