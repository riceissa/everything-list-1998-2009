Russell Standish writes, regarding <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0607227">http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0607227</a> :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for giving a digested explanation of the argument. This paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was discussed briefly on A-Void a few weeks ago, but I must admit to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not following the argument too well, nor RTFA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My comment on the observer moment issue, is that in a Multiverse, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure of older observer moments is less that younger ones. After a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain point in time, the measure probably decreases exponentially or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; faster, so there will be a mean observer moment age.
</em><br />
<br />I had a similar thought. I am curious to know your reasoning or
<br />
justification for why this should be true.
<br />
<br />I have not read the papers referenced by this one, but the authors allude
<br />
to previous work: &quot;Given some a priori distribution of the values of
<br />
the fundamental constants across the ensemble, the probability for a
<br />
'typical' obserer to measure a certain value of one or more of these
<br />
constants is usually taken to be proportional to the number of observers
<br />
(or the number of observers per baryon).&quot;
<br />
<br />It is this last parenthetical comment I found interesting.  Apparently
<br />
there has been a difference in previous work about whether the measure
<br />
should be proportional to observers vs observers per baryon.  Consider
<br />
two cases: one observer in a universe of a given size, or one observer
<br />
in a universe twice that big.  These would be considered the same by a
<br />
number-of-observers measure, but the first would have twice the measure
<br />
if it was observers per baryon.
<br />
<br />I argued some time past, based on some hand-wavey arguments, that the
<br />
latter measure is better - we attribute a portion of a universe's measure
<br />
to an observer, proportional to the fraction of the universe that the
<br />
observer takes up.  This came from the UDASSA concept I was describing
<br />
in detail last year.  It amounts to the observers-per-baryon measure.
<br />
It's interesting that physicists have considered a similar idea.
<br />
<br />In terms of time, like Russell I would say that ancient observer-moments
<br />
should get less measure than early ones, for the same basic reason -
<br />
it takes more information to specify the location of the &quot;physical&quot;
<br />
system that instantiates the OM within the universe.  My reasoning
<br />
though would imply that measure should be inversely proportional to
<br />
age, rather than Russell's suggestion of an exponential decay.  So I am
<br />
curious where he got that.  I could describe my reasoning in more detail
<br />
if there is interest.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So contra all these old OMs dominating the calculation, and giving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rise to an expected value of Lambda close to zero, we should expect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only a finite contribution, leading to an expected finite value of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lambda.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We don't know what the mean age for an observer moment should be, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presumably one could argue anthropically that is around 10^{10}
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years. What does this give for an expected value of Lambda?
</em><br />
<br />I don't know if I know enough physics to figure that out.  I'll take
<br />
another look at the paper.
<br />
<br />I see that I misstated the reason why the CC limits observation.
<br />
It's not that the universe becomes uninhabitable.  Rather, computation
<br />
and observation is assumed to be proportional to internal energy divided
<br />
by external universe temperature.  It turns out that the optimal strategy
<br />
is to accumulate and store up as much energy as you can, as the universe
<br />
expands and cools.  Then, when the universe is all cooled down, you go
<br />
ahead and do all your observations and calculations.
<br />
<br />In a universe with a high CC, you can't accumulate as much energy,
<br />
because it expands more quickly and hence mass-energy thins out faster.
<br />
It cools down sooner and you don't have as much stored up at that time,
<br />
so you can't do as much.
<br />
<br />So what we would have to say is that that strategy is no longer optimal
<br />
because such distant observer-moments will have low measure, and we care
<br />
more about OMs which have high measure.  (I admit that few people take
<br />
the idea seriously that seemingly undetectable OM measure changes should
<br />
matter, but I can assume that this is a super-advanced civilization and
<br />
everyone is smart, so of course they will agree with me!)
<br />
<br />Instead, the optimal strategy maximizes the total measure of OM-
<br />
computations, and that requires doing more computations early.  OTOH,
<br />
it is more efficient to wait until the universe is cooler, we can do more
<br />
computing with the same amount of energy.  Maximizing the product of these
<br />
two effects would require a detailed model for how quickly measure decays
<br />
with time.  (We'd also have to consider whether measure should change with
<br />
temperature, which it might in my model, I have to think about it more.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course their argument does sound plausible for a single universe -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is this observational evidence in favour of a Multiverse?
</em><br />
<br />I think what you're saying is that if this is the only universe, and if
<br />
civilizations adopt the strategies advocated in this paper, then most
<br />
OMs will be far in the future, hence by the ASSA we are unlikely to be
<br />
experiencing present-day OMs.  This was the basic concept of a paper we
<br />
discussed back in 2002:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dyson, L., Kleban, M. &amp; Susskind, L. Disturbing implications of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cosmological constant. Preprint &lt;<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0208013">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0208013</a>&gt;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (2002). 
</em><br />
<br />They used a slightly different physics model but came up with the same
<br />
idea, that most OMs should be in the distant future, contradicting what
<br />
we call the ASSA, which I think they just considered an implication of
<br />
the anthropic principle.
<br />
<br />You might be right that these papers could be read as an argument
<br />
against a single-universe model, if in fact we could come up with a
<br />
good justification within a multiverse model for decreasing OM measure
<br />
in the future.  We'd probably have to have a pretty strong argument
<br />
in that regard, though.
