<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a recording. Instead of the wires + recording we could say that there is a special

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; group of neurons with spontaneous activity that stimulates the rest of the brain

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; just as if it were receiving input from the environment. Such a brain would have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; no ability to interact with the environment, unless the effort were made to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; figure out its internal code and then manufacture sense organs for it - but I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; think that would be stretching the definition of &quot;potential interaction&quot;. In any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; case, I don't see how &quot;potential interaction&quot; could make a difference. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet you had to refer to &quot;stimulate...as if it were receiving input from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment&quot; to create an example.  If there were no potential interaction 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there could be no &quot;as if&quot;.  So istm that the potential interaction can be an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; essential part of the definition.  That's not to say that such a definition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is right - definitions aren't right or wrong - but it's a definition that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes a useful distinction that comports with our common sense.
</em><br />
<br />It's very difficult to define &quot;potential interaction&quot;. With even a completely solipsistic 
<br />
computer we could imagine taking readings at various points in the circuit with an 
<br />
oscilloscope and/or changing circuit voltages, capacitance, resistance etc. Is the 
<br />
fact that we *could* do this enough to make the computer conscious? Or would it 
<br />
only be conscious if we had access to its design specifications, so that we could in 
<br />
principle communicate with it meaningfully rather than just making random changes? 
<br />
What if the human race died out but the computer continued to function, with no 
<br />
hope that anyone might ever talk to it? What if the computer had very complex 
<br />
(putatively) conscious thoughts, but rather simple input and output, eg. it beeps 
<br />
when the counts from a connected geiger counter matches the number it happens 
<br />
to be thinking of at the time: would that be enough to make it conscious or does the 
<br />
environmental interaction have to match or reflect (or potentially so) the complexity 
<br />
of its internal thoughts?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;If you had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; two brains sitting in the dark, identical in anatomy and electrical activity except 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that one has its optic nerves cut, will one brain be conscious and the other not?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where did the brains come from?  Since they had optic nerves can we suppose 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they had the potential to see photons and they still have this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; potential given replacement optic nerves?  Not necessarily.  Suppose one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; came from a cat that was raised in complete darkness.  We know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experimentally that this cat can't see...even when there is light.  The lack 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of stimulus results in the brain not forming the necessary structures for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpreting signals from the retina.  Now suppose it were raised with no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stimulus whatever, even in utero.  I conjecture that it would not &quot;think&quot; at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all - although there would be &quot;computation&quot;, i.e. neurons firing in some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order.  But it would no longer have the potential for interaction; even with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its own body.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, the cat would be missing essential brain structures so it would not be 
<br />
conscious of light even if you somehow gave it eyes and optic nerves. But I think 
<br />
this makes the point that perception/consciousness does not occur in the environment 
<br />
but in the brain. If you have the right environmental inputs but the wrong brain, 
<br />
there is no perception, whereas if you have the right brain with the neurons firing 
<br />
in the right way, but in the absence of the right environmental inputs, the result is 
<br />
a hallucination indistinguishable from reality.
