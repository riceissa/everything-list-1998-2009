<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Georges,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is to your reflections to my remarks. It starts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to look like a private discussion on-list,
</em><br />
<br />Not completely. And some may also follow the discussion
<br />
an find it interesting even if they do not participate
<br />
(as I often do for other threads).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I love it.
</em><br />
<br />So do I.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are not on 'opposite' sides, just think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differently.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or just express ourselves differently. - 
</em><br />
<br />Does such a distinction really make sense ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Reductionist thinking is the way the human mind CAN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function at our present level. To select portions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the wholeness as our 'topics' and regard them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separately. Where I turn negative about it is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; habit of science (and other human thinking as well) to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; draw universal conclusions from details learned within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such models - extending it to the domains BEYOND such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is eg. how geocentric 'findings' were extended
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into the stellar movements in Ptolemistic views, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bio-physiologic 'findings' are substituted for mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events and their ORIGINATION. Or the physicalization
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of nonphysical sciences. Etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find reductionist exploration/science successful in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learning about the 'world' for constructing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technology. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theoretically, however, I like to 'TRY' to consider 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;wholeness&quot; (which I do not identify as TOE or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hal's everything. I simply cannot identify it as of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; today, which does not induce me to accept an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identification I disagree with. Like: omnipotens
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; math.]
</em><br />
<br />I agree with Bruno that reductionism is not equivalent to
<br />
the idea that our universe has a mathematical structure
<br />
or is (isomorphic to) a mathematical object. I do not try
<br />
to promote reductionism and have no interest in that.
<br />
The view I presented (and that I am not selling either)
<br />
is quite strongly related to the approach however because
<br />
it reduces phenomenology to biology, biology to chemistry,
<br />
chemistry to physics, physics to mathematics and finaly,
<br />
mathematics to necessity. Indeed this is speculation or
<br />
conjecture at every level. I say that this is a possible
<br />
way of thinking and just that: a *possible* way. I do not
<br />
intend to exclude any other ways of thinking even if I do
<br />
not feel able to understand them. I do not feel it very
<br />
satisfactory from many respects (including social). I did
<br />
not find any better way but that does not mean to me that
<br />
this is the right one and even a good one. I am still
<br />
agnostic form this point of view. Fortunately my everyday
<br />
life does not depend at all on what should be the issue.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You are free to rely on whatever you want. However, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; seems that we have no choice about the world we live in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Of course we have: you choose one eplanatory way I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another. We both assume and hypothesize. Speculate. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then the bullies argue that only THEIR ideas are true.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What do they do: select a (reductionist) model of ways
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to think (like: mathematical ways) and stone those who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like another way better. ]
</em><br />
<br />We may have some choice about the way we think the world
<br />
(not so much however as I see things) but I meant that
<br />
we have no choice about how this world actually is.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (((GQ))):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would say that we discovered them. The argument (a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; weak one I concede) is that we did not have so much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; freedom while doing so. We find and proved that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Fermat's conjecture was true and we *could not* find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that is was false. This constraint is intemporal and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it exists whether there are men or not and even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whether there is something or not (but there cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be nothing because there is least this constraint).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The set of such constraints is likely to include or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; define that natural numbers themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Good game with our 'discovery'. WE paly it according
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the level we can think in. I consider that there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are other levels, too, different from OUR mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic because the totality is unrestricted. So we may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have an explanation WITHIN math, but there MAY BE (in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hal's &quot;all possible cases&quot;) other types as well and if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we close our minds before 'other ways', we incarcerate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ourselves into our today's stupidity.
</em><br />
<br />There might be, yes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Don't ask me about those &quot;other ways&quot;: I am not (YET?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;G&gt;) omniscient. 
</em><br />
<br />Not even an idea about how such speculation could help?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (((GQ))):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not only natural numbers but also real numbers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hilbert spaces and all the &quot;higher level objects&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that &quot;comes with&quot;. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; As you said above: &quot;this is speculation indeed&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Hilbert spaces make me genuflect. Did not Hilbert
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; himself revoke his teachings when he became old?]
</em><br />
<br />I did not heard about this revokation. What I was
<br />
taught about them made sense to me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (((GQ))):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Indeed, I identified at least four speculations on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which the explanation rely upon. I don't see for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; any of them any way to rationally make an opinion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I did not find for any of them any decisive argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for or against and I can't even imagine on what such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; an argument could rely upon (indeed, common sense is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; excluded). Furthermore, it happens that many people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sharing the same biology and even the same culture
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have very different opinions about them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [You see? we are not identically designed machines.]
</em><br />
<br />I should have said &quot;roughly sharing the same ...&quot;.
<br />
This variety of opinions is puzzling however.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's also consider the possibility that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; universe in which we live strictly follows some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;mathematical rules&quot; and that it is completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; determined by them (this is another speculation).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [That is a conjecture based on the 2006 limited level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of our epistemic enrichment. We will become smarter in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time and will know more, better. There were pretty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; firm notions about how the 'universe' (world?) works
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before and after Copernicus, and they all changed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do you assume our present level as the perfect and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; omniscient 'total' wisdom achievable at all?]
</em><br />
<br />I do not assume such a thing. We do not exactly know
<br />
which mathematical rules our universe actually follows
<br />
(if it follows any indeed) and the set of laws we have
<br />
identified has changed many times yet. The speculation
<br />
here is not about the exact set of rules but about their
<br />
existence. We do not even need to refer to rules. The
<br />
relevant speculation is that the universe is (isomorphic
<br />
to) a mathematical object. The exact nature of this
<br />
object is not relevant. Once again we are considering
<br />
speculations or conjectures. These might be true or
<br />
false (or even be nonsense). My point is that *if* these
<br />
conjectures are correct *then* we have an explanation
<br />
about existence. Of course, the explanation can be
<br />
considered as an acceptable one only by people willing
<br />
to accept these conjectures.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [morphology is one way to represent things. Isomorphic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a match WITHIN THIS ONE PLANE of view. Try another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - call it 'dimensiom? - and your isomorphic will be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No-Match different pair. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I always remember Mr Square from Abbott's Flatland,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 2D guy. He was sent to the nuthouse by his 2D
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people because hi considered and spoke about a 3rd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimension.
</em><br />
<br />Agreed. Morphology might not be all we can think with.
<br />
Now, how the idea of the possilility of something else
<br />
can help?
<br />
<br />Georges.
