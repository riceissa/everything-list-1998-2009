Hi John,
<br />
<br />I comment you two last posts. It all begins by a slight  
<br />
misunderstanding to end with deep agreement (except perhaps on Plato,  
<br />
and the simplicity of the totality &quot;seen from outside&quot;, if that makes  
<br />
sense).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Bruno, this is my reply to your &quot;SeventhStep-2&quot; post.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Still not clear; Axiom 1 says I is 'a' number, - OK.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Axiom 2 sais &quot;x&quot; which I understand is general for &quot;any&quot; number.  So  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; xI is not different from II. The example: (say) I is 2, x=3, xI=32  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and your 'II' is not 'a' number, but two numbers (definitely NOT by  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axiom 2, rather by axiom 1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I did not see 'axiom 3' acording to which III or IIII would be 'a'  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number (any). They would be e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 593 or 4983 (or even 666 and 2222).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am still missing the definitions of the digits. Not enough  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuition?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />The goal was to define the following object I II III IIII ..., and  
<br />
illustrating the difficulty to define the &quot;...&quot;. No digits appear here.
<br />
<br />The axiom 2 says that if x is a number, then the result of the  
<br />
concatenation of x with I is a number too.
<br />
But x, for being used to find or build a new number, needs to be  
<br />
already a number. Only axiom 1 gives a number, indeed I, for free at  
<br />
the start.
<br />
<br />By axiom 1, I is a number. By axiom 2 if x is number, like I, then the  
<br />
result of concatenation of x with I, i.e. II, is again a number.
<br />
By axiom 2 again, we have that III is a number. Indeed it is the  
<br />
concatenation of II, which we have already as number at the preceding  
<br />
step, with I.
<br />
And thus III is a number.
<br />
And then IIII, by axiom 2, again.
<br />
And the IIIII, by axiom 2 again.
<br />
etc.
<br />
<br />The problem now is that the &quot;etc&quot; is fuzzy. In particular should we  
<br />
consider the infinite expression IIII... as a number. It follows by a  
<br />
*number* of application of the axiom 2. To avoid it we could stipulate  
<br />
that the axiom 2 should be applied a finite number of times. But  
<br />
&quot;finite number&quot; is what we tried to define with the axioms 1 and 2 to  
<br />
begin with. The point is that we cannot define &quot;...&quot;
<br />
&quot;...&quot; is already a little god that the mathematician have to invoke  
<br />
(under the form of an axiom in a set theory, for example; but this  
<br />
will fundamentally described the dynamic of the symbols.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My question to the von Neumann (an older school- mate from my  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; highschool) notation:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The generation of the universe of numbers proceed in stages,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beginning with an empty universe...&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; WHO generates?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
You. Or some machine, easy to build, or program. Using the dynamic of  
<br />
the machine to implement the &quot;...&quot; in some local way.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and HOW?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
That is what I (try) to explain.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; especially an EMPTY one (whatever an empty universe may be? does  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'it' have borders? (nonexitent ones, because it is empty), or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; volume? measures? space? that all in emptiness?{}
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />No. It is just the set having no element. It is mathematical set. In  
<br />
modern math, all the notion of border, volume, measure, space are  
<br />
defined or represented in term of sets. More modern approach use  
<br />
function as primitive, or categories. But set are still used  
<br />
implicitly by most mathematicians as a foundation, if only in the  
<br />
background.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ((your didactic epic is impressive).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do you have a zero within the 1? To make it '2',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
That is the cute feature of this set representation of the numbers,  
<br />
and indeed of all ordinals. Each number or ordinal *is* the set of all  
<br />
those numbers (ordinals) which are little than itself.
<br />
<br />0 = { }
<br />
1 = {{ }} = {0}
<br />
2 = {{ }, {{ }}} = {0, 1}
<br />
3 = {{ } {{ }} {{ }, {{ }}}} = {0, 1, 2}
<br />
...
<br />
omega = {{ }, {{ }}, {{ }, {{ }}}, {{ } {{ }} {{ }, {{ }}}}, ...} =  
<br />
{0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
<br />
omega+1 = {{ }, {{ }}, {{ }, {{ }}}, {{ } {{ }} {{ }, {{ }}}}, ... 
<br />
{{ }, {{ }}, {{ }, {{ }}}, {{ } {{ }} {{ }, {{ }}}}, ...}} = {0, 1, 2,  
<br />
3, ... omega}
<br />
...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  {{ },{{ }}} if 2 equals {0, 1} still empty sets? Or now you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitute for the inside unexplained digits?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your #3 is indeed {0,1,2} (took some reconsidering) and I really  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appreciate that you did not go all the way of the 7 days of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Creation). Thanks. However I plead guilty not to have gone through  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the 'omegas'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess that (*) means multiplication and (^) power. These have no  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explained meaning in the preceeding sets.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Epsilon is noted generally as something tiny, e.g. Paul Erdos called  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; little children 'little epsilons', (it became an accepted entry in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Webster's dictionary).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where did 'ordinals' come from?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Georg Cantor. The discoverer of the fact that an infinite can hide  
<br />
other infinities.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Still no connection with 'a' universe. Where did THIS enter? besides  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in my 'narrative' (not theory) there are innumerable and quite  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different 'universes' as being 'fulgurated' (appear and vanish) from  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Plenitude. We know only about THIS one.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure I can figure out what you are talking about, here. When  
<br />
I talk on the &quot;universe&quot; of numbers, I am using the term &quot;universe&quot; in  
<br />
the most vague sense as possible. It could mean {0, 1, 2, 3 ... } as  
<br />
it could mean all possible numbers, and even everything, according to  
<br />
the context. Sorry if I have not been clear.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I gave a 'way' for their appearance and demise, no unexplained  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'behavior' or 'activity' involved.
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One final adition: I have the feeling that 'your' universe is still  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an empty set what jibes well with the illusionary 'physical world'  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with matter imagined, that in the final analysis does not contain  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything 'matterly' (why QM calls the partitioned 'energy' (also a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningless name) as &quot;particles&quot;). All the rest is figment, base it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on fictional numbers or else. And indeed, 'computation' requires a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; factor that computes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So far I still have my questions. Sorry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I was just trying to give you another question: what do we mean by  
<br />
&quot;...&quot;.  And I was illustrating we just can't do it.
<br />
<br />At the same time I was illustrating the notion of recursive  
<br />
definition. I did already such a thing on the list when I define the  
<br />
combinators (or their syntax).
<br />
<br />I said
<br />
<br />Axiom 1 K is a combinator
<br />
Axiom 2 S is a combinator
<br />
Axiom 3, if x is a combinator, and y is a combinator, then (x y) is a  
<br />
combinator.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From this you can already build all combinators: they are K, S, (K  
<br />
K), (K S), (S K), (S S), (K (K K)), (K (K S)), (K (S K)), (K (S S)),  
<br />
((K K) K), ...
<br />
<br />(And then you have already a full &quot;programming language&quot; or &quot;universal  
<br />
machine&quot; with two little computation rules, which you can find here,  
<br />
in those links to my combinatory posts to the everything list:
<br />

<br />
<br /><br />Let me comment your next post here:

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Initial remark:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I like Gunther's parenthetical condition of arithmetic consistency -  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which I find not assured in DIFFERENT universes.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Formally, the Löbian machine agrees, perhaps serendipitously, with  
<br />
you. It is the godelian consistency of inconsistency. For each Lobian  
<br />
machines, there are mathematical universes, making true the axiom of  
<br />
arithmetic, or the specification of the machine, in which there exist  
<br />
&quot;proofs&quot; that there are inconsistent. I put &quot;proof&quot; in quote, because  
<br />
those &quot;proof&quot; are different from the usual one (based on our  
<br />
incommunicable intuition of what we mean by &quot;finite&quot;, again).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I said axioms (2+2=4) are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in my opinion thought - conditions to make one's theory workable and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so they are  conditioned by the circumstances.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />&quot;2+2 = 4&quot; is true in all those (quite different) mathematical  
<br />
structures. I don't see how &quot;2+2 = 4&quot; could depend on circumstances. I  
<br />
guess you are interpreting &quot;2+2 = 4&quot; as something else. You are not  
<br />
referring to the natural numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; *
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I try to add is the 'mind-body' problem. While I have no  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition for &quot;mind&quot;,
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Assuming digital mechanism in cognitive science, there is a simple  
<br />
definition of mind: the object study of computer science. You can then  
<br />
define theology by the gap between computer science and computer's  
<br />
computer science.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; we 'all' think to know what it means: a non-material mentality which  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; encompasses the tool's (brain(function)) genetic built differences -  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i.e. enhanced  or reduced ease of connectivity-building in select  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topical domains - plus the sum of previous experience helping one's  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal interpretation (and maybe more) including one's faith in a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;soul&quot; as well,
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; while the 'body' is the formulation of a figment in the 'physical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world' upon phenomena that are (mis/poorly) understood when received  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and both are parts of the complexity of us.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Nice. OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I cannot figure a 'separation' of substantial parts of a complexity  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without destruction of the complexity in its entirety, so a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;transport&quot; can be only the entire complexity - or none.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I follow that intuition. Lobian machine too, of course proVably only  
<br />
in a technical sense.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Aristotle had it easy with his simple cognitive level of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'physical world' so there was an easy possibility of thinking  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separately about the physical body and the rest of it not fitting  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into such.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It was an ingenious methodological assumption which has made possible  
<br />
many discoveries. But it is a metaphysical trap which could lead to  
<br />
the elimination of person in theory, if not in practice. OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In brief: I se no 'mind-body' problem, only when we try the ancient  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I may say: obsolete) ways of separating the 'physical world  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; figment' from the total (complexity).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Plato didn't commit *that* error! nor Plotinus, nor any rationalist  
<br />
mystics, from East, or West, or North, or South.
<br />
Also the total can be simple (it is the main agreed assumption of the  
<br />
&quot;everything&quot; idea), and complexity appears from inside the totality.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ((you promised an explanatory post to my askings - I am in a hurry  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to write down these remarks, because MAYBE after your explanations  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these would not make sense&lt;G&gt;))
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Too late :)
