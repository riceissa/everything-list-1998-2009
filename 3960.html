<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In Sequence One, the two urns are filled with stones of mixed color at the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;start of the film. As the main transfers stones, the number of black and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;white stones in each of the urns fluctuates, but there are never, in this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;particular film, any excursions outside the ratio 450 of one color to 550 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In Sequence Two, the the film begins rolling with one urn filled with white 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stones and the other urn filled with black stones. The man reaches in, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;takes a white stone, transfers it to the other urn. He reaches in, takes a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;black stone, transfers it to the first urn. As the film progresses, the two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;urns eventually reach a state where each has about 250 white stones and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about 250 black stones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The group is told that one of the films is presented in correct

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chronological order while the other is presented in reverse chronological

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;order.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The group is told that bets will be taken on which is which. Oddsmakers are

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;standing by. A terminal linked to the Idea Futures Market is available.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(The Barbourian jumps up and yells &quot;There is no time! All events happen at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the same time!&quot; The organizer says &quot;Fine, but I'm still taking bets. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Barbourian sits down.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Which way would you bet? And what do think oddsmakers would make odds?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Not surprisingly, nearly everyone will bet that Sequence Two was shown in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;correct chronological order and that Sequence One, if one of the two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sequences was shown in reverse chronological order, must have been the one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that was reversed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(The Quibbler points out that Sequence One could easily be shown in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chronological order, just either a long time after the mixing started or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;starting with an initially mixed set. &quot;Sure,&quot; the organizer points out, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;but I told you one was in correct order, one was reversed, so place your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bets.&quot;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now the urn example is one that does not use the &quot;molecular chaos&quot; that Huw 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Price is so critical of in &quot;gas mixing&quot; examples, arguing that &quot;molecular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chaos&quot; is assuming the conclusion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here we have a simple, discrete, mixing problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is urn mixing &quot;reversible&quot;? Sure, though very, very unlikely. Unless the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;man doing the blind mixing (not looking at the color, or unable to see the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;color, etc.), the odds of a reversal back to the original 500 white/500 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;black configuration is a simple matter of odds calcualations--on the order 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of 2^(-500).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now the Priceian would argue, from what I have read of his book, that while 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;he agrees that nearly all people would correctly bet which of the films was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time reversed and which was not, that they are missing the point, that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;real issue is how the urns came to have 500 white balls in one urn and 500 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;black balls in the other urn in the first place.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Feh. This crotchet, this hangup, is one of the main reasons I can't get 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;overly excited by Huw Price's analysis of time.
</em><br />
<br />It's true that if one just wants to study the physics of how the world works 
<br />
now one can just take for granted a low-entropy initial singularity and not 
<br />
worry about why. But I think if one wants a complete cosmological theory 
<br />
that's a pretty big issue you'll want to explain. It all depends on your 
<br />
point of view.
<br />
<br />I agree that Huw Price would say the real issue in your scenario is how you 
<br />
got the balls segregated in the first place. If his point of view is 
<br />
correct, the only reason you see it as &quot;natural&quot; is because you are used to 
<br />
living in a universe with low-entropy initial conditions which allows for 
<br />
the existence of things like intelligent beings who are able to set up such 
<br />
ordered initial conditions. Consider a variation on this--say the video 
<br />
features two types of molecules instead of two types of balls, and instead 
<br />
of urns we're just dividing the screen into two halves and looking at how 
<br />
many of each type appear on each side. Again, if the video was shot in our 
<br />
universe then we'd expect the scenario with molecules starting out perfectly 
<br />
segregated and then gradually mixing as they bounce around must be the one 
<br />
shown normally while the one where they start about equally mixed and end 
<br />
about equally mixed was shown in reverse. But suppose we then find out the 
<br />
video was taken from a parallel universe which was in a state of maximum 
<br />
entropy, with no low-entropy initial conditions. In that case, there'd be no 
<br />
way to tell which video was shot in reverse; either way, the video showing 
<br />
the molecules &quot;starting&quot; segregated would represent a statistically unlikely 
<br />
fluctuation in entropy. Or what if the video was taken from a parallel 
<br />
universe which we knew had a *future* low-entropy boundary condition, but no 
<br />
such boundary condition in the past--then we'd bet that the video showing 
<br />
the molecules going from segregated to mixed was actually the one shot in 
<br />
reverse! A priori there is no reason why a universe with a future 
<br />
low-entropy boundary condition should seem any more or less weird to us then 
<br />
one with a past low-entropy boundary condition; for now we are equally 
<br />
clueless about how to explain either one in terms of known principles of 
<br />
physics.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And I certainly don't draw the same conclusions he draws about how the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;initial low entropy state of such systems must come from Poincare/Boltzmann 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;recurrences.
</em><br />
<br />If I remember correctly Price did *not* suggest low-entropy initial 
<br />
conditions could be explained by Poincare recurrence--in fact I think he 
<br />
raised the exact same objection to this possibility that you did, pointing 
<br />
out that the anthropic principle would only guarantee the minimum entropy 
<br />
fluctuation needed to generate an intelligent observer, which is tiny 
<br />
compared to the fluctuation you'd need to explain a universe like ours with 
<br />
low entropy as far as the eye can see (and even lower entropy in the past). 
<br />
I think Price's suggestions were:
<br />
<br />1. new time-asymmetric laws of physics
<br />
<br />2. a &quot;Gold universe&quot; with time's arrow reversing during the contraction 
<br />
phase so the big crunch is a mirror to the big bang (Greg Egan wrote a cool 
<br />
short story about how living in such a universe could allow you to send 
<br />
messages into the past using light from stars in the contraction phase)
<br />
<br />3. laws which guarantee that one end of the universe will be low in entropy 
<br />
while the other will be high, but are equally likely to lead to a 
<br />
low-entropy &quot;future&quot; condition as a low-entropy &quot;past&quot; condition (though 
<br />
observers in either type of universe will call the low-entropy end the 
<br />
'past').
<br />
<br />Incidentally, J. Richard Gott (who I think might have come up with the 
<br />
Doomsday argument, I'm not sure) in his book &quot;Time Travel in Einstein's 
<br />
Universe&quot; makes another interesting suggestion about how to explain 
<br />
low-entropy initial conditions. Combining the idea of wormholes spawning 
<br />
&quot;baby universes&quot; with the idea of wormholes as time machines, he suggests 
<br />
that the Big Bang might be such a baby universe spawned my a wormhole which 
<br />
originates in its own future history! As it turns out this &quot;self-creating 
<br />
universe&quot; model seems to naturally imply no advanced electromagnetic waves, 
<br />
only retarded ones, which is equivalent to saying that entropy must decrease 
<br />
in the past direction, not the future one. Quoting from p. 195-196:
<br />
<br />&quot;The geometry of our time-travel model provides a natural explanation for 
<br />
the asymmetry between the future and the past that we observe in our 
<br />
universe. Suppose we live in the universe represented by the farthest right 
<br />
horn in Figure 27. [he refers to a diagram of a self-creating universe where 
<br />
the 'farthest right horn' is another baby universe that spawned from the 
<br />
original self-created universe] If we allowed light waves to go to the past, 
<br />
they would work their way down this branch to the branch to its left and 
<br />
eventually to the trunk, where they would enter a time loop at the bottom 
<br />
and circle the time loop counterclockwise an infinite number of times, 
<br />
leading to an infinite buildup of energy and causing the whole structure to 
<br />
blow up, creating a singularity. That is not the geometry we started 
<br />
with--the solution is inconsistent. The only way for a self-consistent model 
<br />
to work is if light waves always travel toward the future, just as we 
<br />
observe. (If photons created in the branches travel only toward the future, 
<br />
then these photons travel out the branches away from the time loop, creating 
<br />
no problem.)
<br />
<br />&quot;Now consider a photon emitted within the time loop at the bottom. It could, 
<br />
in principle, circle the loop clockwise an infinite number of times. But 
<br />
each time it went around, it would lose energy because it would be traveling 
<br />
toward the future, in the same direction that the branch is expanding. Each 
<br />
time it circled, it would add only one 535th as much energy as on the 
<br />
previos circuit because the expansion stretches its wavelength by a factor 
<br />
of 535, robbing it of energy. The sum rapidly converges to a finite value. 
<br />
So, even though it circles an infinite number of times, it would not cause 
<br />
an infinite buildup of energy. However, a photon going backward in time 
<br />
(counterclockwise) around the loop would pick up energy on each circuit 
<br />
because in the counterclockwise direction the branch is always getting 
<br />
smaller, compressing its wavelength. A photon circling an infinite number of 
<br />
times toward the past would cause an infinite buildup of energy, causing the 
<br />
model to blow up. In fact, the only way to obtain a self-consistent solution 
<br />
is to have light waves, and gravitational waves, travel only to the future 
<br />
throughout the entire model. Thus, in our model, the asymmetry between the 
<br />
future and the past that we observe (in which causes precede effects) comes 
<br />
from the time asymmetry in the geometry of the Universe--it has a time loop 
<br />
in the beginning.
<br />
<br />&quot;This arrow of time was not something we built into the model; it was 
<br />
implicit in the model, but its emergence quite surprised us. It's an 
<br />
important prediction by the model, which turns out to agree with our 
<br />
observations.
<br />
<br />&quot;In the standard big bang model, by contrast, there is nothing to produce an 
<br />
arrow of time. In that model, the early universe is filled with radiation, 
<br />
and whether it is going forward or backward in time from its source does not 
<br />
matter. Waves going toward the past would increase in energy as they 
<br />
approached the big bang singularity, where they would blow up. But the 
<br />
density in the big bang model blows up there anyway, so it causes no 
<br />
problem. Waves going to the past are not forbidden, in principle, in the 
<br />
standard big bang model. But with a time loop in the beginning, 
<br />
self-consistency forbids waves going to the past--just as is observed 
<br />
today.&quot;
<br />
<br />Gott then goes on to show how the entropy arrow of time can be derived from 
<br />
the electromagnetic arrow of time, based on the fact that it implies higher 
<br />
temperatures as you go back in time. Anyway, this probably is not the most 
<br />
likely answer to the arrow of time question (there are a few other 
<br />
contenders), but it'd be pretty cool if it turned out to be true.
