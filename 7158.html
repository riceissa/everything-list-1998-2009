Hi Jesse,
<br />
<br />I was still trying to put some sort of reply together to your last post, but 
<br />
I think your water analogy is making me more rather than less confused as to 
<br />
your actual position on these issues, which is obviously something you have 
<br />
thought deeply about. With the puzzle in this thread, I was hoping that it 
<br />
would be clear that the subject in the room *has* to experience the light 
<br />
changing colour every 10 minutes, and therefore can draw no conclusion about 
<br />
which state is the high measure one. It seems that many on this list would 
<br />
indeed say that running a mind in parallel increases its measure, and some 
<br />
would say (eg. Saibal Mitra in recent discussions - I still have to get back 
<br />
to you too, Saibal) that the subject would therefore find himself 
<br />
continually cycling in the 10^100 group.
<br />
<br />To summarise my position, it is this: the measure of an observer moment is 
<br />
relevant when a given observer is contemplating what will happen next. If 
<br />
there are 2N successor OM's where he will experience A and 3N successor OM's 
<br />
where he will experience B, then he can assume Pr(A)=0.4 and Pr(B)=0.6. Only 
<br />
the ratio matters. Moreover, the ratio/ relative measure can only be of 
<br />
relevance at a particular time point, when considering the immediate future. 
<br />
To say that an individual will not live to 5000 years even though there 
<br />
exist OM's where he is this age, because his measure is much higher when he 
<br />
is under 100 years of age, makes no sense to me.
<br />
<br />Now, minimising acronym use, could you explain what your understanding is of 
<br />
how measure changes with number of copies of an OM which are instantiated, 
<br />
and if it doesn't, then how does it change, and when you use it in 
<br />
calculating how someone's life will go from OM to OM. Also, you have talked 
<br />
about memory loss, perhaps even complete memory loss, while still being you: 
<br />
in what sense are you still you? Isn't that like saying I am the 
<br />
reincarnation of Alexander the Great or something? You say we need a theory 
<br />
of consciousness to understand these things, but don't you mean a theory of 
<br />
personal identity? I can't see the former knocking on our door in the near 
<br />
future, but I'm pretty confidant about the latter.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the effort you are putting into explaining this stuff.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I  agree you have given the correct answer to my puzzle: from a first

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;at any point there is a 50-50 chance that you are either one of the 10^100

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Would you say that because you think running multiple identical copies of a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe the concept of absolute measure on observer-moments is meaningful
