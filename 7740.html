Whoa! 
<br />
<br />A simple question that just opened up SO many things in my mind!
<br />
(maybe a few screws too:-) ) Blabber on I shall!
<br />
<br />[LC]: 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By &quot;event&quot; do you mean an event that leaves a record? Just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wondering. 
</em><br />
<br />&quot;leaves a record&quot; is the same as saying &quot;affects/causes/interferes
<br />
with other events&quot;.
<br />
<br />Side Note: Beware the pitfalls of visualizing this as a temporal
<br />
cause-effect relationship though, we are talking of events, which
<br />
happen in space-time, not space. Better to understand it as
<br />
&quot;interference&quot;.
<br />
<br />I think that if we consider an ENTIRE intricate interference-connected
<br />
web of events, we are in fact considering one equivalence class from
<br />
the partition called &quot;multiverse&quot;. The equivalence relation creating
<br />
this partition is the &quot;interferes with&quot; relation. And each equivalence
<br />
class is a &quot;universe&quot;.
<br />
<br />Side Note: If you are following till here, then please help me a bit
<br />
with the reflexive part of the &quot;interferes with&quot; equivalence. How does
<br />
an event interfere with itself? I am going the base the rest of the
<br />
post on this assumption, and unfortunately I currently cannot
<br />
substantiate it.
<br />
<br />But now this is a perfect example of something that our brain can
<br />
&quot;define&quot; but not model. Because from our perspective, until and unless
<br />
an event &quot;interferes with&quot; our universe, it is in &quot;some other
<br />
universe&quot; which we have no way of describing.
<br />
<br />Therefore yes, for us the &quot;knowable universe&quot; at any time can only
<br />
have events that leave records in our universe, or events that form
<br />
part of our interference web.
<br />
<br />BUT, since &quot;coming to know&quot; is itself only an event, it is ALWAYS
<br />
possible that even our notion of &quot;knownable universe&quot; is incomplete.
<br />
This is because we ALWAYS have the potential to be &quot;unlucky enough&quot; to
<br />
not &quot;feel&quot; some interference from an event that we currently believe
<br />
is in &quot;some other universe&quot; and therefore &quot;unknowable&quot;. It is just a
<br />
matter of not being in the right place at the right time.
<br />
<br />So although I cannot say for sure whether there even exist events that
<br />
&quot;do not leave a record&quot;, but if they do exist, then they are
<br />
unknowable. By their very definition they do not &quot;affect&quot; us in ANY
<br />
way, and therefore can be ignored in a ToE. But the problem is, we
<br />
have NO way of knowing that an event SURELY does NOT leave a record!
<br />
<br />Having said this, the universe seems to be at BEST only recursively
<br />
enumerable to us, not recursive. Because while we CAN observe what's
<br />
INSIDE it, we have NO way of saying what's OUTSIDE (yet INSIDE the
<br />
&quot;multiverse&quot;). So my concluding claim is this: We may some day have a
<br />
ToE that is in fact Consistent and Complete (finally TRUE), but we
<br />
will NEVER be sure that it is so.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for a nice try at clearing up what Jesse, at least,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I were discussing.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe now I have managed to complicate things again:-)
