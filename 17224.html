It is a 'reductio ad absudum' argument.
<br />
<br />My argument /does not start with AI can't do science/.
<br />
<br />It starts with the simple posit that if /COMP is true/ then all 
<br />
differences between a COMP world (AC) and the natural world (NC) should 
<br />
be zero under all circumstances and the AC/NC distinction would be 
<br />
false. That is the natural result of unconditional universality of COMP yes?
<br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br />This posit is /not/ an assumption that AC cannot be a scientist.
<br />
<br />The rationale is that if I can find one and only one circumstance 
<br />
consistent/sustaining that difference, then the posit of the universal 
<br />
truth of COMP is falsified. The AC/NC distinction is upheld:
<br />
.
<br />
I looked and found one place where the difference is viable, a 
<br />
difference that only goes away if you project a human viewpoint into the 
<br />
'artificial scientist' ( i.e. valid only by additional 
<br />
assumptions).....that position is that the NC artificial scientist 
<br />
cannot ever debate COMP as an option. _Not because it can't construct 
<br />
the statements of debate, but because it will never be able to detect a 
<br />
world in which COMP is false, because in that world the informal systems 
<br />
involved can fake all evidence_ and lead the COMP scientist by the nose 
<br />
anywhere they want. If the real world is a place where informal systems 
<br />
exist, those informal systems can subvert/fake all COMP statements, no 
<br />
matter what they are and the COMP scientist will never know. It can be 
<br />
100% right, think it's right and actually not be connected to the actual 
<br />
reality of it. A world in which COMP is false can never verify that it 
<br />
is. Do not confuse this 'ability to be fooled' with an inability to 
<br />
formulate statements which deal with inconsistency.
<br />
<br />The place where we get an informal system is in the human brain, which 
<br />
can 'symbolically cohere and explore' any/all formal systems. I 
<br />
specifically chose the human brain of a scientist, the workings of which 
<br />
were used to generate the 'law of nature' running the artificial (COMP) 
<br />
scientist (who must also be convinced COMP is true in order to bother at 
<br />
all!). I can see how, as a human, I could 100% fake the apparent world 
<br />
that the COMP entity examines COMP-ly and it will never know. (The same 
<br />
way that a brilliant virtual reality could 100% fool a human and we'd 
<br />
never know. A virtual reality that fools us humans is not necessarily 
<br />
made of computation  either. )
<br />
<br />I am not saying humans are magical. I am saying that humans do /not/ 
<br />
operate formally like COMP.... and that '/formally handling 
<br />
inconsistency/' is not the same thing as '/delivering inconsistency by 
<br />
being an informal/ /system/'. BTW I mean informal in the Godellian 
<br />
sense...simultaneous inconsistency and incompleteness.
<br />
<br />This is a highly self referential situation. Resist the temptation to 
<br />
assume that a COMP/NC scientist construction of statements capturing 
<br />
inconsistency is equivalent to dealing the intrinsic inconsistency of 
<br />
the human brain kind. Also reject the notion that the brain is computing 
<br />
of the COMP (Turing)  type. This is not the case.

of Mind. Philosophy and Phenomenological Research LIX:41-69.*
<br />
....He ends with.....&quot;/In the end, then, the zombie attack proves 
<br />
lethal: computationalism is dead./&quot;
<br />
<br />It's a formal modal logic argument to the same end as mine.... in the 
<br />
end, they are actually the same argument. It's just not obvious. I like 
<br />
mine better because it has the Godellian approach. The informality issue 
<br />
has some elaboration here:
<br />
*Cabanero, L. L. and Small, C. G. 2009. Intentionality and 
<br />
Computationalism: A Diagonal Argument. Mind and Matter 7:81-90.*
<br />
Also here:
<br />
*Fetzer, J. H. 2001. Computers and Cognition: Why Minds are Not Machines 
<br />
Kluwer Academic Publishers.*
<br />
<br />I am hoping that between these and a few others, the issue is sealed. I 
<br />
know it'll take a while for the true believers to come around. It's not 
<br />
such a big deal ... except when $$$ + wasted time promulgates bad 
<br />
science and magical thinking in the form of a kind a 'fashion 
<br />
preference' based on presumptions that the natural world is obliged to 
<br />
operate according to human-constructed 'isms.
<br />
<br />If I look at the natural world and it tells me COMP is true then I will 
<br />
use that stance scientifically.
<br />
If I look at the natural world and it tells me COMP is false then I will 
<br />
use that stance scientifically.
<br />
<br />I have no desire for one or the other. I desire merely truth, as best I 
<br />
can assemble it, scientifically.
<br />
<br />I hope this sorts it out.  I am done for now. Stuff to do. If anyone 
<br />
wants the cited papers email me offlist.
