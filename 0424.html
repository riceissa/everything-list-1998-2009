<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;I thought that the explanation for why the doomsday argument fails in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;the everything-exists case went like this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;Either we are in a world where the human race lives for a very long
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;time but we are very early in its history, or we are in a world where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;it lives for a short time and we are at a typical point in its history
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;(or something in between).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;Hal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think it's true. Bayes theorem is correct but the prior probability is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; very strongly in favor of worlds with many humans.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; However we can do estimate something about the duration of the human race.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; For most of the distributions of births (including exponential growth of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the population), the average (over all human beings) ratio of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (tf-t)/(t-ti), the time left before doomsday over the time past since the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; beginning of mankind, is of the order of one. The best estimate is thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that mankind has to live around as much time it has already lived, between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 10^5 to 10^7 years.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is not correct to apply time as a measure for the human race, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you and I are members thereof, and because the number of people per unit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time has not been uniform.  John Leslie is correct in using the birth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of people as a measure of time passage.  You and I are indeed not in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;peculiar positions by this measure, while we are by direct time measure.
</em><br />
<br />but if you take the average value for all people, you don't give you a
<br />
peculiar position. You are just looking for a value that mimimizes the
<br />
number of people who are wrong in choosing it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is interesting to note that the &quot;Copernican&quot; estimate that you give
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;originally, to my knowledge from Gott, does seem to give plausible time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;estimates, but has the following property that makes me very suspicious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of Copernican estimates.  (First, the Copernican estimates as a whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do not have a finite expectation, but the median estimate is for future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interval = observed past interval).  Then for Copernican estimates on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;humans (as if they were made by an alien).  The time, as you indicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is 10^5 to 10^7.  The number of people is about 60 10^9. The pair of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;forecasts can both be met if the total forecast is for a rapid decline
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of current population, then a long period of very few members.  This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is oddly reminiscent of a reversal of past history.
</em><br />
<br />It's true, I saw this estimate somewhere and I lost the references.
<br />
Isn't the absence of expectation value due to unphysical distribution of
<br />
births? (function extending down to -infinity). I checked rapidly (I may be
<br />
wrong) that for a function starting at a finite time -T with f(-T) = 0 ( a
<br />
convenient approximation if one assumes a &quot;first Eve&quot;, with 46 chromosoms
<br />
for example), there is indeed a finite expectation value.
<br />
The symmetry of population seems to arise from the fact that you want both
<br />
a median in birth rank and in time. So indeed it is more correct to choose
<br />
the forecast on the number of people still to be born. Of course the
<br />
remaining time depends on the actual population growth rate. I made a
<br />
mistake in my first calculation, but I agree that if the growth is
<br />
exponential, the expectation value of (tf-t)/(t-ti) can be much smaller
<br />
than 1 if the total life time is much larger than the typical growth time.
<br />
Both methods are not contradictory.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I rather suspect that there could be a lot of empirical cases in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Copernican forecasts would be right, but it is hard to reconcile
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that with the apparent basis in a time reversal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thinking further of it, maybe the problem comes from the fact that you put
<br />
another piece of information : the past curve of growth of the mankind. It
<br />
may well be that the overall population curve is nearly symetrical, for
<br />
example if the mankind reaches a quasi-steady state around 20 billions
<br />
people during some millions of years, before genetic mutation or the impact
<br />
of an asteroid (for example) makes it disappear. But it means that we are
<br />
*not* in a typical rank. Considering the very recent explosion due to the
<br />
large progress of medicine in this century, we could be at a rather
<br />
particular stage, just as if you try to predict the life time of a baby by
<br />
this way. Morality: to make predictions, it's better to try a realistic
<br />
model including the maximal information about all physical processes than
<br />
relying on pure mathematics...
