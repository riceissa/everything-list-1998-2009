Hi,
<br />
----- Original Message ----- 
<br />
From: &quot;Hal Finney&quot; &lt;hal.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Suppose I sit on this copy machine in New York, and the information of
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; position and velocities (within quantum uncertainty) of all particles in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; my body is copied. Suppose, for the sake of the argument, that the mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; retrieval of this information should pose no problem to me. It should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; me harmless.  This information then travels by wire from the reader to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the reproducer. An almost perfect copy of me is made in Paris. Should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I, in that moment, expect to have the first-person 50% probability of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; suddenly seeing the eiffel tower? I don't think anyone would support
</em><br />
that.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think your argument is valid, that this experiment is indeed the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as stepping into a destructive duplication machine and having copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made in two places.
</em><br />
<br />OK...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only place I think you're wrong is in the last sentence.  In fact,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think many people here would in fact &quot;support that&quot;, i.e. they would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expect to face a 50% chance of being in the two places.
</em><br />
<br />I wouldn't know. That seems too weird an expectation. But let me try to
<br />
think about that...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have some subtle issues with this expectation which I will explain at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another time, but broadly speaking I would expect that if a copy were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made of me, and that copy were started up, I would in fact experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a branching of my experience.  If I were about to be copied and I knew
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the copy was going to be started up in Paris, I would expect to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience the two futures equally.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Others who accept the destructive-double-copy experiment would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presumably agree with this basic analysis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And for the record, my reservation is that it might be psychologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different to have two different futures for certain than to have two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; futures in two different branches of the multiverse.  It seems to me that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this follows from the ASSA, which I provisionally accept at present.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's hard to say what the perceptual difference will be, but it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like there ought to be one.
</em><br />
<br />I think that would certainly be psychologically different, and that may be
<br />
an argument against that position (how should I call it? Is there a name?).
<br />
<br />You already agreed that the non-destructive-copy experiment is equivalent
<br />
to the destructive-double-copy experiment, so let me argue using the first
<br />
one.
<br />
In the case of non-destructive-copy experiment, the copy is
<br />
made in a distinct place/time from the original. They could as well be done
<br />
100,000 years in the future and in the Andromeda galaxy, and you should
<br />
as well expect to have the subjective experience of being that copy with
<br />
the same probability as being the smooth continuation of yourself on Earth.
<br />
But in the multiverse, there are certainly infinite other perfect copies of
<br />
yourself which are not smooth continuations. We can imagine thousands of
<br />
ways how these copies could be made. In computer simulations, in a distant
<br />
&quot;Earth&quot; in the Tegmark plenitude, or elsewhere.
<br />
<br />But suppose you just stepped outside the Paris duplicator. Unaware of the
<br />
experiment that is being made, your last memory is sitting in front of your
<br />
computer, reading this email. Suddenly, you see the Eiffel Tower. That
<br />
would surely be a psychological experience that we don't have too often.
<br />
And since there are infinite copies of yourself at any given moment, if you
<br />
should expect to be any of them at the next moment, you shouldn't expect
<br />
to ever feel the continuous experience you do.
<br />
<br />Therefore, since I do actually have a continuous experience of myself,
<br />
then 'I am not my copies'.
<br />
<br />-Eric.
