<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Jacques Mallah wrote]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;	And there's the proof of my above statement.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;	Wei Dai has previously argued that the 'quantum suicide' crowd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;really just had a weird sense of morality regarding measure, rather than a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;wrong view of the math.  I think the above proves that not to be the case:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;since Higgo now thinks that being old would be evidence of QTI, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;proves that he does believe that the predictions of QTI would not be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;standard predictions of QM as Wei and I understand it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;	I find it incredible that Higgo can state that being old would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;statistical evidence for QTI, since one would not expect that without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;QTI, but still not realize that being young is statistical evidence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;against it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Jacques, I agree with James.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1) if you find yourself very old, this is no rigorous evidence for any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; theory. However you should choose the explanation following the maximum of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; likelihood criterium, i.e. the theory in which the probability of being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; very old in some world is maximum. This probability if 1 in MWI, and very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; tiny in conventional QM. So the fact of being very old should be considered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as a very strong, although not absolute, evidence for MWI. In the same way,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the thousands of experimental confirmations of QM are very strong pieces of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; evidence for QM, but not rigorous proofs (which do not exist).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Would you define for me the meaning of your statement that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability of you being very old in the MWI is 1?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	It is surely true that in the MWI, old copies of you-like beings 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will exist.  It is also true that they will be of very small measure, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the effective probability of being one of those copies is very tiny.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Being old is about as unlikely in the MWI as in any other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation.
</em><br />
<br />I think we're talking about MWI with some additional reasonable
<br />
suppositions, the main one being that at each point of every history
<br />
containing a live you will have a future history also containing a
<br />
live you. Thus even if future histories containing xx old you's are a
<br />
vanishing proportion of the total future histories, there is still a
<br />
one to many correspondence between now and the future.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2) The fact of being young is not a statistical evidence against QTI,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; because the number (or the measure) of worlds where you are young is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; actually much larger than that where you are old. If you choose randomly a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; point between the x axis and the exponential curve y=exp(-x), most of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; points will lie at x of the order of 1, although there exist an infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; number of points with x as large as you want.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	You do seem to have some kind of understanding of measure based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the above paragraph.  So why can't you go all the way and repudiate QTI?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No one is suggesting that QTI=false means that no worlds with you-like old
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beings exist.  Rather, the point is that you should not expect to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience that in any meaningful sense; most you-like beings are not that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; old.  More dramatically, suicide is no wiser in the MWI than without it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since it just reduces your measure and the measure fraction of old
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you-like observers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Gilles, on other issues we have sometimes agreed.  I hope you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learn to take a more rational look at this issue, and if you are convinced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you might be able to teach the others in a way I couldn't.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;against it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;But Jacques does not say what 'old' is. In relation to immortality, 31 is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;neither old nor young; in the same way, in relation to infinity, 31 is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;neither a lot nor a little, any more than 457*10E900 is a lot or a little.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	False.  31 about is what one would expect if QTI were false, no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question about that, since it's within the normal human lifetime as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; documented from watching the deaths of others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	If QTI were true, you should expect to be very much older than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that, at least.  The exact age would still seem surprisingly low compared
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to infinity, if you had an infinite brain capacity.  Luckily (?) you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't, so you should expect with probability 1 that your age would be too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; large for you to remember or even estimate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;(I assume you are also OK with the notion that there is an infinite number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of billion-year-old-Jacqueses). Well, then our only disagreement is whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;you will become an old Jacques. I believe that you only experience those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;universes in which you exist, so you will eventually experience being one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;those old Jacqueses. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	The above paragraph seems rather meaningless.  From what I gather,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you believe that &quot;I&quot; (whatever that means) will experience all me-like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations in some kind of consecutive order, and that the measure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such observations will not decrease with time.  Quite ridiculous.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Would you care to offer a non-SSA argument against this (SSA is inapliccable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;to this situation, as I have pointed out, as you are the only immortal and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;therefore not a representative sample).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	&quot;SSA&quot; is merely applying the usual Bayesian proceedure to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incomplete information.  It can not be false, even if QTI were true.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Jacques Wrote:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;	I hope even you have realized by now that an argument against
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;immortality quoted above is that if immortality were true, identity would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;have to figure in physics.  So you are supporting my point above, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;opposing it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Nonsense. What I am arguing is that we can expect to experience a continuous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;flow of consciousness forever. That does not mean we have an objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;identity. I am arguing about our experience, which is 100% subjective.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Again, a meaningless paragraph.  My experience consists of one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observation.  The collective experiences of me-like beings consists of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many observations most of which are not of being old.  Any link over time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between certain of those beings would require an identity criterion, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if measure was conserved over time within the being that meets such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criterion, it would require special laws of physics for that special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purpose.
