<br />
The all-universes model may provide some insight into causation and
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
<br />Philosophers define causation in what seems at first to be a backwards
<br />
way.  Rain causes the grass to grow; therefore, we might think to express
<br />
this as, if it doesn't rain, the grass won't grow.
<br />
<br />But this does not work, because if it doesn't rain, we will water the
<br />
grass, and it will grow anyway.
<br />
<br />Instead, they express the causality as, if the grass doesn't grow, it
<br />
didn't rain.  This is similar to the &quot;contrapositive&quot; from symbolic
<br />
logic, where &quot;a implies b&quot; is equivalent to &quot;not-b implies not-a&quot;.
<br />
<br />Causation is seen to be an essentially counterfactual relationship (that
<br />
is, it deals with things which are contrary to actual facts).  Especially
<br />
when we deal with actual events, we describe the causal relationship in
<br />
terms of &quot;if one of the events didn't happen&quot;.  But it did happen.
<br />
<br />The status of counterfactuals is a problem in philosophy.  Philosphers
<br />
invoke imaginary universes to describe them, but then how real can
<br />
causality be if it can only be described with reference to imaginary
<br />
situations?
<br />
<br />However, in the context of the all-universe model, we have a ready set of
<br />
additional universes to work with, all as real as our own.  This allows
<br />
counterfactuals to have a greater degree of reality.  We can express
<br />
&quot;if not-b then not-a&quot; as &quot;in all universes in which not-b occurs,
<br />
not-a occurs&quot;.  It is a well defined set of relationships among the
<br />
contents of actually existing universes.
<br />
<br />I got thinking about causality because some people suggest that it has
<br />
a crucial bearing in the phenomenon of consciousness.  I first ran into
<br />
this, obliquely, in Searle's famous &quot;Chinese Room&quot; thought experiment.
<br />
This purports to be a philosophical demonstration that the computational
<br />
model of mind is absolutely wrong, that no computer could be conscious
<br />
merely by virtue of running the proper program.
<br />
<br />Searle's Chinese Room is interesting for the wide variation in responses
<br />
it produces.  Many people find it absolutely convincing, while others
<br />
see it as transparently absurd.  A good discussion is in Hofstadter's
<br />
book Goedel, Escher, Bach.
<br />
<br />If the computational activity of the brain isn't what produces
<br />
consciousness, what is?  Searle points rather vaguely to the possibility
<br />
that the brain possesses &quot;causal powers&quot; which produce consciousness.
<br />
He never really defines what these causal powers are; they are really
<br />
just a placeholder for whatever the brain might be doing to produce
<br />
consciousness, since he feels he has shown that it can't be just its
<br />
information processing.
<br />
<br />Searle's ideas aren't well regarded in the circles I frequent, but the
<br />
idea of causality playing a role in consciousness does come up.  This
<br />
is an approach to the issue Wei raised: is it state, or information
<br />
processing that produces consciousness?  Some people suggest that it
<br />
is information processing, and that specifically the processing must 
<br />
have a causal flow.
<br />
<br />It is not enough, in this view, to reproduce an instance of information
<br />
processing in a non-causal way.  For example, we could monitor each
<br />
neuron in the brain and record its firing pattern, then play back those
<br />
patterns in another brain which has had its neural connections all
<br />
severed.  Each neuron would have its own &quot;recorded tape&quot; for when it
<br />
was supposed to fire, based on the measurements made in the brain which
<br />
was thinking.  In the playback brain, the neurons all fire with exactly
<br />
the same patterns as in the conscious brain.  Is it conscious?
<br />
<br />(My solution is, as I said earlier, that the question isn't meaningful,
<br />
because it is at best another iteration of an already-produced calculation,
<br />
and it doesn't matter if a conscious calculation is instantiated multiple
<br />
times.)
<br />
<br />According to the consciousness-as-causality view, this playback is not
<br />
conscious, even though the patterns are all the same.  There is no causal
<br />
relationship among the neural firings as their was in the real brain.
<br />
Without causality, there is no consciousness.
<br />
<br />If we accept that consciousness is a real phenomenon deserving of
<br />
explanation, this view would require that causality is also a real,
<br />
fundamental, physical phenomenon.  But if the only way causality can be
<br />
defined is as a relationship that spans multiple universes, it would
<br />
follow that consciousness also must fundamentally involve multiple
<br />
universes.
<br />
<br />This is not necessarily as absurd as it may seem at first.  Our
<br />
consciousness seems to inherently be an active process.  The sense we
<br />
have of being conscious is intricately bound up with the sensation of
<br />
the passage of time.  Yet time &quot;passing&quot; is really a matter of the
<br />
increase of entropy, which can also be related to universe splitting
<br />
in either a many-worlds or all-universes model.  So it is already clear
<br />
that our perceptions do partake of some aspects of the multiple worlds.
<br />
If we could somehow bring counterfactuals into this, then we might be
<br />
closer to a coherent theory of consciousness.
<br />
