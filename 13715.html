<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:  OK. I would insist that the &quot;comp project&quot; (extract physics from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is really just a comp obligation. This is what is supposed to be shown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the UDA (+ MOVIE-GRAPH). Are you OK with this. It *is*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterintuitive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DN:  I believe so - it's what the reductio ad absurdum of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'physical' computation in the 'grandma' post was meant to show. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />This was not so clear, but OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My version of the 'comp obligation' would then run as follows.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Essentially, if comp and number relations are held to be 'real in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense that I am real',
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure that numbers are real in the sense that &quot;I am real&quot;, 
<br />
unless you are talking of the third person &quot;I&quot;. Then &quot;you&quot; are as real 
<br />
as your (unknown) Godel-number.
<br />
In general, when people use the word &quot;I&quot; they refer to their first 
<br />
person, or to first person plural feature of their &quot;physical&quot; body. It 
<br />
is a unexpected (by me) discovery that quanta belongs to that sharable 
<br />
first person view (making the comp-QM a bit more psychological than 
<br />
some Many-Worlder would perhaps appreciate. So that Fuch-Pauli could be 
<br />
right ... (if you know the work of Fuchs).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; then to use Plato's metaphor, it is numbers that represent the forms 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outside the cave. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, but not only (there are also the relations between numbers, the 
<br />
relation between the relations between the numbers, etc.)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If that's so, then physics is represented by the shadows the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers see on the wall of the cave.  This is what I mean by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'independent' existence in my current dialogue with Torgny: i.e the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'arithmetical realism' of numbers and their relations in the comp 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; frame equates to their 'independence' or self-relativity.  And the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of 'arithmetical observers' then derives from subsequent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes of 'individuation' intrinsic to such fundamental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-relation.  Actually, I find the equation of existence with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-relativity highly intuitive.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. (Technically it is not obvious how to define in arithmetic such 
<br />
self-relation: the basic tool is given by the recursion or fixed point 
<br />
theorems).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:  Then, the interview of the universal machine is &quot;just&quot; a way to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extraction of physics in a constructive way. It is really the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subtleties of the incompleteness phenomena which makes this interview
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; highly non trivial.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DN:  This is the technical part.  But at this stage grandma has some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feeling for how both classical and QM narratives should be what we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expect to emerge from constructing physics in this way.
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure how could grandma have a feeling about that, except if 
<br />
grandma get Church Thesis and the UDA.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:  There is no direct (still less one-one) correlation between the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental and the physical,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is the physical supervenience thesis is incompatible with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp hyp. [A quale of a pain] felt at time t in place x, is not a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; product of the physical activity of a machine, at time t in place x. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rather, it is the whole quale of [a pain felt at time t in place x] 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is associated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with an (immaterial and necessarily unknown) computational state, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself related to its normal consistent computational continuations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Comp makes the &quot;yes doctor&quot; a gamble, necessarily. That is: assuming 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;theory comp&quot; you have to understand that, by saying yes to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doctor, you are gambling on a level of substitution. At the same time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you make a &quot;gamble&quot; on the theory comp itself. There is double gamble 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here. Now, the first gamble, IF DONE AT THE RIGHT COMP SUBSTITUTION 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; LEVEL, is comp-equivalent with the natural gamble everybody do when 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going to sleep, or just when waiting a nanosecond. In some sense 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;nature&quot; do that gamble in our place all the time ... But this is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somethjng we cannot know, still less assert in any scientific way, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is why I insist so much on the &quot;theological&quot; aspect of comp. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is important in practice. It really justify that the truth of the &quot;yes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doctor&quot; entails the absolute fundamental right to say NO to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doctor. The doctor has to admit he is gambling on a substitution 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level. If comp is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true we cannot be sure on the choice of the subst. level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DN:  ISTM that a consequence of the above is that the issue of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'substitution level' can in principle be 'gambled' on by cloning, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by evolution (because presumably it has been, even though we can't say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how).  But by engineering or design???  Would there ever be any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; justification, in your view, for taking a gamble on being uploaded to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an AI program - and if so, on the basis of what theory? 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, if you are willing to believe in &quot;neurophilosophy&quot;, you can bet 
<br />
on some high level description. If you bet on Hammerof's theory, you 
<br />
have to duplicate the qunatum state of the brain (and this is of 
<br />
courese not possible). I don't think we are concerned with those 
<br />
practical matter. The point is just that physics appears as a sort of 
<br />
sum on your lobian ignorance.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Essentially, this is what I've been trying to get at.  That is: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assuming comp, HOW would we go about making a 'sound bet', founded on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a specific AI theory, that some AI program instantiated by a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'physical' computer, will equate to the continuity of our own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observation?
</em><br />
<br />Before a long time (despite Kurzweyl) we just can do it, even at a high 
<br />
level. A brain is *very* complex, for any theory. In the future people 
<br />
will just bet on the available theory through some Pascal wag.
<br />
It is possible that there is some &quot;zombie&quot; gap, and that the first 
<br />
person having an artificial brain will not be conscious ... (I doubt 
<br />
this, but apparently the lobian machine say so .... according to the 
<br />
definition I gave).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second question I have is summarised in my recent posts about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'sense and 'action'. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />What you say is interesting, but honestly I am far from extracting 
<br />
notion like &quot;action&quot; in the lobian frame. I have no time, nor space, 
<br />
just bit of promising algebra confirming the quantum principle.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Essentially, I've been trying to postulate that the correlation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness and physics is such that the relations between both sets 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of phenomena are a necessary entailment, not an additional 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption.  ISTM that this is essential to avoid all the nonsense 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about zombies. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />As I said this is a point where I would like to disagree with the 
<br />
lobian machine. The fact is that even the lobian machine warns us on 
<br />
the possibility of zombie. Certainly the current artificial cops on the 
<br />
road are zombie. Tomorrow we will be able to build artificial skin for 
<br />
androids capable of making us believe they are normal humans citizens, 
<br />
... We should distinguish &quot;local zombie&quot; which are capable to fail you 
<br />
during some finite time, and &quot;theoretical global zombie&quot; which are 
<br />
capable to fail you, in principle, for ever (like Torgny try to make us 
<br />
believe he belongs too: nobody can prove him wrong).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And not only this, but to show that the reciprocity between experience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - e.g. suffering  - and behaviour (indeed the whole entailment of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'intentionality') is a necessary consequence of fundamental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-relation (arithmetical relations, in the comp frame). 
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure about that. Again you develop your intuition where I am 
<br />
force to ask the machine, and I am far away to tackle a notion like 
<br />
&quot;behavior&quot;, except in very rough way (where a behavior would be defined 
<br />
by a generable set of input-outputs).
<br />
Are you considering neural processing as a behavior?
<br />
Are you considering that some platonic and static relations between 
<br />
numbers can be seen as behavior?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, my attempt to do this has been to postulate that 'sense' and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'action' are simply observer-related aspects of a non-decomposable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental self-relation, which in the comp frame would equate to a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of number-relations.  But ISTM that for this to be true, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer and physical narratives would somehow need to follow an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'identical' or isomorphic trajectory for their invariant relation to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerge in the way that it seems to.  Do you think that this idea has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any specific sense or relevance in the comp frame?
</em><br />
<br />Given that the physical is defined by the invariant of the observable, 
<br />
it would be a pity not having such invariant, but I am a bit prisoner 
<br />
of my methodology here. Feel free to pursue your intuitive exploration.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:  Does this help? I assert some propositions without justifying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the justification are both already on the list, or in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; papers. But, please, don't hesitate to ask for more if interested. From
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what I understand about your intuition, you are quite close to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;natural first person discourse&quot; of the lobian machine. And the closer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are, the more severe my comments will be on the details, so please
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indulge my critical way of talking ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, absolutely!  I feel I'm making progress in resolving some of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ambiguity in my understanding, so be as severe as necessary, cher 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maitre.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Recall that the nameable lobian master always insist on  &quot;I will say a 
<br />
stupidity or I could say a stupidity&quot;       (is that english?)
<br />
<br />:)
