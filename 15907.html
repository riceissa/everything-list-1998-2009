Hi Brent,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I didn't use the term - it is one being attributed to me simply because I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question the adequacy of logic and mathematics to instantiate physics.
</em><br />
<br />That is ok - there are different versions of materialism/physicalism etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't accept any such esoteric theories - I merely entertain them.
</em><br />
<br />That is well put, I agree - as rational people we all hold tentatively,
<br />
we entertain - with &quot;accept&quot; I mean that it passes enough tests that it
<br />
can be entertained - versus other theories that are so unprobable that 
<br />
one does not have the time to concern oneself with them...(although one 
<br />
never knows ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the problem reappears as the body-problem.  Why is materialism so successful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a model of the world?
</em><br />
<br />No, the problem is of a quite different nature than the mind-body
<br />
problem. I would not call the white rabbit problem as a body problem.
<br />
Besides, materialism also faces this issue in an infinite universe if
<br />
you accept unification of mind states (remember the Bostrom paper?).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems somewhat gratuitous to call this a &quot;substance&quot;.  I'd say materialism 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; holds (on simple empirical grounds) that some things exist and some don't.
</em><br />
<br />Hmm, that is too little I think to distinguish materialism from, say,
<br />
Pythagorean views or even Platonic views. Saying that &quot;everything&quot; 
<br />
exists does not quite capture what Everythingers believe.
<br />
<br />Everything never means everything conceivable - but everything that is 
<br />
possible. What is possible, is, of course, the question.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why should some things exist and others not - because if everything existed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there would be no distinction between &quot;exist&quot; and &quot;not-exist&quot; 
</em><br />
<br />With the restriction to &quot;everything possible&quot; (and not plain everything) 
<br />
exists, we still have to distinguish accessible regions. Or do you mean 
<br />
&quot;can influence us causally&quot; by exists? But then you would deny existence 
<br />
to parts outside the observable universe - which is of course dependent 
<br />
from where you look (Earth), so I think it is not a good criterion for 
<br />
existence.
<br />
<br />But if we accept that &quot;material&quot; things exist which can never affect us 
<br />
causally, why not accept that there are other, mathematically even more 
<br />
remote entitities? Or, consider decoherence - here mathematically very 
<br />
similar branches are suddenly inaccessible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I don't think it has &quot;moved beyond&quot;.  MWI is attractive for several reasons, but it is well short 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Tegmarkia.
</em><br />
<br />Of course - what I mean that it has &quot;moved beyond&quot; is a lot of 
<br />
Absolutes: absolute space, absolute time etc - what remains are 
<br />
relations. And there _are_ defenders in philosophy of physics which 
<br />
retain some anthropomorphic Absolutes, but I think they are fighting a 
<br />
losing battle.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think Tegmark grounded his &quot;everything&quot; by supposing that the lowest level was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncomputable.
</em><br />
<br />Ok thanks I missed that, will have to read the paper again.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Materialism has been very effective in not only explaining, but in predicting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things. That doesn't prove it's right, but I could ask what explanatory power 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does &quot;everything exists&quot; hold.  Remember that a theory that could explain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything, fails to explain at all.
</em><br />
<br />Indeed, and that is what makes materialism very enticing, but then the 
<br />
question immediately crops up: why this, and not something else? I think 
<br />
materialism would have a much better stance if one would find one set of 
<br />
equations which describes our universe (that is, of logical necessity), 
<br />
but it doesn't look likely.
<br />
<br />And every contingent description leads to multiversal concepts.
<br />
<br />Best Wishes,
<br />
Günther
