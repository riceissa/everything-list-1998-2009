<br /><br />I am proposing, I suppose:
<br />
<br />CONSCIOUSNESS  =&gt; EVERYTHING ELSE
<br />
<br />So obviously it seems useful to postulate the existence of things like
<br />
quarks and electrons, which we then use to make predictions about what
<br />
will happen if we do this, that, or the other.  However, I think there
<br />
is good reason to believe that this only holds true in our own
<br />
relatively well-behaved part of what is actually a vast experiential
<br />
wilderness.
<br />
<br />Any proposal that has our consciousness as being &quot;caused&quot;, whatever
<br />
the causal mechanism, is open to the possibility that we are caused to
<br />
experience something that is not reflective of the reality that
<br />
produced the experience.  Dreams, delusions, hallucinations,
<br />
brains-in-vats, and computer simulations of brains all offer real or
<br />
conceivable examples of scenarios where what is experienced might lead
<br />
one astray in trying to determine the underlying nature of things.
<br />
<br />If our conscious experience is caused, then for all we know we're
<br />
giant amorphous blobs floating in 12 dimensional space, but with just
<br />
the right internal causal structure to produce the conscious
<br />
experience of being humans in 3-dimensional space.  Or we could be
<br />
&quot;Boltzmann Brains&quot;, produced by the random fluctuations of particles
<br />
in just the right way to produce the illusion of our current
<br />
experiences.  Given enough time, exactly our experience would be
<br />
produced, regardless of the underlying physics of the Boltzmann
<br />
Universe that we actually inhabit, just through a brute random search
<br />
of the space of possibilities, combination and recombination of all
<br />
possible configurations.  OR (per Bruno) we could be mathematical
<br />
algorithms existing only in some immaterial platonic sense.
<br />
<br />Or identical experiences, plus all variations, of being Brent or Bruno
<br />
might be caused by each of the above mechanisms at different times and
<br />
in different places.  An infinite number of universes, or a universe
<br />
of infinite size, or with an infinite amount of time, or a quantum
<br />
mechanical multiverse with infinite branches, or a platonic Plenitude
<br />
containing all possible mathematical/algorithmic structures, would all
<br />
seem to be possibilities, and not even mutually exclusive ones.
<br />
<br />BUT, I don't think so.
<br />
<br />All causal explanations for consciousness (even Bruno's) ultimately
<br />
rely on fiat assertions that &quot;this causes conscious experience&quot;,
<br />
without providing any convincing explanation for why this should be.
<br />
It's not so much causation as correlation, as far as I can see.
<br />
<br />As I mentioned, I'm sure that the brain can be viewed as representing
<br />
the contents of my experience.  And I'm sure that a computer program
<br />
could also be written that would represent the contents of my
<br />
conscious experience and whose representational state would evolve as
<br />
the program ran so that it continued to match what I experience over
<br />
time.  But this would not mean that the program was conscious, or that
<br />
my brain is conscious.
<br />
<br />The living brain and the executing computer program both just
<br />
represent the contents of my conscious experience, in the same way
<br />
that a map represents the actual terrain.
<br />
<br />However, I question the need to push the explanation down to a
<br />
separate layer.  So we are at the top of your ontological stack, I
<br />
assume.  And we look below us to see what supports us.  But then we
<br />
have to look below that level to see what supports it, and below that
<br />
level to see what supports it, and so on.  Infinite regress.  Turtles
<br />
all the way down.
<br />
<br />But instead why not look at our own experience, which is the only
<br />
thing we know directly, as the foundation of the ontological stack.
<br />
Everything that exists rests on the foundation of our conscious
<br />
experience?  In this view, the stack goes up for as far as our
<br />
intellect can reach.  And as our intellectual capacity expands, the
<br />
our view of the existential landscape above us also expands.
<br />
<br />This, I think, makes more sense.
