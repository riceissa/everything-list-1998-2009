Hi,
<br />
I am going to have to be a bit targetted in my responses.... I am a TAD
<br />
whelmed at the moment.....
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 4) Belief in 'magical emergence' .... qualitative novelty of a kind
</em><br />
utterly unrelated to the componentry.
<br />
<br />RUSSEL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The latter clause refers to &quot;emergence&quot; (without the &quot;magical&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualifier), and it is impossible IMHO to have creativity without
</em><br />
emergence.
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
The distinction between 'magical emergence' and 'emergence' is quite
<br />
obviously intended by me. A lake is not apparent in the chemical formula
<br />
for water. I would defy anyone to quote any example of real-world
<br />
'emergence' that does not ultimately rely on a necessary primitive.
<br />
'Magical emergence' is when you claim 'qualitative novelty' without having
<br />
any idea (you can't point at it) of the necessary primitive, or by
<br />
defining an arbitrary one that is actually a notional construct (such as
<br />
'information'), rather than anything real.
<br />
<br /><br />COLIN
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The system (a) automatically prescibes certain trajectories and
</em><br />
<br />RUSSEL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes.
</em><br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (b) assumes that the theroem space [and] natural world are the same
</em><br />
space
<br />
and equivalently accessed.
<br />
<br />RUSSEL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No - but the system will adjust its model according to feedback. That is
</em><br />
the very nature of any learning algorithm, of which EP is just   one example.
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
Ok. Here's where we find the big assumption. Feedback? HOW?...by who's
<br />
rules? Your rules. This is the real circularity which underpins
<br />
computationalism. It's the circularity that my real physical qualia model
<br />
cuts and kills. Mathematically:
<br />
<br />* You have knowledge KNOWLEDGE(t) of 'out there'
<br />
* You want more knowledge of 'out there' ....so
<br />
* KNOWLEDGE(t+1) is more than KNOWLEDGE(t)
<br />
* in computationalism who defines the necessary route to this?...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d(KNOWLEDGE(t))
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--------------- = something you know = YOU DO.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dt
<br />
<br />So this means that in a computer abstraction.
<br />
<br />d(KNOWLEDGE(t))
<br />
---------------  is already part of KNOWLEDGE(t)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dt
<br />
<br />You can label it 'evolutionary' or 'adaptive' or whatever...ultimately the
<br />
rules are YOUR rules and come from your previously derived KNOWLEDGE(t) of
<br />
'out there', not intrinsically grounded directly in 'out there'. Who
<br />
decided what you don't know? YOU DID. What is it based on? YOUR current
<br />
knowledge of it, not what is literally/really there. Ungroundedness is the
<br />
fatal flaw in the computationalist model. Intrinsic grounding in the
<br />
external world is what qualia are for. It means that
<br />
<br />d(KNOWLEDGE(t))
<br />
---------------
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dt
<br />
<br />is
<br />
(a) built into the brain hardware (plasticity chemistry, out of your
<br />
cognitive control)
<br />
(b) partly grounded in matter literally/directly constructed in
<br />
representation of the external world, reflecting the external world so
<br />
that NOVELTY - true novelty in the OUTSIDE WORLD - is apparent.
<br />
<br />In this way your current knowledge minimally impacts
<br />
<br />d(KNOWLEDGE(t))
<br />
---------------
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dt
<br />
<br />In other words, at the fundamental physics level:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;d(KNOWLEDGE(t))
<br />
---------------
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dt
<br />
<br />in a human brain is NOT part of KNOWLEDGE(t). Qualia are the brain's
<br />
solution to the symbolic grounding problem.
<br />
<br /><br />RUSSEL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not at all. In Evolutionary Programming, very little is known about the
</em><br />
ultimate solution the algorithm comes up with.
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
Yes but that is irrelevant....the programmer said HOW it will get
<br />
there....Sorry...no cigar....see the above....
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; My scientific claim is that the electromagnetic field structure
</em><br />
literally the third person view of qualia.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Eh? Electromagnetic field of what? The brain? If so, do you think that
</em><br />
chemical potentiation plays no role at all in qualia?
<br />
<br />Chemical potentiation IS electric field. There's no such thing as
<br />
'mechanical' there's no such thing as 'chemical'. These are all metaphors
<br />
in certain contexts for what is there...space and charge (yes...and mass
<br />
associated with certain charge carriers). Where did you get this weird
<br />
idea that a metaphor can make qualia?
<br />
<br />The electric field across the membrane of cells (astrocytes and neurons)
<br />
is MASSIVE. MEGAVOLTS/METER. Think SPARKS and LIGHTNIING. It dominates the
<br />
entire structure! It does not have to go anywhere. It just has to 'be'.
<br />
You 'be' it to get what it delivers. Less than 50% of the signalling in
<br />
the brain is synaptic, anyway! The dominant cortical process is actually
<br />
an astrocyte syncytium. (look it up!). I would be very silly to ignore the
<br />
single biggest, most dominant process of the brain that is so far
<br />
completely correlated in every way with qualia...in favour of any other
<br />
cause.
<br />
-------------------
<br />
<br />Once again I'd like to get you to ask yourself the killer question:
<br />
<br />&quot;What is the kind of universe we must live in if the electromagnetic field
<br />
structure of the brain delivers qualia?&quot;
<br />
<br />A. It is NOT the universe depicted by the qualia (atoma, molecules,
<br />
cells...). It is the universe whose innate capacity to deliver qualia is
<br />
taken advantage of when configureed like it appears when we use qualia
<br />
themselves to explore it....cortical brain matter. (NOTE: Please do not
<br />
make the mistake that sensors - peripheral affect -  are equivalent to
<br />
qualia.)
<br />
<br />My original solution to
<br />
<br />Re: How would a computer know if it were conscious?
<br />
<br />stands. The computer must have a qualia-depiction of its external world
<br />
and it will know it because it can do science. If it doesn't/can't it's a
<br />
rock/doorstop. In any computer model, every time an algoritm decides what
<br />
'is' (what is visible/there) it intrisically defines 'what isn't' (what is
<br />
invisible/not there). All novelty becomes thus pre-ordained.
<br />
<br />anyway.....Ultimately 'how' qualia are generated is moot.
<br />
<br />That they are _necessarily_ involved is the key issue. On their own they
<br />
are not sufficient for science to occur.
<br />
<br />cheers
