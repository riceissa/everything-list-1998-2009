Thank you, guys, for 2 parts in this post I cherrish most.
<br />
(I was questioning the endless back-and-forth of these 'bickercussions', but from time to time there is a part that justifies the frustration of reading so much) 
<br />
*
<br />
I leave the part from Stathis' text which I want to copy to another list (with credit to Stathis and this list - if it is not prohibited, pls advise) between dotted lines. 
<br />
Also:
<br />
The remark of Brent opened up a little light in my head (aka activated some photons in the neurons?) about refreshing the 'pilot wave' of D. Bohm as coinciding with Robert Rosen's anticipatory principle. (Bohm's priority). 
<br />
*
<br />
Btw I find 'metaphysics' was a false historical mock-name to reject everything outside the primitive ancient model they called (then) &quot;physics&quot; (the science). Today's physics is many times 'meta', especially when carrying a &quot;Q-name&quot;. I can relate to both of yours remarks. 
<br />
( Theists etc. just wanted to ride that horse in the past.  )
<br />
The wording that emerges in talks about metaphysics is a mixture of the ancient denigration and the up-to-date ideas. Is it still fruitful to argue about a past misnomer?
<br />

<br />
PS. about 'cause' and 'positivists':
<br />
if we accept the random occurrences in the existence, we just waste any effort to identify ANY order (including math). I don't think the 'positivist' is a right (denigrating?)
<br />
word for the idea that everything is (deterministically) interconnected/ interinfluencing any occurrence to 'happen' - maybe not 'causing' just 'directing/facilitating' - entailing in some sense.  JM

<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose it depends on what is covered by the term &quot;metaphysics&quot;. Theists sometimes profess absolute certainty in the face of absolute lack of evidence, and are proud of it. I wouldn't lump this in together with the interpretation of quantum mechanics (I'm sure you wouldn't either, but I thought I'd make the point).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You seem to take metaphysics to be an absolutist theory.  Maybe Tom does too.  But I think of metaphysics to be the interpretation we put on top of our mathematical theories, e.g. Bohm's pilot wave and Feynman's multiple particle paths are two different metaphysics we can use to explain what the formalism of quantum mechanics refers to.  But we're *less* certain about them than about the formalism.  In fact they don't even matter in applications.  Their usefulness, if they have any, is in suggesting extensions to the theory.
