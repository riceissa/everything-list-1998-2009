<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I have said above, it is possible to rigorously define death as occurring 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when there is no successor observer moment, anywhere or ever. This is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case with physical death where there is no surviving copy or where the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surviving copy has diverged from the original, and it is also the case with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory loss.
</em><br />
<br />Then you are claiming that a lot of death occurs in Aussie bars?
<br />
Some really, really plastered guy is told the most *amazing*
<br />
things by a gal who knows he won't remember a word the next
<br />
day. So there are no successor observer moments to his experience
<br />
of hearing these amazing things (about his virility, probably).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Losing a lifetime's memories is equivalent to physical death 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with no surviving copy, so it is certainly a very bad thing.
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Losing a shorter period of memories or dying and leaving behind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a copy made a short time ago might not seem as bad, but I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is only because the &quot;survivor&quot; is unable to remember any loss.
</em><br />
<br />Surely you are *not* saying that it *is* as bad!  The survivors
<br />
who wake up the next morning in their beds unable to recall 
<br />
anything of the previous evening are the same people they were
<br />
the day before and the same people that they were the night
<br />
before. A little memory erasure never seriously hurt anyone.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The situation is not any different to suffering pain and then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having the memory erased; the knowledge that they are about to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; die is for many people even more distressing than physical pain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You argue that the doomed person should not consider himself 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doomed if there is a backup available,
</em><br />
<br />He should think of it *exactly* the way that some guy in a
<br />
bar does, when he realizes that he is sloshed out of his mind.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and certainly you have more chance of convincing him of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than you have of convincing a victim undergoing torture that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he isn't really in pain because his memory will be erased or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he will be killed and a pre-torture copy will take over.
</em><br />
<br />How can you conflate the two?  The latter is clearly a lie
<br />
---it's absurd to say to someone who is in pain that he or
<br />
she is not in pain.
<br />
<br />Now if the person is in pain because you're pointing your
<br />
disintegrator ray gun at him and are about to pull the
<br />
trigger---well, then, it should all depend on what he
<br />
knows.  If he happens to *know* that there is a backup
<br />
of him made just a few hours before, then he really 
<br />
should (logically) consider it to be the same as being
<br />
in an Aussie bar.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nevertheless, I would still be upset if I were about to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; die, unless I knew that my mind was being backed up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuously, so that no experiences are lost.
</em><br />
<br />More upset than you would be if some of your pals managed
<br />
to talk you into a wild night on the town with plenty of
<br />
booze and---just to cinch it---plenty of midazolam?
<br />
<br />Being replaced by a backup, or losing memories, from the
<br />
viewpoint of physics, they're equivalently bad for you.
<br />
And that's not very bad.
<br />
<br />Lee
