<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ha!  Well, maybe.  What is the flaw that you see in my reasoning?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that both the argument and conclusion are rational, just not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuitive.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't see the theory. What do you ask us to agree on, if only for  
<br />
the sake of the argument.
<br />
In the conclusion I don't understand the last sentence, which seems to  
<br />
me a proposition for abandoning theorizing in that field.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So earlier you asked this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; By the way, what is the status of your theory with respect to comp?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which in part prompted this new thread.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I think that one of the things that we can be conscious of is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descriptive theory referred to as &quot;comp&quot; that attempts to map the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contents of our &quot;conscious experience over time&quot; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematically/logically defined &quot;machines&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />No, comp is a &quot;theology&quot; in which you believe that you can survive a  
<br />
concrete artificial brain/body transplants.
<br />
comp does not attempt this, it presupposes a level where it can be  
<br />
done. Among the first consequences appears the fact that such an  
<br />
attempt provably necessitates an act of faith.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And, I will not be surprised if you or someone else is ultimately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successful in doing so.
</em><br />
<br />Being successful here means only being able to explain (physical)  
<br />
observations. It is already successful in explaining the existence of  
<br />
sensations, and in situating quanta with respect to qualia.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But while this would be interesting, I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think that it means anything deeper.  All that it will mean is &quot;look,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here's an interesting way of representing the contents of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious experience over time&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Not at all, the comp theory, thanks to its Church Thesis part, and  
<br />
some mathematical logic, is particularly cautious in distinguishing  
<br />
the representation and the represented, and what will and will not  
<br />
depend on the choice of representations. By definition of comp we bet  
<br />
that there is a digital representation correct with respect to the  
<br />
most probable local universal number, or computation, but the comp  
<br />
theory, which is just computer science/number theory/mathematical  
<br />
logic will still take the many nuances into account.
<br />
For example: it is a theorem, not depending of the choice of any  
<br />
representation that all universal machines have to have a local  
<br />
representation to develop a third person notion.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would just be a way of representing what &quot;is&quot;.  By which I mean:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would just be a way of representing conscious experience.
</em><br />
<br />Comp explains, or if you prefer, the Löbian machine can already  
<br />
explains, about simpler Löbian machines, why those simpler machine  
<br />
cannot represent their notions of truth and consciousness.  
<br />
Consciousness of machine M is not representable by machine M.
<br />
Comp provides a theory of consciousness, and this theory prevents us  
<br />
to represent our consciousness, except by betting on a sufficiently  
<br />
low level description and making an act of faith. A Löbian machine, I  
<br />
recall, is a universal machine which can prove (in technical weak  
<br />
sense) that she is universal. Most known Löbian machine are Peano  
<br />
Arithmetic and Zermelo Frankel Set Theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would say that consciousness has a reason, a purpose, and a power.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A reason: the many universal numbers and the way they reflect each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This doesn't sound like a &quot;reason&quot; to me.  It sounds like an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observation, along the lines of &quot;adjacent gray and white veins exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within this block of granite&quot; (from my original post).
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is a theorem in arithmetic. It is a reason, in the sense that if  
<br />
you agree with some axioms of arithmetic, you can agree that those  
<br />
universal numbers exist, and contemplate a sequence of unexpected  
<br />
facts about them.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A purpose: truth quest, satisfaction quest.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This purpose would only exist as part of someone's conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience.  The desire for truth and/or satisfaction are things that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only exist in the context of conscious experience.
</em><br />
<br />OK. No problem.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A  power: relative self-acceleration (can lead to catastrophes, (like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all power)).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by this.
</em><br />
<br />Hmm... I refer often to another result by Gödel, or similar discovered  
<br />
by Blum and others in computer science, that universal machine/number  
<br />
are infinity accelerable, and that lobian machine can shorten  
<br />
arbitrarily the length of infinities of theorems. Consciousness can be  
<br />
related by the inference of self-consistency, and it makes the machine  
<br />
able to add that consistency as new belief leading to a new machine  
<br />
provably more powerful, in its communicating or proving abilities, in  
<br />
the length or speed of proofs, and the same occur for its anticipating  
<br />
abilities, by a theorem of Royer.
<br />
Consciousness has probably developed with the relatively self-moving  
<br />
entities for letting them anticipate their neighborhoods more and more  
<br />
quickly. Comp explain both the role of consciousness and the reason  
<br />
why we cannot really defined it or capture the notion in any formal  
<br />
theory. Consciousness escapes representation, but feed on  
<br />
representations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Physicists explain by finding elegant laws relating the quanta we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; measure, but fail indeed linking those quanta to the qualia we live,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and fail saying where those quanta comes from. But computer science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; suggest a solution, we are universal machine mirroring doing science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;automatically&quot; betting on &quot;big picture&quot; all the time, relatively to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; other possible universal machines.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So our machineness precedes our conscious experience?
</em><br />
<br />Assuming comp:
<br />
&nbsp;From the third person sharable ontology you are right. First the  
<br />
numbers, then consciousness.
<br />
&nbsp;From the first person point of view it is the contrary. First  
<br />
consciousness, then the numbers.
<br />
Both view, although contradictories, fit well with what a Löbian  
<br />
machine can already explain about itself.
<br />
(and fit well with Plotinus amanation/conversion transform
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Machines are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more fundamental than consciousness?  Or machines are just a way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representing conscious experience?
</em><br />
<br />Machines/numbers cannot represent conscious experiences. They may live  
<br />
them, assuming comp.
<br />
They can represent piece of computation, but, those are not  
<br />
computation, they are representation of computation. No consciousness  
<br />
there. It is a key point to get UDA-8 (the movie graph, MGA).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Then theoretical computer science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can explain why we feel consciousness unexplainable and explain its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reason, purpose and power.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see that it explains anything.
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br />It explains why machine can feel consciousness uncaused, like if they  
<br />
could remember in a first person way their belongness to arithmetic.  
<br />
Lobian machine can explain a &quot;strangely similar&quot; for simpler or  
<br />
actually any &quot;definably correct by definition&quot; Löbian machine. They  
<br />
can study themselves and explore their ignorance space.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Though it may be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; useful/enjoyable way of thinking about the contents of our conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This explains the mind, but we get the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; problem of justifying the computability and the existence of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical laws from a vast set of computations. The white rabbits and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; white noises.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So it seems to me that you aren't explaining the fact that we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences.
</em><br />
<br />I think this is what comp explain the best, thanks to the (rather  
<br />
incredible) discovery of the universal machine(s), and then by the  
<br />
work of Gödel, Löb, Solovay, for those universal machines which know  
<br />
their are universal.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It seems to me that you are focused entirely on finding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a way of generating mathematical/logical representations of what you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I experience that doesn't also generate representations of strange
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; white-rabbit experiences.
</em><br />
<br />I reduce the mind-body into a body problem.
<br />
<br />What I say is just: oh look, if brain works like machine then we have  
<br />
to justify the appearance of physical laws by numbers only&quot;. This is  
<br />
UDA. And then I add, &quot;oh look thanks to Gödel, Löb and Solovay we can  
<br />
already chat with the Lobian machine, and ask her opinion, and she can  
<br />
already explain some feature of physics, up to now confirmed by  
<br />
Quantum Mechanics.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Those universal machine are self-multiplying and self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; differencing infinitely often in arithmetic. This is a big price: if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we are machine (a theory which explains consciousness as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; unconscious bet on a reality), we have to explain the physical laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from computer science and logic alone.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The physical laws can't be explained except in terms of other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unexplained laws, as mentioned in my previous post.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course. Without theory (axioms) we cannot explain anything. But  
<br />
here the unexplained laws are just succession, addition, and  
<br />
multiplication. Without them or equivalent, we just cannot get them.
<br />
<br />Any one believing that the concept of prime number makes sense,  
<br />
already believe in the theory. With comp, we can say that the theory  
<br />
of everything is already taught in high school, although not presented  
<br />
in that way, of course.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Though, I'd say that physical laws can't be explained because they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only exist in our perceptions,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Comp forces us to (re)define physics as what is first person  
<br />
observable by ALL universal machine.
<br />
Physics loses its status of fundamental science, but is elevated as  
<br />
sharable laws of arithmetic (&quot;seen from inside&quot;).
<br />
All the rest is contingent geographies.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; which are themselves uncaused and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore unexplainable.
</em><br />
<br />They are uncaused &quot;physically&quot;, but comp explains their logic- 
<br />
arithmetical origin, which is beyond time and space. Indeed time and  
<br />
space appears as inside first person psycho-theo-bio-logical category  
<br />
(a place where people can easily fight on voacabularies).
<br />
Consciousness is a mathematical phenomenon, a fixed point of self- 
<br />
doubting, an elementary belief in a reality if not the reality of the  
<br />
doubter.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But now that explanation can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; tested in nature, making that theory refutable. And this illustrates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we don't have to abandon rationalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the rational conclusion from what we perceive is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious experience is fundamental and uncaused.
</em><br />
<br />Comp can make the conscious experience much more fundamental than the  
<br />
Aristotelian materialist usually think, yet consciousness is  
<br />
arithmetically &quot;caused&quot;. It is an attribute of universal machine (in  
<br />
an even weaker sense than usual) related to their ideal self- 
<br />
consistency. It generates the belief in a reality, and the infinities  
<br />
of corrections which ensue.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are saying that consciousness is NOT fundamental, and thus it IS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; caused.  By...numbers?
</em><br />
<br />Together with succession, addition and multiplication. In classical  
<br />
logic.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that you are mistaking representation for causation.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think so at all. On the contrary, I even distinguish a  
<br />
computation and a representation of a computation, like I distinguish  
<br />
numbers and their relation with representations of numbers and  
<br />
representations of their relations. It is where mathematical logicians  
<br />
have an advantage, because such distinction is the key to comprehend  
<br />
most results in logic.
<br />
I know some have still problem with this in step 07 and 8, and that's  
<br />
why I propose a few math and logic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers exist in some platonic sense, and can be related in a way that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be seen as mirroring, representing, or even predicting my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious experience...I think that all this shows is that math/logic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a really flexible tool for representing processes, relationships,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; patterns, etc.
</em><br />
<br />I am afraid you underestimate mathematical logic. I would defined it  
<br />
here as the science of the relation between realities and their  
<br />
possible representations. Comp makes possible to, exploit this to put  
<br />
many light on the hard problem of consciousness. It explains there is  
<br />
a an unbridgeable personal third person gap, and how the first person  
<br />
can bridge it, yet.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As far as the significance of accurate predictions, I refer you back
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the last paragraph of my original post.  You read the part about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the granite block, right?  Though, I do need to find some more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; succinct way of stating that point that doesn't require the setup of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the preceding paragraphs.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmmm.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ALSO, this discussion between Sean Carroll and Mark Trodden was great,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I think goes with my original post pretty well, especially the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; last third of their discussion.

<br /><br />I did not see the relation with consciousness. Physicsts, thanks to  
<br />
Everett and decoherence explains rather well the disappearance of the  
<br />
observable white rabbits, and this in a elegant way (phases  
<br />
randomization of waves of coherent interactions), this may explain why  
<br />
apparently we live in a quantum universal machine. My point is just  
<br />
that if you &quot;say yes to the digital medication&quot;, then we have to  
<br />
justify that quantum universal machine from a sum on all classical  
<br />
computations.
<br />
<br />Bit from qubit, is already understood,
<br />
I say comp gives an inverse, Qubit from bit, and that its main  
<br />
usefulness is that the inverse is enriched by its distinction between  
<br />
the sharable quanta and its incommunicable qualia extension. This is  
<br />
AUDA where the modalities are given by two mathematical theories of  
<br />
self-reference G and G*.
<br />
<br />Assuming comp you can no more invoke quantum fluctuations, you have to  
<br />
derive them from universal specification. That works not too bad.
<br />
<br />I don't like the idea to consider matter as fundamental, 'cause I want  
<br />
an explanation there.
<br />
I don't like the idea to put consciousness as fundamental, ' cause I  
<br />
want an explanation, there too.
<br />
<br />I like numbers and their relations as fundamental, because many  
<br />
persons can share them, and tshare heir beliefs on them, and yet  
<br />
numbers and their relation have been discovered to lead to  
<br />
uncomputable richness. Besides, betting on comp makes me bet that I  
<br />
am , well not really one of them, but (one of them) multiplied by  
<br />
infinities.
<br />
<br />Comp invites to study theoretical computer science.
<br />
<br />And computer can already shows us the infinite complex border of a  
<br />
simple universal thing, like an iterated enlargement of the Mandelbrot  
<br />
