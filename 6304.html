<br />
The core concept (which is somewhat muddled by the way I described 
<br />
it) is that we live in a 4 axis universe, but we visualize it as a 3 axis
<br />
+ linear time (i.e. viewing time as &quot;motion&quot;, a linear series of events)
<br />
&nbsp;because we appear to be on a time-line due to the nature of 
<br />
consciousness.  Realizing time is a 4th axis, and not just linear, opens 
<br />
up the understanding that we live in a multiverse.
<br />
<br />Horizontal + Vertical axis = area, add depth = volume, add time axis = multiverse space, hyperspace, whatever (but it is a higher space than just volume)
<br />
<br />The multiverse exists in the time axis.  If the time axis is symmetrical to the other axes, the higher space information storage capacity would fill the volume of a cube of space along our world line.  3 axes = 10^200, 4 axes = 10^300.  So if we could see the area of space across the time axis (across the multiverse), we would see 10^300 information.  But we do not have access to anything but our world line, so this axis is excluded= 10^200 (The Holigraphic principle).
<br />
<br />So why did I get all twisted around trying to explain the mental image I had all along that time is a fourth axis which creates a higher space than volume that is the space the multiverse exists in?  It is very hard to imagine a spatial quantity above volume, and I kept wanting to refer to it as a &quot;time area&quot; or a &quot;volume of time&quot; which greatly complicates the issue, because obviously it sounds like I am referring to typical 2 axis area or 3 axis volume. 
<br />
<br /><br />Imagine you have no knowledge of the physics of our universe, but mathematical knowledge.  You are told that you are about to enter a 4 axis universe, but that the nature of your experience would make it seem you had the freedom to move about in 3 axes, but were stuck on a fixed motion along a line in the fourth axis.  What predictions would you make about your experience?  The two that come to mind for me are:  It will be very difficult for me to appreciate the true size of this universe; and some observations will make it appear there is a higher dimension, given my failure to appreciate the fourth axis is really more than linear.
<br />
<br />The holographic principle is just such an 
<br />
observation- it implies we live in a universe with a higher dimension.  
<br />
Viewing time as an axis instead of a line, that higher dimension may be 
<br />
the area created by the time axis (the multiverse).
<br />
<br />&quot;This is the distinctive core of the quantum concept of time: Other times are just special cases of other universes&quot; - David Deutsch, FOR, p. 278.
<br />
<br />My follow up:  Other outcomes/worlds are other universes beyond our world-line on the time axis.
<br />
