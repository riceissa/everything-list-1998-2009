<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Would you say that because you think running multiple identical copies of a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given mind in parallel doesn't necessarily increase the absolute measure of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those observer-moments (that would be my opinion)...
</em><br />
<br />Here is an argument I wrote a couple of years ago on another list
<br />
that first made me think that copies count, that is, that having more
<br />
identical copies should be considered to increase measure.  Previously I
<br />
was skeptical about it, I thought what mattered was whether something
<br />
or someone got instantiated at all, not how many there were.  And of
<br />
course since then I not only believe that copies count, I have followed
<br />
my logic to the absurd sounding conclusion that size and slowness increase
<br />
measure as well.
<br />
<br />Consider an experiment where we are simulating someone and can give
<br />
them either a good or bad experience.  These are not replays, they are
<br />
new experiences which we can accurately anticipate will be pleasant
<br />
or unpleasant.
<br />
<br />Suppose we are going to flip a biased quantum coin, one which has a 90%
<br />
chance of coming up heads.  We will generate the good or bad experience
<br />
depending on the outcome of the coin flip.  I claim that it is obvious
<br />
that it is better to give the good experience when we get the 90% outcome
<br />
and the bad experience when we get the 10% outcome.  That's the assumption
<br />
I will start with.
<br />
<br />Now consider Tegmark's level 1 of parallelism, the fact that in a
<br />
sufficiently large volume of space I can find a large number of copies
<br />
of me, in fact copies of the entire earth and our entire visible universe
<br />
(the &quot;Hubble bubble&quot;?).  When I do my quantum coin flip, 90% of the copies
<br />
will see it come up heads and cause the good experience for the subject,
<br />
and 10% will see tails and cause the bad experience.
<br />
<br />I will also assume that my knowledge of this fact about the physical
<br />
universe will not change my mind about the ethical value of my decision
<br />
to give the good experience for the 90% outcome.
<br />
<br />Now the problem is this.  There are really only two different programs
<br />
being run for our experimental subject, the guy in the simulation.  One is
<br />
a good experience and one is bad.  All my decision does is to change how
<br />
many copies of each of these two programs are run.  In making my decision
<br />
about which experiences to assign to the two coin flip outcomes, I have
<br />
chosen that the copies of the good experience will outnumber copies of
<br />
the bad experience by 9 to 1.
<br />
<br />But if I don't believe that the number of copies being run makes a
<br />
difference, then I haven't accomplished what I desired.  The fact that
<br />
I am running more copies of the good program than the bad wouldn't make
<br />
any difference.  Therefore there is no actual ethical value in what I
<br />
have done, I might have just as validly reversed the outcome of my coin
<br />
flips and it wouldn't have made any difference.
<br />
<br />In this way I reach a contradiction between the belief that the number
<br />
of copies doesn't matter, the belief that the existence of distant
<br />
parallel copies of myself doesn't make much difference in what I should
<br />
do, and the idea that there is value in making people happy.  Of these,
<br />
the most questionable seems to be the assumption that copies don't matter,
<br />
so this line of reasoning turns me away from that belief.
<br />
<br />I can come up with similar contradictions from simpler cases like
<br />
our own observations of subjective probability.  The fact that I do
<br />
experience a subjective 90% chance of seeing the quantum coin come
<br />
up heads corresponds very well with the fact that 90% of the copies
<br />
of me will see heads - but only if I assume that the multiplicity of
<br />
the copies matters.  After the coin flip, in a certain voume of space
<br />
there are 90 copies of me that see heads and 10 copies that see tails.
<br />
But within the two groups all copies are identical (neglecting other
<br />
quantum events which would further split me).  If the multiplicity
<br />
doesn't count, then there are really just two outcomes and I might
<br />
expect to subjectively experience equal probability for them.
<br />
<br />This is a variant on an old argument against the MWI, but in that case I
<br />
always felt the answer was &quot;measure&quot;, that some of the outcomes occured
<br />
in a quantum branch which had this intangible quality which made it count
<br />
more.  In this case I can't invoke any such magic; all the copies of me
<br />
are running in the same universe and with equal quantum amplitude.  I have
<br />
to resort to counting the instances separately and assuming that each one
<br />
makes its own independent contribution to my subjective experiences, in
<br />
order to gain correspondence with subjective probability.  Therefore it
<br />
is most consistent to say that separate runs of identical programs do
<br />
&quot;count&quot;, they do add to the measure of the subjective experience.
