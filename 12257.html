<br />
Bruno,
<br />
<br />I have been doing a lot of reading/thinking on your former posts on the
<br />
Hypostases, other reading on Plotinus and the neo-Platonist hypostases,
<br />
and the Christian &quot;interpretation&quot; of the hypostases.  There is a lot
<br />
to say, but I'll start by just giving some responses to your last post
<br />
on this.
<br />
<br />On Dec 11, 8:46 am, Bruno Marchal
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that the problem of evil (and thus the equivalent problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Good) is interesting. Of course it is not well addressed by the two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current theories of everything: Loop gravity and String theory. With
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that respect the comp hyp can at least shed some light on it, and of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course those &quot;light&quot; are of the platonic-plotinus type where the notion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of goodness necessitates the notion of truth to begin with. I say more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; below.
</em><br />
<br />The discussions over the last two weeks on Evil, and just how to define
<br />
good and bad, underscore how puzzling this problem can be.  I agree
<br />
that at the base of this is the question, &quot;What is Truth?&quot;  I am not
<br />
satisfied with the Theaetetus definition, or Tarski's &quot;trick&quot;.  I
<br />
believe the answer to the question, &quot;What is Truth?&quot; which Pilate asked
<br />
Jesus, was standing right in front of Pilate: Jesus himself.  The
<br />
Christian definition of truth goes back to the core of everything, who
<br />
is personal.  As I've said before, without a personal core, the word
<br />
&quot;personal&quot; has lost its meaning.  In the context nowadays of
<br />
impersonal-based philosophy, &quot;personal&quot; has come to &quot;mean&quot; something
<br />
like &quot;without rational basis&quot;.  But when the personal IS the basis, not
<br />
an impersonal concept of personal, but the ultimate Person, and with
<br />
man being made in the image of that ultimate Person, we have a basis
<br />
for truth, personality, rationality, good...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Note also that the major critics by the neoplatonists on Aristotle,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; besides their diverging opinions on the nature of matter, is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; non-person character of the big unnameable, but then for Plotinus the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;second God&quot; (the second primary hypostase is &quot;personal&quot;), and indeed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; G* has a personal aspect from the point of view of the machine. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (comp agree) with Plotinus  that the big first cannot be a person. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; second one can. To be sure Plotinus is not always completely clear on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that point (especially on his chapter on free-will).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; None of Plotinus' hypostases are both personal and free from evil (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; well as infinite, which we agree is needed (but not sufficient, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; maintain!) for the problem of meaning).
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is a key point. I agree. None of Plotinus hypostases are both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal and free from &quot;evil/good&quot;. Finding an arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation of the hypostases could then give a hope toward an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation of goodness and evil.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please note that 7/8 of the hypostases are &quot;personal-views&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I'll just deal with the first 4 hypostases, since this is the basis of
<br />
the rest, even though my John quote below addresses the others also.
<br />
<br />Perhaps the neo-Platonists couldn't see how the core could be personal
<br />
(even though Plato called it the &quot;Good&quot;). It is hard to accept that the
<br />
core could be both infinite and personal (and good), since our view of
<br />
personality is finite (and flawed). But the infinite personal core, God
<br />
the Father, which replaces the neo-Platonist &quot;ONE&quot; or 0-person (of
<br />
course I maintain that the replacing was in the other direction :),
<br />
answers the big question of the origin of all other persons (and
<br />
consciousness).
<br />
<br />You mentioned to Brent that perhaps invoking the second-person is a way
<br />
of explaining the origin of &quot;personal&quot; aspects.  In a way this is true,
<br />
in that our earthly fathers/mothers and others take part as persons in
<br />
developing us as persons.  But there has to be an ultimate source.  And
<br />
in the Christian &quot;interpretation&quot; the ultimate source of all
<br />
first-person level experience (neo-Platonist &quot;ALL-SOUL&quot; or
<br />
&quot;UNIVERSAL-SOUL&quot;) could be said to be God the Holy Spirit.  He fills in
<br />
the gaps when we cannot find words to talk to him.
<br />
<br />Then, the real clincher is the third person point of view, the
<br />
neo-Platonist &quot;INTELLECT&quot;.  The personal God did not stay silent and
<br />
keep all of this personhood stuff at a purely theoretical level which
<br />
we would have to take with blind faith.  Instead the hopes of the
<br />
neo-Platonists were fulfilled in the Christ (Messiah) whose name was
<br />
Emmanuel which means &quot;God with us&quot;, who was the &quot;wisdom and power of
<br />
God&quot;.  &quot;In the beginning was the Word (Logos), and the Word was with
<br />
God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through
<br />
him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been
<br />
made. In him was life, and that life was the light of men. The light
<br />
shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it... The
<br />
Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his
<br />
glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of
<br />
grace and truth.&quot; (John 3:1,2,3,14)  So the particular finite form that
<br />
we have, God somehow took on that same form.  In this way God showed us
<br />
(who are in his image) true truth about himself in a way which we can
<br />
understand (just as a father tells truth to his children), without
<br />
having to tell us infinite exhaustive truth.  This bridges the gap
<br />
between the celestial/divine and the terrestial/human.  Christ is the
<br />
fixed-point between heaven and earth, the axis of the universe for us.
<br />
In Christ, we all see in third-person the Way, the Truth and the Life.
<br />
<br />It's late, so I'll stop here.
<br />
<br />Joyeux Noel!
<br />
<br />Tom
