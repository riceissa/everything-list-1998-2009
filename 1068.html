<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; comp2 contradicts comp1 because the essence of comp1 is the independance of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the results with respect to the material implementation, whereas comp2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; requires the precize definition of this implementation (of course the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simulation made in comp2 could be runned on any TM, but the object of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simulation must be one precise physical system).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't see that as necessarily true.  Couldn't comp2 be an ensemble of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computations, each of which represents one &quot;universe&quot;, or one set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical laws?  We are interested in that ensemble which contains SASs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that can be mapped to ourselves.  So we can be existing in multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes simultaneously.
</em><br />
<br />GH:
<br />
<br />In different universes, the exact definition of &quot;we&quot; is somewhat subjective
<br />
(see previous mails) but it doesn't matter.
<br />
Of course if you accept comp2, each computation can be &quot;mapped&quot; to a
<br />
Universe, (however you have a big uncertainty in how to do this mapping,
<br />
because all simulations of a physical Universe assumes a preexisting
<br />
physical law, that was my point 1). But now comp1 is false, i.e. the brain
<br />
is NOT like a computer, storing ALL the necessary information at a much
<br />
higher level than its physical structure. It can NOT be duplicated by
<br />
another physical structure (or if comp2 is true, by a computation coding
<br />
another physical structure).
<br />
<br />CM:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Even if not, I don't follow your reasoning that comp1 is contradicted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;When you say &quot;of course the simulation made in comp2 could be running
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on any TM&quot;, I understand that to be thing in comp1 that you are saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is contradicted.  So where's the problem, exactly?
</em><br />
<br />GH:
<br />
see above. I repeat: the necessary information is stored in the entire
<br />
physical structure (analogic, or digitally modelized) which is the contrary
<br />
of comp1 (as I have expressed it).
<br />
<br />What I stress here is that comp2 goes much farther than the idea that you
<br />
can make a digital computation on any platform. When you let a normal
<br />
computer run, you have basically two levels of information : the
<br />
information I1 stored in its memory bits  (a few tens of Mo, say) and the
<br />
physical information I2 in its physical structure, which is enormously
<br />
larger, but irrelevant for the most part for the computation.
<br />
<br />The information stored in I1 is enough to determine exactly the
<br />
computation.  The physical information I2 is more tricky. If you calculate
<br />
it by the physical entropy, you will get around the number of atoms 10^23,
<br />
but this physical information is limited by the quantum uncertainty, i.e.
<br />
you forget any detail beyond the Heisenberg inequality. This is perfectly
<br />
compatible with the impossibility of measuring the quantum state. However
<br />
if you want to calculate deterministically the quantum evolution, you must
<br />
describe the wave function with much more accuracy, although this accuracy
<br />
is not measurable experimentally! For example if you want to describe the
<br />
wavefunction at a Planck scale length, you need a factor (l(de
<br />
Broglie)/l(Planck))^3 = 10^75 (say) more information, although this
<br />
information is completely hidden in reality.
<br />
<br />There is so a fundamental difference between digital computers, for which
<br />
I1 exists and is self-consistently determining EXACTLY its evolution, and
<br />
so can be duplicated independantly of I2, and analogic ones where I1 can
<br />
exist but is insufficient to predict its evolution (in this case, I1 is in
<br />
general observer dependant, it is only a partial information ,e.g. the
<br />
speed of the wind and the temperature of the atmosphere at selected points,
<br />
etc...) The required information I2&gt;&gt;I1 necessary to predict the real
<br />
evolution is
<br />
a) depending on physical laws
<br />
b) hence still unknown  (we don't know the physical laws of the Universe)
<br />
c) unlless I1, probably far beyond all possible measurements due to the
<br />
quantum nature of the world.
<br />
<br />* comp1 states only that the brain (more exactly here the consciousness)
<br />
implements EXACTLY a digital computation as defined above, which can be
<br />
obtained by any machine with an  equivalent information I1, whatever its
<br />
physical information I2 is (like computer programs).
<br />
<br />*comp2 recognizes that comp1 is false. Note that there IS actually a low
<br />
information content I1 in the brain (&quot;low&quot; means here of course  much lower
<br />
than the quantum detailed information. It is still higher than all what our
<br />
computers can store!), which determines our conscious state, our memory,
<br />
etc... that does NOT appear to be very sensitive to the microscopic state
<br />
since our neurons are constantly changing, dying, etc...without strong
<br />
changes in our thought. However, it is not &quot;digital&quot; enough to be exactly
<br />
predicted at this level.
<br />
&nbsp;comp2 assumes that
<br />
a) there is a level I2&gt;&gt;I1 for which the evolution of I1 can be exactly
<br />
reproduced.
<br />
b) ALL physical properties (or at least, consciousness) are conserved
<br />
through a simulation of I2 with a digital machine (whose physical
<br />
information I3, of course, is much larger than I2 !!)
<br />
<br />Do you agree that it is a very strong assumption,which is not obvious at all?
<br />
<br />For example if I do a simulation of the sun in my computer, I can reproduce
<br />
rather exactly the temperature, luminosity, pressure etc... of its
<br />
interior, but my computer will not trigger a neutrino detector !! Why
<br />
should a digital simulation of the physical state of my brain, or best of
<br />
THE WAY I AM REPRESENTING the physical state of my brain, have the same
<br />
&quot;intrinsic&quot; properties as the brain itself?
<br />
<br />CM:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I disagree completely with your analysis in the last paragraph.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Chinese room thought experiment, as well as Maudlin's argument, are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entirely bogus.  In short, let me try to explain why.  Let me draw an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;analogy between the common-sense view of physical reality and your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;library&quot; example.  In the former, there are physical laws which govern
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the motion and interaction of innumerable sub-atomic particles in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brain, which map in some way into a computation.
</em><br />
<br />GH:
<br />
I disagree also. The motion and interaction of sub-atomic particles are not
<br />
THE physical reality. It is one way by which we can represent
<br />
(approximately) the reality. BTW in Quantum Field Theory it is extremely
<br />
hard to imagine the quantum state as a collection of &quot;real&quot; particle, and
<br />
we have definitely no theory to represent all particles + interactions
<br />
including gravitation. The reality itself is unknown. Taking the physical
<br />
laws for the reality is just as taking the characters of a movie as real
<br />
persons- physical laws are just a little bit more accurate.
<br />
<br />CM:
<br />
&nbsp;They map as surely
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as a macroscopic digital computer maps -- but in a much more complicated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and diffuse way.
</em><br />
<br />GH:
<br />
<br />No, for the last reason. A REPRESENTATION of reality can be mapped (in
<br />
general approximately) by a computation, not the unknown reality itself. A
<br />
digital computer is built to implement exactly  computations (without
<br />
approximations, except residual bugs in Pentium...), and so cannot be
<br />
exactly equivalent to reality.
<br />
<br />Note that Bruno's conclusions is that the reality does not exist at all !!!
<br />
I think it exists but it is beyond any representation.
<br />
<br />CM:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the latter (your library example), you have to consider the entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system - library, books, you, the food you'd eat - everything.  Then you'd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;find that that entire system maps onto a computation by virtue of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actions you'd take in performing your job.  So I'd say that the system as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a whole is conscious.  It might be a ridiculously precarious consciousness -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as you say - you might not be very reliable in doing your job.  But that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would, I'd suggest, be analogous to (in the common-sense physics view)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;having a fatal disease that could kill me at any second.
</em><br />
<br />GH:
<br />
You did not answer me on what I have actually to do for this job for you to
<br />
live!!
<br />
<br />CM:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A third and last difficulty is that comp2 does not solve the problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness. For if everything is assimilable to computations, what makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some computations or parts of computations conscious or not (see Wei)? So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; how to found Bruno's &quot;computational psychology&quot; ? What is the dream of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; string? Complexity is not enough, because for example the chemical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; evolution of a thinking brain is not more complex to that of a dead brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; leading to putrefaction. At the analogic level of comp2, you have lost the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; information level of comp1 ! I agree that the problem is the same with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; materialism - I just point out that it is not easier with comp2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Asking a rhetorical question, &quot;what makes some computations or parts of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computations conscious or not,&quot; is not the same as a refutation.  I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;see how you have presented any problem about comp2 in this preceding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;paragraph.
</em><br />
<br />GH: Here I just stress that asking &quot;what makes some computations or parts of
<br />
computations conscious or not,&quot; is a priori not simpler than asking &quot;what
<br />
makes some physical systems or parts of physical systems conscious or
<br />
not,&quot;, so comp2 does not simplify this problem. I see some unconsistency in
<br />
thinking that consciousness can be produced by computations of physical
<br />
laws that do not exist!
<br />
<br />CM:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So I think that pure computationalism, either comp1 or comp2, is very hard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to maintain. Another comp3 proposition?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; One remark is that all &quot;thinking&quot; devices based on digital simulations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the analogic state of the brain handle in fact much more (and too much)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; information than the brain itself, which is totally unaware of its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; material structure. A very important fact is that they ALL require an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; external structure able to store the relevant information and program them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; adequately, which is NOT the case of actual brains (and I guess of possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; future thinking machines).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What!!???  Of course the program being run by a brain requires an external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structure - the brain!  What do you mean by this last paragraph?
</em><br />
<br />GH:
<br />
I meant here that the physical laws governing the activity of the brain are
<br />
the same that those governing its very formation, and the brain is
<br />
&quot;building itself&quot; without any OTHER pre-storage of its information content.
<br />
I suspect it is a requirement for a conscious system to actually
<br />
work...(not proven of course!)
