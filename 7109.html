</em><br />
<br />It is kind of interesting, but I particularly noted a segment which can
<br />
be thought of as addressing some of the issues of thinking of the needs
<br />
of observer-moments vs those of observers:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just last month, a team led by Nobel-prizewinning psychologist Daniel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kahneman of Princeton University unveiled a new tool for sizing up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happiness: the day-reconstruction method. Participants fill out a long
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diary and questionnaire detailing everything they did on the previous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; day and whom they were with at the time and rating a range of feelings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during each episode (happy, impatient, depressed, worried, tired, etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on a seven-point scale. The method was tested on a group of 900 women in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Texas with some surprising results. It turned out that the five most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; positive activities for these women were (in descending order) sex,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; socializing, relaxing, praying or meditating, and eating. Exercising and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; watching TV were not far behind. But way down the list was &quot;taking care
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of my children,&quot; which ranked below cooking and only slightly above
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; housework.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That may seem surprising, given that people frequently cite their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; children as their biggest source of delight--which was a finding of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; TIME poll on happiness conducted last month. When asked, &quot;What one thing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in life has brought you the greatest happiness?&quot;, 35% said it was their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; children or grandchildren or both. (Spouse was far behind at just 9%,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and religion a runner-up at 17%.) The discrepancy with the study of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Texas women points up one of the key debates in happiness research:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which kind of information is more meaningful--global reports of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well-being (&quot;My life is happy, and my children are my greatest joy&quot;) or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more specific data on enjoyment of day-to-day experiences (&quot;What a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; night! The kids were such a pain!&quot;)? The two are very different, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; studies show they do not correlate well. Our overall happiness is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; merely the sum of our happy moments minus the sum of our angry or sad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones.
</em><br />
<br />The point here is that the actual OMs you are experiencing may be
<br />
unhappy, but you may have a sense as a person, an observer, that you
<br />
are in fact happy.  Now, in this particular case, I think it is more a
<br />
matter of social pressure to say that you love your children and they
<br />
bring you joy.  Everyone knows you are supposed to say this and think
<br />
it, and so people do say this and maybe even convince themselves that it
<br />
is true.  Someone who said, no, my children are a negative in my life,
<br />
they are a source of stress and a total pain to deal with, would be
<br />
thought something of a monster.  No one wants that for themself.
<br />
<br />But I think the overall point about OMs versus memories as an observer
<br />
still applies, and the article goes into it further:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is true whether you are looking at how satisfied you are with your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life in general or with something more specific, such as your kids, your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; car, your job or your vacation. Kahneman likes to distinguish between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the experiencing self and the remembering self. His studies show that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what you remember of an experience is particularly influenced by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emotional high and low points and by how it ends. So, if you were to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; randomly beep someone on vacation in Italy, you might catch that person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; waiting furiously for a slow-moving waiter to take an order or grousing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the high cost of the pottery. But if you ask when it's over, &quot;How
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was the vacation in Italy?&quot;, the average person remembers the peak
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moments and how he or she felt at the end of the trip.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The power of endings has been demonstrated in some remarkable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments by Kahneman. One such study involved people undergoing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; colonoscopy, an uncomfortable procedure in which a flexible scope is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moved through the colon. While a control group had the standard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; procedure, half the subjects endured an extra 60 seconds during which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the scope was held stationary; movement of the scope is typically the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; source of the discomfort. It turned out that members of the group that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had the somewhat longer procedure with a benign ending found it less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unpleasant than the control group, and they were more willing to have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; repeat colonoscopy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Asking people how happy they are, Kahneman contends, &quot;is very much like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; asking them about the colonoscopy after it's over. There's a lot that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; escapes them.&quot; Kahneman therefore believes that social scientists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; studying happiness should pay careful attention to people's actual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences rather than just survey their reflections. That, he feels,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is especially relevant if research is to inform quality-of-life policies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like how much money our society should devote to parks and recreation or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how much should be invested in improving workers' commutes. &quot;You cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ignore how people spend their time,&quot; he says, &quot;when thinking about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well-being.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Seligman, in contrast, puts the emphasis on the remembering self. &quot;I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think we are our memories more than we are the sum total of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences,&quot; he says. For him, studying moment-to-moment experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; puts too much emphasis on transient pleasures and displeasures.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Happiness goes deeper than that, he argues in his 2002 book Authentic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Happiness. As a result of his research, he finds three components of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happiness: pleasure (&quot;the smiley-face piece&quot;), engagement (the depth of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involvement with one's family, work, romance and hobbies) and meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (using personal strengths to serve some larger end). Of those three
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; roads to a happy, satisfied life, pleasure is the least consequential,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he insists: &quot;This is newsworthy because so many Americans build their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lives around pursuing pleasure. It turns out that engagement and meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are much more important.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />So here the two philosophies are expressed more plainly.  Do we
<br />
care about the OMs, trying to make each one as pleasant as possible?
<br />
Or do we go for how happy people *think* they are, how happy they claim
<br />
to be, based on their memories of how things went?  This leads to the
<br />
paradoxical situation where someone who has a lot of unhappy OMs but does
<br />
not remember them well (like in the colonoscopy experiment described
<br />
above - talk about &quot;more torture&quot;!) is considered to be happy, by the
<br />
observer based perspective.
<br />
<br />I do have a new idea along these lines.  It is something of a middle
<br />
ground between the two.  It starts of course with the principle that
<br />
the measure of an OM is 1/2^KC where KC is its Kolmogorov complexity.
<br />
This should be unproblematic for those who adopt this general approach
<br />
to understanding the Multiverse, the Schmidhuberian/Tegmarkian method.
<br />
The measure of ANYTHING is 1/2^KC and OMs are no exception.  This is the
<br />
basic principle which I elaborated on in my Observer Moment Measure from
<br />
Universe Measure posting.
<br />
<br />Okay, so the new idea is simply that the KC of an OM depends not just on
<br />
how hard it is to instantiate it (ie how big a program it takes to create
<br />
it in a universe) the first time, but on also how big an &quot;echo&quot; it makes
<br />
in the universe.  This is the same basic idea I described earlier which
<br />
causes bigger and slower instantiations of OMs to have higher measure.
<br />
But this applies as well to the impact an OM makes on the universe.
<br />
An OM with a bigger impact adds somewhat to its measure, because such
<br />
an OM can be output by a shorter program (as I outlined earlier).
<br />
<br />The most straightforward case would be an OM which is remembered.  It has
<br />
echoes down through time.  Such an OM has higher measure by virtue of
<br />
its existence not only the first time, but as an echo in subsequent OMs.
<br />
A more typical OM which is immediately forgotten, in contrast, has no
<br />
such echo and will have a lower measure.
<br />
<br />This allows us to synthesize the two approaches advocated above by the
<br />
researchers Kahneman and Seligman.  With Kahneman, we will seek to make
<br />
OMs happy.  But with Seligman, we will pay more attention to those OMs
<br />
which get remembered.  Those are the &quot;peak moments&quot; which he argues make
<br />
a bigger difference in terms of &quot;real&quot; happiness.  This allows us to
<br />
make a tradeoff where we let typical OMs be less happy in exchange for
<br />
&quot;peak&quot; OMs being happier.
<br />
<br />The main question is how much extra measure an OM should get by virtue
<br />
of being remembered.  How much smaller can a program be to output such
<br />
an OM?  I don't know if we understand consciousness well enough to
<br />
begin to answer this question.  But in principle it will be calculable
<br />
once we have a good theory of consciousness and brain function.  Then
<br />
we will know how to properly balance the two perspectives of OM vs
<br />
observer.
