<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm skeptical of &quot;continuity&quot; requirements. Now I do not believe in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Greg Egan's equations in &quot;Permutation City&quot;: according to a premise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the story, it order to obtain the you of tomorrow, there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; short-cut alternative to just letting you run.  And that is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; determine the solutions of an immense number of differential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; equations that do not in fact emulate your intermediary states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If this were so, then it may be that you could discontinuously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; skip past all of tonight and tomorrow's experiences, and just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; start living by directly experiencing the day after that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Does it not seem that the continuity requirement is such that it only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comes up when we consider either an external 3rd person P.o.V. of a OM 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chaining P.o.V. or an internal 1st person of a memory of having changed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one's mind about something is some other OM?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, it does seem to come up under both points of view. For some
<br />
reason I can't fathom. To me, there is no use of it either way:
<br />
<br />Let's take the first-person point of view first. What if in some
<br />
universe it so happened that none of your Monday OMs existed? I
<br />
say that you would have Sunday's OMs followed by Tuesday's OMs,
<br />
and be none-the-wiser. The discontinuity would not be important
<br />
at all.
<br />
<br />I considered the third-person view above, but here's more: *If*
<br />
something weird like Greg Egan investigated were true, then one's
<br />
experiences could be discontinuous. However, as actual machines
<br />
we compute all our intermediate states, and so experience is
<br />
continuous (no matter how it may seem via memory erasure or
<br />
brain malfunction). 
<br />
<br />(In Repeated Experience, this characteristic is not present. If
<br />
your behavior today is a reenactment of an original calculation
<br />
from billions of years ago, then in principle it would be possible
<br />
for you to experience Sunday, then be terminated, and then a
<br />
recorded state from the original Tuesday billions of years ago
<br />
commenced.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC] 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     If we erase our memories of having done the loathsome
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; event after actually going through it, do we not need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also erase the memory of any other witness that might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; able to remind us of the event?
</em><br />
<br />No, witnesses can be bought off, or, where I come from, snuffed
<br />
out. So long as they keep their traps shut, see, I don't
<br />
start to wonder about it. But anyway, having them tell me in
<br />
all sincerity about things I don't remember isn't anything
<br />
*like* actually having had the experiences:  suppose that you
<br />
convince me that the Nazis ran a version of me in 1944 and
<br />
tortured the bejesus out of me---well, I'd rather listen to
<br />
your story a thousand times than actually go through the
<br />
alleged experience.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     How can a OM encode a trace of other OMs such that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can capture the notion of &quot;remembering something&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />Nature has given our brains a way, somehow. But remember,
<br />
those do not need to be veridical OMs. In principle you
<br />
can insert the memory of me having been elected president
<br />
into my brain. Doesn't make it so at all.
<br />
<br />(Yes, yes, yes, I know: in some universe I *was* elected
<br />
president. But truly, that's irrelevant.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     What, exactly makes me &quot;me&quot;? Is it &quot;I am what I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remember myself to be&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />I would say yes. If we got hold of Napoleon's memories and
<br />
inserted them in your brain while discarding SPK's original
<br />
ones, then Napoleon would be alive and you'd be dead.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I don't have any problem believing that I *am* all of my duplicates 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either, so long as there is some way that the &quot;me&quot; that I remember now could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be smoothly continued within the world of a duplicate *and* all witnesses 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree that I did all that I claim I did with in that world.
</em><br />
<br />Like I said, witnesses aren't important, and are expendable. Why
<br />
do you care about witnesses? Besides, the quality of your life
<br />
over the next few minutes is not affected by whether or not it
<br />
is true that God created the world 30 seconds ago (and so you
<br />
never had any experiences, and even your mother and father are
<br />
not reliable witnesses).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Mike Perry, in his book &quot;Forever For All&quot; develops these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [ideas] from the idea of &quot;day-persons&quot;,...&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Does Mike Perry elaborate on how anyone can know for sure that &quot;they are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not the same person from day to day&quot;. What does he define &quot;same&quot; to be?
</em><br />
<br />No, this is pretty-much at the level of definition, I think.
<br />
It's just that some folks we talk to contend that you are not
<br />
the same person from second to second, nor, of course, from
<br />
month to month. He argues that our identities are real and
<br />
do continue through time (under usual circumstances).
<br />
<br />He defines sameness based upon the &quot;information or pattern
<br />
view of identity&quot; which I also subscribe to.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; [Stathis]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; We die all the time, so death is nothing to worry about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; On this definition, yes. But this is *such* an impractical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; approach. We all know that it's bad for your neighbor when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; he dies, despite us and him totally believing in the MWI.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We would like to avoid having to say that we die all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Are we really just recoiling in horror at the prospect of our own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-existence (mortality) and trying like madmen to find an escape clause? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Isn't this the same motivation that exists at the root of Religions?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     If this is true, can we admit it to ourselves; much like Tipler has?
</em><br />
<br />I didn't know that Tipler admitted to being desperate.
<br />
While it's always possible that there are deeper psychological
<br />
explanations for why we hold certain beliefs, all we can do
<br />
is to use our conscious minds to examine them the best we
<br />
can.
<br />
<br />It's usually *after* I totally agree with someone that we engage in
<br />
pleasant conjectures about the psychological processes underlying
<br />
our adversaries' views  :-)
