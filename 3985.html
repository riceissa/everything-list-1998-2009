<br />
Time is a construct we invented to describe things.  Most
<br />
basically we use it to describe our sequence of experiences
<br />
and memories.  We feel hot and cold, but we needed to
<br />
quantify hot and cold and give them operational definitions
<br />
in order make definite predictions about them. So we
<br />
invented temperature and thermometers.  For mechanics we
<br />
needed a quantified, operational definition of duration -
<br />
so we invented time and clocks.
<br />
<br />Besides psychological time,there are at least three
<br />
different possible definitions of time used in physics  What
<br />
they all have in common is that they assign numbers to
<br />
different physical states, i.e. they index different states
<br />
into some order so that this sequence of states can be
<br />
compared to that sequence of states.
<br />
<br />It's this last function that makes time important in
<br />
dynamical equations. We could always rewrite the equations
<br />
in purely relational terms. So if we had three particles
<br />
with positions X(t), Y(t), and Z(t), we could write
<br />
equations Y(X) and Z(X).  But the equations could be very
<br />
messy if X(t) were a complicated motion.  On the other hand
<br />
if X(t) is a very simple motion, X(t)=t, i.e. X is a clock,
<br />
then the equations are simple. In fact that's one way to
<br />
define time: A variable X which can be used to parameterize
<br />
equations into their simplest form. However, relativity
<br />
complicates this picture a little. Clocks measure proper
<br />
time along their paths, not coordinate time.
<br />
<br />But to write equations about interacting things moving
<br />
relative to each other it is more convenient to define
<br />
coordinate time.  This is usually time as measured by a
<br />
clock in some special motion, but not necessarily. All it
<br />
has to be is a way of labelling space-like foliations in 3+1
<br />
space. This is a global &quot;time&quot; but it has no physical
<br />
significance.  In contrast, Zeh refers to the different
<br />
times measured by clocks along world lines between
<br />
foliations, as &quot;many-fingered time&quot;.
<br />
<br />Consider the spatial analog.  We could locate every city on
<br />
Earth by giving its distance from every other city, i.e.
<br />
the airlines miles between them.  This would give an
<br />
accurate picture of the globe, but a very complicated one
<br />
since, for N cities we would have to give N! numbers.
<br />
Instead we invented latitude and longitude, so we only
<br />
have to give 2N numbers and we can figure out the distances.
<br />
Coordinate time serves the same purpose in labeling events.
<br />
<br />Finally, these clock times are reversible if the underlying
<br />
dynamics are reversible, as they are in most intepretations
<br />
of fundamental physics.  Then the arrow of time is
<br />
determined by statistical properties of complex systems
<br />
which are summarized by the increase of entropy.
<br />

<br />
Time is an illusion, lunchtime doubly so.
