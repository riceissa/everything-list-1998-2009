</em><br />
<br />Yes, I think this could have been better put. I meant that each aspect
<br />
of the experience could be treated as if self-contained, with an
<br />
independent 'pov'. etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What does &quot;informationally closed&quot; mean?
</em><br />
<br />'Isolated' might be a better term. As DD puts it 'other times are
<br />
special cases of other worlds'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Errmm.. if by &quot;recover&quot; we are able to replay them as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious (re)experiences. The memory-trace need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only contain time-stamps indicating the order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and timing of the contents of the experience. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; total structure of time-stamped-stored-experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can co-exist simultaneously, just as a the frames
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a movie stored on a shelf co-exist simultaneously.
</em><br />
<br />Precisely, my dear Watson.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The stored experience is not conscious in itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any more than the stored movie involves any (ilusion of) motion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In both cases, that comes in with the recovery.
</em><br />
<br />And I'm saying that the recovery *is* a structure that implements a
<br />
specific set of relations between the 'time-stamped' data and the
<br />
perceptual apparatus - what I've termed the perceiver-percept dyad. The
<br />
dyad's function is to render the time-stamped data in the form of
<br />
environmentally-embedded dynamic processes centred on a 1-person pov.
<br />
If you press me for the detail of 'render' I'm afraid I can only
<br />
respond 'in some way', as you do with respect to RITSIAR. My point is
<br />
that the dyad is rendered as a simultaneously compresent structure. As
<br />
to *why* the structure is experienced as an 'A'-series, I can but refer
<br />
you to my previous suggestions, which you may or may not find
<br />
persuasive.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That all depends on what you mean by &quot;individual occasion&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In physics that a purely 3d (0 time-dimensional)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't contain enough information to recover
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standard dynamics, and instead a kind of &quot;specious present&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; known as &quot;instantaneous velocity&quot; is used -- i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the snapshot is of an infinitessimal slice, not a 0-width slice.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Barbour's Machianism keeps the 0-slices and does without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some features of standard dynamics).
</em><br />
<br />We don't have to define the occasion in this way. Rather, we look at
<br />
what information is available for 'dyadic rendering'. My point to
<br />
Stathis was that unless the information representing all stages of a
<br />
specific dynamic experience is simultaneously compresent in a single
<br />
occasion, however delimited, there could be no such experience present
<br />
in that occasion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and it seems that we almost can't stop ourselves imaginatively invoking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; some sort of continuity over multiple occasions, in order that coherent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiences can somehow be recovered by summing over the sequence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmm. Well, sequence per se doesn't require continuity.
</em><br />
<br />No, but the temptation is to try to assemble the information from
<br />
different OMs or occasions by surreptitiously invoking 'continuity' -
<br />
peeking, IOW.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Soo...what you are saying is that experiences of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (seemingly) continuous processes are incompatible with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;presentism&quot;, the idea that everything must be recovered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from a 0-width (temporally) slice. Well, maybe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but not even physics goes in for presentism in exactly *that* sense.
</em><br />
<br />Am I? I'm saying that the information driving the experience of
<br />
(seemingly) continuous processes must be recovered from simultaneously
<br />
compresent sources. The reason is that if one assumes the opposite -
<br />
that such information is just recovered from individual events 'smeared
<br />
over time' - then you keep losing bits of the (psychological) 'specious
<br />
present' because, as the information sequence moves forward, the
<br />
earlier bits *just aren't available any longer*. So I'm saying that in
<br />
the B-series events are indeed sequentially 'laid out', but that this
<br />
of itself is insufficient to account for our own species of episodic
<br />
dynamic experience. The A-series (i.e. time-as-experienced) seems to
<br />
proceed via sequences not of single events, but simultaneously rendered
<br />
'dynamic  capsules' generated by (god-knows-what) brain mechanisms that
<br />
have specifically evolved towards this end.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But there's a subtler point here also, I think,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that leads to the problem. Let's take the 'cat sat on the mat': now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'cat' starts at t1 and 'mat' ends at t2. Let's subdivide t1t2 into

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; occasions o1-o1000, and let teleportation occur between each. Each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; occasion o1-o1000 is as informationally closed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What does &quot;informationally closed&quot; mean?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as OMt1t2 (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'teleportation' is of course inserted precisely to make this point),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but now it has become implausible to believe that any individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; occasion, say o492, is of sufficient extent to recover any coherent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; component whatsoever of the conscious thought 'the cat sat on the mat'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And yet, we know that we *are* in fact able to routinely recover such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; components, corresponding loosely to a 'specious present' of some 1.5
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seconds extent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Errmm.. if by &quot;recover&quot; we are able to replay them as

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now comes the problem: how do we account for our manifest ability to do

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this without invoking some form of illicit 'continuity' between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; informationally separated occasions of arbitrarily fine granularity? No
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That all depends on what you mean by &quot;individual occasion&quot;.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think, if true, this would be a real problem in reconciling our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience with the facts, and I think therefore that it requires a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; real solution (actually an aspect of Barbour's time capsule theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which I'm extrapolating a bit further). Simply, if what I'm arguing is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; valid, it must follow that my assumption about individual occasions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'not containing the necessary information' *must be wrong*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I think this is relevant to Maudlin. I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think the physical &quot;activity&quot; of a system can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separated from its latent casual dispositions).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Consequently, sufficient information to recover 'speciously present'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dynamic experiences *must* in fact be *simultaneously* represented by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the brain - be present on one occasion - and that this simultaneous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'dynamic' presentation must be the engine that renders both the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; duration and the dynamism of the experience. And, to complete the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (evolutionary) circularity, this would be precisely *why* the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would possess this capability - because without it, extended, dynamic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; environmental presentations would simply be *unavailable* to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; organism.
