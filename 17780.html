<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; even just enunciate Church thesis. A weakening of Church thesis is 'a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal machine exists&quot;.  In the usual mathematical sense, like  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the theorem asserting that 'prime numbers exists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no usual sense of &quot;exists&quot; as the material I posted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; demonstrates.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You have to be assuming that the existence of the UD is literal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Platonic  since you care concluding that I am beign generated by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my existeince is not merely metaphorical. The arguemnt doesn't go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; otherwise.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Once you say &quot;yes&quot; to the doctor, there is a clear sense in which  
<br />
&quot;you&quot; (that is your third person relative computational state, the one  
<br />
the doctor digitalizes) exist in arithmetic, or exist arithmetically,  
<br />
and this in infinite exemplars, relatively to an infinity of universal  
<br />
numbers which executes the computation going through that state, and  
<br />
this in the arithmetical sense, which implied a subtle mathematical  
<br />
redundancy.
<br />
<br />Then the MGA enforces that all universal machine first person future  
<br />
experience is statistically dependent of a sum on all those  
<br />
computations.
<br />
<br />You may read books by Boolos and Jeffrey, or Epstein &amp; Carnielli, to  
<br />
see this. It is related to the representability of the computable  
<br />
functions in Robinson Arithmetic together with Church thesis.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I just make explicit that elementary true arithmetical statements are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; part of the theory. You are free to interpret them in a formlaistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; way, or in some realist way, or metaphorically. The reasoning does  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; depend on the intepretation, except that locally you bet you can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'save
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your relative state' in a digital backup, for UDA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IF formalism is true  there is no UD. It simply doesn't exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and doesn't genarate anything.
</em><br />
<br />If formalism is true, there is no matter, either.
<br />
I am still waiting your formal definition of &quot;primary matter&quot;, and of  
<br />
&quot;ontological existence&quot;.
<br />
I am not sure I understand how you can both believe to be a formalist  
<br />
and believe in *primary* matter. To be honest.
<br />
<br />Both in the West and the East we known since the dream argument that  
<br />
*primary* matter is a metaphysical notion. That is the main difference  
<br />
between the Platonist (in my sense) and the Aristotelicians. Atheists  
<br />
and Christians are usually Aristotelicians, and their opposition hides  
<br />
the deeper opposition between (weak) materialist Aristotelician and  
<br />
(neo)-Platonist.
<br />
<br />It is here that the scientific attitude remind us to not commit  
<br />
ontological commitment, and to be agnostic, except on refuted  
<br />
statements.
<br />
<br />I am agnostic on both Matter and God. With &quot;B&quot; = believe, &quot;~&quot; = not,  
<br />
&quot;m&quot; = &quot;Matter exists&quot; and &quot;g&quot; =&quot;God exists&quot;, taking in mind that I am  
<br />
open for large sense of those words, I am agnostic in the sense that  
<br />
~Bm &amp; ~B~m &amp; ~Bg &amp; ~B~g. That's why I do research. (Matter with a big  
<br />
&quot;m&quot; = primary matter. In Plotinus the &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Matter&quot; are both  
<br />
beyond being/existence. That fits very well with AUDA.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not agnostic about consciousness, and persons, though.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And you don't need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; really that for the 'interview' of the universal machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course I need a real machine for a real interview.
</em><br />
<br />You should avoid the use of 'real&quot;. In our context, this is the notion  
<br />
which we are discussing, or (re)defining.
<br />
I have personally less doubt about my consciousness, and about my  
<br />
believe in the prime numbers than in anything material. Physicists  
<br />
avoid the question, except when interested in the conceptual problems  
<br />
posed by QM.
<br />
<br />Bohr was ready to decree sometimes ago that the notion of reality did  
<br />
not apply to the microscopic. Nowadays we apply QM in cosmology, and  
<br />
we accept the price, that is the multiverse, but this still avoid the  
<br />
consciousness/reality relationship problem, when we assume comp. The  
<br />
MGA shows that we have to be a little more radical than Everett if we  
<br />
want to keep the CTM/comp idea.
<br />
As I just said on another forum: 'real' is a tricky notion.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; All theories in physics uses at least that arithmetical fragment. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fermions and bosons becomes metaphor, with comp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematical existence is metaphorical if mathematical existence is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literal.
</em><br />
<br />In your theory. I have no problem with that. I just refer you to an  
<br />
argument showing that such theories are epistemologically incompatible  
<br />
with the comp hypothesis, or CTM.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Their existence is literal  if mathematical existence is metaphorical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; May be very fertile
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one. Like galaxies and brains.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Scientist does not commit themselves ontologically. They postulate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; basic entities and relations in theories which are always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hypothetical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; False. There is nothing hypothetical about ingeous rock.
</em><br />
<br />This is either mere wishful thinking, or you are not a machine. If you  
<br />
are a machine, then you confuse stable hypothesis with truth. &quot;de  
<br />
mémoire de rose, je n'ai jamais vu mourir un jardinier&quot; said the poet  
<br />
Fontenelle (from a rose's memory &quot;I have never seen a gardiner dying&quot;.  
<br />
A possible misquote!
<br />
<br />Of course, we can play with words. Comp does provide an explanation of  
<br />
the existence of relatively stable patterns, already similar to  
<br />
quantum mechanics, so there is a sense, in the comp frame, that some  
<br />
rock are not hypothetical relatively to some observer. They are just  
<br />
not composed of little material definite things, they are singular  
<br />
maps on the local accessible probable computational histories. Why  
<br />
this is described by a wave? Probably because things get symmetrical  
<br />
and linear on the border of the universal machine ignorance, as the  
<br />
logic of &quot;sensible&quot; and &quot;intelligible&quot; matter suggests (already, cf  
<br />
AUDA).
<br />
<br />With the SWE, you get a phenomenological account of the wave packet  
<br />
reduction through a comp subjective differentiation (that's mainly the  
<br />
work of Everett). But UDA shows that once you do that, you have to  
<br />
pursue the differentiation up to the justification of the SWE itself,  
<br />
from the numbers (or combinators, etc.).
<br />
<br />You are stuck at step 00 (you told me) by irrelevant philosophical  
<br />
considerations, I'm afraid. My point is mainly technical. UDA  
<br />
transforms the mind-body or consciousness/reality problem into a  
<br />
problem in mathematical computer science. If you are formalist, there  
<br />
is a complete formalist reading on what I do, indeed that's AUDA. A  
<br />
strict formalist can read UDA as a motivation for AUDA. But I have to  
<br />
insist that formalists are in general arithmetical realist ... in the  
<br />
formal sense of using the third excluded middle. I don't need more,  
<br />
and I can technically recast the whole thing with less (by using  
<br />
Markov intuitionistic principle).
<br />
<br />The consistency of all this eventually resides in subtle aspects of  
<br />
the incompleteness phenomena in theoretical computer science. &quot;Comp&quot;  
<br />
is also for &quot;computer science&quot;. Once you accept the excluded middle  
<br />
principle, like most mathematicians, you discover there is a  
<br />
&quot;universe&quot; full of living things there, developing complex views.
<br />
<br />You can say everything is metaphor but your consciousness: it is up to  
<br />
*your* work to make some things less metaphorical than others.
<br />
We share, &quot;obviously&quot; long histories, and we are deep objects which  
<br />
can explain usual confusions about tokens and types.
<br />
<br />And all this leads to a very elegant theory of everything. The  
<br />
ontology is defined by &quot;p is true&quot; if &quot;p&quot; is provable in Robinson  
<br />
Arithmetic. The epistemology is defined by &quot;p is believed&quot; if &quot;p&quot; is  
<br />
provable by Peano Arithmetic, or by any Löbian Machine described by  
<br />
Robinson Arithmetic. It is very concrete and a formalist should  
<br />
appreciate. Perhaps you should forget UDA for a while, and come back  
<br />
later, and study the &quot;formal&quot; AUDA part. It is my modest part in  
<br />
theoretical computer science, relying on key theorems by Gödel, Löb,  
<br />
Solovay, and many others. It is also a sequence of open problems, but  
<br />
the contrary would have been surprising. And there is an heroin there:  
<br />
the (classical) universal machine. And its little brother the  
<br />
(quantum) universal machine plays some key role too. AUDA shed some  
<br />
light on a two way road between those two notions.
<br />
<br />To be sure other part of math shows that, like the relation between  
<br />
braids and quantum computations, or Abramski's combinators algebra.  
<br />
The advantage of the &quot;self-referential&quot; approach, with the (formal)  
<br />
interview of the universal machine which introspects itself is that,  
<br />
by the Solovay G/G* splitting, we get the difference between the true  
<br />
(theological part) and the provable (the 'scientifically communicable'  
<br />
part).
<br />
<br />A correct Löbian machine can study correctly (formally) the whole  
<br />
theology (which extends the science here) of a simpler Löbian machine.  
<br />
She cannot lift it correctly to herself, without falling in  
<br />
inconsistencies, but she can lift it in the interrogative and informal  
<br />
way, be it by hope, fear, bets, prayers or whatever. (or she can  
<br />
accept some 'truth' as new axioms and transform herself, but that's  
<br />
necessary risky).
