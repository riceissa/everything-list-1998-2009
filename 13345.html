<br />Says who?  The point is that infinite sets appear to be indispensible
<br />
to our explanations of reality.  According to the Tegmark paper just
<br />
recently posted, math concepts map to physical concepts.  We can infer
<br />
that there must be some physical concept which can be indentified with
<br />
an infinite set.  And the existence of this physical thing would be a
<br />
violation of reductionism.  To escape from the conclusion we either
<br />
have to deny that infinite sets are real, or else deny the one-to-one
<br />
match between the mathematical and physical world.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Functions

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is established that all of these concepts are indispensible to our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; explanations of reality and they are logically well defined and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; supported.  But none of these concepts can be reduced to any finite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; set of empirical facts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's because we invented them.
</em><br />
<br />No, it's because reductionism is false.  We invented the concepts, but
<br />
(as I mentioned in the previous post) for concepts which are useful
<br />
there has to be at least a *partial* match between the information
<br />
content of the concepts and the information content of reality.
<br />
Therefore we can infer general things about reality from knowledge of
<br />
this information content.  Where informational content of our useful
<br />
concepts is not computable, this tells us that there do exist physical
<br />
things which also mimic this uncomputability (and hence reductionism
<br />
is false).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; QM isn't even a physical theory; it's just a set of principles for formulating physical theories; as classical mechanics was before it.
</em><br />
<br />Exactly so!  I agree.  QM is  really an abstract *high-level*
<br />
explanation of reality.  This sounds strange, because the QM
<br />
description is usually thought of as the *low level* (basement level)
<br />
description fo reality, but it ain't.  It's true that QM may be the
<br />
basement level in the sense of *accuracy* (best scientific model so
<br />
far), but *not* in the ontological sense.  As you point out, in the
<br />
*ontological* sense it's really a sort of high-level *reality shell* -
<br />
an abstracted set of principles rather a complete physical principle
<br />
in itself.
<br />
<br />My reality theory is a three-level model of reality (as I mentioned
<br />
earlier in the thread).  And QM is actually at the *highest* level of
<br />
explanation!  This is the complete reverse of how QM is conventinally
<br />
thought of.  It makes more sense of you think of the wave function of
<br />
the whole universe.  Then you can how QM is actually the *highest
<br />
level* (most abstract) explanation of reality.  Next level down are
<br />
functional systems.  Then the lowest level is the particle level.  All
<br />
three of these levels of description are equally valid.  This is
<br />
somewhat similair to Bohm's two-level interpretation (wave function at
<br />
one level, particles the other level).  Only I have inserted a third
<br />
level into the scheme.  *Between* the QM wave level description (high
<br />
level) and the aprticle level description (low level) is where I think
<br />
the solution to the puzzle of consciousness may be found.
