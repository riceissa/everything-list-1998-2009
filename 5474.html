<br />Yes, your theory states that the chances are 100% that some copy will find 
<br />
itself in the non-bizarre world. But the theory also states that the 
<br />
chances are very low - one in a billion - that *I* will be that copy. Why 
<br />
isn't this second probability important? It seems to me that you only care 
<br />
about the first probability, and disregard the second as irrelevant.
<br />
<br />I'm assuming that the hypothetical person in these thought experiments is 
<br />
not certain that the copying theory is actually correct, and is trying to 
<br />
figure out whether or not to believe it. In such a case, the 
<br />
one-in-a-billion probability is relevant. If the theory states that a 
<br />
billion copies of me are going to be made, and only one of those copies 
<br />
will find itself in a non-bizarre world, and then I find myself in the 
<br />
non-bizarre world, this should change my assessment of the likelihood of 
<br />
the copying theory - it should make me a billion times more suspicious! 
<br />
Whether or not this causes me to reject the copying theory depends on how 
<br />
much credence I gave that theory before the alleged copying took place. If 
<br />
I thought that the copying theory was almost definitely true - say, a 
<br />
trillion times more likely to be true than false - then I should continue 
<br />
to believe it after finding myself in the (very unlikely) non-bizarre 
<br />
world. If I thought that the theory was only a thousand times more likely 
<br />
of being true than false before the alleged copying, then I should strongly 
<br />
doubt the theory after I find myself in the non-bizarre world.
<br />
<br />If we accept your logic, the Platonia idea is unfalsifiable. One could, I 
<br />
suppose, still believe it on strictly a priori logical grounds. Is that 
<br />
your position?
