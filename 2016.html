<br />
The Anthropic principle has been discussed numerous times before. There are 
<br />
many versions going around. I just want to make a point which I think is 
<br />
crucial.
<br />
<br />First let me state some of these principles quoted from Barrow and Tipler
<br />
<br />Weak Anthropic Principle (WAP): The observed values of all physical and 
<br />
cosmological quantities are not equally probable but they take on values 
<br />
restricted by the requirement that there exist sites where carbon-based life 
<br />
can evolve and the requirement that Universe be old enough for it to have 
<br />
already done so. 
<br />
[Barrow and Tipler are not explicit, but this principle implies the requires 
<br />
the existence of conscious observers.]
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Strong Anthropic Principle (SAP): The Universe must have those properties 
<br />
which allow life to develop within it at some stage in its history. 
<br />
[The emphasis here is on the world &quot;must&quot; which implies that the Universe is 
<br />
the way it is by design.. at least this is the way most people interpret 
<br />
this. This version implies the existence of a creator. Its religious 
<br />
connotations makes it unscientific]
<br />
<br />Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP): Observers are necessary to bring the 
<br />
Universe into being. [ As I mentioned to Russell, this version supported by 
<br />
Wheeler implies that observers, have some kind of magical ability to make 
<br />
things happen... Who needs the MWI with this approach? You might as well 
<br />
stick with the old fashion Copenhagen school!]
<br />
<br />Final Anthropic Principle (FAP): Intelligent information-processing must come 
<br />
into existence in the Universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will 
<br />
never die out. [Again, this word &quot;must&quot; implies the design argument. The 
<br />
authors of this principle,  Barrow and Tipler, succomb to mysticism, 
<br />
especially Tipler, in his book &quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot; in which he 
<br />
expounds his concept of the &quot;Omega Point&quot; and identifies the Holy Ghost with 
<br />
the universal wave-function. So much for scientific objectivity!]
<br />
<br />The WAP is the only one that makes any sense. You can define an initial 
<br />
boundary conditions for an arbitrary causal chain (aka Shoedinger wave) and 
<br />
then observes how it propagates. This boundary condition could be &quot;carbon 
<br />
life&quot; or &quot;vertebrate,&quot; or &quot;mammal&quot; or &quot;human&quot; or &quot;american&quot; .... or &quot;I.&quot; &quot;I&quot; 
<br />
is the boundary condition that I prefer as I''ll explain below.
<br />
<br />Now to my point.
<br />
The essence of the anthropic principle requires OBSERVERS. But it does not 
<br />
require LIFE. We can imagine a universe somewhere in the plenitude in which 
<br />
the conditions are suitable for the existence of at least one non-reproducing 
<br />
sentient being. To explain its existence, let's say that fundamental 
<br />
particles in this universe (atoms or maybe, more conveniently, naturally 
<br />
existing logical gates) got together by chance to form some kind of computer. 
<br />
(Very unlikely scenario but not impossible). This &quot;computer&quot; can think and 
<br />
can observe its world but is not &quot;alive&quot; in the sense that it cannot 
<br />
reproduce. 
<br />
How would such a creature state the Anthropic principle? Certainly not in 
<br />
terms of carbon life, not even in terms of life. Its version would simply 
<br />
state the reverse causal assertion:
<br />
<br />The world is the way it is, because I am what I am --- I am, therefore the 
<br />
world is. 
<br />
<br />Given that insight, this being would probably try to deduce if other being 
<br />
like itself also exist in its world.
<br />
<br />The world is, therefore others like me also exist. 
<br />
<br />This last assertion, if proven valid, would preclude this being from adopting 
<br />
a solipsit philosophy.
<br />
<br />Again. the point that Barrow and Tipler fail to emphasize, is that the 
<br />
Anthropic Principle rests on the observer. My preference is to use &quot;observer&quot; 
<br />
in the singular: &quot;I.&quot;   &quot;You&quot; can be deduced. :-)
<br />
