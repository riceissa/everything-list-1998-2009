<br />It seems to me that there are two views of time which we have considered,
<br />
which I would classify as the Schmidhuber and the Tegmark approaches.
<br />
In the Schmidhuber view time is of fundamental importance, and in the
<br />
Tegmark view it is basically unimportant.
<br />
<br />Schmidhuber models the multiverse as the output of a computational
<br />
process operating on all possible programs.  Since computation is
<br />
inherently sequential, it imposes a time ordering on the output.  It is
<br />
natural to identify the time ordering of a computation with the time
<br />
ordering of events in our universe.  So the simplest interpretation of
<br />
the Schmidhuber model as an explanation of our universe is to picture
<br />
the computer as generating successive instants of time as it operates.
<br />
<br />An obvious problem with this is that time appears to have a more
<br />
complex structure in our universe than in the classical Newtonian
<br />
block model.  Special relativity teaches us that simultaneity is not
<br />
well defined.  And general relativity even introduces the theoretical
<br />
possibility of time loops and other complex temporal topologies.  It
<br />
is hard to see how a simple interpretation of Schmidhuber computation
<br />
could incoporate these details.
<br />
<br />Stephen Wolfram considers some related issues in his book, A New Kind
<br />
of Science.  He is trying to come up with a simple computational model
<br />
of our universe (not of the multiverse, but the same issues arise).
<br />
In order to deal with special relativity he shows how a certain kind of
<br />
computational network can have consistent causality even when some parts
<br />
of the computation are run in advance of other parts.  In other words,
<br />
simultaneity is not well defined in these models and it is possible
<br />
for different observers to have different ideas about simultaneity.
<br />
But the causality is the same for everyone.
<br />
<br />The other main model we have considered for the multiverse is that of
<br />
Tegmark, who identifies the universe with all possible mathematical
<br />
structures.  In this model our universe is merely a complicated
<br />
mathematical object.  The fact that we observe three dimensional space and
<br />
one dimensional time is due to the internal structure of the particular
<br />
mathematical object that we live in.  Since all possible mathematical
<br />
structures exist, there would be other universes with one dimensional
<br />
space and three dimensional time, for example, along with an infinite
<br />
number of others.
<br />
<br />In this model, then, time is unimportant; it is merely an incidental
<br />
internal feature of certain mathematical constructs.  Then we can
<br />
invoke the anthropic principle to say that mathematical objects which
<br />
have an internal time dimension can also lead to evolution, which can
<br />
lead to life like ours.  So we have an explanation of time as being a
<br />
constraint on those mathematical objects which can include what Tegmark
<br />
calls self-aware subsystems, i.e. observers like ourselves.
<br />
<br />A final note, I think the Schmidhuber model can be approached in
<br />
a way more consistent with Tegmark by interpreting the output of a
<br />
computation as a structured object independent of the time ordering
<br />
used by the computation that created it (Wolfram pursues this idea in
<br />
his models as well).  Looking at this document, for example, you read
<br />
it sequentially from top to bottom; but I didn't write it that way,
<br />
I rearranged some paragraphs and went back and did some edits here and
<br />
there before sending it.  The document's internal structure imposes or
<br />
reveals an ordering that is independent of the way it was created.
<br />
<br />In the same way, Schmidhuber's programs can create universes, some of
<br />
which might then be interpreted to have an internal time dimension
<br />
similarly to how Tegmark's mathematical objects do.  We would then
<br />
invoke the anthropic principle, as in the Tegmark case, to limit our
<br />
attention to Schmidhuber programs that produce output with an internal
<br />
time dimension that allows for conscious observers.
