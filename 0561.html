I agree that the implicit distribution of m is essential in determining if we 
<br />
should switch after making our first choice.  Interestingly, if we assume a 
<br />
logarithmic distribution and compute the expected value of the content of the 
<br />
other box (the one not selected), we find that it is identical to the content 
<br />
of the selected box:
<br />
<br />Expected Value = (1/2) (Log(m/2) + Log(2m))  = (1/2) (Log(m) - Log2 + Log(m) 
<br />
+ Log2)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= Log(m)
<br />
<br />Which implies that the logarithmic distribution is the one assumed by common 
<br />
sense: don't switch. In other words, the value that any particular number is 
<br />
equal to m is equally likely, and INDEPENDENT OF SCALE. This independence of 
<br />
scale has some intriguing connection with the MWI and the issue that the 
<br />
probability of survival after death is extremely low but FROM THE POINT OF 
<br />
VIEW of the observer it must be equal to one.

&nbsp;I agree here - everything depends on the distribution the experimenter

&nbsp;somehow in their brain state, and so the distribution is &quot;whatever

&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Ah, but all good Bayesians are careful. :-)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;I think what you mean by being &quot;not careful&quot;, in the context of this
<br />
&nbsp;example, is taking the distribution for the question &quot;Is the box I've
<br />
&nbsp;just opened the m box or the 2m box?&quot; to always be 50-50, *even after
<br />
&nbsp;you've read the quantity of money it contains*. That would indeed be not
<br />
&nbsp;just careless but wrong - it is, after all, 50-50 *before* you've read
<br />
&nbsp;the quantity of money, and *therefore*, for that very reason, is not in
<br />
&nbsp;general 50-50 *after* you've read the quantity of money. If you had
<br />
&nbsp;access to the experimenter's secret distribution for generating m in the
<br />
&nbsp;first place (which is not the same thing as access to the value of m
<br />
&nbsp;itself on this occasion, I hasten to add!), you could perform the update
<br />
&nbsp;in a fully proper and knowledgeable way. If you are a Bayesian, then
<br />
&nbsp;even in the absence of access to the experimenter's distribution for m,
<br />
&nbsp;you take it upon yourself to do the next best thing to this: you make
<br />
&nbsp;your own guess as to &quot;what kind of distributions experimenters like when
<br />
&nbsp;playing games with people&quot;, you weight *these* distributions according
<br />
&nbsp;to a guessed set of weightings (&quot;meta-distribution&quot;?) of your own, you
<br />
&nbsp;collapse the meta-distribution of &quot;ordinary&quot; distributions into one
<br />
&nbsp;consolidated distribution by the standard
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;multiply-it-all-out-and-add-it-all-up&quot; method, and you use *that*
<br />
&nbsp;next-best-thing consolidated distribution (and your just-obtained
<br />
&nbsp;knowledge of the quantity of money in the box you opened) to update your
<br />
&nbsp;weightings - previously 50-50 - for that dangling question this long and
<br />
&nbsp;rambling paragraph started off with: &quot;Is the box I've just opened the m
<br />
&nbsp;box or the 2m box?&quot;. Then, of course, you switch iff your updated
<br />
&nbsp;weightings favour the unopened box. Phew! :-)

&nbsp;

<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;

<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Thinking deeper about Peter's box problem after the inauguration,

&nbsp;Well, as should now be clear, I wouldn't use *those* words - and in fact
<br />
&nbsp;the algorithm I said a good Bayesian would follow (the business about
<br />
&nbsp;the consolidated distribution, in my long and rambling paragraph above)
<br />
&nbsp;*would*, I believe, increase the expected return above 1.5m in most
<br />
&nbsp;real-life cases. Even using a very crude caricature of what I called the
<br />
&nbsp;meta-distribution in that paragraph would probably raise the expected
<br />
&nbsp;return a wee bit above 1.5m. So, I'm not saying such an algorithm would
<br />
&nbsp;be &quot;astonishing and completely unbelievable&quot;. Not at all! But of course
<br />
&nbsp;I'd still like you to tell me your method. I'm too tired to work out a
<br />
&nbsp;particular instantiation of my own &quot;algorithm in words only&quot; in my long
<br />
&nbsp;and rambling paragraph above! :-)

&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Bye for now... (and apologies to those on the Theories of Everything
<br />
&nbsp;mailing list for whom this might all be a bit out of context - but it is
<br />
&nbsp;a fairly well-known &quot;toy probability paradox&quot; in the literature, and

&nbsp;Stefan's explanation of it at the beginning is quite self-contained.)

&nbsp;brains in that whim-state have for thinking up numbers&quot;. By hook or by

&nbsp;crook, there's a distribution for m lurking in there!

assuming a probability distribution for something that you don't

&nbsp;call themselves Bayesians. The problem
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
with the Bayesian&amp;nbsp; approach is that in some cases, when you are
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
not careful, it can produce misleading results.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
<br />
&nbsp;Ah, but all good Bayesians are careful. :-)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I think what you mean by being &quot;not careful&quot;, in the context of this
<br />
&nbsp;example, is taking the distribution for the question &quot;Is the box I've just
<br />
&nbsp;opened the m box or the 2m box?&quot; to always be 50-50, *even
<br />
&nbsp;after you've read the quantity of money it contains*. That would indeed
<br />
&nbsp;be not just careless but wrong - it is, after all, 50-50 *before*
<br />
&nbsp;you've read the quantity of money, and *therefore*, for that very
<br />
&nbsp;reason, is not in general 50-50 *after* you've read the quantity
<br />
&nbsp;of money. If you had access to the experimenter's secret distribution for
<br />
&nbsp;generating m in the first place (which is not the same thing as
<br />
&nbsp;access to the value of m itself on this occasion, I hasten to add!),
<br />
&nbsp;you could perform the update in a fully proper and knowledgeable way. If
<br />
&nbsp;you are a Bayesian, then even in the absence of access to the experimenter's
<br />
&nbsp;distribution for m, you take it upon yourself to do the next best
<br />
&nbsp;thing to this: you make your own guess as to &quot;what kind of distributions
<br />
&nbsp;experimenters like when playing games with people&quot;, you weight *these*
<br />
&nbsp;distributions according to a guessed set of weightings (&quot;meta-distribution&quot;?)
<br />
&nbsp;of your own, you collapse the meta-distribution of &quot;ordinary&quot; distributions
<br />
&nbsp;into one consolidated distribution by the standard 
<br />
&quot;multiply-it-all-out-and-add-it-all-up&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;method, and you use *that* next-best-thing consolidated distribution
<br />
&nbsp;(and your just-obtained knowledge of the quantity of money in the box you
<br />
&nbsp;opened) to update your weightings - previously 50-50 - for that dangling
<br />
&nbsp;question this long and rambling paragraph started off with: &quot;Is the box
<br />
&nbsp;I've just opened the m box or the 2m box?&quot;. Then, of course,
<br />
&nbsp;you switch iff your updated weightings favour the unopened box. Phew! :-)

Thinking deeper about Peter's box problem after the inauguration,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I thought that there might be a similar experiment that actually
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
increases your expected return of 1.5m.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
You may find this astonishing, but I actually came up with a
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
strategy that has an expected return of **more than** 1.5m -
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
no matter what m is (as long as m is bigger than zero).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In order to increase suspension a little and give you some time
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
to think about this, I'll reveal my method to you - after you
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
reply to this mail saying something to the effect of &quot;It would be
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
astonishing and completely unbelievable that such a method should
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
exist&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Regards!

<br />
&nbsp;Well, as should now be clear, I wouldn't use *those* words - and
<br />
&nbsp;in fact the algorithm I said a good Bayesian would follow (the business
<br />
&nbsp;about the consolidated distribution, in my long and rambling paragraph
<br />
&nbsp;above) *would*, I believe, increase the expected return above 1.5m
<br />
&nbsp;in most real-life cases. Even using a very crude caricature of what I called
<br />
&nbsp;the meta-distribution in that paragraph would probably raise the expected
<br />
&nbsp;return a wee bit above 1.5m. So, I'm not saying such an algorithm
<br />
&nbsp;would be &quot;astonishing and completely unbelievable&quot;. Not at all! But of
<br />
&nbsp;course I'd still like you to tell me your method. I'm too tired to work
<br />
&nbsp;out a particular instantiation of my own &quot;algorithm in words only&quot; in my
<br />
&nbsp;long and rambling paragraph above! :-)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Bye for now... (and apologies to those on the Theories of Everything
<br />
&nbsp;mailing list for whom this might all be a bit out of context - but it is
<br />
&nbsp;a fairly well-known &quot;toy probability paradox&quot; in the literature, and Stefan's
<br />
&nbsp;explanation of it at the beginning is quite self-contained.)
