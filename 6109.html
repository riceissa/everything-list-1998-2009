<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reiterated self-duplications)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and put measure on infinite sets of alternatives. Those infinite sets of

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relative alternative *are* themselves&quot; generated by simple programs (like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the UD).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here is how I approach it, based on Schmidhuber.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. But remember that Schmidhuber completely dismisses
<br />
the distinction between first and third points of view, and so his
<br />
approach cannot be used to explain both the laws of mind, the
<br />
laws of &quot;matter&quot; and the relation between them.
<br />
I have explained this before.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose we pick a model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of computation based on a particular Universal Turing Machine (UTM).
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right. And with Church's thesis Schmidhuber is right to invoke the
<br />
compiler theorem when he justifies such a choice is arbitrary.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Imagine this model being given all possible input tapes.
</em><br />
<br /><br />At once? I cannot imagine that, except under the form of a UD. This
<br />
follows from the two diagonalization posts to this list referred to in my url.
<br />
It is really the closure of the set of partial recursive function which makes
<br />
the comp whole comp definable. I will come back on the diagonalisations.
<br />
It's the pillar of all the construction I try to describe (but also of a very
<br />
large part of theoretical computer science, including Li and Vitanyi).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There are an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uncountably infinite number of such tapes, but on any given tape only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a finite length will actually be used (i.e. the probability of using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an infinite number of bits of the tape is zero).
</em><br />
<br /><br />To *define* (only) the program. But during arbitrary runs of even very
<br />
short programs all the tape will be used. In the sense that the needed
<br />
part of the tape will grow in an unboundable way, getting at deep
<br />
(in Bennett sense) large strings. Those are both &quot;absolutely&quot; (or
<br />
Kolmogorov-chaitin improbable but are highly probable relatively to
<br />
each other sligth variant (like the work of Shakespeare which is
<br />
both &quot;coin&quot;-improbable and then reflect determined universal
<br />
lobian anxieties (to be short). The only measure I can make sense
<br />
of is the relative (to a state) measure of the histories
<br />
(= computations from some 1 or 3 point of views) going through that states.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   This means that any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;program which runs is only a finite size, yet occurs on an infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number of tapes.
</em><br />
<br />This is ambiguous for me. Where on the tapes ? In company of other
<br />
programs ? Finite or recursive or recursively enumerable sets of programs?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The fraction of the tapes which holds a given program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is proportional to 1 over 2^(program length), if they are binary tapes.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes but you postulate an infinite random structure at the start. What is that?
<br />
Taking the inside view into account gives cheaply strong form of randomness
<br />
the first person comp indeterminacy).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is considered the measure of the given program.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;An equivalent way to think of it is to imagine the UTM being fed with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a tape created by coin flips.  Now the probability that it will run a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;given program is its measure, and again it will be proportional to 1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;over 2^(program length).  I don't know whether this is what you mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by &quot;infinite coin generations&quot; but it sounds similar.
</em><br />
<br /><br />By some aspect: I just show how comp gives sense to infinite coin
<br />
generation by iterating self-duplications. In *that* situation (which is 
<br />
only partial
<br />
relatively to the UD) we have a &quot;random noise&quot;.
<br />
And if we duplicate the populations of observers we get a locally
<br />
&quot;third person&quot; (in appearance) observable &quot;random noise&quot;, like Quantum
<br />
Physicist *seems* to observe (but Many-Worlders know better).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I believe you can get the same concept of measure by using the Universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dovetailer (UD) but I don't see it as necessary or particularly helpful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to invoke this step.  To me it seems simpler just to imagine all possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;programs being run, without having to also imagine the operating system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which runs them all on a time-sharing computer, which is what the UD
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;amounts to.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The UD is just a program among others but it can be shown that it
<br />
*is* the simplest program generating the most complex histories (actually all).
<br />
But the complexity is judged from inside, by those &quot;self-aware&quot; programs
<br />
generated in the many computations generated by the UD, and distributed
<br />
in the whole execution of it (UD*).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now we cannot know in which computational history we belong,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or more exactly we &quot;belong&quot; to an infinity of computational histories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (undistinguishable up to now). (It could be all the repetition of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simple program)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And by &quot;repetition of your simple program&quot; I think you mean the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that there are an infinite number of tapes which have the same prefix
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(the same starting bits) and which all therefore run the same program,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if it fits in that prefix.  This is the basic reason why shorter programs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have greater measure than longer ones, because there are a larger fraction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the tapes which have a given short prefix than a long one.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That simple program *has* been discovered and is the Universal Turing
<br />
Machine from which the UD is just a &quot;spashed&quot; version. The S K combinators
<br />
are even simpler.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's also possible, as you imply, that your consciousness is instantiated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in multiple completely different programs.  For example, we live in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;program which pretty straightforwardly implements the universe we see;
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't think we see a universe. I am not sure I understand what you mean
<br />
by &quot;pretty straightforwardly implements the universe we see&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;but we also live in a program which implements a very different universe,
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say we are in a continuum of incredibly similar histories.
<br />
Like all the &quot;universe&quot; where Pluton weight varies between infintesimals.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;in which aliens exist who run artificial life experiments, and we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one of those experiments.
</em><br />
<br />This does not make sense giving that before an act of observation
<br />
which would make it history, we *are* in front on *all* alternatives.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;We also live in programs which just happen to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simulate moments of our consciousness, purely through random chance.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, those are runned by the UD. Either they give rise to finite
<br />
computations (measure null) or they give rise to infinities with
<br />
the genuine measure, and then it is no more attributable to random
<br />
chance that what we are &quot;most probably&quot; living now.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, my guess is that the great majority of our measure will lie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in just one program.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Then it is either the UD or the &quot;unitary preserving UD&quot;. But then my reasoning
<br />
gives that the second must be justified by the first, or comp is false.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I suspect that that program will be quite simple,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and that all the other programs (such as the one with the aliens running
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;alife experiments) will be considerably more complex.  The simplest case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is just what we see, and that is where most of our measure comes from.
</em><br />
<br /><br />just what we see?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But to make an infinitely correct prediction we should average on all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computational histories going through our states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, I agree, although as I say my guess is that we will be &quot;close enough&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just by taking things as we see them,
</em><br />
<br /><br />?  (seeing, measurement, are one of the most complex phenomenon I can think
<br />
about. It is related to &quot;interaction&quot; and relative (local) irreversibility. 
<br />
I don't take
<br />
any of that of granted.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;and in fact it may well be that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the corrections from considering &quot;bizarre&quot; computational histories will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be so tiny as to be unmeasurable in practice.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It should be so! That is what we can study by making more clear our
<br />
theoretical assumptions. Feynman's explanation of Newton's law by the
<br />
the quantum sum, describes why, in the quantum frame, bizarre computations
<br />
are &quot;absolutely&quot; more &quot;probable&quot; but then destructively annihilate 
<br />
themselves, so that
<br />
the shorter &quot;normal&quot; path get higher probability amplitude. We need to 
<br />
justified
<br />
something similar to get rid of &quot;lambs eating wolves&quot; once we take seriously
<br />
the idea that there is a level where we are Turing emulable. We must justified
<br />
why quantum computations seem to win in the first person actual living 
<br />
experiences.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Your measure could explain why simple and short subroutine persists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; everywhere but what we must do is to extract the &quot;actual measure&quot;, the one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; apparently given by QM, from an internal measure on all relatively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consistent continuation of our (unknown!) probable computationnal state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is independent of the fact that some short programs could play the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; role of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; some initiator of something persisting. Perhaps a quantum dovetailer ? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; proceed by taking comp seriously this too should be justify from within.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Searching a measure on the computational histories instead of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; programs can not only be justified by thought experiments, but can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be defined neatly mathematically. Also a &quot;modern&quot; way of talking on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Many Worlds is in term of relative consistent histories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But the histories emerge from within. This too must be taken into account.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It can change the logic. (And actually changes it according to the lobian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; machine).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm losing you here.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sorry. Just abruptly summing up years of works.  Humans seem not yet quite able
<br />
to listen to each other on this planet so it is perhaps just premature to 
<br />
attract
<br />
the attention on the fact that those *machines* which are able to prove enough
<br />
theorems in elementary arithmetic are clever enough to infer by 
<br />
self-introspection
<br />
the geometry of the set of computational continuations they can &quot;normally&quot; 
<br />
expect.
<br />
That's the comp &quot;physics&quot;.
<br />
That makes the comp hypothesis eventually testable/refutable, just by 
<br />
comparing the
<br />
comp physics  with the empirical-inspired physics.
<br />
But listen to machine is pretty not en vogue isn't it?
<br />
<br />Well Palestinians and Iraki have voted ... There are some hope ...in the 
<br />
long run.
