</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I think need to take a hard line on RITSIAR.  I feel that the key lies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; in what Bruno terms the certainty of the ontological first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (OFP): i.e. the sine qua non of reality as it is uniquely available to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; us.  Since this is inescapably the foundation of any and all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; judgements whatsoever, it is simultaneously both the both point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; departure and the 'what-is-to-be-explained' of RITSIAR.  In this light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; it becomes self-evident that any and all explanatory entities -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; physical, computational, or whatever - are severely restricted to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; domain of epistemology.  IOW - as Bruno says above - they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; theoretical constructions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That doesn't follow at all. A theoretical construct can have a real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; referent. eg, if the theory of quarks is true , quarks exist. What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would &quot;theory X is true&quot; mean?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, of course, I agree with you that we take our references to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real referents.  Part of our problem in discussion I think is that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tend to attribute views to me that - if I held them - would indeed be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fatuous.  Now, you are within your rights to say that it's my fault
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for giving you this impression.  But I can only reply that my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intention is to draw attention to something more subtle, and this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficult.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think if I had to sum up the point of departure for more or less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything I've been saying, it would be that I question the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption that everything we can discover or know about the world can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be exhausted by describing its observable behaviour - whatever the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model.  This is I think what has been called the 'view from nowhere'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and - wonderfully useful though it undoubtedly is, and prone as I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; myself to rely on it much of the time - I'm not alone in criticising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it in the context of mind-body issues.  And this is because it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to me - though I think not to you - that in this domain alone we're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forced out of our view from nowhere and confronted with the fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what we're trying to explain by observation is the very phenomenon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we're using to make the observation.  And this is the problem.
</em><br />
<br />It might be. It isn't obviously the case that
<br />
cosnciousness wouldn't be able to account for itself.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; So far so obvious.  But - as has again been recognised immemorially -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; solipsism is a dead-end and hence we seek a theory to capture the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; relation between the OFP and its environment.  But immediately we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; faced with the notorious 'explanatory gap',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; and it seems to me that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; its most precise expression is in the gap between ontology and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; epistemology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don;t know what explanatory gap you are talking about,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but is doesn't sound like Levine's one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, as I imply above, I'm using ontology in the sense of 'what it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be' - not 'what it is to describe' - so maybe we need another term
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to avoid confusion.  So the gap is the one between these two things.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What is &quot;Ontological certainty&quot;? Certainty belongs to epistemolgoy,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; so &quot;onotlogical&quot; can't bve qualifying &quot;certainty&quot;. Do you mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; something like &quot;the one certain fact about ontology/existence&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My rhetorical question was &quot;how do we reach a state of certainty about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'what it is to be' on the basis of 'what it is to describe'.
</em><br />
<br />Why do we need certainty?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my response is that we can't, because in the area of the first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we have indubitable acquaintance with at least some aspect of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; former.
</em><br />
<br />That doesn't support the conclusion by itself. You also need to argue
<br />
for lack of certainty in descriptions
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And in my view, this acquaintance is so alien to 'what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described'
</em><br />
<br />with regard to consciousness , or generally?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the assumption of the gap being bridged on the basis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of *any* model of observability can only be a brute apriori
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption.  Now I know that many people aren't troubled by this, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some just are.  Frankly, by this stage I'm ready to put it down to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differences in imaginative style, what we're trying to achieve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personally with our thinking, or something equally idiosyncratic.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't really believe it can be resolved entirely by persuasion.
</em><br />
<br />Do you concede that many aspects of mind -- cognition, memory and so
<br />
on --
<br />
are not part of any Hard Problem?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Realism doesn;t need the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; existence of a non-mental world to be a certainty, it just needs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it to be more plausible than the alternatives.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, in general I agree with you.
</em><br />
<br />Then what is the significance of Ontological Certainty?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I suppose on the mind-body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question, the various positions that I've successively tried to hold
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on to (and I think I've traversed most of them over the last 30 years
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or so) having become less and less plausible to me.  I don't want to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a mysterian, but I think that the assumption that with a bit more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effort we've got the mind sorted on the basis of current theories will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turn out to be more like Lord Kelvin's notorious dicta on black-body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; radiation and the ether wind.  Actually, if that were the case, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be a good omen, because that presaged relativity and QM.
</em><br />
<br />I think physicalism has been generally succesful and as much
<br />
of it should be retained as possible. hence the need to focus
<br />
on the key issues in the MBP
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Is there a coherent way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; to conceive what it could mean to *be* a theoretical entity (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; opposed to postulating or observing one)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Probably not, but that is because the question posed is somethign of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a category error. What the realist would say is that she can conceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of theoretical statements havign real referents.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but my view is that mind-body shows us that to consider the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; referent of a theoretical statement to be something 'external' is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact the category error - i.e. the view from nowhere again.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Referents are external by definition. So you must be sayign that no
<br />
theory ever has a referent. But you have not said why.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (can't remember who) put it like this: &quot;what is the external world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supposed to be external to?&quot;
</em><br />
<br />My head.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Look, it may well be that you're capable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of doing this sort of category-juggling in your head whilst still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; using the standard theoretical language.  Part of the trouble is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm never quite sure if others are doing this, which is why I try to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proceed in a painfully step-by-step way in enquiring into it - which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably makes me sound like the village idiot to you.
</em><br />
<br />Hmm. Well, I still think you are repeating standard map-territory
<br />
fallacies.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; There is something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; quintessential that stubbornly eludes capture, because epistemological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; access never tells us what an entity *is* - only what can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; ascertained of its 'externalised' properties.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How do you know? If you can't detect some mysterious inner essence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; how do you know there is one?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I certainly wouldn't put it like that.  I don't think that the view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from nowhere can 'detect' anything of the sort precisely because it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't - can't - say anything about the 'inner' at all - i.e. its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; externalised: that's its point.
</em><br />
<br />YOu still haven't said about how you got into contact with the inner--
<br />
or at least any &quot;inner&quot; other than your own.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theories represent the limit of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world can *tell* us, not the limit of what it *is*.
</em><br />
<br />Theories don't necessarily tell us the whole story. However
<br />
you seem to have decided they necessarily don't.
<br />
If you can't peak over the horizon. how do you know there
<br />
is anything there?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really suppose that you are limited in any such way?  That your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence as it is known to you by acquaintance is entirely exhausted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by what I can glean by interacting with you or bouncing signals off
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you?
</em><br />
<br />Do you think that if you scanned my brain right down to the atomic
<br />
level,
<br />
you still wouldn't have captured all the information?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What we know by indubitable acquaintance is something absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualitatively different to what is described theoretically - it has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be - and whereas of course I'm not implying that this acquaintance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gives us the ante on the whole nature of existence, I do believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it should be a salutory corrective to any notion of the 'completeness'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of our theories of observation.
</em><br />
<br />And the corrective to that corrective is that it must all be the same
<br />
information -- just somehow presented differntly.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;And lest we be tempted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; to accept the sum of these properties as exhausting 'existence', we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; need only turn to the self-evident corrective of the OFP.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; THat passage is very far from self evident. Explain, please.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I said above.
</em><br />
<br />Waht is OFP?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; So the gap must remain, and I think that now I see why Bruno appeals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; simply to the 'ordinary' mathematical sense of existence - because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; COMP, under this analysis, is an epistemological schema, and its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; entities are theoretical constructions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No, Bruno is a Platonist. He thinks numbers are RITSIAR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I don't suppose you'll ever agree on that.  But I think, on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis of my latest discussion with him, that he sees all theory -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; including number theory - as standing in relation (i.e. referring to)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to what is RITSIAR, not as actually *being* RITSIAR.
</em><br />
<br />I think just the opposite. He thinks arithmetic &quot;models&quot; arithmetic
<br />
truth. But arithmetic truth just is arithmetic truth.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Elsewhere, he's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguished between a representation of a number, and a number.  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to me that you are using Platonic to characterise what is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle unobservable, but surely that also applies to many of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretical entities appealed to by physics with equal force?
</em><br />
<br />No. an unobservale entity would be unfalsifiable. I am using the
<br />
Platonic
<br />
to characterise the real-but-immaterial.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;  Hence the question of jumping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the ontological gap is in abeyance, perhaps permanently, but in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; case in the realm of faith.  And if this is true for COMP, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; mutatis mutandis it is true for physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course not. Physics is about explaining the real world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I agree that physics is about explaining a real world - i.e. it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stands in some theoretical relation to the describably real.  But I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reiterate that you can't jump the gap from description to 'what it is'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for free - and this is not to rubbish the unique achievement of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science in human understanding.  It is simply to warn against hubris,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suppose.  What has been extraordinarily successful in one domain of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; application may yet flounder when pushed too far beyond it.
</em><br />
<br />That's pretty general.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You see, the thing that interests me about comp isn't that I know that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's true.  Rather it's because I think that it confronts the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind-body issue without sweeping the real problems under the rug.
</em><br />
<br />CMT has next to nothng to say on the issue
<br />
of phenomenal consciousness and so
<br />
does Brouno's &quot;comp&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That doesn't mean that it doesn't face the final explanatory abyss
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too, but I think it positions the mysteries much more insightfully.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The unavoidable consequence of the foregoing is that atoms, quarks and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; numbers cannot be RITSIAR.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That has not been demonstrated at all. At best you have an argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that they are not necessarily RITSIAR. Which is straightforwardly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; by the observation that theories are less than certain. All you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; writen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; boils down to the fallacy that &quot;no necessarily true&quot; implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;necessarily untrue&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, I think it boils down to the fact that no theoretical entity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should ever be seen as RITSIAR - only in some relation to it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is the very fallacy I was complaining about. You are taking
<br />
&quot;not necessarily real&quot; to imply
<br />
&quot;necessarily unreal&quot;. (NB: RITSIAR is not intended as a claim of
<br />
certainty. If you are just saying nothing is certain, you are nto
<br />
saying much).
<br />
<br />At least you don't have any support for the conclsuion that nothing
<br />
theoretical
<br />
should be seen as real beyond the argument that it might not be
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference between physics and comp is that in terms of the former
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's virtually no way of expressing this thought coherently,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whereas in terms of the latter it's a key aspect of the theory.
</em><br />
<br />Since the thought is unfounded, I don't see why that is an issue.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The unique feature of consciousness is not - as you claim - its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 'epistemic' certainty, but its status as what is *ontologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; certain*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Whatever that means.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It means its status as evidence by acquaintance of at least some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indubitable aspects of 'what it is to be' something.
</em><br />
<br />All that is delivered induibably is how things seem. Consciousness
<br />
does not offer any gold-plated insight into what things are. including
<br />
itself.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;To regard consciousness itself (or in Bruno's terms the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; ontological first person) as merely the object of 'knowledge' is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; commit the fallacy of taking 'observation' in a naively literal sense:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; i.e. to require there to be an 'observer'.  But this, self-evidently,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; can only lead to infinite regress.  Consequently, consciousness does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; not consist in the 'observation' of epistemic entities, but in their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; instantiation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Whatever that means. Surely if soemthign is insantiated, it exist and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is therefore ontological.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mean that consciousness isn't what we observe in others - or in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functioning of our brains - it's what they experience.
</em><br />
<br />Consciousness doesn't seem to be the funcitoning of brains. But then
<br />
diamond doesn;t seem to be the same as graphite.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need a different term - like consciousness-related behaviour - for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; former to avoid this confusion.  I also mean that 'epistemic entities'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - the things that we use to refer with - are instantiated in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.  Mine are anyway.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Consciousness is, as it were, the 'ontology of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; epistemology'.  When you say that the physical is basic, you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; yourself mistaking the epistemological for the ontological.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No, I am takign certain highly succesful theories to be true.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, given that the physical is what is deemed to be described by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics, then it is indeed what is assumed to be true by highly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successful theories.  But this success is not what is necessary to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bridge the mind-body gap, because the theories aren't designed for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that particular job.  In fact, they are designed precisely for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opposite of that job - i.e. to describe a state of affairs in a way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that deliberately obscures the reversal of the relationship between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory and reality.
</em><br />
<br />What reversal is that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; IOW, in this view, consciousness is theory and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physical is the touchstone of reality.
</em><br />
<br />No, on this view cosnciousness is not theory.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this view relies on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the denial (in an unavoidably Freudian sense) that the physical is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; known exclusively in terms of conscious representations on which all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extrapolation to an 'observable' reality rests.
</em><br />
<br />No it doesn't. Why shouldn;t consciousness know the non-conscious?
<br />
You are blurring epistemology and ontoloy again. I can paint
<br />
the Taj Mahal in oils, that doesn't mean
<br />
here is anything oil-painting-ish abotu the Taj Mahal.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since such representations are not in themselves observable (though of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course not unknowable) it is unreasonable to suppose that any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; putatively 'final' ontology known entirely on the basis of observation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could ever be considered a complete account of the situation.
</em><br />
<br />Who says they are unobsrvable? We can introspect them qua
<br />
consciousness, and observe their neurological basis to boot.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a real issue.  I'm by no means the only one who thinks that standard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics lacks a natural way to address this, and I feel there must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ways to re-position the issues more fruitfully - comp being one such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know what I can say to make this more compelling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so, if you still see this as nothing but the old category error stuff
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again, I give up.  No hard feelings.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; As to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; your evidence consisting in 'the whole of science', since the nature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; and significance of this evidence is precisely what is in question, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; is inadequate merely to make such appeals to authority.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Au cotnraire, it is inadequate to assume that theories are necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; false bcause they are not necessarily true.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How could I disagree?
</em><br />
<br />You did above. You said a theoretical entities should never be
<br />
taken as RITSIAR.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you really think this is the substance of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our divergence?  I merely reiterate that if some aspect of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific method and its interpretation is under dispute it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insufficient merely to lean too heavily on the fact that lots of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientists don't question it.
</em><br />
<br />I am sayign that phsycalism is correct generally, not that is
<br />
necessarily ciorrect in problem areas.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Whilst it would of course be foolish to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disregard this, one may surely still have the temerity to question any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; authority if we think it may be mistaken.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The problem is this: in the face of one indubitable ontology - that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; exemplified in consciousness - you try get physically-basic ontology
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; for free.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Free? The development of physics involves a huge effort. And note
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that I am not claiming cvertainty for it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Look, for most of my life, most of my heroes have been the champions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of science.  I'm the last person to rubbish this effort.  All I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying is that in the mind-body domain the carefully designed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; methodology of 'vexing nature' is seeking to get a 'theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything' for free - because if you really believed that physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could account for 'everything' on the basis of' any possible set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations, then IMO you don't take the 'gap'  - between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observable and the ontologically real  - that seriously.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking about everything you've said, I conclude that you don't take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it seriously in that way. And that means that I'm worrying about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something unnecessarily in your view because you say it's just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; category error.  OK, we can agree to disagree.
</em><br />
<br />OK, good. That saves me some typing. There is a gap
<br />
between the way consciousness presents itself to the observer
<br />
and the way it appears in descriptions. That doesn't necessarily
<br />
mean we are dealing with an ontological divide, and it doesn't
<br />
necessarily
<br />
have to be part of some wider gap betwee any kind of description and
<br />
any
<br />
kind of reality.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And I don't think I get any ontology from consciousness. I'll grant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that it is indubitable that it exists, but that tells me nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about *what* it is. A brute fact is not an ontology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;In other words, you simply assume that if we take ourselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; to 'be' - what? - say, neural activity in 'computational' - or some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; yet-to-be-established  - guise, then - pouf! - the ontological first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; person is conjured from mere description.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No, the first person is conjured from the brain -- from the territory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the map.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but the territory is entirely known (to the extent that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; known) in its conscious aspect, not in in terms of the observably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'physical' referents of physics-as-theory.
</em><br />
<br />Consciousness is by no mean entirely known expereientially, because it
<br />
does nto
<br />
reveal its own workings -- we don't get to peak behind the curtain.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And saying that these two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; categories are 'identical' is just pretending to monism whilst
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuing to think dualistically IMO, as I've said - and as you've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; denied - repeatedly.
</em><br />
<br />I am just pointing out the can't-grow-potatos-in-Norfolk fallacy.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; But there is no sense in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; which one can simply 'be' an epistemic 'object' - a theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; construction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As noted before, that is an artificial problem. Since theories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *can* be correct, one *can* be the referent of a  theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; description, and the referent of  a theoretical construction, if it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; has one, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a real thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;*This* is the explanatory gap,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No, it is nto the standard one in the literature. You are just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; commiting a basica fallacy -- saying that because the map is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; itself real, it cannot *represetn* a real territory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, I'm not saying that.  I'm casting doubt on whether the mapping to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the territory can be complete.
</em><br />
<br />Now you are. You have been variously doubting whether maps can be
<br />
the whole truth. or true at all in different passages.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In other words, the territory mapped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the basis of observation is still only a partial account of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complete state of affairs.  However, I do realise that this amounts to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heresy according to the standard doctrine of physics.
</em><br />
<br />It amounts to jumping to a conclusions of ontological dualism
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You still haven't said what the objection is to saying that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the mental emerges from the physical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm saying that all that can 'emerge' from one class of description is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; another class of description.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The physical is not a description/map. Physics is the description/map.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; True.  But we have no direct access to the physical-in-itself through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description, theory or mapping - only (in certain of its aspects)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />How could we have got so far without the &quot;access&quot; argument?
<br />
<br />Note that if access is taken as some kind of causal indirectness,
<br />
it doesn't have any obvious epistemic implications whatsoever.
<br />
We are communciating through IP packets that are bounced around and
<br />
relayed all over the placve.
<br />
Our communication is indirect, but that does not make it innacurate.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So if you want the mental to 'emerge' from -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or stand in true relation to - 'something', we must look beyond what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is needed to account merely for what is observed.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the facer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for physics, because of course it is precisely committed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restricting itself to accounting for what is observed, and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand the power and intent of this approach.  But to extrapolate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from this to the causal closure of a physical ontology of everything,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independent of consciousness, is fatal to a coherent resolution of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind-body issues IMO.
</em><br />
<br />You are assuming that consciousness is unobserved. But as I pointed
<br />
out in the brain-scannign argument, there is good reason to think
<br />
that all the *information* in phenomenal cosnciousness is in fact
<br />
physically available. What is missing in physical descriptions is
<br />
the mode of presentation of that informaiton  to the first person.
<br />
<br />A red quale doesn't convey information over and above &quot;that is red&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; If that exhausts your idea of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 'mental' I say you are an eliminativist.  But you say you're not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; What then?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I do think there is an explanatory gap, and I also think it is very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the the nature of the mental and the nature of phsycial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *descriptions*. However
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that does not mean that it is impossible for the mental territory to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emrge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from the physical territory. There are two things here, the brute fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; -- *that* the mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emerges -- and the  explanation -- *how* it emerges.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We may agree here.  It depends what you mean by 'how'.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You have in fact *not* criticised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the emergence of mental territory from physial territory, you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; criticised the emergence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the mental territory from the physcical map. Well, you can't grow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; potatos in a map of Norfolk,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but you can still grow potatos in Norfolk.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, it's not because I don't recognise the distinction, at any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; event.  I just want to be convinced we're getting real potatoes, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not just a load of stories about potatoes, that leaves us as hungry as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;This, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; take it, can be construed only as a particularly odd form of dualism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; or eliminativism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Don't take it, expalin how you came to that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The explanation, which I've referred to above, is this: there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim that two categories -  conscious experience itself, and a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical ontology characterised exhaustively in observable terms - are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalent.  I say that any such claim is implicitly dualistic: IOW it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must appeal to 'something else' to fill what is not accounted for.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Alternatively, to deny that anything remains unaccounted for is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *eliminate* the 'something else'.
</em><br />
<br />You say that. The people who agree with it disagree that there is
<br />
anything unaccoutned for.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; At this point, I feel that the issues have had a good outing and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; further detailed commenting would be otiose.  I don't expect either of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us have shifted our position, though speaking personally I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really welcome the opportunity to do so, if I could see a compelling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason.  If you can think of a new angle of attack, that could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really helpful.  But for now, I'm signing off.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David&gt;&gt; The 'arbitrariness' is inherent in the burden of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the term 'functionalism', which is intrinsically neutral as to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; details of physical implementation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No, there are two quite differnt claim here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1. A function can have multiple instantions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2. Anything can instantiate any function.
</em><br />
<br />It's a pity you didn't comment on that.
