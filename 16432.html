<br />So, going back to some of your other posts about &quot;transmitting&quot; a copy
<br />
of a person from Brussels to Moscow.  What is it that is transmitted?
<br />
Information, right?  So for that to be a plausible scenario we have to
<br />
say that a person at a particular instant in time can be fully
<br />
described by some set of data.
<br />
<br />It would seem to me that their conscious state at that instant must be
<br />
recoverable from that set of data.  The only question is, what
<br />
conditions must be met for them to &quot;experience&quot; this state, which is
<br />
completely described by the data set?  I don't see any obvious reason
<br />
why anything additional is needed.  What does computation really add
<br />
to this?
<br />
<br />You say that computation is crucial for this &quot;experience&quot; to take
<br />
place.  But why would this be so?  Why couldn't we just say that your
<br />
various types of mathematical logic can describe various types of
<br />
correlations, categories, patterns, and relationships between
<br />
informational states, but don't actually contribute anything to
<br />
conscious experience?
<br />
<br />Conscious experience is with the information.  Not with the
<br />
computations that describe the relations between various informational
<br />
states.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But if A is a consciousness related state, then to evaluate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the probability of personal access to B, you have to take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into account  *all* computations going from A to B
</em><br />
<br />I don't see how probability enters into it.  A and B are both fully
<br />
contained conscious states.  Both will be realized, because both
<br />
platonically exist as possible sets of information.  State B may have
<br />
a &quot;memory&quot; of State A.  State A may have an &quot;expectation&quot; (or
<br />
premonition) of State B.  But that is the only link between the two.
<br />
Otherwise the exist independenty.
<br />
<br />So Brian Greene had a good passage somewhat addressing this in his
<br />
last book.  He's actually talking about the block universe idea, but
<br />
still applicable I think:
<br />
<br />&quot;In this way of thinking, events, regardless of when they happen from
<br />
any particular perspective, just are. They all exist. They eternally
<br />
occupy their particular point in spacetime. This is no flow. If you
<br />
were having a great time at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve,
<br />
1999, you still are, since that is just one immutable location in
<br />
spacetime.
<br />
<br />The flowing sensation from one moment to the next arises from our
<br />
conscious recognition of change in our thoughts, feelings, and
<br />
perceptions. Each moment in spacetime - each time slice - is like one
<br />
of the still frames in a film. It exists whether or not some projector
<br />
light illuminates it. To the you who is in any such moment, it is the
<br />
now, it is the moment you experience at that moment. And it always
<br />
will be. Moreover, within each individual slice, your thoughts and
<br />
memories are sufficiently rich to yield a sense that time has
<br />
continuously flowed to that moment. This feeling, this sensation that
<br />
time is flowing, doesn't require previous moments - previous frames -
<br />
to be sequentially illuminated.&quot;
<br />
<br />On your earlier post:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The physical has to emerge from the statistical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability interference among all computations, going through my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (current) states that are indiscernible from my point of view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why such interference takes the form of wave interference is still a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (technical) open problem.
</em><br />
<br />In my view, I just happen to be inhabit a perceptual universe that is
<br />
fairly orderly and follows laws of cause and effect.  However, there
<br />
are other conscious observers (including other versions of me) who
<br />
inhabit perceptual universes that are much more chaotic and
<br />
nonsensical.
<br />
<br />But everything that can be consciously experienced is experienced,
<br />
because there exists information (platonically) that describes a mind
<br />
(human, animal, or other) having that experience.
<br />
<br />I say that because it seems to me that this information could
<br />
(theoretically) be produced by a computer simulation of such a mind,
<br />
which would presumably be conscious.  So add platonism to that, and
<br />
there you go!
