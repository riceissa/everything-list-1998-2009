Wei Dai asked
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is consciousness based on information or computation? Let me give an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;example to explain what I mean. Suppose there is a computer running an AI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;program. Assuming computationalism, this computation should contribute to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the measure on conscious experiences. Now suppose there are two computers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;independently running two identical AI programs with the same inputs. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;should make twice as much contribution to the consciousness measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But now suppose there is one computer running an AI program, and a second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computer that makes a copy of the first computer's state after every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;operation. My question is how much contribution to the consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure does this setup make, compared to the single computer setup? If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness is based on computation, then it makes the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contribution, since there is just one instance of the AI computation being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;run. But if consciousness is based on information, then it makes twice as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;much contribution, since there are two copies of the AI's state at any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;given time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So which is it?
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure I understand why you choose the words computation and 
<br />
information, but let use these words. Neither don't Ifeel easy with the 
<br />
expression &quot;measure of consciousness&quot; : I understand it as a question of 
<br />
measuring conditionnal probabilities. Let me put it in the following way :
<br />
You are computationnalist so you are willing to use (classical) 
<br />
teletransportation. So your instantaneous description is read at 
<br />
Amsterdam (let us say) and then you are annihilated (100% of success, 
<br />
this is not possible with MWI, let us suppose it is possible for the sake 
<br />
of the argument). Then you are build following the description at 
<br />
Washington in one exemplar, and you are build in Moscow in 9 exemplars. 
<br />
What is your expectation, when you are at Amsterdam of feeling yourself 
<br />
appearing in Washington after the experiment ? I suppose the 9 exemplars 
<br />
in Moscow are build in identical but separate closed rooms.
<br />
Would you say there is something like 1/10 of appearing in Washington and 
<br />
9/10 appearing in Moscow ? 
<br />
For computationnalism making sense, I believe there must be a difference.
<br />
If there is no difference there is a risk of collapsing all 
<br />
computationnal state, at least from a first person point of view.
<br />
I think that this question is fundamental both for the computationnalist 
<br />
and any many-worlder. Nevertheless it is not easy to formalize such 
<br />
question. I think it is an important open problem.
<br />
<br />Gilles wrote 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I personnaly deny the concept of &quot;measure of conscious experiment&quot;. I deny
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the fact that consciousness is an *objective* property of matter, just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because you can not define a physical property, measurable by an external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;apparatus, whose measure could determine the degree of consciousness (or if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you can, let me know).
</em><br />
<br />OK, but just replace &quot;measure of conscious experiment&quot; by &quot;probability of 
<br />
having a personal experience&quot;. See above.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Much of the discussion about consciouness is plagued by this fact, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we include it in formalisms that have not been deviced to handle it.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only consciousness we know is our own one, by means that are different from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;those we use to interact with the outer world. We think that the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;human beings are conscious because of the similarity of their behavior with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ours, but it does not define what is consciousness. If one succeeds in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;building a computer with a human-like behaviour (which is quite possible in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my sense), deciding if it is actually conscious or not is purely a matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of convenience, not an intrinsic property. In other words, I think the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proposition &quot;Another than me is conscious&quot; is really unprovable.
</em><br />
<br />That is a very important point. Note that the proposition &quot;I am 
<br />
conscious&quot; is also unprovable. I am used to define quasi-axiomatically 
<br />
consciousness by this very property. To be conscious = to know something 
<br />
and to feel that it is not possible to prove it. This make it possible to 
<br />
find objective root for subjectivity. The existence of unprovable (by a 
<br />
machine x) but true (about machine x) proposition encourage to use logic 
<br />
for the search of objective foundation of subjectivity.
<br />
<br />James wrote 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So it is MEANINGLESS to think of 'choice' or 'determinism'. Two meaningless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;words can be as compatible as you like.
</em><br />
<br />I think it is a question of level. At the arithmetical level or if you 
<br />
prefer at the level of the wave function of the universe 'choice' has no 
<br />
meaning. But at that level things seems to me to be deterministic 
<br />
(Schroedinger equation is determinist). But at the personal higher order 
<br />
level, choice has a meaning. The meaning is linked to the fact that I am 
<br />
ignorant -for all practical purpose- of the low level, AND I can reflect 
<br />
that practical ignorance and feel obliged to make choice.
<br />
If not, any lawyer could defend anyone very easily : O member of the 
<br />
jury, please, indulge poor Bill Clinton, after all, all he has done is 
<br />
just obeying physical deterministic equation ! And of course the jury can 
<br />
propose the death penalty to poor Bill, justifying themselves by invoking 
<br />
the same equation.
<br />
Well, by saying that 'choice' has no meaning, you take the risk of 
<br />
denying the meaning of any high level psychological term, and to produce 
<br />
something like an ethical collapse.

James wrote also
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the MWI view, we have a 'block universe' made up of every possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe and time is just a relationship between them. To speak of anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'happening' - let alone a choice - is meaningless when you take this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'Archimedian' perspective in 'nowhen' (The time issue is mastered by Huw
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Price in 'Time's Arrow and Archimedes's Point' (1997 I think) - absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;required reading.).  Determinism, free will - all meaningless.
</em><br />
<br />Right, but WE are NOT living at the Archimedian level. We do have free 
<br />
wil, just because we cannot determine ourself completely, and we can 
<br />
reflect that.
<br />
And free-wil could be an objective property of any sufficiently rich 
<br />
machines embedded in that 'block universe'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is NO reason to think that the arrow of time is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objective feature of reality.
</em><br />
<br />Same remark. I agree with that (as a matter of fact I do think there is no
<br />
reason to think that any physical stuff has an objective feature in 
<br />
reality).
<br />
BUT here too, I do think that there could be an objective feature to the 
<br />
existence of the feeling of the arrow of time for a machine (or abserver) 
<br />
which can only postulate the existence of the Archimedian level.
<br />
The intrinsical limitation of the observer can be founded on objective 
<br />
law linking the observer and the archimedian level. Exactly like Everett 
<br />
when he gives objective reasons (schroedinger equation) for subjective 
<br />
probabilities (personal histories of automaton). 
<br />
<br />Bruno.
