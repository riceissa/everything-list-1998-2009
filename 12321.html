</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I respect your belief or faith, but I want to be frank, I have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; evidences for the idea that &quot;Jesus&quot; is &quot;truth&quot;, nor can I be sure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; any clear meaning such an assertion could have, or how such an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assertion could be made scientific, even dropping Popper falsification
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; criteria. I must say I have evidences on the contrary, if only the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that humans succumb often to wishful thinking, and still more often to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; their parents wishful thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you are not sure of any clear meaning of the personal God being the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; source of everything, including of course truth, this entails not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowing the other things too.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Is that not an authoritative argument?
<br />
What if I ask to my student an exam question like give me an argument 
<br />
why the square root of 3 is irrationnal. Suppose he gives me the 
<br />
correct and convincing usual (mathematical) proof. I could give him a 
<br />
bad note for not adding: &quot;and I know that is the truth because truth is 
<br />
a gift by God&quot;.
<br />
Cute, I can directly give bad notes to all my students, and this will 
<br />
give me more time to find a falsity in your way to reason ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For a personal God, taking on our form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (incarnation), especially if we were made in the image of God in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first place, and showing through miracles, and rising from the dead...,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his dual nature (God&amp;man, celestial&amp;terrestial, G*&amp;G) seems to make a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lot more sense than something like a cross in earth orbit.  For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, giving a hug is a more personal (and thus a more appropriate)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way of expressing love, than giving a card, even though a card is more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; verifiable in a third person sense, especially after the hug is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finished.  But we do have the &quot;card&quot; too: God's written Word, even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though this is not sufficient, the incarnate hug was the primary proof,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;card&quot; was just the historical record of it.
</em><br />
<br />The card records facts. To judge them historical is already beyond my 
<br />
competence. Why the bible? Why not &quot;the question of king Milinda&quot; ?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; There can be no upward
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; emanation unless/until a sufficient downward emanation is provided. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Christianity, the downward emanation is &quot;God loves us&quot;, and then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; upward emanation is &quot;We love God&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Plotinus insists a lot on the two ways: downward emanation and upward
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; emanation. The lobian machine theology is coherent with this, even if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; negatively. It is coherent with Jef idea that pure &quot;theological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; imperatives&quot; can only be addressed by adapted &quot;story telling&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; examples, like jurisprudence in the application of laws. But then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is a proviso: none of the stories should be taken literally.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with the use of stories.  Jesus used stories almost exclusively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to communicate.  Either the hearers &quot;got it&quot; or not.  But this does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imply that stories are the only form of downward emanation.
</em><br />
<br />Of course not. Real stories and personal experiences,  and collective 
<br />
experiences and experiments ... All this can help the downward 
<br />
emanation.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incarnation was the primary means.  Otherwise, who would have been the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; story-teller?  What good are stories if the story is not teaching you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth?
</em><br />
<br />Look, I cannot take for granted even most mathematical theories 
<br />
although their relation with a notion of truth is much more easy than 
<br />
any text in natural language. Stories can be good in giving example of 
<br />
behavior in some situation, or they can help anxious children to sleep. 
<br />
Stories are not written with the idea of &quot;truth&quot;. The bibles contains 
<br />
many contradiction. And, if really you want take a sacred text as a 
<br />
theory of everything, there is a definite lack of precision.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How do we know that the ultimate source of stories is a good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; source.  Jef and Brent and others seem to be basing their truth on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really nothing more than pragmatism.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Jef perhaps. I am not sure for Brent which seems to admit some form of 
<br />
realism (even physical realism).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; This is not poetry.  Heidegger said to listen to the poet, not to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; content, but just to the fact that there is a poet, which gives us 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hope
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; that there is meaning.  However, unfulfilled hope does not provide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; meaning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hope is something purely first-personal, if I can say. So I have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; clue how hope does not provide meaning. Even little (and fortunately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; locally fulfillable hope) like hope in a cup of coffee, can provide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; meaning. Bigger (and hard to express) hopes can provide genuine bigger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; meaning, it seems to me. I am not opposed to some idea of ultimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; meaning although both personal reasons and reflection on lobianity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; me doubt that communicating such hopes can make any sense (worse, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; communication would most probably betrays the possible meaning of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is attempted to be communicated, and could even lead to the contrary).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even poetry must be based eventually on some meaning.  Even minimalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or the Theatre of the Absurd is based on some form to attempt to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicate meaninglessness.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am glad that your aren't opposed to some idea of ultimate meaning.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am open to that idea indeed. But &quot;ultimate&quot; is a very fuzzy term ... 
<br />
So I am also open that this might be &quot;not even wrong&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My whole argument is that without it our hope eventually runs out and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are left with despair, unless we lie to ourselves against the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absence of hope.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here Stathis already give a genuine comment. You are just admitting 
<br />
your argument is &quot;wishful thinking&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; The content of these words speak of the *actual* fulfillment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; of the hopes of the Greeks expressed in their hypostases.?   Are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you talking about mystical enlightening experiences. Like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; losing any remaining doubts about immortality because you have already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; seen the whole of the eternal tergiversations all at once ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By &quot;these words&quot; I was referring to the John quote from the Bible.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actual fulfillment was Jesus (the Word/Logos).  He spanned the infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gap, like you said above, perhaps analogous to hypercomputation,...all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in one step.
</em><br />
<br />Note that most notion of hypercomputation does not make it possible to 
<br />
escape the G/G* logics, and when they do escape it, the price is the 
<br />
abandon of personhood.
<br />
This is a general argument which is independent of the comp hypothesis: 
<br />
to escape the G/G* (and the related hypostases) you have to &quot;abandon&quot; 
<br />
your self or the person-hood (personal-ness I would like to say).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So apparently, accepting the personal God basis would mean that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have to reject comp.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not at all. Just taking text literally about the unnameable &quot;god&quot; is 
<br />
incompatible with comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It makes sense, even in that to accept the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal God we have to put aside anything that we were putting in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place of Him.  In fact, we put ourselves in the place of God, whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we consider ourselves a machine or not.
</em><br />
<br /><br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is why Jesus was the Word, the Logos.  God simply shouting words
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out of the sky or something would have this problem.  This is why I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said that the incarnation was primary in God's communication to us.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, but why not Nagarjuna instead? What is so special about Jesus 
<br />
(beside our culture) ?
<br />
<br />For any belief I have I try to figure out if I would have had that 
<br />
belief in completely different context. &quot;Jesus&quot; or &quot;Nagarjuna&quot; does not 
<br />
survive such a test. For example I would not have believed in Jesus in 
<br />
the case I would have born in the time of Plato, nor would I believed 
<br />
in Euler would I have born on a different planet, but it make sense 
<br />
that I would have believed in the content of their message. This forces 
<br />
us to make the argument the most universal possible, the less 
<br />
culturally influenced.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; How do you know? Are you willing to assume this clearly and build some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; axiomatization?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This follows from the acceptance of the personal God who is love (among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the three Persons I outlined using the hypostases) independently of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyone/anything else.
</em><br />
<br /><br />In an axiomatization the meaning does not depend on the choice of the 
<br />
words. Would your argument be palpable with axiomatic definition?
<br />
Do you know and accept Godel's axiomatisation of St-Anselme definition 
<br />
of God?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; I agree that it is dangerous for a child to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; keep taking a father too literally when the father tells him/her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; something.  At first, the child should take the father/mother's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; words
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; at face value, trusting that the parent is saying the right words 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; the child to understand what the parent wants them to know.  But to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; keep living with only those words, and not continue to try to learn 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; deeper understanding and grow through more communication and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exchange
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; of love.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I feel uneasy to be loved by someone because that someone has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; asked to love me. &quot;Love&quot; is essentially a &quot;second&quot; person construct.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Again &quot;telling stories&quot; will go here beyond the ten thousand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;treatises&quot; . Love stories ok, love theories, why not. But normative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; love = end of love.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree, words are not enough.  Here again, the primary communication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of love was not words e.g. a command to love, but the actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expression by the action of incarnation and giving his life and death.
</em><br />
<br /><br />In a story. I can appreciate symbolically.
<br />
If you want Jesus playing a personal role in our 3-person approach, 
<br />
just pray Him to make a 3-person communicable sign.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; And this can be done only on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; basis of the ultimate infinite Person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Again I agree. I would say the arithmetical hypostases describes such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person. In a precise theoretical frame where any one can verify the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; statements following from the axioms. Actually your &quot;ultimate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; inifinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Person&quot; is still very vague so that there are still many arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; candidates for the &quot;ultimate infinite person&quot; related to a simpler
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine like Peano Arithmetic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By &quot;ultimate&quot; I mean something that cannot be created, or generated by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; upward emanation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Nice. Like arithmetical truth. Nothing can generate it upward.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am not sure, because we can bet. We can make act of faith. We can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; learn from our mistakes, we can change our minds and still keeping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; faith, faith corrected by reason and experiences can only grow. Only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;bad or wrong faith&quot; (generally based on wishful or fearful thinking)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can fear to be &quot;corrected&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A bit like it is more easy for a parent to &quot;punish&quot; his child when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; parent &quot;truly&quot;  loves it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this hope is without an ultimate basis.  Real hope has an ultimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All the lobian point is that as far as the word &quot;real&quot; means something, 
<br />
we cannot use it and still keep the scientific attitude (humility, 
<br />
modesty).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Our hope has become even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; more hopeless, not that the reductionist hope was well-founded 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; either.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Why should our hope become more hopeless? On the contrary, knowing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we know less, we can expect more. With comp we can hope for more (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fear for more too, to be precise).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Knowledge is personal.  Without an ultimate personal basis, we cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expect or hope for more, because we have nothing to begin with.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I make it plain that S4Grz1, alias the arithmetical first person (the 
<br />
solipsist topos of &quot;conscience &amp; mécanisme), alias the third hypostase, 
<br />
is a good candidate for the ultimate personal basis. Here you should 
<br />
appreciate. In a way it vindicates both Nargarjuna and Jesus, with the 
<br />
same proviso that their &quot;stories&quot; (Jesus resurection, Nagarjuna 
<br />
reincarnation) should not be taken literally (by adults).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; But you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; saying that we have not received ANY words from God.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I have never said that. (Unless by God you mean this one, or this one,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or this one, ...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Without God putting words into a form which we can recognize as from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; him (like the incarnation) where we can say &quot;there he is&quot;, we have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way of receiving ANY words from God, and knowing it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Why?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;  there remains an *infinite* gap to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; fulfill our aspirations, which will always remain unbridged.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It depends on what you mean by &quot;fulfill&quot;. Comp could be consistent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some complete fulfilment in some limit. It is hard to work out, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; indeed it could be related with unpersonhood. (But the point is to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; our theory seriously and see where we are led)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; By
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; working from nothing, one step at a time, we will never get there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Forever Unfulfilled&quot;, there can be no true fulfillment, only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; deceiving ourselves, which also leads to death...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am not sure your &quot;pessimist&quot; derivation is valid. One of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; arithmetical comp hypostase (Bp &amp; p) is both divine and personal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We could agree on everything except for the idea that &quot;sacred text&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; should not be taken literally. And we could differ on that just for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; contingent reason we have been educated differently.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Note that I am not saying that Jesus is not the son of God, just that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have less evidence for that than for the *primitive* physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in which I still don't believe either.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I know I am demanding, concerning evidence and conviction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, the &quot;sacred text&quot; by itself is not sufficient.  The proof is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God's actual act of love toward us.  For us, love is expressed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meeting our need, which was our being lost and dead, separated (by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evil, by definition) from truth, meaning and life.
</em><br />
<br />You refer to personal things. If you are lucky enough to be blessed by 
<br />
Love, it is ok, especially if it inspire you to work toward a 
<br />
communciable theory. But nobody can use such reference in a theory. 
<br />
Even, and I would say especially in a &quot;theological&quot; theory.
<br />
<br />Bruno
