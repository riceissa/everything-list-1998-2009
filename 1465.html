Fred,
<br />
<br />Some jottings on your recent post which might conceivably be of interest.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; An essence of being an SAS is to perceive lawlike behavior in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe it inhabits. Laws are essentially ways an SAS organizes what it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observes about the world around it. In this way an SAS is able to learn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from its surroundings, generalize event patterns into laws and constants
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that characterize its universe, and predict the likelihood of future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events. An SAS with finite knowledge will allow for rare, apparent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; violations of laws, but assumes that an explanation exists for that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparent violation, which fits in with the laws it has knowledge of.
</em><br />
<br />Under AUH, unfortunately it is neither *necessary* for a SAS to perceive
<br />
totally law-like behaviour, nor try to fit all observed behaviour to laws.
<br />
Firstly, there will be a relatively few unlucky SAS's who *do* perceive
<br />
dragon/WR events in any AUH (some will have more than can be explained away
<br />
as hallucinations etc); secondly, it is the case that the majority of SAS's
<br />
on this planet would ascribe at least some paranormal events that they see
<br />
or think they see (like miracles, angels, or nde's) to divine, rather than
<br />
law-based, explanations - this doesn't disqualify them from being SAS's.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So it is no surprise, that, for example, a dragon event is never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observed. If some SAS reported the sighting of a dragon event, its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fellow SAS's would pass it off as a hallucination. That would be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'natural' (i.e., fits in with the known laws) explanation. Similarly, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a group of SASs reported the dragon event, it would be passed off as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; group hallucination, or possibly, a hoax. If there is an 'objectively'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confirmed string of dragon sightings by SAS scientists, either the known
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws would be updated while maintaining their simplicity (if that were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible) or else there would be great effort by the SASs to find a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'natural' explanation (e.g., the SAS's passed through a wormhole into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another universe).
</em><br />
<br />I agree that a minimal number of dragon events could in practice be
<br />
dismissed as a mass-hallucination or something like that, but one cannot use
<br />
this fact to *explain* the lack of established dragon events, not least
<br />
because the main counter to the AUH is that there should be *maximal*
<br />
law-less behaviour, consistent with the existence of a SAS (so perhaps
<br />
events on Earth would be straightforward, but elsewhere (except for the
<br />
life-supporting Sun) they would be chaotic). To refute this we need more
<br />
careful analysis, such as that in Russell's paper, or my web site. (For MWI
<br />
instead of AUH it's a whole different ball-game.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Similarly, the Strong Anthropic Principle is really a statement that any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SAS will find itself will observe itself in a universe that allows it to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist. The SAS should be aware which conditions that allow SAS's to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist and conditions which do not allow SAS's to exist. The appearance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of fine-tuning really becomes rather subjective - how narrow should the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; range of values of allowed parameters should be so that there appears to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be fine-tuning?
</em><br />
<br />I don't agree that the range of fine-tuning is subjective, given a
<br />
reasonable physics framework. We may have problems assessing it, or there
<br />
may be other types of SAS that we are not aware of, but that is a different
<br />
matter.
<br />
<br />Alastair
