<br />I just want to continue the train of thought about measure and perform a type of UD
<br />
experiment that Bruno has been talking about to show that the constancy of measure as
<br />
seen from the first person perspective is a reasonable hypothesis.
<br />
<br />Many years ago I read about a parachutist whose parachute had not fully open. He was
<br />
saved by a fluky combination of circumstances. He happened to land through a  tree and
<br />
on the ground covered with a deep layer of snow. He got away with some broken bones,
<br />
but remained alive. I don't remember his exact name but suffice it to say, for our
<br />
thought experiment that we now live in a subset S1 of the branching pattern (in the
<br />
plenitude) in which those unlikely events took place. Let the set of  &quot;other&quot; branches
<br />
in which the man died be named S0.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From a third person point of view ( a la Jacques Mallah for example) the number of
</em><br />
branches in S0 are more numerouse than the number of branches in S1. Hence measure M0&gt;
<br />
M1.
<br />
<br />Now lets examine the converse situation. Another man jumps in a parachute, the
<br />
parachute does not open and the man dies. This event is unlikely but has occured a few
<br />
times. There are worlds in the plenitude where this man lives, but not in our world.
<br />
He is dead. These other worlds are extremely unlikely for they must include a rare
<br />
combination of circumstances (tree, snow, water, partially opened parachute, etc) Let
<br />
the worlds where this man lives be the set of branches S2.
<br />
<br />Clearly from the third person perspective, the number of branches in S2 is much
<br />
smaller than the number of branches in S1. Hence M2&lt;M1
<br />
<br />Therefore we have the third person perspective of measure
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M2&lt;M1&lt;M0
<br />
<br />Yet the worlds S0, S1, S2, are all physically speaking identical except for the
<br />
existence or non existence of one person. The laws of physics are the same.
<br />
<br />Now let's take a step back and replace the very emotionally charged facts of seeing a
<br />
man live or die after a parachute jump by simple &quot;inorganic&quot; facts, millions and
<br />
millions of them which characterize each branch in the plenitude. The important thing
<br />
to keep in mind is that none of these facts are privileged. The are just random
<br />
branching outcomes that affect the history of the observer without directly affecting
<br />
his life. There is no reason why these unprivileged facts should affect the first
<br />
person measure of the world.
<br />
<br />Now here is my relativistic assumption:
<br />
If an observer located in S0 attempts to measure M0 (number of branches corresponding
<br />
to S0), he would find the same number as an observer in  S1 attempting to measure M1
<br />
and as an observer in S2 attempting to measure M2 - Reason: the laws of physics are
<br />
the same. The only difference between these worlds are facts which do not affect the
<br />
existence of the observer. These facts only affect the history of the world that he
<br />
can observe.
<br />
