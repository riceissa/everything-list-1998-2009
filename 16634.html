<br />No, no, no.  I'm not saying that at all.  Ultimately I'm saying that
<br />
if there is a physical world, it's irrelevant to consciousness.
<br />
Consciousness is information.  Physical systems can be interpreted as
<br />
representing, or &quot;storing&quot;, information, but that act of &quot;storage&quot;
<br />
isn't what gives rise to conscious experience.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You're aware of course that the same things were said about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physio/chemical bases of life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />You mentioned that point before, as I recall.  Dennett made a similar
<br />
argument against Chalmers, to which Chalmers had what I thought was an
<br />
effective response:
<br />
<br />-------
<br />
<a href="http://consc.net/papers/moving.html">http://consc.net/papers/moving.html</a>
<br />
<br />Perhaps the most common strategy for a type-A materialist is to
<br />
deflate the &quot;hard problem&quot; by using analogies to other domains, where
<br />
talk of such a problem would be misguided. Thus Dennett imagines a
<br />
vitalist arguing about the hard problem of &quot;life&quot;, or a neuroscientist
<br />
arguing about the hard problem of &quot;perception&quot;. Similarly, Paul
<br />
Churchland (1996) imagines a nineteenth century philosopher worrying
<br />
about the hard problem of &quot;light&quot;, and Patricia Churchland brings up
<br />
an analogy involving &quot;heat&quot;. In all these cases, we are to suppose,
<br />
someone might once have thought that more needed explaining than
<br />
structure and function; but in each case, science has proved them
<br />
wrong. So perhaps the argument about consciousness is no better.
<br />
<br />This sort of argument cannot bear much weight, however. Pointing out
<br />
that analogous arguments do not work in other domains is no news: the
<br />
whole point of anti-reductionist arguments about consciousness is that
<br />
there is a disanalogy between the problem of consciousness and
<br />
problems in other domains. As for the claim that analogous arguments
<br />
in such domains might once have been plausible, this strikes me as
<br />
something of a convenient myth: in the other domains, it is more or
<br />
less obvious that structure and function are what need explaining, at
<br />
least once any experiential aspects are left aside, and one would be
<br />
hard pressed to find a substantial body of people who ever argued
<br />
otherwise.
<br />
<br />When it comes to the problem of life, for example, it is just obvious
<br />
that what needs explaining is structure and function: How does a
<br />
living system self-organize? How does it adapt to its environment? How
<br />
does it reproduce? Even the vitalists recognized this central point:
<br />
their driving question was always &quot;How could a mere physical system
<br />
perform these complex functions?&quot;, not &quot;Why are these functions
<br />
accompanied by life?&quot; It is no accident that Dennett's version of a
<br />
vitalist is &quot;imaginary&quot;. There is no distinct &quot;hard problem&quot; of life,
<br />
and there never was one, even for vitalists.
<br />
<br />In general, when faced with the challenge &quot;explain X&quot;, we need to ask:
<br />
what are the phenomena in the vicinity of X that need explaining, and
<br />
how might we explain them? In the case of life, what cries out for
<br />
explanation are such phenomena as reproduction, adaptation,
<br />
metabolism, self-sustenance, and so on: all complex functions. There
<br />
is not even a plausible candidate for a further sort of property of
<br />
life that needs explaining (leaving aside consciousness itself), and
<br />
indeed there never was. In the case of consciousness, on the other
<br />
hand, the manifest phenomena that need explaining are such things as
<br />
discrimination, reportability, integration (the functions), and
<br />
experience. So this analogy does not even get off the ground.
<br />
<br />------
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Though it DOES seem plausible/obvious to me that a physical system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; going through a sequence of these representations is what produces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; human behavior.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you're saying that a sequence of physical representations is enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to produce behavior.
</em><br />
<br />Right, observed behavior.  What I'm saying here is that it seems
<br />
obvious to me that mechanistic computation is sufficient to explain
<br />
observed human behavior.  If that was the only thing that needed
<br />
explaining, we'd be done.  Mission accomplished.
<br />
<br />BUT...there's subjective experience that also needs explained, and
<br />
this is actually the first question that needs answered.  All other
<br />
answers are suspect until subjective experience has been explained.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And there must be conscious experience associated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with behavior.
</em><br />
<br />Well, here's where it gets tricky.  Conscious experience is associated
<br />
with information.  But how information is tied to physical systems is
<br />
a different question.  Any physical systems can be interpreted as
<br />
representing all sorts of things (again, back to Putnam and Searle,
<br />
one-time pads, Maudlin's Olympia example, Bruno's movie graph
<br />
argument, rocks implementing every FSA, Stathis's birds and trees, and
<br />
triviality attacks on functionalism).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That seems to me to imply that physical representations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are enough to produce consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />The problem is that physical &quot;representations&quot; are everywhere.  The
<br />
problem is coming up with a non-arbitrary way of deciding when a
<br />
physical system represents something that's conscious and when it
<br />
doesn't.
<br />
<br />Physical systems are too representationally promiscuous!
<br />
<br />Which leads me to abandon physicalism/materialism for idealism.
