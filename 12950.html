MP: .....
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  That is one thing. Another thing is that no entity or set of entities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  could know if their 'simulation' attempt was doing what they wanted in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  every detail because to attempt to find this out would interfere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  irreversibly with the unfolding of the world.
</em><br />
<br />Brent:
<br />
This assumes that the simulation must be quantum mechanical - but I 
<br />
think that would defeat the whole point of assuming a simulation. If the 
<br />
world can be simulated classically, then it can be monitored without 
<br />
interference.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
MP: well actually I wasn't thinking about QM at all; I guess most of my 
<br />
thinking is 'classical' although I realise of course that QM principles 
<br />
impose minimum sizes for basic components of all information processing 
<br />
systems.
<br />
<br />My concern is much more a pronounced sceptical disbelief in the ability 
<br />
of sentient creatures at any order of magnitude to be able to control 
<br />
all the variables in a system they wish to impose. I think the basic 
<br />
condition is always going to be that we and they CANNOT. My usual 
<br />
expression of this, said in the context of working at a low level in a 
<br />
bureaucracy, is that in any given situation there are always more things 
<br />
which can occur than we want to occur, and usually there are more things 
<br />
which can occur than we can possibly know about. This is a long winded 
<br />
way of expressing 'Murphy's Law', but it is also a precise way of 
<br />
stating in plain-English how entropy manifests at the level of our 
<br />
work-a-day lives.
<br />
<br />The thing is, setting up a simulation or emulation of something requires 
<br />
giving up some degree of control over the process. I mean that's what we 
<br />
have machines for isn't it,to do the work for us? And as far as I can 
<br />
see, despite what Bruno says, the numbers have got to BE somewhere. So 
<br />
the cosmic Boffins have got to have systems which are at least to some 
<br />
degree autonomous. [As I write this it seems to me I am cutting at the 
<br />
root of Bishop Berkeley's concept of being in the mind of God, or some 
<br />
such.] In fact considering the scale of what is being contemplated I 
<br />
would assume that at least some parts of the system would be interacting 
<br />
in recursive self-referential ways that guaranteed unpredictability. And 
<br />
if it is unpredictable then you are not controlling it; it is simply 
<br />
happening, and it is non-QM randomness.
<br />
<br />I can see I have rambled on here a bit too much, but I have to say I 
<br />
think the issue of testing to see if what you predicted is really 
<br />
happening, must involve some interference in the simulation process 
<br />
itself, either that or the measurement is estimation with significant 
<br />
error margins.
<br />
<br /><br />I also think there is a strong argument from ethics that we are NOT in a 
<br />
simulation and furthermore that that sort of thing just doesn't happen. 
<br />
My argument is very presumptuous of course but, what the heck, if there 
<br />
IS a conspiracy of ET, pan-dimensional experimenters out there somewhere 
<br />
tweaking their coding to make our world ever more 'realistic', well they 
<br />
NOW have a moral duty to show themselves and give account for what they 
<br />
have done. Why? Because if they are smart enough to do such a thing then 
<br />
they are also smart enough to realise that they are causing avoidable 
<br />
harm and suffering to people here on Earth and this has been going on 
<br />
for a long time. [and it's gotta stop!]
<br />
<br />If they don't show themselves and give account then they are just a 
<br />
bunch of moral wimps who do not deserve our respect, let alone 
<br />
adoration. This will be true even only if there is only The One.    It 
<br />
is the question that has to be directed at all those who wield power: If 
<br />
you are so smart, why aren't you kind?
<br />
<br />It's like Terry Pratchett says: There is only one sin, and that is to 
<br />
treat another person like a thing.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is mixing Everett's relative state interpretation with the idea that the world is a simulation.  These are not the same and maybe not even compatible.  The world evolves deterministically in Hilbert space and the &quot;many-worlds&quot; are projections relative to us.  Whether this can be simulated, except in a quantum computer, is questionable because the Hilbert space is infinite dimensional.  Is some fixed finite resolution sufficient for simulation?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP: I don't think I can accept this. Maybe I sound arrogant in saying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this, but I think the idea of simulation is used a bit too loosely. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; know there are those lurking on the Mind &amp; Brain list and JCS-online who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would say I am 'the pot calling the kettle black', because I am always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; asserting what I call UMSITW [pronounced um-see-two for English 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; speakers] - updating the model of self in the world - is the basis of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness. But they misunderstand me, because I do not say there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; anyone else doing simulation, merely that we experience being here 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because the universe has evolved self sustaining regions within itself 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which maintain their structure by means of dynamically modelling 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; themselves and their local region so as to avoid fatal dangers while 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; obtaining everything they need from their environments. My point here is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simply that the universe is its own best simulation and that any ideas 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of something greater, such as a Matrix type operation, are science 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fiction only. Why? Because for a feasible universe like the one we seem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to inhabit to be deterministic does not require that it is predictable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nor that it can be repeatable. Nobody knows to what extent quantum level 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; events are intrinsically random as opposed to being _pushed from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'behind' or 'below'_ so to speak.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That is one thing. Another thing is that no entity or set of entities
