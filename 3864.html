</em><br />
<br />Several points:
<br />
<br />1. Perhaps you need to give it more time, as reading Lawvere and 
<br />
Schanuel is not light reading. (It's at about the same level as Raymond 
<br />
Smullyan's recent books on logic are. Or perhaps to Hofstadter's &quot;Godel, 
<br />
Escher, Bach.&quot; Not dense texts, but also not light reading.)
<br />
<br />2. Or perhaps you can do what I do, which is to read several related 
<br />
books at the same time, the various books illuminating the topic in 
<br />
various ways.
<br />
<br />3. As for fundamental relevance, I see it as important for mathematics 
<br />
and computer science, as well as for certain (mostly frontier) issues in 
<br />
physics. Not everyone does, even in math. You mention logic and 
<br />
recursion theory, so you might want to do some Web searches on some of 
<br />
these names: Martin Hyland (the effective topos, Eff), Joyal, Bell (not 
<br />
the QM Bell), in connection with topos theory. The Paul Taylor book I 
<br />
mentioned a while back has much material on logic, computability, with 
<br />
lots of connections shown with category and topos theory.
<br />
<br />(But, &quot;moving on&quot; to topos theory without knowing some category theory 
<br />
is no more advisable than &quot;moving on&quot; to quantum theory without knowing 
<br />
a fair amount of classical physics would be. Nothing wrong with dabbling 
<br />
in several areas--QM, GR, classical--at the same time, using the &quot;MBI&quot; 
<br />
(Many Books Interpretation).)
<br />
<br />4. I find category and topos theory to be refreshing, stimulating, and 
<br />
foundational. The Lawvere and Schanuel is a leisurely, 
<br />
lots-of-exposition-and-motivational treatment which requires almost no 
<br />
prerequisites, which is why both Bruno and myself recommend it. It is 
<br />
definitely _not_ a &quot;Why category theory is really important!&quot; sort of 
<br />
book.
<br />
<br />5. Your mileage may vary. It may never be as interesting to you as it is 
<br />
to me. That's a feature, not a bug. Or you may come back to it after a 
<br />
while.
<br />
<br />(Looking through my copy of Pearl's &quot;Causality,&quot; simple graph theory 
<br />
would be more immediately useful as background prep.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Topos theory seems to be motivated by intuitionistic logic, which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered the logical basis of constructive mathematics (according to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intuitionistic/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intuitionistic/</a>). Does that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should learn something about intuitionistic logic and constructivism 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before trying to tackle topos theory?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I think so. Doesn't mean you need to read an entire book on it, 
<br />
though.
<br />
<br />Smullyan's &quot;Forever Undecided,&quot; 1987, is a good survey of parts of 
<br />
modern logic. Not much on intuitionistic logc, but still good 
<br />
preparation. A good chapter on possible worlds and Kripke's 
<br />
contributions. (Which has strong connections to topos theory, as I've 
<br />
mentioned.)
