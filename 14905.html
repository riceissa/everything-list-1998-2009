Hi Folks,
<br />
I can't throw myself any further into this ... I have to get back in the 
<br />
fray here. However - a couple of quick-ones for Brent and Bruno:
<br />
<br />COL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the instant the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstraction happens, from that moment on you know NOTHING about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current state of the distal environment...all you have is IO 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measurements. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
BRENT
<br />
And that's all a human scientist has too - IO measurements by his senses.
<br />
<br />COL
<br />
This is just plain empirically, factually wrong. The whole of 
<br />
neuroscience for 100 years confirms that perception is a central nervous 
<br />
system functiona: CRANIAL, CENTRAL. Not peripheral. The CNS qualia are 
<br />
observation. The peripheral nervous system has/bestows no experienced 
<br />
qualities whatever. It only feel like it does because of the CNS doing 
<br />
its thing. I don't want to debate this. I shouldn;t have to. Go and look 
<br />
it up. There's about a million books and papers on it. In terms of my 
<br />
discussion of a scientist:
<br />
a) CNS qualia are scientific observation
<br />
b) The events in the distal world outside the scientist are the 
<br />
scientific measurement.
<br />
<br />In the scenario I painted, the scientist COMP_S has to be hooked up to 
<br />
IO (you could even put the COMP_S inside a human body). Results are 
<br />
identical. There is absolutely no point in simulating the distal natural 
<br />
world! You are there to do SCIENCE: You don't know what the distal 
<br />
natural world is, by definition! Therefore you can't possibly simulate 
<br />
it ...and... if you could you wouldn't want to do science on it... 
<br />
that's the nice point about this scenario. It cuts out the logical holes.
<br />
<br />BRUNO:
<br />
Please don't get me wrong. I actually hold the universe to be literally 
<br />
a mathematics...not COMP _OF_ a mathematics. There is no computer. The 
<br />
universe is the computer. There's no _abstractions_ of it. There's 
<br />
actual reified symbols interacting with each other, not being forced to 
<br />
interact by something else..... but that's a whole other story only 
<br />
indirectly related to the one I told.
<br />
<br />In regards to being guided by what the HUMAN_S vs COMP_S scenario tells 
<br />
us  - as is usual in the most Popperian of science... what I get is 
<br />
merely guidance in my behaviour - my choices - as a designer. I don't 
<br />
get told by the analysis a 'truth' or what to do. I get told by the 
<br />
analysis what NOT to do  - or better - what choices  to refrain from 
<br />
making. The COMP_S is an _abstract_ symbol manipulator. When you 
<br />
abstract X, then all relations between X and everything else (through 
<br />
the parallelness with all the other entities in the universe) - are all 
<br />
gone.
<br />
<br />Classical mathematical thinking is a single stream  - a single line of 
<br />
proof. Our abstractions are the axioms in such a style of proof. But 
<br />
that's NOT what any entity X (the intended abstracted entity) has. If 
<br />
there are 10^1234  entities in the universe then X has (10^ 1234 -1) 
<br />
relationships with everything that is not X. Our models throw all of 
<br />
them away. I cannot prove that these relationships play no part in 
<br />
scientific behaviour. Nor can you. So in my design I shall, in the 
<br />
popperian tradition, refrain from making any choice that eliminates 
<br />
those relationships. So: abstract COMP is OUT as an option.
<br />
<br />You said:
<br />
<br />&quot;That we cannot build constructively a scientist is correct. But it is  
<br />
then very misleading to use the word &quot;false&quot;. Also, it is not because  
<br />
we cannot built constructively a scientist that we can infer that we  
<br />
are unable to isolate one, or to copy one, (and then: without  
<br />
constructively proving that we have done so). We just cannot know who  
<br />
we are.
<br />
By using &quot;false&quot; here you change the usual meaning of the word, and it  
<br />
could lead to add misunderstandings in a field where there are already  
<br />
many misunderstandings.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />OK we're getting to the nub of it. Firstly I disagree that &quot;we cannot 
<br />
build constructively a scientist&quot;. I hold that we can... unless by &quot;We&quot; 
<br />
you mean &quot;All those people who subscribe to COMP&quot; .. in which case you 
<br />
are correct. I hold that we CAN. I am not interested in copies or 
<br />
'simulations' = pretending. My scenario demands authentic original 
<br />
science done from a point of view of incomplete knowledge of a system 
<br />
from the vantage point of being literally built inside the system being 
<br />
scientifically described.
<br />
<br />RE: 'falsity', 'refutation' etc.
<br />
The BEER definition of
<br />
<br />COMP = '...the theoretical claim that a system's behavior derives from 
<br />
its instantiation of appropriate representations and computational 
<br />
processes.&quot; Beer, R. D. (1995), 'A Dynamical-Systems Perspective on 
<br />
Agent Environment Interaction'. Artificial Intelligence 72(1-2):pp. 
<br />
173-215.
<br />
<br />Such a definition does not preclude &quot;scientific behaviour&quot; as a &quot;system 
<br />
behaviour&quot;. Therefore COMP predicted that a scientitist can be created 
<br />
by &quot;instantiation of appropriate representations and computational 
<br />
processes&quot; , which I take to mean, as most would , a Turing 
<br />
Machine/digital computing abstraction-based symbol manipulator.
<br />
<br />*FACT 1:* COMP cannot deliver one very specific, highly specialised 
<br />
thing: an authentic scientist. For all the reasons I have supplied in 
<br />
previous posts.
<br />
<br />YES you can simulate a scientidst...! From that point of view COMP is 
<br />
true. But if you could you wouldn;t want to because all the science must 
<br />
have been done already... otherwise you wouldn't be able to simulate it! 
<br />
The logic is compelling.
<br />
<br />By the BEER definition (which is only a theoretical claim anyway!), 
<br />
because FACT 1, COMP is false in the specialised circumstance.... 
<br />
therefore it is methodologically false as a general/universal claim.
<br />
<br />I don't give a stuff about the survival of COMP as a concept. All I care 
<br />
about is making good decisions. A good decision involves NOT choosing 
<br />
COMP to build something capable of doing authentic original science on 
<br />
the a-priori unknown....and... something that is provably capable of 
<br />
such a scientific act is logically arguable to be capable of less 
<br />
rigorous, everyday problem solving of the kind humans do....
<br />
<br />COMP is refuted as a general claim. It doesn't mean it's not useful. It 
<br />
just means that you can't simulate a scientist. You can still use COMP 
<br />
to do a whole lot od things.... just not artificial GENERAL intelligence.
<br />
<br />The useful way ahead is to forget about 'computing' the universe and 
<br />
start discussing the universe AS innate computation (there is no 
<br />
computer!). But this is not COMP as I understand it. You can rearrange 
<br />
the meaning of the words all you like... there's no intrinsic value in 
<br />
being right by a definition! What need to do is make correct choices... 
<br />
so COMP - as defined above - is a dead idea...way past its use-by date. 
<br />
I don't need to think about UTMs or dovetailers or anything else 
<br />
designed to make up for the fundamental shortcomings of a COMP approach 
<br />
... I have an empirically testable, logically arguable, here and now 
<br />
decision-maker.
<br />
<br />In my INORGANIC_S ...there is still 'computation'... but the computation 
<br />
involves manipulation of natural symbols and the 'rules of 
<br />
transformation' of it, as a calculus ...are literally Maxwell's 
<br />
microscopic equations. All relationships with everything else that is 
<br />
NOT (INORGANIC_S) are conserved and allowed to influence the dynamics.
<br />
<br />If you want to redefine COMP to include such natural symbol 
<br />
manipulation...fine...! It makes COMP true, but changes nothing....I 
<br />
still decide to do the same thing...NOT to use Church-Post-Turing-based 
<br />
approaches which force the computing to be dissociated from the computed 
<br />
through any abstraction process..
<br />
<br />So... Marc... you can let Mr Yudkowski know that his ideas are formally 
<br />
refuted as a way to AGI. I am thinking of going to the AGI conference 
<br />
next year... in which case I'll tell them all!
<br />
<br />Until next time....
<br />
<br />cheers

<br /><br /><br />================================
<br />
I can;t do any more now... please run with it... I have to dissappear 
<br />
back into my work... I have an INORGANIC_S to build!
<br />
<br />Thanks for the interesting sparring...to be continued another day... 
<br />
maybe when my COMP refutations come out in print.
<br />
<br />cheers
