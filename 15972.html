<br />
Kim, Russell
<br />
<br />I appreciate your concern and propositions. I have a friend who thinks  
<br />
about making a book with a subsubsection only (in french), and I think  
<br />
that you could make hundreds of books from &quot;Conscience et Mécanisme&quot;.  
<br />
And I believe this could give money to the publishers, and the  
<br />
translators and even the author, and even leads to movie and t-shirts!  
<br />
Everything I say follows from the idea, which can or cannot be in  
<br />
fashion, of self-duplication. I make this clearer in the &quot;The secret  
<br />
of the Amoeba&quot; (the book ordered by the Grasset french publisher).  
<br />
Self and self-duplication is a perennial thought object with a strong  
<br />
appeal to the art. Have you read Borgess?
<br />
<br />Also, mechanism is today the most believed idea, but few are aware of  
<br />
the startling consequences, and of the non triviality and generality  
<br />
of the notion of &quot;universal machine/number/system/...&quot;.
<br />
<br />And my work can also be seen just as enthusiasm in front of the  
<br />
universal machine mathematical world.
<br />
<br /><br />Well I am afraid I have to die for this being true. For sad and boring  
<br />
circumstantial circumstances.
<br />
<br /><br />And then Mirek is right too and I should write a book (and a paper),  
<br />
instead.
<br />
<br /><br />But , and this is part of a problem, I have progressed, and I have  
<br />
progressed on the obviously most delicate point at the heart of  
<br />
computationalism (alas), the fundamental difference it introduced into  
<br />
public provability (about numbers,  machines and machine's discourses)  
<br />
and truth about those things.
<br />
And the fact that universal machine can observe that difference, and  
<br />
can actually *live* that difference.
<br />
It is the theological part. It is already in &quot;Conscience and  
<br />
Mécanisme&quot;, with the chapter &quot;theology and modality&quot;. But there I  
<br />
almost define &quot;theology&quot; by &quot;modal logic&quot; following a sort of  
<br />
tradition. The many modal logics have been conceived to help reasoning  
<br />
on fundamental metaphysical and theological issues, and nowadays  
<br />
computer science enlarge that sets of theories.
<br />
The progress is in the arithmetical interpretation of Plotinus. The  
<br />
Gödel provability predicates illustrates the appearance of a purely  
<br />
mathematical modality, but the &quot;yes doctor&quot; hypothesis/act of faith  
<br />
justifies, for each machines an &quot;abstract&quot; mathematical theology,  
<br />
which has 8 &quot;natural hypostases&quot;, with 3 of them justifying or  
<br />
describing the comp physics (making that theology testable), quanta  
<br />
and qualia being distinguished by the Gödel inherited splitting  
<br />
between the modalities.
<br />
A toy theology with a complete cosmogony and theogony It is weird. And  
<br />
to be sure, the white rabbit problem has not been solved, only  
<br />
translated into a purely mathematical problem.
<br />
<br />Anyway I am a bit stuck. Both by boring contingent difficulties and  
<br />
interesting necessary difficulties. Explaining the consequences of  
<br />
comp in this list, like currently, could augment (or diminish) the  
<br />
probability that I write the book, or perhaps I could write the book  
<br />
on-line, so that when more than five or ten people acknowledge a  
<br />
chapter is clear enough I go to the next chapter,  I dunno.
<br />
<br /><br />Anyway many thanks for the interest, and please, you have my  
<br />
permission to translate.  I can make links to those translations if I  
<br />
don't find them not correct, but then we can discuss (thanks for  
<br />
crediting). You can be part of the second possible volume of &quot;the  
<br />
secret of the amoeba&quot;, the story of the thesis, asked by Grasset and  
<br />
the journal LE MONDE in 1998.
<br />
<br />But I expect before some understanding and acknowledgment of  
<br />
understanding or of not understanding. I like the idea to explain to  
<br />
Kim, because it means starting from zero for the math and computer  
<br />
science part, this could provides possible technical annexes for the  
<br />
book making wider the audience.
<br />
<br />Kim, to be frank I am not sure you can translate something without  
<br />
understanding it, but I am sure you can understand the main part of  
<br />
it, at least up to the point of trusting results in some books without  
<br />
going in the details. Interdisciplinary research asks for being  
<br />
professionally unprofessional, to smell the level of pertinence and  
<br />
develop a sensibility to the 1004 fallacies, which can grow at the  
<br />
frontiers of the fields.
<br />
<br />When I say, you can, I admittedly make abstraction of time, things are  
<br />
not easy,
<br />
<br />Of course when I see the argument for making illegal salvia divinorum  
<br />
I feel a bit depressed about humans and believe it is about time  
<br />
people learn elementary logic. There is a sort of pseudo &quot;human  
<br />
science&quot; which want to defend irrationalism, in the name of liberty,  
<br />
and which is very useful for arbitrary manipulation of facts and then  
<br />
lifes.
<br />
<br />We should certainly not prosecute someone for making an arithmetical,  
<br />
or a statistical, or a logical error, given that learning needs  
<br />
errors. But sometimes I think we should be able to prosecute those who  
<br />
makes the *same* error again, and again, and again, and again, ...  
<br />
(generally to rise fear about something or someone or somepeople).
<br />
<br /><br />Best regards,
<br />
<br />Bruno

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Bruno, I'd love to read your thesis in english, but I fully

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; understand

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; with. At the end, it might be easier to start from scratch, take the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno reads beautifully in French.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have offered to translate some of his stuff - the Brussels thesis is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a wonderful read in French, I can't really understand the stuff about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the construction of the computer because I have no background in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer science, but I can translate all the text into good,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idiomatic English if I could generate some little income in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process. He has said &quot;The road to hell is paved with the best of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intentions&quot; to me in the past, and I agree with him on that, also that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; publishing deals will benefit the publisher, not the author, but there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are many people (me included) who love his stuff now and wish it could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be presented to a wider audience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Failing that, a few of you might have to learn French, which would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; benefit your brain cells anyway. French is just English pronounced

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrongly anyway ;-)
