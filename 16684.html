<br />Well, I don't think I can say it much better than I did before:
<br />
<br />In my view, there are ungrounded abstract symbols that acquire
<br />
meaning via constraints placed on them by their relationships to other
<br />
symbols.  The only &quot;grounding&quot; comes from the conscious experience
<br />
that is intrinsic to a particular set of relationships.  To repeat my
<br />
earlier Chalmers quote, &quot;Experience is information from the inside;
<br />
physics is information from the outside.&quot;  It is this subjective
<br />
experience of information that provides meaning to the otherwise
<br />
completely abstract &quot;platonic&quot; symbols.
<br />
<br />Going a little further:  I would say that the relationships between
<br />
the symbols that make up a particular mental state have some sort of
<br />
consistency, some regularity, some syntax - so that when these
<br />
syntactical relationships are combined with the symbols it does make
<br />
up some sort of descriptive language.  A language that is used to
<br />
describe a state of mind.  Here we're well into the realm of semiotics
<br />
I think.
<br />
<br />To come back to our disagreement, what is it that a Turing machine
<br />
does that results in consciousness?  It would seem to me that
<br />
ultimately what a Turing machine does is manipulate symbols according
<br />
to specific rules.  But is it the process of manipulating the symbols
<br />
that produces consciousness?  OR is it the state of the symbols and
<br />
their relationships with each other AFTER the manipulation which
<br />
really accounts for consciousness?
<br />
<br />I say the latter.  You seem to be saying the former...or maybe you're
<br />
saying it's both?
<br />
<br />As I've mentioned, I think that the symbols which combine to create a
<br />
mental state can be manipulated in MANY ways.  And algorithms just
<br />
serve as descriptions of these ways.  But subjective consciousness is
<br />
in the states, not in how the states are manipulated.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; With different probabilities. That is why we are partially responsible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of our future. This motivates education and learning, and commenting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; posts ...
</em><br />
<br />In my view, life is just something that we experience.  That's it.
<br />
There's nothing more to life than subjective experience.  The feeling
<br />
of being an active participant, of making decisions, of planning, of
<br />
choosing, is only that:  a feeling.  A type of qualia.
<br />
<br />Okay, it's past my bedtime, I'll do probability tomorrow!
