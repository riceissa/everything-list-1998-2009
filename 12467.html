Friends:
<br />
Siding with Mark (almost?&lt;G&gt;)
<br />
just to a 'wider' view of mentality than implied by
<br />
physicalistic - physiologistic - even maybe
<br />
comp-related frameworks, indicating the domains we did
<br />
not even discovered, but love to disregard. Upon Marks
<br />
post 
<br />
--- Stathis Papaioannou (wroteamong more):
<br />
&lt;stathispapaioannou.domain.name.hidden&gt; 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;...
</em><br />
Our bodies, including all neural tissue, are
<br />
constantly falling apart and being rebuilt.
<br />
Experiments with radiolabeled amino acids in mice, 
<br />
for example, suggest that the half life of protein in
<br />
the brain is about 10 days. The turnover at synapses
<br />
is even faster, a matter of minutes. 
<br />
So given months or years, you really are like a car in
<br />
which every single component has been replaced, the
<br />
only remaining property of the original car being the
<br />
design....&lt;
<br />
Is it really?
<br />
Are we a mchanistic isolated structure and an
<br />
unchanging mechanism fabricates the replacements
<br />
exactly according to the 'origina' blueprint?
<br />
All that in a world that changes continually?
<br />
Don't the 'fanricating' units also change (including
<br />
the rules of fabrication? Don't the changed
<br />
replacement
<br />
&nbsp;parts influence the complexity of actions? Are we not
<br />
subject to a changing world with responding to more
<br />
than just 'inside' activity-patterns? 
<br />
<br />That may be applicable to a computer-contraption of
<br />
our present (first) embryonic primitivity and its
<br />
restriction into a hardware designed exactly and
<br />
exclusively for a type of software similarly designed
<br />
for exclusive application, - in 'that' hardware using
<br />
that ridiculously primitive binary system 'we' so
<br />
ingeniously invented to simulate in a 'very first'
<br />
elevation SOME of our mental functions (in the first
<br />
place arithmetical ones).
<br />
<br />I am sure you do not deny a plasticity (I like
<br />
elasticity better) of the mind - I would add: and
<br />
body, i.e. ourselves, (everything in the world?)
<br />
stemming for 'replacements' with adjustment to the
<br />
changing ambiance - even unlimited environment (just
<br />
consider as an example our 'plastic' recollections vs
<br />
a rigid machine-memory) as in eye-witness reports. 
<br />
<br />Do you have exactly the same mentality by rigidly
<br />
replaced identical 'neuronal etc.' substitutes as was
<br />
the little rascal who went to his first communion? 
<br />
Or even same-thinking as you did when joining this
<br />
list? 
<br />
<br />A negative to that: senescence is part of it, change
<br />
is not only 'addition', it is by 'streamlining' also
<br />
eliminating design-aspects all the way to destructing
<br />
the 'original' design. In a world-dynamism. Complexly.
<br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Brent: 'However, all that is needed for the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguments that appear on this list is to recreate a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rough, functioning copy of the body plus a detailed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reproduction of memory and a brain that functioned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approximately the same.  That much might not be too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hard.  After all, as Stathis points out, you're not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same atoms you were a week ago'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; MP: Well! I'm not going to let YOU pull the levers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or press any buttons if I have to be faxed anywhere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; soon! You make  philosophers' copy-machines sound
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like props for Frankenstein's  Monster or that movie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'The Fly'. Furthermore &quot; ... memory and a brain that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functioned approximately the same&quot; would seem to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather less than what Bruno's arguments about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copying require. But my point is that, whilst the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideas are cute, they are also nonsense any way. Most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people have problems enough living from day to day,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the only time that 'copying' of a person really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has any relevance is where surgery or prosthetic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; augmentation of some kind really should be done to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alleviate suffering or prevent premature death.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As for Stathis's assertion about seemingly minor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changes which commonly occur to people's brains as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they get older, like the odd little stroke here and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there, it is always a question of the facts in each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case. Some deficiencies turn out to be crucial in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms of quality of life: loosing the use of one or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two fingers could be annoying, embarrassing and on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occasion quite dangerous. Losing the ability to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remember the names of all the people you know, would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likewise not be nice. On the other hand, losing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ability to recognise things on the left side of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world, or losing the ability to see the people you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knew before as being THOSE people such that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; become convinced that the person you are with is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitute, now that could be very dysfunctional and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very distressing. I have seen it written that in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact most people who survive past middle age, do in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact suffer from 'micro' strokes quite often but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; usually the perceived experience is that of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; progressively weakened memory. Not Alzheimer's which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a league of its own, but just difficulty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remembering certain things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our bodies, including all neural tissue, are
