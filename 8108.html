<br /><br /><br />I tend to think that consciousness is related to an instinctive  
<br />
(automated) ability to bet or anticipate on a reality. Somehow  
<br />
consciousness is unconscious science, beginning usually with the  
<br />
discovery of the planet MAMMY and the planet DADDY. Its role is that  
<br />
it makes possible to highly complex entity to build an efficacious  
<br />
high level description of a world-view, and this makes possible for  
<br />
that complex entity to make decision with incomplete knowledge and  
<br />
many (anj infinity) default assumptions. The net result is a self- 
<br />
speeding up ability relatively to the most probable (comp-)history. I  
<br />
think this has been made indispensable for self-locomotion, if only  
<br />
to anticipate possible (but not actual) collisions with the  
<br />
anticipated neighborhood.
<br />
Now this makes consciousness quite close to the logician notion of  
<br />
consistency (more or less equivalent with the existence of logician  
<br />
&quot;models&quot; or &quot;mathematical realities&quot;. It can be shown that a machine  
<br />
can speed up itself by infering its consistency. The first to see  
<br />
this is Godel, in his &quot;lenght of proof&quot; paper you can find in the  
<br />
bible by Davis 1965:
<br />
DAVIS M. (ed.), 1965, The Undecidable, Raven Press, Hewlett, New York.
<br />
<br />If you read Hobson physiological theory of dreams, they are reasons  
<br />
to think that the trigger of that anticipating phenomenon could be  
<br />
associate with the cerebral stem, the cortex would do the  
<br />
anticipation and the claustrum would integrate it and makes coherent  
<br />
the available information. But since one or two years I am  
<br />
accumulating evidence, mainly through the &quot;placebo effect&quot; that  
<br />
similar anticipation could already be implemented at the chemical level.
<br />
<br />Here is the last paper I found, in the journal of neuroscience of  
<br />
this week:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/25/34/0-i">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/25/34/0-i</a>
<br />
<br />Endogenous Opiates and the Placebo Effect(*)
<br />
<br /><br />Now, some materialist could take the theory of consciousness, I have  
<br />
sketched above, as a theory which does not need anything non- 
<br />
physical. But I would like to insist that this is not the case. If we  
<br />
really take seriously such an explanation of consciousness, then,  
<br />
looking at the detail, it makes the notion of &quot;matter&quot; very hard. I  
<br />
will not develop this here, but it is the entire content of a  
<br />
&quot;theorem in theoretical cognitive science&quot; I got, and allude to in  
<br />
many posts (see my url or the everything mailing list:
<br />
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list%40eskimo.com/maillist.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list%40eskimo.com/maillist.html</a>
<br />
Nevertheless, note that this theory of consciousness is locally very  
<br />
coherent with Darwinism. It is obvious that an ability to genuinely  
<br />
anticipate the probable neighborhood will enhance survival,  
<br />
especially for moving animals. It is just provably incoherent with  
<br />
the idea of some temporal or dynamical substance.
<br />
Self-consciousness appears logically after consciousness, when the  
<br />
entity begin to bet on a stable distinction between itself and the  
<br />
neighborhood. This helps for better avoidance of the possible collision.

<br />(see pages 7754-7762)
<br />
<br />Much to the chagrin of drug designers and sometimes to the benefit of  
<br />
patients, placebos can have powerful effects on medical management.  
<br />
This week, Zubieta et al. add to the evidence that the placebo effect  
<br />
on the subjective assessment of pain involves the endogenous opioid  
<br />
system. During a pain challenge, volunteer subjects were given an  
<br />
intravenous injection that they were led to believe might have  
<br />
analgesic properties. The painful stimulus, the infusion of a few  
<br />
milliliters of hypertonic saline into a jaw muscle, was adjusted to  
<br />
maintain constant pain intensity and to prevent tissue swelling. The  
<br />
authors used positron emission tomography in combination with a µ- 
<br />
opioid receptor-selective radiotracer to examine the brain regions  
<br />
activated and the contribution of µ-opioid receptors. The placebo  
<br />
induced activation in the rostral anterior cingulate, dorsolateral  
<br />
frontal cortex, insular cortex, and nucleus accumbens in parallel  
<br />
with lower ratings of pain intensity.
