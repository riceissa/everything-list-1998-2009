Hi Max,
<br />
<br />I will first comment what you say about Gödel's theorem.
<br />
You say (pp 19, 20) that Gödel's second incompleteness theorem implies 
<br />
that we can never be 100% sure that &quot;this&quot; (Peano Arithmetic, real 
<br />
numbers, ...) is consistent, and that this would leave open the 
<br />
possibility that a finite length proof of &quot;0 = 1&quot;.
<br />
This is a very common misconception of Godel's incompleteness, 
<br />
sometimes advocated by &quot;relativists&quot;.
<br />
By &quot;common&quot; I mean that most good popularizations of Godel's results 
<br />
address correctly this misconception. I am mainly thinking about 
<br />
Smullyan's many books on this subject, or the more recent, quite 
<br />
excellent, book by Torkel Franzèn &quot;Gödel's Theorem An incomplete Guide 
<br />
to its Use and Abuse&quot;. I certainly recommand  it to anyone interested 
<br />
in this list subject. Franzèn is a little weak on the *Use* of Gödel's 
<br />
theorem, but quite excellent on the so widespread *Misuses* and 
<br />
*Abuses*.
<br />
<br />It is hard for me to believe you are serious on Gödel. Even if we grant 
<br />
some possibility of doubting the consistency of Peano Arithmetic PA 
<br />
(say) I don't see how you derive from Gödel's second theorem the 
<br />
possibility of a finite proof of 0=1. Gödel's theorem is itself 
<br />
provable in PA, so your doubt would have a circular origin. Would PA 
<br />
proves its consistency, this could be doubtful too:  after all, all 
<br />
inconsistent theories do proof their own consistency. Then it is easy 
<br />
to provide everyday informal quite convincing proof of the consistency 
<br />
of PA  by using the fact that the axioms of PA are satisfied by the 
<br />
model (N, +, *), and the inference rule of PA are truth preserving). 
<br />
Formally, the consistency of PA can be proved in weak fragment of ZF 
<br />
(Zermelo Fraenkel set theory) by transfinite induction up to the little 
<br />
constructive ordinal epsilon zero (Gentzen theorem).
<br />
<br />Now, what is curious and amazing, is the following consequence of the 
<br />
second incompleteness theorem: given that PA is consistent, but cannot 
<br />
prove its consistency, it follows that the theory PA + [PA is 
<br />
inconsistent], that is PA with the addition of the axiom Bf (beweisbar 
<br />
false = false is provable)  has to be consistent too! (why? because if 
<br />
you can derive a contradiction in PA from Bf, you would prove in PA 
<br />
that Bf -&gt; f, that is ~Bf = PA's consistency, contradicting the second 
<br />
incompleteness theorem. NOW, by Godel's COMPLETENESS (not 
<br />
INcompleteness) theorem, all first order theory is consistent if and 
<br />
only if the theory has a model (in the logician sense, that is a model 
<br />
is a mathematical structure satisfying the axioms.  I think your 
<br />
misconception could come from this fact. Indeed the completeness 
<br />
theorem entails that the theory PA+Bf , being con,sistent by Godel II, 
<br />
has a model! So there is a mathematical structure which satisfies the 
<br />
axiom of PA + there is a proof of a falsity. But PA can prove (like 
<br />
weaker theories) that 0 is not (a godel number coding) a proof of f, 
<br />
and that 1 is not a proof of f, and that 2 is not a proof of f, etc. 
<br />
That is, for each natural number n, PA can prove that n is not the 
<br />
godel number of a falsity f. Thus, in the model of PA+Bf, the object  
<br />
corresponding to a proof of a falsity has to be different from any 
<br />
natural number. logician describes such object has an infinite non 
<br />
standard numbers, and it can't correspond to anything looking like a 
<br />
finite proof of f, or 0=1.
<br />
<br />By the way, this list mixes people with diploma and without, you could 
<br />
have asked or participate, but then this is what you are doing now, 
<br />
isn't it? I have a phd in logic and computer science, although my 
<br />
motivation has always been biology and/or theology, I mean fundamental 
<br />
questioning. People without diploma are often better on new or very old 
<br />
questions because they are less prejudiced by granting less theories. 
<br />
It is also why I like to interview directly universal machines.
<br />
<br />What is much more annoying in your paper, and shows that you have never 
<br />
really  consulted this mailing list, is that you are still burying 
<br />
under the rug the mind body problem, or the first person/third person 
<br />
relation problem. Your use of the frog/bird distinction illustrates 
<br />
that you are using implicitly, despite your mathematicalism which I 
<br />
appreciate, some &quot;mind-matter&quot;-like identity theory capable of giving 
<br />
sense to the notion of a physical structure and of an observer 
<br />
belonging to it. This *can* make sense, but, especially with the 
<br />
computationalist hypothesis (= I am turing emulable), such a thing has 
<br />
to be justified. This follows from the Universal Dovetailer Argument + 
<br />
the Movie-graph Argument.  I have already show that the 
<br />
computationalist hypothesis (roughly: there is a level of description 
<br />
where I am Turing emulable) entails the falsity of the computational 
<br />
universe thesis. Physicalness, with comp, is a global internal feature 
<br />
of arithmetical reality emerging from &quot;machine's dream gluing&quot;, to be 
<br />
short.
<br />
<br />Another problem, is that, although I agree with mathematicalism, I have 
<br />
no clue of what could be &quot;All Mathematics&quot;. But with the Church Thesis, 
<br />
or Church-Turing thesis, it can be argued that arithmetical reality is 
<br />
enough (even for set-theoretical talking machine). Analysis and 
<br />
everyday informal mathematics can be justified from inside too. See my 
<br />
other posts or my work (hmm...I should update my webpage with my last 
<br />
papers). About some of your point on mathematics, I think category 
<br />
theory could help you, but note that it will not help for defining the 
<br />
whole of math.
<br />
<br />I finish by saying that I am ok with your ERH (there exists an external 
<br />
physical reality completely independent of us human).
<br />
But I do not believe there could exist a corresponding external 
<br />
physical reality completely independent of us lobian entity, once we 
<br />
assume the comp hyp, or even very weak version of the comp hyp). CF the 
<br />
UDA reasoning.
<br />
About the MUH (Our external physical reality is a mathematical 
<br />
structure), I find this very vague and ambiguous and have to think more 
<br />
about how you derive it. With comp the physical has to emerge from a 
<br />
notion of first person plural sharable experiences. Of course I am not 
<br />
saying that comp is true, but I have made that first person sharable 
<br />
experience enough precise so that it can be empirically tested, and I 
<br />
can already show that many feature of quantum mechanics are 
<br />
consequences of it. I hope to derive the local exploitability of 
<br />
universal quantum machine in the neighborhood of (almost all) classical 
<br />
universal, in the years to come, or to refute it, and thus refute the 
<br />
comp hyp.
<br />
I show also that Godel's results (and Löb Solovay generalizations, ref 
<br />
in my Lille thesis) provide a transparent arithmetical interpretation 
<br />
of Plotinus theology, including his platonist theory of matter. The 
<br />
UDA, then, can relate Plotinus with the comp hyp, and does illustrate 
<br />
new relationships between Pythagorean and Platonist &quot;theologies&quot; (in 
<br />
the greek sense, not necessarily in the Christian sense). See some 
<br />
&quot;theological&quot; threads in the archive.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Folks,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After a decade of procrastination, I've finally finished writing up a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequel to that paper that I wrote back in 1996 (Is &quot;the theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything'' merely the ultimate ensemble theory?) that's been the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subject of so much interesting discussion in this group.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's entitled &quot;The Mathematical Universe&quot;, and you'll find it at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0646">http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0646</a> and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/toe.html">http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/toe.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - I'd very much appreciate any comments that you may have.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The purpose of this paper is both to clarify what I mean by the Level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IV Multiverse and to further explore various implications, so it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lots of discussion of stuff like the simulation argument, the relation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to Schmidhuber's ideas, Gödel incompleteness and Church-Turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incomputability. Please let me apologize in advance for the fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sections III, IV and the appendix of this paper are quite technical,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so if you're among the 99.99% who don't have a Ph.D. in theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics, perhaps skip those sections. I've added links to more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accessible papers touching on some of these issues at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/toe.html">http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/toe.html</a>, and I'll try to write
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something less obtuse soon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Finally, if you discover a good time stretching device, please let me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know! Although I'm embarrassed that I haven't found the time to follow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and participate in the fascinating discussions in this group, the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there's such interest has inspired and motivated me to continue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pursuing these ideas despite the discouragement from mainstream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; academia. So thanks for the encouragement!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
