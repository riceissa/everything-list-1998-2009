&quot;Pulling up the door you're standing on is known in the computer
<br />
industry as &quot;bootstrapping&quot;, which comes from the expression &quot;to pull
<br />
yourself up by your bootstraps&quot;.
<br />
<br />Of course, over time, this has been shortened to &quot;boot&quot;, as in
<br />
&quot;booting your computer&quot;.
<br />
<br />Initially, to boot a computer, one had to enter a small loader program
<br />
inot the computer by flicking switches. Run the program, and this
<br />
would a larger program from a disk or tape, which in turn would read
<br />
in an operating system (or whatever and start it running).  These
<br />
days, this initial program is burned into a nonvolatile silicon chip,
<br />
which loads and runs the first sector of the hard disk, and so on, so
<br />
the tedious stage of entering the first program by hand is
<br />
avoided.
<br />
<br />Can a conscious mind be understood completely by a conscious mind?
<br />
This can be cast in terms of Cantor's diagonalisation
<br />
argument. Goedel's 2nd theorem effectively says that arithmetic &quot;cannot
<br />
understand itself&quot;. However, the set of recursive functions is closed
<br />
to diagonalisation, namely recursive functions exist that can emulate
<br />
any other.
<br />
<br />Coming back to the original question - Bruno Marchal would probably answer
<br />
yes, with repsect to the assumption of COMP. Robert Rosen (to pick a
<br />
somewhat extreme opposing example) would probably argue no - that
<br />
consciousness lies in a class of systems outside the computable set.

<br />
If my memory serves well, I heard that explanation of &quot;bootstrapping&quot; some
<br />
decades ago, (cosmological Q-theories) I suppose, before it was applied to
<br />
computers. Thanks, Russell, for the computer class,  however I would not
<br />
equate 'booting' with 'bootstrapping', especially based on your info about
<br />
the 'special' initiating programs you have to provide to 'strapp'. It may
<br />
well be that the usage of the word originated from such poor understanding
<br />
of the metaphor.
<br />
<br />I wanted to stress the ignorance of that &quot;bootstrapper&quot; (to use your
<br />
preferred word) about the way she was acting. She did not want to lift
<br />
herself up. She thought she is lifting a trapdoor (to go down the stairs).
<br />
Exactly the goal we are pursuing  in trying to understand the 'world' we
<br />
belong to as part of it - together with its 'sense' of which we use a small
<br />
part to think with. Maybe Cantor and Goedel were smarter, yet I doubt if
<br />
they could encompass the totality in its interactions up and down to draw
<br />
wholistic conclusions upon the world they also were a small part of only.
<br />
They might have known more than us. That's all.
<br />
<br />If one considers an infinite set for comp, (imaginary that is) unlimited and
<br />
encompassing all (knowable and coming) ramifications into its computations,
<br />
that is a different ballgame. I try to stay within our applicable limits and
<br />
accept the limitations of our mental capabilities. Not only mine, those of
<br />
other humans as well. I have no computer working with unlimited sets of
<br />
data, unlimited ways of comp, unlimited options to consider and the
<br />
unlimited choice to apply for results, I envy all who have that.
<br />
<br />Without trying to defend Robert Rosen, his (unlimited) natural systems
<br />
(maximum models = the THING itself, not a model) are (in his words) &quot;not
<br />
Turing -computable&quot;, I think that is different from Bruno's unlimited
<br />
'comp'.
<br />
<br />Excuse me for falling through a trap-door into a reply about things I am no
<br />
expert in. I may have the wrong bootstraps.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />John
