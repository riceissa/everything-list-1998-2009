<br />
hi all. re: the exponential vs polynomial time thread.
<br />
imho HFs comments could be interpreted as roughly correct
<br />
but stated in a very confusing way &amp; I would say, hence
<br />
the ensuing confusion. lets give this another shot.
<br />
<br />there are no problems for which it has been proven that
<br />
there is a **lower bound** of exponential time except
<br />
for those that also require exponential space (for which
<br />
the exponential time lower bound is trivial). (space is
<br />
the number of tape squares used by a TM, time is the number
<br />
of steps). this of course is quite frustrating &amp; even embarrassing
<br />
to researchers and a gaping open problem in the theory.
<br />
<br />the big P!=NP problem depends on showing that there is some
<br />
P-space problem that has a lower bound of exponential time, i.e.
<br />
it cannot be solved &quot;any faster&quot; than exponential time.
<br />
<br />literally, there are many problems for which it has been shown or even
<br />
&quot;proven&quot; that they can be verified in P time and can 
<br />
be solved in exponential time.
<br />
<br />in fact every NP complete problem has this property. what has
<br />
not been proven or is not known is that exponential time is
<br />
also a **lower bound**.
<br />
<br />so it can be very confusing if someone says: there are no
<br />
problems that are known to be checkable/verifiable in P time but take
<br />
exponential time. the term &quot;take&quot; must be used very carefully, imho
<br />
it should be avoided as just too ambiguous.
<br />
sometimes people mean as a lower bound (as HF did below), or 
<br />
sometimes it just means &quot;a solution exists at that speed&quot; (as I write
<br />
above).
<br />
<br />forget NP complete for a minute &amp; 
<br />
suppose I have a problem that is solvable in P time. does it
<br />
&quot;take&quot; exponential time? in one sense, yes, there exists also
<br />
algorithms that run in exponential time to solve it. but in another
<br />
sense, no, that is not the lower bound, the lower bound is polynomial.
<br />
<br />also note that defining NP in terms of &quot;verification in P time&quot;
<br />
is done in terms of a regular deterministic TM machine, not 
<br />
an nondeterministic one. the sense that NP 
<br />
can be defined in terms of nondeterministic
<br />
TMs is: it is the set of problems that can be solved by nondeterministic
<br />
TMs in P time.
<br />
<br />that straightens it all out, right???
<br />
<br />there are many different ways to look at the P vs NP problem,
<br />
in this way it is like g&quot;odel's problem, and this can lead
<br />
to knowledge in the sense that &quot;a little knowledge is a
<br />
dangerous thing&quot;..
