</em><br />
<br />OK, so I perhaps did not understand you fully. I thought they did
<br />
not even accept AR, or &quot;2+2=4&quot; for the sake of the argument.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;If they finally have to abandon these positions due to the amount
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;of evidence in favor of it, the last line of defence for their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;conception of a personal God and for a significant role for Him
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;could be at the level of artihmetical realism. Artihmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;realism by itself (not from a distinct personal God) is therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;seen as evil by them. As I mentionned, they usually do not put it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;that way. Rather they argue that such a view would prevent the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;foundation of human dignity and the like.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; They make probably the same confusion of those who believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that determinism is in contradiction with free will.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would say that one of the concern they have behind this is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question of free will versus determinism (and/or randomness). You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and others might see this as making &quot;the same confusion of those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;who believe that determinism is in contradiction with free will&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But there might also be more than one conception of free will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and we could also consider that what they are doing is trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;defend another conception of free will that the one which is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in contradiction with determinism (and/or randomness).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Look, I have no problem at all with any people open to defend
<br />
they point, I am always prepared to make evolve my own position.
<br />
But I really don't appreciate those who wants to impose any
<br />
position (even mine). By its very nature free-will is hard to define
<br />
and I quite believe there is as many conception of free-will
<br />
than there are free-person.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Though we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;may or may not share this conception, I don't think that we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dismiss it. The only thing we can say is that they cannot convince
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;us of it or possibly even of its meaningfulness but in the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way we have no ground to prove them they are wrong.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No problem as long as they don't use authoritative argument.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Basically, they want to believe that we humans are not reducible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to numbers and I think that such a reductibility cannot be proved
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;either way.
</em><br />
<br />Er... No scientific proposition can *ever* be proved. Only refuted, or
<br />
confirm. Except perhaps a tiny part of intuistionist mathematics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also I understand that one could feel offended by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;idea that he could be reduced to mere numbers (not more but not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;less he would feel offended by the idea it could be reduced to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;set of interacting molecules) even if these ideas are considered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as just hypotheses. They want to believe (and they want to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;generally believed) that there is (much) more than this in human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;beings (and incidently in themselves).
</em><br />
<br />It is ok, in principle. It all depend on the way they will make us
<br />
to believe their proposition. I am used to met people who are
<br />
shocked by the idea of being a machine. I think those people
<br />
ahave just a lack of trust in themselves. If I like myself and if I learn that
<br />
I am a machine, then I will say &quot;formidable, some machine can be nice
<br />
like me&quot;. If I dislike myself, and I learn that I am a machine, then I
<br />
will say &quot;I knew I was just a stupid machine&quot;. Just to say that
<br />
if someone has the faith (or some deep faith) he/she will not be afraid
<br />
by *and* hypothesis. Those who are afraid by hypotheses are really
<br />
afraid of the fragility of their own ideas or of their own faith.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Actually I tend to think that Godel's and other incompleteness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; result makes comp a sort of vaccine against reductionist view of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; self and reality (and arithmetic).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is not obvious to me. Maybe what &quot;reductionist&quot; actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;means needs to be clarified.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sure. It is a very big thread by itself.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You know &quot;reason&quot; works only through doubt, and through the ability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to listen to different opinions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I tend to agree but it does not seem enough just to say it.
</em><br />
<br />I guess it is not enough. As I said it is linked to &quot;trusting oneself&quot;.
<br />
This trust is given, I think, by appropriate love and education
<br />
from generation through generation. That is, a  very long work.
<br />
may be some shortcut exists, but there is probably no universal simple
<br />
recipe.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now with Godel we can say more,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which is that &quot;good faith&quot; never fears &quot;reason&quot; and rationality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Sincere Faith can only extend Ratio, and is always open to dialog.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It seems that there exists other conceptions of what &quot;good faith&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and/or &quot;Sincere Faith&quot; should be. Idem for &quot;Ratio&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Which one?
<br />
<br />Bruno
