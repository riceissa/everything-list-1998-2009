<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where the device is build in such a way   -by filming the computer-  that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all &quot;computationnal activity&quot; will be purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accidentally correct
</em><br />
<br />And Jacques Mallah replies
<br />
&lt;&lt; As you noted in your next mail, this has been discussed on the
<br />
list many times already.  Such a device would not implement the
<br />
computations and would not be conscious according to computationalism.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's it?  So much for your alleged proof.  There's nothing in
<br />
it.  It just presents an example of a physical situation in which a
<br />
computation is not implemented, and claims that consciousness would not be
<br />
present in that situation.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />I think the requirement for computationalism for the existence of 
<br />
consciousness is a red herring. The real requirement is rationality of 
<br />
consciousness as well as anthropic and rational constraints in the flow of 
<br />
consecutive events. Computationalism and physical laws are derived from these 
<br />
anthropic and rational constraints. (Maybe this is just a question of 
<br />
terminology, some of you may equate computationalism with rationality)
<br />
<br />One more issue about consciousness. It only exists in the eyes of the 
<br />
beholder. And the beholder is the self. The self is both the object and the 
<br />
subject. 
<br />
<br />In addition, you guys get confused with TIME. The characters in a movie or 
<br />
documentary are obviously not conscious when the movie is shown because they 
<br />
are incapable of rational thought or behavior in the real world at that time. 
<br />
However, they are definitely conscious when the movie is recorded because 
<br />
they are rationally aware of their world. 
<br />
<br />Similarly recording the activities of neurons and then playing them back 
<br />
results in no consciousness at playback time but consciousness certainly 
<br />
exists at recording time. 
<br />
<br />Now lets make it more interesting and say that the playback machine is 
<br />
implemented simply by rewinding the universe to some past state and allowing 
<br />
the same events to happen again. Assume that the issue of indeterminism is 
<br />
resolved and by some incredible chance the events do play back again as they 
<br />
have done the first time. (This scenario can more easily be set up in a 
<br />
virtual reality environment with virtual reality conscious entities) Does the 
<br />
second consciousness exist just as the first? Are they different or are they 
<br />
the same? Assuming that these consciousness are totally unaware of the guy 
<br />
behind the curtain doing his rewinding trick, then in my opinion the two 
<br />
consciousness are actually one and the same because they view the world in 
<br />
exactly the same way with the same rationality. 
<br />
<br /><br />Hal:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(My solution is, as I said earlier, that the question isn't meaningful,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because it is at best another iteration of an already-produced 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;calculation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and it doesn't matter if a conscious calculation is instantiated multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;times.)
</em><br />
<br />Jacques: 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I obviously reject that.
</em><br />
<br />And this is the point where the idea of measure comes in. Is there any loss 
<br />
in measure if a playback absolutely identical with the original play is 
<br />
eliminated? Is there any gain in measure if the original play is repeated 
<br />
once, twice or a million times? In my opinion there is no loss and no gain. 
<br />
Consciousness is playback independent and is also time independent. You could 
<br />
implement it on a time share computer and it would not know the difference 
<br />
even if the active time intervals last one microsecond every billion years. 
<br />
As long as the rational link between the time segments is maintained. 
<br />
<br />This however is only my opinion. How to prove this and make scientific 
<br />
predictions as Jacques demands can only be done if one is brave enough and 
<br />
willing to go through Tegmark's experiment. Eventually we will all have a 
<br />
chance to do so and maybe Jacques will then be convinced :-). However if he 
<br />
is right we won't be around to change our mind :-(

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do agree with the relation between measure and effective probability.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good, maybe there is still some hope for you.  (Yeah right.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; [BM] The problem is that Jacques M Mallah is computationnalist. I am afraid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that this entails he has no other choice than to choose the relative SSA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Only by choosing a strong physicalist ontological principle AND by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; choosing a strong (and rather mysterious) link between consciousness and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; physical activity, will it be possible for him to get a &quot;limited MW&quot; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; which branching is absolute. Such a link between consciousness and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; physical activity has been showed incompatible with mechanism (by myself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; in 1988, and independently by Tim Maudlin in 1989, precise reference in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal</a>.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;	[JM] Yeah right.  I wanted to see this crackpot proof only because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;(unlike QS) it does directly touch on my interests, but unfortunately it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;was unreadable.  So what's the idea of the &quot;proof&quot;?  In English.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) I like very much your sense of humor, Jacques. Do you really believe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will be clearer in English ? ... and without drawings, and without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hands waving ?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oui, je connais seulement un tres petite nombre des mots Francais.
<br />
Vraiment, je peut ecrire une mal paragraphe, mais je ne peut pas
<br />
comprehende les mots des autres.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Is it necessary ? This very discussion list, as we can realize by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looking at the beginning in the archive, is founded on the idea 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (see also Tegmark and Schmidhuber, and (of course) Everett !) that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allowing more [every] things to exist makes possible the isolation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more [the most] simpler [simplest] explanation possible. This, I think,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means that almost every one in the list accept some kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceptually strong form of Occam Razor (as explicitely,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exemplified by James Higgo). With such an idea, there is no need for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eliminating HE. Any arithmetical (abstract) DU is enough.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're saying we all accept the everything hypothesis, that is
<br />
irrelevant.  I think there's a good chance it's true, but it must be 
<br />
proven that it gives the right predictions.  I assume for now that the
<br />
debate about QS is in the context of QM, straight Shrondinger equation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, you also said that the proof would show why a &quot;relative
<br />
SSA&quot;, which I think is nonsense in any context, is needed.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem here is that the &quot;physics&quot; cannot distinguish a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterfactually correct firing of a neuron (for exemple) and an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accidentally correct firing of a neuron.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure it can.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For exemple, think that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the neuron is broken and that, by pure chance, a cosmic ray supplies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it in real time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Then, if consciousness supervenes on the physical activity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a digital computer (emulating a brain), it will be not difficult 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to show that consciousness will supervene
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on a physically equivalent device, at some level below our substitution 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where the device is build in such a way   -by filming the computer-  that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all &quot;computationnal activity&quot; will be purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accidentally correct (like in a cartoon where the dropping of a stone in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a window is NOT the cause of the breakdown of the window).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That mean that consciousness could supervene on something equivalent to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; filmed brain, in which there is no form of &quot;physical&quot; computation at all. 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you noted in your next mail, this has been discussed on the
<br />
list many times already.  Such a device would not implement the
<br />
computations and would not be conscious according to computationalism.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's it?  So much for your alleged proof.  There's nothing in
<br />
it.  It just presents an example of a physical situation in which a
<br />
computation is not implemented, and claims that consciousness would not be
<br />
present in that situation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is basically the idea of the reductio ad absurdum.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course Wei Dai does not find it absurd; his position is that it
<br />
would be conscious.  I'd call him a 'structuralist'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;&lt;&lt; Hal:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is not enough, in this view, to reproduce an instance of information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;processing in a non-causal way.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(My solution is, as I said earlier, that the question isn't meaningful,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because it is at best another iteration of an already-produced 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;calculation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and it doesn't matter if a conscious calculation is instantiated multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;times.)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I obviously reject that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we accept that consciousness is a real phenomenon deserving of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explanation, this view would require that causality is also a real,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fundamental, physical phenomenon.  
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, the laws of physics must exist in addition to things such
<br />
as functions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But if the only way causality can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;defined is as a relationship that spans multiple universes, it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;follow that consciousness also must fundamentally involve multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes.                                              &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope.  Causality is easy to incorporate into a one universe model.
<br />
Any initial value problem obviously has causality.
<br />
<br />(Bruno:)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I will make a detailed comment about that ASAP. I agree with Hal but not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on the point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;it doesn't matter if a conscious calculation is instantiated multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;times&quot;, where it seems I am closer to Jacques M Mallah.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good, that will help you understand QS.
