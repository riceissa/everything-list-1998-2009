<br /><br />I basically agree with this. But don't confuse Axiomatic System and Formal

system.
<br />
(I answer it offline (by error ! Sorry Hal). I repeat my answer because
<br />
it still works for the last message by Hal Ruhl.)

</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />The same confusion everywhere! You are right when you say that Turing 
<br />
shows
<br />
the equivalence of provability (in some rich system) with
<br />
computability, but this is only true from a computability point of view.
<br />
Godel and Turing result are better described as showing the abyssal
<br />
difference between provability (relative to a formal system) and 
<br />
computabilility (which is a machine independent concept). I guess you know
<br />
that because your own approach is based on that difference, actually.
<br />
You should read the original paper by Godel and Turing
<br />
(instead of Casti who is not quite rigorous). 
<br />
Buy Davis 1965. Read it, sleep with it!
<br />
Also, if you use the incompleteness for the (perhaps quantum) 
<br />
indeterminacy,
<br />
then you should describe that indeterminacy as bifurcation in the
<br />
model 'trajectories', and then distinguish the possible type of discourses
<br />
of creature appearing in your model, ...
<br />
You seem also to presuppose an undefined part of classical mechanics, and
<br />
geometry.
<br />
Well your text is long and rather fuzzy. If you are on the right track,
<br />
which is not impossible for what I can judge, you should try to be 
<br />
more pedagogical and learn
<br />
the minimal amount of proof theory/model theory to make your
<br />
use of incompleteness presentable for a (mathematical) logician ...
<br />
Do you know the book by Svozil ? He present some reasonable use of 
<br />
Godel's incompleteness in physics (orthogonal to mine).
<br />
I think also that Girard linear logic could be genuine for your type
<br />
of interesting but very delicate mix of proof and dynamics.
<br />
<br />Then Hal Ruhl wrote:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have been asked to compress my model so as to maximize its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;accessibility.  The following is an attempt to do so.  The result is rather 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cryptic and has little effort to &quot;prove&quot; anything.  It is frequently just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an application of Occam's Razor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             BEGINNINGS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Start with:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) Nothing - an empty finite consistent Formal Axiomatic System - an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fc-FAS.
</em><br />
<br />What do you mean ? A theory is intended for its models. If you take the
<br />
null theory you get ... every-models. That is our everything hypothesis.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) Nothing is incomplete because it can not address the meaningful question 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of its own stability - it is an ifc-FAS.
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;3) To address the incompleteness Nothing becomes Something.
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;4) To address the question of the stability of Nothing, Something must have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a bifurcation to implement the concept of &quot;Yes&quot; vs &quot;No&quot;, or &quot;True&quot; vs 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;False&quot;, or &quot;Is&quot; vs &quot;Is Not&quot;, or affirmation vs negation. [As in &quot;Nothing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is unstable.&quot; is a well formed statement Yes or No.]
</em><br />
<br /><br />Honestly your shorter version seems completely not understandable, at 
<br />
least to me. I'm afraid you don't realise the difficulty of the question
<br />
you are adressing. Try to imagine you must explain your theory
<br />
to a 14 years old student. Define your terms and make explicit your
<br />
primitive terms.
<br />
The incompleteness phenomena are notoriously misused. It is a reason
<br />
to be completely clear on it. Perhaps you should compare your approach
<br />
with those presented in the discussion list (Tegmark, Schmidhuber, 
<br />
Russell,
<br />
George Levy, myself, etc.). That would help us.
<br />
I insist you should read the original paper on the incompleteness and 
<br />
insolubility result (Davis 1965, ref in my thesis, URL below)
