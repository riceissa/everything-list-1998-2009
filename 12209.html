<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It seems to me that consciousness can exist without narrative, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; without long term memory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The question if the amoeba forms memories could depends on the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scale. After all amoebas are pluri-molecular mechanism exchanging
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; information (through viruses?) in some way. I would not bet on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; unconsciousness of amoebas on large time scale.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then you have adopted some new meaning of &quot;consciousness&quot;.  If you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stretch &quot;consciousness&quot; to fit every exchange or storage of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information then everything in the universe is conscious and we will  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need to invent a new word to distinguish conscious people from  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unconscious ones.


</em><br />
I was using the word consciousness in the usual informal sense. I was  
<br />
not saying that any information exchange/storage is conscious. I was  
<br />
saying that I would not bet that some highly complex exchange/storage  
<br />
of information, in some context where self-referential correctness is  
<br />
at play (like evolution and self-adaptation) is not conscious. I was  
<br />
saying I am open to the idea that some process around us could have a  
<br />
consciousness about whioch we have no idea because it operates on a  
<br />
different scale than our own. I was not saying that amoebas are  
<br />
conscious, but that it would be quick to say for sure that many  
<br />
communicating amoebas during millenia are not. I was just doubting  
<br />
aloud.

<br />
More formally, I think that consciousness is just the interrogative  
<br />
belief in a reality. But it is an *instinctive* belief. The  
<br />
interrogative aspect, the interrogation mark has a tendency to be  
<br />
burried. We are blasé, especially after childhood.

<br />
Much more formally. By Godel COMPLeteness theorem, a (first order)  
<br />
theory is consistent iff the theory has a model, that is iff there is a  
<br />
mathematical structure capable of satisfying the theorems of the  
<br />
theory. Like (N, +, *, 0; succ) satisfies Peano Axioms and theorems.
<br />
So, extensionally, to say &quot;I am consistent&quot; is equivalent (from  
<br />
outside) with &quot;there is a reality (respecting my beliefs/theorems). By  
<br />
Godel INCOMPLeteness, if such a reality exists (for me) then I cannot  
<br />
prove it exists (that would be a proof of my consistency), so I can  
<br />
only hope in such a reality. But that hope is so important for life (by  
<br />
accelerating relatively my decisions making ability) that &quot;nature&quot; has  
<br />
buried the interrogation mark of that hope, so that old animal like us  
<br />
take reality for granted until Plato recall us it cannot be (and create  
<br />
science by the same token). So consciousness is &quot;Dt?&quot;. In arithmetic it  
<br />
is the interrogative *inference* of &quot;Consistent(godel-number of &quot;0 =  
<br />
0&quot;&quot;).
<br />
Once the machine infer Dt, she can either keep it as an inference about  
<br />
itself, or she can take it as a new belief, but then it is a new (and  
<br />
provably more efficient machine(*) for which a new &quot;B&quot; and &quot;D&quot;, still  
<br />
obeying G and G*, can be (re)applied.

<br />
(*) See Godel's paper on &quot;the length of proofs&quot; in Martin Davis &quot;The  
<br />
Undecidable&quot;, or Yuri Manin's  book on Mathematical Logic which gives a  
<br />
clear proof of Godel's result on the length of proofs (shortened when  
<br />
adding undecidable sentences). See the book by Torkel Franzen, which is  
<br />
quite a good introduction to Godel incompleteness theorem (perhaps more  
<br />
readable than many other book at that level).
