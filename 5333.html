Thank you Jesse for your clear answer. Your comparison
<br />
of your use of both ASSA and RSSA with Google ranking system
<br />
has been quite useful.
<br />
This does not mean I am totally convince because ASSA raises the
<br />
problem of the basic frame: I don't think there is any sense to compare
<br />
the probability of &quot;being a human&quot; or &quot;being a bacteria&quot; ..., but your
<br />
&quot;RSSA use of ASSA&quot; does not *necessarily* give a meaning to such
<br />
strong form of absolute Self Sampling Assumption, or does it?
<br />
I think also that your view on RSSA is not only compatible with
<br />
the sort of approach I have developed, but is coherent with
<br />
&quot;Saibal Mitra&quot; backtracking, which, at first I have taken
<br />
as wishful thinking. OK you make me feel COMP could be a little less
<br />
frightening I'm use to think.
<br />
Concerning consciousness theory and its use to isolate a similarity
<br />
relation on the computational histories---as seen from some first person
<br />
point of view, I will try to answer asap in a common answer to
<br />
Stephen and Stathis (and you) who asked very related questions.
<br />
Alas I have not really the time now---I would also like to find a way to 
<br />
explain
<br />
the consciousness theory without relying too much on mathematical logic,
<br />
but the similarity between 1-histories *has* been derived  technically in 
<br />
the part
<br />
of the theory which is the most counter-intuitive ... mmh  I will try soon ...
<br />
<br />Bruno

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Jesse's TOE pet is very similar to the type of TOE compatible with the comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;hyp, I guess everyone can see that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Jesse,  imo, that post deserves to be developed. The way you manage to save
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;partially the ASSA (Absolute Self-Sampling Assumption) is not very clear 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, the idea I discussed was somewhat vague, I think to develop it I'd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;need to have better ideas about what a theory of consciousness should look 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;like, and I don't know where to begin with that. But as for how the ASSA 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is incorporated, I'll try to summarize again and maybe make it a little 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;clearer. Basically my idea was that there would be two types of measures 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on observer-moments: a relative measure, which gives you answers to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;questions like &quot;if I am currently experiencing observer-moment A, what is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the probability that my next experience will be of observer-moment B?&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and an absolute measure, which is sort of like the probability that my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;current observer-moment will be A in the first place. This idea of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;absolute measure might seem meaningless since whatever observer-moment I'm 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiencing right now, from my point of view the probability is 1 that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm experiencing that one and not some other, but probably the best way to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think of it is in terms of the self-sampling assumption, where reasoning 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*as if* I'm randomly sampled from some group (for example, 'all humans 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ever born' in the doomsday argument) can lead to useful conclusions, even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if I don't actually believe that God used a random-number generator to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;decide which body my preexisting soul would be placed in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, once you have the idea of both a relative measure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;('probability-of-becoming') and an absolute measure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;('probability-of-being') on observer-moments, my idea is that the two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measures could be interrelated, like this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. My probability-of-becoming some possible future observer-moment is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;based both on something like the 'similarity' between that observer-moment 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and my current one (so my next experience is unlikely to be that of George 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;W. Bush sitting in the White House, for example, because his memories and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;personality are so different from my current ones) but also on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;absolute probability of that observer-moment (so that I am unlikely to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;find myself having the experience of talking to an intelligent white 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rabbit, because even if that future observer-moment is fairly similar to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my current one in terms of personality, memories, etc., white-rabbit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moments are objectively improbable). I don't know how to quantify 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;similarity&quot; though, or exactly how both similarity and absolute 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probabilities would be used to calculate the relative measure between two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moments...this is where some sort of &quot;theory of consciousness&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be needed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2. Meanwhile, the absolute measure is itself dependent on the relative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure, in the sense that an observer-moment A will have higher absolute 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure if a lot of other observer-moments that themselves have high 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;absolute measure see A as a likely &quot;next experience&quot; or a likely &quot;past 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience&quot; (ie there's a high relative measure between them). This idea 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is based partly on that thought experiment where two copies of a person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are made, then one copy is itself later copied many more times, the idea 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being that the copy that is destined to be copied more in the future has a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;higher absolute measure because there are more future observer-moments 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;reinforcing&quot; it (see <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m4841.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m4841.html</a> for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more on this thought-experiment). I think of this whole idea in analogy to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the way Google's ranking system works: pages are ranked as more popular if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they are linked to by a lot of other pages that are themselves highly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ranked. So, the popularity of a particular page is sort of like the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;absolute probability of being a particular observer-moment, while a link 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from one page to another is like a high relative probability from one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moment to another (to make the analogy better you'd have to use 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;weighted links, and you'd have to assume the weight of the link between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;page A and page B itself depends partly on B's popularity).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The final part of my pet theory is that by having the two measures 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interrelated in this way, you'd end up with a unique self-consistent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;solution to what each measure would look like, like what happens when you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have a bunch of simultaneous equations specifying how different variables 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relate to one another, and they determine a unique solution. This would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;provide a rationale for having a non-arbitrary choice of absolute and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relative measure (see my comments about the 'arbitrariness problem' in my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very first post on this list at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2606.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2606.html</a> ). Also, this type of TOE 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would give a precise answer to the 'problem of the reference class' which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Nick Bostrom talks about in his work on the self-sampling assumption, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;answer being that you should reason as if you were randomly sampled from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the set of all observer-moments, weighted by their absolute measure. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;final benefit of this type of theory is that you wouldn't need a two-step 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;procedure of first coming up with a measure on &quot;universes&quot; and then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;afterwards adding anthropic considerations as a second step--I think that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;two-step idea depends on a fundamentally dualistic view of the mind/body 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problem, as I said in my post at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m5069.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m5069.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, does any of this help explain how I try to save the ASSA? I guess it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;depends on what you think the basic problem the ASSA has that requires it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to be &quot;saved&quot;, I think Hal Finney was saying the problem was that it could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lead to predictions incompatible with those of the RSSA, while others seem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to have more of a philosophical problem with talking about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;probability&quot; that my current observer-moment could be anything other than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what it actually is (if 'I' were someone else, 'I' wouldn't be me!) What 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is your basic objection to the ASSA, and do you think my pet theory offers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at least one possible way to resolve it?
