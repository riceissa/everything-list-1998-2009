<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I really do not want to be a stick-in-the-mud here, but what do we base 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the idea that &quot;copies&quot; could exist upon?
</em><br />
<br />It is a conjecture called &quot;functionalism&quot; (or one of its close variants).
<br />
I guess the &quot;strong AI&quot; view is that the mind can be emulated on a 
<br />
computer. And yes, just because many people believe this---not surprisingly
<br />
many computer scientists---does not make it true.
<br />
<br />An aspect of this belief is that a robot could act indistinguishably
<br />
from humans. At first glance, this seems plausible enough; certainly
<br />
many early 20th century SF writers thought it reasonable. Even Searle
<br />
concedes that such a robot could at least appear intelligent and
<br />
thoughtful to Chinese speakers.
<br />
<br />I suspect that Turing also believed it: after all, he proposed that
<br />
a program one day behave indistinguishably from humans. And why not,
<br />
exactly?  After all, the robot undertakes actions, performs calculations,
<br />
has internal states, and should be able to execute a repertoire as fine
<br />
as that of any human.  Unless there is some devastating reason to the
<br />
contrary.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What if &quot;I&quot;, or any one else's 1st person aspect, can not be copied?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the operation of copying is impossible, what is the status of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of these thought experiments?
</em><br />
<br />I notice that many people seek refuge in the &quot;no-copying&quot; theorem of
<br />
QM. Well, for them, I have that automobile travel also precludes
<br />
survival.  I can prove that to enter an automobile, drive it somewhere,
<br />
and then exit the automobile invariably changes the quantum state of
<br />
the person so reckless as to do it.
<br />
<br />If someone can teleport me back and forth from work to home, I'll
<br />
be happy to go along even if 1 atom in every thousand cells of mine
<br />
doesn't get copied. Moreover---I am not really picky about the exact
<br />
bound state of each atom, just so long as it is able to perform the
<br />
role approximately expected of it. (That is, go ahead and remove any
<br />
carbon atom you like, and replace it by another carbon atom in a
<br />
different state.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     If, and this is a HUGE if, there is some thing irreducibly quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanical to this &quot;1st person aspect&quot; then it follows from QM that copying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not allowed. Neither a quantum state nor a &quot;qubit&quot; can be copied without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; destroying the &quot;original&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />This is being awfully picky about permissible transformations. I
<br />
have even survived mild blows to the head, which have enormously
<br />
changed my quantum state.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; falsified, by the same experiments that unassailably imply that Nature is, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at its core, Quantum Mechanical and not Classical and thus one wonders: &quot;Why 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do we persist in this state of denial?&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Probably for the same reason that some people continue to be Libertarians.
<br />
It's a belief thing---the way you see the world.
<br />
<br />Lee
