Hi Joel,
<br />
<br />Sorry for the delay, but I am web-connected only at work, and at
<br />
work ..., well I have to work, sometimes :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; My first question, Joel, is simply : does this makes sense for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you?  Can you imagine saying yes to the doctor? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sure.  Sign me up!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (as you know, I already think we are software :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Next question I suppose..
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. I see you *are* a &quot;computationalist&quot; !
<br />
<br />The next questions are so easy that I will answer them for you, if 
<br />
you don't mind.
<br />
It will be useful later having numbered the questions. If you
<br />
disagree somewhere just tell me ('course).
<br />
<br />Question 2: Do you agree using (classical) teleportation? Are you
<br />
willing to use the European Teleportation Link Service Inc. They
<br />
can make you &quot;read&quot; and &quot;destroyed&quot; at Sofia and then they build 
<br />
you from the description (which has been send by the traditionnal 
<br />
post (nothing is perfect)) at Brussels.
<br />
<br />Because you say we are software I can guess you will ask me to
<br />
sign you up again.
<br />
<br />So let us go to the next question.
<br />
<br />Question 3: The next question introduces the 3-person 
<br />
(3-observer, ...) and the 1-person.
<br />
<br />We can define (for a beginning) the first-person description by the
<br />
content of his/her personal private diary, or by  his/her personal
<br />
memory. What matters is that the diary/memory follows the comp
<br />
practionners. In particular, during your Sofia-Brussels trip, your
<br />
diary/memory is destroyed in Sophia and recover in Brussels.
<br />
<br />The 3-person is just the content of the public (or scientific) diary
<br />
of an external observer. Her/his memory is not destroyed.
<br />
<br />Let us consider the Sofia-Brussels' trip. I suppose also that
<br />
the reconstitution box at Brussels has no windows. Do you agree
<br />
that if an arbitrary delay of recontitution is introduced at Brussels,
<br />
so that the 3-description describes a longer, and so a different
<br />
experiment, still the 1-description will not changed. That is the
<br />
1-person description (written in the box immediately after the
<br />
&nbsp;reconstitution) does not mention the delay. Do you agree if I say
<br />
that from the 1-person point of view there is no delay or that the
<br />
person does not feel, does not remembered, is not aware of, the 
<br />
(arbitrary) delay?
<br />
<br />Well, as a computationalist I'm afraid you will feel insulted by
<br />
a so easy question, so you will say yes. Isn't it?
<br />
<br />So here is question 4. It *seems* innocuous. You take the tele-trip
<br />
again from Sofia to Brussels. Could the fact that you survive that 
<br />
trip depends on very far (not even in your light cone if you want)
<br />
event?
<br />
Because you made allusion to the independance of the computations
<br />
I guess you will agree.
<br />
<br />In that case I can almost deduce that you will say yes also
<br />
to question 5.
<br />
Question 5: do you agree you will survive the *duplication*
<br />
experiment where you are read and destroyed at Brussels and then
<br />
you are reconstituted (simultaneously or not) both at 
<br />
Washington and Moscow? I just ask you if you think you will
<br />
survive *that* experiment. Well I ask you also if you agree 
<br />
that the Joel in Moscow and the Joel in Washington have the 
<br />
same &quot;joelness right&quot;.
<br />
<br />Here is question 6. Perhaps the first not so obvious one.
<br />
Do you agree that, if I ask you at Brussels, before the
<br />
Washington-Moscow duplication experiment: &quot;Where will you *feel*
<br />
to be after the experiment will be completed?&quot; that although
<br />
you can answer &quot;you will see me at Washington and at Moscow&quot;, 
<br />
your first person diary will either contain &quot;I am at Moscow&quot; or
<br />
I am at Washington&quot; so that you cannot predict with certainty 
<br />
where you will feel to be?&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
<br />
<br />PS I hope I'm clear. I'm interrupt each five minutes by collegues.
<br />
Works would improved in the world if we eliminate all collegues  :-)
<br />
I hope also I'm not too boring. It is necessary to be quite clear
<br />
at the beginning.
