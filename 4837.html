Hal,
<br />
<br />Waht about a definition of Observer-Moment?
<br />
That would surely help me...
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In your definition of the ASSA, why do you define it in terms of your next

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer moment?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The ASSA and the RSSA were historically defined as competing views.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not 100% sure that I have the ASSA right, in that it doesn't seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too different from the SSSA.  (BTW I have kept the definitions at the end
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of this email.)  (BTW, BTW means By The Way.)  But I am pretty sure about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the RSSA being in terms of the &quot;next&quot; moment, so I defined the ASSA the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same way, to better illustrate its complementary relationship to the RSSA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The real difference between these views was not addressed in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; glossary, which is that the RSSA is supposed to justify the QTI, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum theory of immortality, while the ASSA is supposed to refute it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is, if you only experience universes where your identity continues,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as the RSSA implies, then it would seem that you will never die.  But if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your life-moments are ruled by statistics based on physical law as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ASSA says, then the chance that you will ever experience being extremely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; old is infinitesimal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Personally I think the ASSA as I have it is somewhat incoherent, speaking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a &quot;next&quot; observer moment in a framework where there really isn't any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such notion.  But as I said it has been considered as the alternative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the RSSA.  I invite suggestions for improved wording.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Wouldn't it be possible to have a version of the SSA where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you consider your *current* observer moment to be randomly sampled from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; set of all observer-moments, but you use something like the RSSA to guess
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what your next observer moment is likely to be like?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That seems contradictory.  You have one distribution for the current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moment (sampled from all of them), and another distribution for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the next observer-moment (sampled from those that are continuous with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same identity).  But the current observer-moment is also a &quot;next&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moment (relative to the previous observer-moment).  So you can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use the ASSA for current OM's and the RSSA for next OM's, because every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next is a current, and vice versa.  (By OM I mean observer-moment.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Also, what about a weighted version of the ASSA? I believe other animals are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conscious and thus would qualify as observers/observer-moments, which would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; suggest I am extraordinarily lucky to find myself as an observer-moment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what seems like the most intelligent species on the planet...but could there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be an element of the anthropic principle here? Perhaps some kind of theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of consciousness would assign something like a &quot;mental complexity&quot; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; different observer-moments, and the self-sampling assumption could be biased
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in favor of more complex minds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I think the possibility of weighting OM's is implicit in these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitions.  We often use the term &quot;measure&quot; to indicate that some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OM's carry more weight and more probability than others.  For example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one theory is that OM's which take a larger program to output would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have lower measure than ones which are described by a short program.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By this definition we might think that less complex minds would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more measure, the opposite of your idea.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I haven't heard of anyone suggesting that complex minds would inherently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have higher measure.  Instead, it seems that most people use a somewhat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrary cutoff for complexity which is necessary to qualify as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer.  In the anthropic literature this general issue is discussed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as the problem of the reference class.  I'm not that familiar with all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ideas which have been proposed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your idea, and my alternative about less complex minds having more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure, have the problem that it seems that much more and less complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minds should exist in the multiverse, and as you note we obviously have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence of less-complex minds existing in abundance right here on Earth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So if more complexity is better, why aren't we super-intelligent aliens?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Likewise, one might use a graded version of the RSSA to deal with &quot;degrees
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of similarity&quot;, instead of having it be a simple either-or whether a future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer-moment &quot;belongs to the same observer&quot; or not as you suggest in your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; definition. There could be some small probability that my next
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer-moment will be of a completely different person, but in most cases
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it would be more likely that my next observer-moment would be basically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; similar to my current one. But one might also have to take into account the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; absolute measure on all-observer moments that I suggest above, so that if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there is a very low absolute probability of a brain that can suggest a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; future observer-moment which is very similar to my current one (because,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; say, I am standing at ground zero of a nuclear explosion) then the relative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probability of my next observer-moment being completely different would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; higher. Again, one would need something like a theory of consciousness to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; quantify stuff like &quot;degrees of similarity&quot; and the details of how the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; tradeoff between relative probability and absolute probability would work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This seems hard to motivate because it fails to satisfy the desire of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RSSA proponents to get quantum immortality, while still introducing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the problematic notions of identity which the ASSA was supposed to free
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us from.  Also, you would need to come up with some rules for how big the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; threshold has to be in order to kick you out of your current identity-line
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and into someone else's.  It looks problematic to me.
