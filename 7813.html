Hi Hal,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much for you work in writing this review and commentary 
<br />
of the Maulding paper. I have not read it yet, but would like to ask some 
<br />
questions and interject some comments, even if I end up looking like a fool.

Subject: Maudlin's Machine and the UDist
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rutgers philosopher Tim Maudlin has a paper intended to challenge certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; views about consciousness and computation, which we have discussed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occasionally on this list.  It is called &quot;Computation and Consciousness&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Journal of Philosophy v86, pp. 407-432.  I have temporarily put a copy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; online at <a href="http://www.finney.org/~hal/maudlin.pdf">http://www.finney.org/~hal/maudlin.pdf</a> .  This is a personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copy and I would ask you not to redistribute it.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sad that copyrights are what they have become such that the free 
<br />
flow and accessibility of papers is becoming more and more like the guilds 
<br />
of yore. :_(
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The background question is when a given physical system can be said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to implement a given computation (especially, a conscious computation).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We imagine that the computation is specified in abstract terms, perhaps as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a program in a conventional computer language, or perhaps in a lower-level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form as a program for a Turing Machine or some other model of computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it is abstract.  We then ask, given a certain physical system P,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is it implementing computation C?
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to touch on the question that Chalmers asked here:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://consc.net/papers/rock.html">http://consc.net/papers/rock.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In practice, it seems that this is an easy question to answer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our computers implement the programs which are fed into them.  No one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; denies that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But philosophers have argued that there is a way of viewing the activity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a physical system that can make it appear to be implementing *any*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation C.  We can think of C as passing through a series of states:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; C1, C2, C3, and so on.  And we can think of the physical system P as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; passing through a series of states: P1, P2, P3.  So if we map P1 to C1,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P2 to C2, and so on, we can argue that P is implementing C, for any C
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and for pretty much any P.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that there should be nothing special about the ordering 
<br />
of the P_i for the COMP assumptions to hold, OTOH, there seems to be some 
<br />
requirement that some aspect of P_n be relatable to P_n-1 in a way that is 
<br />
independent of how the particular P_i are extent, no?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The philosophers' response to this is that it is not enough to be able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set up such a mapping.  What is also necessary, to claim that P implements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or &quot;instantiates&quot;) C, is that the *counterfactuals* would have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist in correspondence as well.  That is, not only the states C1, C2,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; C3 but also other states of C that would have been taken if the inputs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had been different, have to have correspondences in P.  It is claimed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the kind of arbitrary mapping described above will not work once
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterfactuals are taken into account.  (I'm not sure I fully understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or agree with this rebuttal but it is well accepted in the field.)
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contrafactuals have been shown, at least in QM experiements, to be 
<br />
just as *real* when it comes to notion of causation as the factuals. So if 
<br />
we are to take empirical evidence as a guide, it seems that there is some 
<br />
reason to expect that contrafactuals can not be dismissed out of hand.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.nonlocal.com/quantum-d/v2/kbowden_03-15-97.html">http://www.nonlocal.com/quantum-d/v2/kbowden_03-15-97.html</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The principle that whether P implements C depends on these counterfactuals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is one of the issues that Maudlin addresses.  When referring to conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations, this principle is generally considered part of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;computationalist&quot; hypothesis, that the instantiation of an appropriate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation C in a physical system P actually produces a corresponding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sensation of consciousness.  Implicit in this hypothesis is that to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said to be instantiating C, P must have had enough structure to also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; produce counterfactuals, if they had occured.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, that's a lot of background!  And there's more.  The other thesis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that Maudlin considers is called supervenience, a philosophical word for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is fortunately a pretty straightforward concept.  It is that whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a physical system implements a given computation depends solely on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity of that physical system.  No mystical or non-physical elements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or attributes need to be considered in judging whether P implements C.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All that matters is P's physical activity.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can hope that no &quot;obscurum per occultum&quot; is involved! ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a nutshell, Maudlin argues that these two common views on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter are actually in contradiction.  But frankly, although Maudlin's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument is complicated and involves all kinds of thought experiments and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elaborate, imaginary machines, I think it is actually quite an obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point.  Supervenience means that implementation depends on what P does,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; while support for counterfactuals means that implementation depends on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what P doesn't do.  Q.E.D.!  Maudlin merely takes great time and care
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to illustrate the contradiction in detail.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another place that counterfactuals come into play is when considering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether replays are conscious.  If we re-run a calculation, but this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time we don't include the logic aspects but merely passively replay a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recording of each component's activity, is this conscious?  Does this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P instantiate C?  The answer, according to the counterfactual view, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no, because a mere replay of a recorded set of events does not include
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterfactuals and will not work right if a different input is supplied.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand if the re-run is a genuine computation which merely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens to be given the same input and hence to follow the same sequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of operations, then that re-run would in fact be considered to generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it Live or Memorex? What is the difference between object and 
<br />
Representation?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now to bring in the multiverse perspective, in the flavor I have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pursuing.  From the viewpoint that says that all information objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist and are distributed according to the Universal Distribution (UDist),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what can we say about these questions?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First, the question of whether a physical system P implements a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation C is seen to be the wrong question to ask.  C is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information object and has a measure.  Likewise, although we think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of P as physical, in the UDist model the universe containing P is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; merely one information object, and P is a subset of that universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question is therefore, how much measure does P contribute to C?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That will depend on the measure of P and on how much of P's measure can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be seen as contributing to C.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still worried about how a measure can exist over a set, collecton, 
<br />
class, or whatever of computations! Does not the notion of a measure require 
<br />
the existence of a space where each point is an object of the class and the 
<br />
measure itself defines the similarity/difference between one object, here a 
<br />
computation, and some given other?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What ontological status does &quot;Computation Space&quot; have?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, here I need to address an ambiguity in some of the philosophical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion of this issue, which shows up in Maudlin's paper among other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; places.  What do we mean by an abstract computation?  Is it a program,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or is it a run of a program (i.e. the sequence of states it goes through,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also called the &quot;trace&quot;)?
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally make a big deal about a difference between a program and 
<br />
the running of a program! The former is merely an ontic question and the 
<br />
latter involves some supervinient &quot;process&quot; that implements the program, no?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I suppose it could mean either one; from the UDist perspective,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both views can be supported.  As information objects, we can distinguish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programs and program traces, just as we could distinguish theorems and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proofs, or numbers and sequences.  They are related but not the same.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We could ask for the measure of a program, and define it by representing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the program in some canonical form like Java source code, then finding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the shortest program that would output that program.  Or we could ask
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the measure of a program trace, define it as a sequence of states
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again in some canonical form, and ask for the shortest program that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would output that sequence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maudlin talks about programs as sequences of states, which provides
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the most direct way of thinking of them as causing or creating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.  I'll do it that way, too.  So when I speak of P or C
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here I am talking about sequences of states, not static structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like machine descriptions or source code listings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The specific mechanism in the UDist framework for calculating the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contribution of P to C's measure is to imagine a program which takes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P as input and produces C as output.  Both P and C are considered as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information objects for this purpose.  Such a program can be quite small
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the case where our common sense would say that P does implement C.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can find a mapping of P into C that is simple and straightforward,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and therefore corresponds to a small program.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand in cases where common sense would say that P does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing to implement C, such as where P is a clock and C is a conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program, any such mapping from P to C is going to have to be about as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; big as C itself.  P is of no help in calculating such a C and hence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is no short program that produces C given P.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could it be that a &quot;clock&quot; (the physical object) IS, in fact, the 
<br />
shortest program that implements &quot;what it is like to be a clock&quot; - the 
<br />
program?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no need to consider counterfactuals in this framework.  What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; keeps a clock from contributing measure to arbitrary programs is not its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; failure to implement counterfactuals, it is the fact that no short program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can use the structure of a clock to output an arbitrary computation C.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This analysis also produces a different answer than the traditional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach for considering the impact of replays.  Both &quot;passive&quot; replays
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which just play back a recorded sequence of states) and &quot;active&quot; ones
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which re-do a computational sequence) would both add roughly equal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amounts to measure, because both would allow for similarly short programs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which turn the sequence of P states to the sequence of C states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turning to Maudlin's paper, his main effort is to construct a machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (named Olympia) which essentially does a passive replay but which contains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; triggers which will turn on an &quot;active&quot; machine if the inputs are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what were recorded during the replay.  In this way he argues that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine does implement counterfactuals.  However when run in replay mode,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; none of the counterfactual machinery gets activated, because in practice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the inputs are all given the correct values.  And his machine is so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple in how it does the replay that the actual physical activity is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; almost non-existent.  In this way he argues that the supervenience thesis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would find insufficient activity for consciousness, in contradiction to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computationalist principle.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to support my ill-formed argument that there is a huge and 
<br />
important difference between the existence of some Interger N and the 
<br />
computation of N; again the former merely &quot;exists&quot; the latter requires a 
<br />
process...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, I hope that Mauldin assumes that some kind of &quot;activity&quot;, 
<br />
re: process, is involved in consciousness. From your depiction I assume that 
<br />
he does, but will have to hold back until I read the paper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very important point, IMHO, because it is distinguishing 
<br />
between the actual implentation of a conscious mind and a sequence of &quot;snap 
<br />
shots&quot; of the brain assumed to exist a priori.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure I find Maudlin's argument persuasive even within the standard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; framework, for a variety of reasons, but I won't go into that here.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would really like to read your thoughts on this!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My goal is to analyze it within the UDist framework.  In that case the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paradox or contradiction doesn't arise, because the only question is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the degree to which the structure of Maudlin's machine Olympia allows
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a short program that maps to the computational pattern C.  We can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first ignore the extra machinery for handling counterfactuals since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is not an issue in the UDist approach.  For the rest, Maudlin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rearranges the program states and includes in Olympia a map from every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program state to some other program state, which will be an enormous map
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for any actual conscious experience.  I suspect that the size of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; additional structure, and the way the states have been scrambled, will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complicate the program that has to do the translation somewhat, but that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it will still be possible to output C using a reasonably short program.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore I would expect that his machine might not contribute quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as much to the measure of C as a conventional machine would, but still

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would contribute an appreciable measure.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In any case, his machine certainly does not pose a challenge or paradox
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the UDist framework, since UDist is merely a recipe for how to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculate a number, the measure of C.  All kinds of bizarre machines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be imagined which would in some way relate to C, and still in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle we could estimate out how much measure they would each add to C.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems that no paradox can arise from this type of analysis.
