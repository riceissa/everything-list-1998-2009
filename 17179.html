<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experience exists uncaused.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not against physicalism, it is again rationalism.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ha!  Well, maybe.  What is the flaw that you see in my reasoning?
<br />
<br />I think that both the argument and conclusion are rational, just not intuitive.
<br />
<br /><br />So earlier you asked this:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; By the way, what is the status of your theory with respect to comp?
</em><br />
<br />Which in part prompted this new thread.
<br />
<br />So I think that one of the things that we can be conscious of is a
<br />
descriptive theory referred to as &quot;comp&quot; that attempts to map the
<br />
contents of our &quot;conscious experience over time&quot; to
<br />
mathematically/logically defined &quot;machines&quot;.
<br />
<br />And, I will not be surprised if you or someone else is ultimately
<br />
successful in doing so.  But while this would be interesting, I don't
<br />
think that it means anything deeper.  All that it will mean is &quot;look,
<br />
here's an interesting way of representing the contents of your
<br />
conscious experience over time&quot;.
<br />
<br />It would just be a way of representing what &quot;is&quot;.  By which I mean:
<br />
It would just be a way of representing conscious experience.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say that consciousness has a reason, a purpose, and a power.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A reason: the many universal numbers and the way they reflect each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other.
</em><br />
<br />This doesn't sound like a &quot;reason&quot; to me.  It sounds like an
<br />
observation, along the lines of &quot;adjacent gray and white veins exist
<br />
within this block of granite&quot; (from my original post).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A purpose: truth quest, satisfaction quest.
</em><br />
<br />This purpose would only exist as part of someone's conscious
<br />
experience.  The desire for truth and/or satisfaction are things that
<br />
only exist in the context of conscious experience.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A  power: relative self-acceleration (can lead to catastrophes, (like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all power)).
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure what you mean by this.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physicists explain by finding elegant laws relating the quanta we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure, but fail indeed linking those quanta to the qualia we live,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and fail saying where those quanta comes from. But computer science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggest a solution, we are universal machine mirroring doing science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;automatically&quot; betting on &quot;big picture&quot; all the time, relatively to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other possible universal machines.
</em><br />
<br />So our machineness precedes our conscious experience?  Machines are
<br />
more fundamental than consciousness?  Or machines are just a way of
<br />
representing conscious experience?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then theoretical computer science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can explain why we feel consciousness unexplainable and explain its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason, purpose and power.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see that it explains anything.  Though it may be a
<br />
useful/enjoyable way of thinking about the contents of our conscious
<br />
experience.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This explains the mind, but we get the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem of justifying the computability and the existence of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical laws from a vast set of computations. The white rabbits and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; white noises.
</em><br />
<br />So it seems to me that you aren't explaining the fact that we have
<br />
experiences.  It seems to me that you are focused entirely on finding
<br />
a way of generating mathematical/logical representations of what you
<br />
and I experience that doesn't also generate representations of strange
<br />
white-rabbit experiences.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Those universal machine are self-multiplying and self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differencing infinitely often in arithmetic. This is a big price: if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are machine (a theory which explains consciousness as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unconscious bet on a reality), we have to explain the physical laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from computer science and logic alone.
</em><br />
<br />The physical laws can't be explained except in terms of other
<br />
unexplained laws, as mentioned in my previous post.
<br />
<br />Though, I'd say that physical laws can't be explained because they
<br />
only exist in our perceptions, which are themselves uncaused and
<br />
therefore unexplainable.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But now that explanation can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tested in nature, making that theory refutable. And this illustrates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we don't have to abandon rationalism.
</em><br />
<br />I think the rational conclusion from what we perceive is that
<br />
conscious experience is fundamental and uncaused.
<br />
<br />You are saying that consciousness is NOT fundamental, and thus it IS
<br />
caused.  By...numbers?
<br />
<br />I think that you are mistaking representation for causation.  Even if
<br />
numbers exist in some platonic sense, and can be related in a way that
<br />
can be seen as mirroring, representing, or even predicting my
<br />
conscious experience...I think that all this shows is that math/logic
<br />
is a really flexible tool for representing processes, relationships,
<br />
patterns, etc.
<br />
<br />As far as the significance of accurate predictions, I refer you back
<br />
to the last paragraph of my original post.  You read the part about
<br />
the granite block, right?  Though, I do need to find some more
<br />
succinct way of stating that point that doesn't require the setup of
<br />
all the preceding paragraphs.
<br />
<br />Hmmmm.
<br />
<br />ALSO, this discussion between Sean Carroll and Mark Trodden was great,
<br />
and I think goes with my original post pretty well, especially the
<br />
last third of their discussion.
