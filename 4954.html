Hi, George. I'm sorry for the lateness of my reply; thankfully I've 
<br />
been very busy.
<br />
<br />I find your thoughts interesting in that they seem distantly relative 
<br />
to fractional charges we attribute to some things, such as quarks, 
<br />
although one might argue that they are only fractional because they 
<br />
were not the 1st items to have been assigned values! I tend to try to 
<br />
formulate my thoughts upon logic rather than mathematics, though, 
<br />
since I'm of the opinion that mathematics is limited to a digital 
<br />
interpretation but logic encompasses both the digital and the analog. 
<br />
When dealing with the very large and the very small, I think 
<br />
mathematics is inherently inaccurate when trying to describe an 
<br />
analog condition and that is why it can not accurately represent 
<br />
infinity in a practical way.
<br />
<br />My thoughts, on what &quot;dark matter&quot; and &quot;dark energy&quot; really are, are 
<br />
not mainstream and they seem inconsistent with your general equation 
<br />
involving them. I've argued in this topic that both of those things 
<br />
are really not matter/energy, and that they are both the same thing. 
<br />
I've basically agreed with a strange idea that &quot;dark energy&quot; is what 
<br />
we see when the force of &quot;gravity&quot; is relavistically below a 
<br />
threshold value and that it is the engine which is causing an 
<br />
accelerating expansion space/time within our entire open universe.
<br />
<br />I've gone further to say that the equivalent flip side of that 
<br />
concept is expressed when the force of &quot;gravity&quot; exceeds a threshold 
<br />
value and a black hole forms in result. I've argued that a black 
<br />
hole, in seeking to be a singularity, is forever moving away and 
<br />
distancing itself from all other objects in our universe and that the 
<br />
process is nothing more than another but localized expression of an 
<br />
ever increasing rate of space/time inflation. I've argued that the 
<br />
force of &quot;gravity&quot; related to a black hole is what &quot;dark matter&quot; is. 
<br />
Based upon that logic, I've argued that dark matter and dark energy 
<br />
are really the same things, an inflating region of space/time. 
<br />
Building more on that logic, I've argued that &quot;gravity&quot; is not 
<br />
matter/energy and it instead is an expression of space/time. I've 
<br />
argued that space/time and matter/energy are two differing things, 
<br />
and that they can not be unified into one term. I've argued that 
<br />
space/time is the absence of matter/energy, it is an infinite 
<br />
nothingness. But I've argued that matter/energy and space/time do 
<br />
affect each other nonetheless, and that the affect is expressed in a 
<br />
concept that we refer to as relativity.
<br />
<br />And I've argued that matter/energy is but a chance quantity and 
<br />
arrangement of a spontaneous appearance of virtual particles in what 
<br />
I've termed a &quot;meta universe&quot;. I like that the term &quot;meta universe&quot; 
<br />
to distinguish it from similar but non identical concepts. I've 
<br />
argued that it just so happened that enough virtual particles 
<br />
appeared close enough together that an expanding bubble formed and 
<br />
which our entire known universe resides within. All of our 
<br />
measurements are constrained within that bubble, they are not 
<br />
relative to the meta universe because on the average and over 
<br />
infinity there is nothing in the meta universe - all virtual 
<br />
particles return their energy back to the meta universe which thereby 
<br />
keeps its state of thermal equilibrium (that state being at a 
<br />
temperature of absolute zero, not even a fraction above).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the viewpoint of an eternity in the meta universe, all 
</em><br />
space/time and matter/energy that we perceive in our bubble universe 
<br />
simply does not exist and it is but an illusion. Although our 
<br />
universe does exist relative to its constructs composed of what to us 
<br />
are real particles but what to the meta universe are but virtual 
<br />
particles, our universe does not really exist relative to the meta 
<br />
universe because there is no point of relative reference in the meta 
<br />
universe which is but, on the average throughout eternity, composed 
<br />
of absolutely nothing at all.
<br />
<br />I've argued that both at the cosmic and at local scales, in our 
<br />
universe, space/time continues to inflate at an ever accelerating 
<br />
pace. I've argued that where there be matter/energy then inflation 
<br />
slows down locally, but it is never completely inhibited. I've argued 
<br />
that inflation itself is the process by which the apparent energy in 
<br />
our universe is returned to the meta universe, that inflation is a 
<br />
sort of &quot;tension&quot; or a sort of attraction mechanism that seeks to and 
<br />
ultimately will return the virtual particles to a ground state (a 
<br />
zero energy state) in the meta universe.
<br />
<br />And so that logic also had me argue that &quot;gravity&quot; does not have a 
<br />
force carrier, it will never be found because gravity is just a 
<br />
relative expression of inflationary space/time itself and gravity is 
<br />
not composed of matter/energy. I've argued that at some point where 
<br />
inflation locally exceeds the speed of light then the very atomic 
<br />
bonds become unbound due to their component parts being forced away 
<br />
from (and thereby distancing themselves from) each other, and that 
<br />
this is the mechanism by which all matter will eventually decay to 
<br />
zero energy and exhibit infinite red shift.
<br />
<br />I've argued that in local regions where the rate of inflation, 
<br />
relative to any particle within that region, has exceeded the speed 
<br />
of light then it is not possible for matter/energy therein to 
<br />
interact with other points of matter/energy anywhere therein or 
<br />
thereout, because exchange of energy can not travel faster than 
<br />
light. This is but another indicator, relative to the rest of our 
<br />
universe, that decay has occurred - the matter/energy is no longer 
<br />
relative and indeed relativity has then lost all meaning. If you can 
<br />
not measure it due to light speed constraint then there is no 
<br />
relativity and so there can be no interactions, and such a particle 
<br />
could only be relative to itself and nothing else.
<br />
<br />My arguments are circular and that is what gives them consistency. 
<br />
Break the chain of logic then the premise is found to be faulty. So 
<br />
far, I think my arguments have held up pretty good to disassembly 
<br />
attempts. They are not really my own arguments, individually; but 
<br />
maybe just the way I've assembled the arguments is a little unique.

Ron,
<br />
<br />I am not a physicist, just a dabbling engineer philosopher, however, 
<br />
the idea of dark energy is intriguing. I asked a question a few weeks 
<br />
ago, whether dark (mass) energy is identical to negative (mass) 
<br />
energy and what the implications would be in terms of Newton 
<br />
mechanics. The reason for my question was that, on purely 
<br />
philosophical grounds, because of symmetry and of conservation laws, 
<br />
I was expecting the amount of positive (mass) energy in the universe 
<br />
to be exactly equal to the amount of negative (mass) energy. 
<br />
Therefore, I was expecting the amount of dark energy to be exactly 
<br />
equal to the amount of mass energy in the universe. 
<br />
<br />However, in recent article, Tegmark stated that the amount of dark 
<br />
energy has been measured to be 67%. This data shoots down my bipolar 
<br />
symmetry conjecture. However, pursuing the idea of symmetry in the 
<br />
complex plane, it may imply that there are two kinds of dark energy 
<br />
each 33% of the universe. The symmetry would then be three-fold: 1/3 
<br />
real matter, 1/3 (-0.5 +  isqrt(3)/2) dark energy and 1/3 (-0.5 - 
<br />
isqrt(3)/2) dark energy. Can any one figure out what the implications 
<br />
of this conjecture  would be? How would dark energy interact with 
<br />
itself and how would it interact with ordinary matter?
<br />
