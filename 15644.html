</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree.
<br />
(Mainly, for technical reason in some context essentialistic argument  
<br />
can speed-up argumentation, but I agree with you that this should be  
<br />
done only if the &quot;essentialist&quot; part of the definition can be  
<br />
eliminated, or it could be done provisorily in pehnomenologies).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Science used to suffer from this.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not only science. Also philosophy, religion, humanity. Science is just  
<br />
the attitude of being aware that, if we want to understand each  
<br />
others, we can only de-essentialize somehow. There is no field which  
<br />
cannot benefit from that attitude in the long run.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; About 120 years ago, biologists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used to argue about the meaning of &quot;life&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Were viruses alive?
</em><br />
<br />OK, you can see this as an essentialist question.
<br />
Is a cigarette pack alive? Well, it has a rather crazy reproduction  
<br />
cycle!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sperm alive?
</em><br />
<br />Of course biologists today have a clear and definite answer: sperm are  
<br />
alive. By all conventional definitions.
<br />
&quot;Is a human sperm a human&quot; is much more debated, and some of those  
<br />
debate could be related to essentialist misconceptions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  What they could or could not consider &quot;alive&quot; was really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important to the old-school biologists, and there was endless debate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between them.  (People on both sides of the abortion issue still make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these kinds of empty arguments.)
</em><br />
<br />Keep in mind you are in applied science. To take already matter for  
<br />
granted is, I think, one of the big last essentialist illusion in  
<br />
science.
<br />
It prevents the questioning on matter and on the origin of matter, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But today, biologists don't care what &quot;life&quot; means.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  They accept an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrary definition for &quot;life&quot; because they're scientists, and as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientists they realize that the definitions we use do not define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality.
</em><br />
<br />All right.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Definitions of words and concepts are merely tools for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describing things to one another in a consistent manner.
</em><br />
<br />Indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Real truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stems from examining the relationships between observable phenomena,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Let me cut the hairs: Real Truth stems, HOPEFULLY, from examining the  
<br />
relationships between observable phenomena. OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by using operational definitions rather than essentialistic ones.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I so much agree with you. That is even exactly why I approach the mind  
<br />
body problem through the digital mechanist hypothesis. That hypothesis  
<br />
makes possible a purely operational and deductive approach to the  
<br />
consciousness/matter relationship problem.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anything less than this is semantics.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am less sure why you say this. Semantics are good to provide  
<br />
consistency, to show independence of beliefs, etc.
<br />
<br /><br />--------------
<br />
Let me comment here your &quot;mind and personhood. Was Kim 1&quot; post.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I apologize if I seemed rude or accusatory...
</em><br />
<br /><br />No need. Essentialism ruins science, even poetry and art can succumb.  
<br />
In applied science, you can almost always use essentialism to hide  
<br />
deductive consequences. I suspect some people does that often, but if  
<br />
you read the posts here, most people are rather careful in that  
<br />
setting. Of course most attempt to use a notion of &quot;real matter&quot; is  
<br />
bounded to essentialism since Aristotle introduces that idea in  
<br />
&quot;science&quot;. Modern physics is not yet completely cured.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Words are very useful, but systematic measurements are better for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things, because the Universe seems to allow us to repeat them.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Of course. But systematic measurements makes sense only to confront  
<br />
theories. Which needs words, deduction rule, semantics, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Issues involving the mind are intrinsically harder to tackle.  Human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dialogue over the millenia suggests there's some subjective  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personhood or &quot;being&quot; that we all share, and each of us presumably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences something like that.  But we have no way to quantify or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the conscious experience itself.  We're left feeling like there's  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; missing from what we can measure.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Making it a fascinating field. And we have an old theory, Mechanism,  
<br />
renewed recently by a couple of major impressive discoveries: the  
<br />
discovery by Babbage, Post, Turing, Kleene, Church ... of the  
<br />
universal machine, and the discovery by Feynman, Deutsch Beniof  
<br />
Kitaev, Friedman... of  quantum universal machine.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we're scientists, what we should really be asking is this: why do  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say all the things they do about conscious experience?
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. Another questionr, will the self-observing machine says similar  
<br />
things. how much similar, how to compare, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It doesn't seem too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strange to think that a computer program which has some meta-cognitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ability and self-awareness might, as part of the natural output of its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program, spit out a bunch of symbols related to the &quot;experience&quot; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-awareness itself.
</em><br />
<br /><br />So you are open to the Strong AI thesis. Are you open to the stronger  
<br />
hypothesis that *you* could say yes for a graft of a digital  
<br />
artificial brain?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Science doesn't suggest there must be anything more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to what we are than this kind of output.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Experiments does not suggest per se. But experiments does not prove  
<br />
either. It remains an hypothesis. It remains a theory. Experiments  
<br />
confirms or falsify. In that particular case, of mechanism, I can  
<br />
argue that the hypothetical character has to be insisted upon. No  
<br />
machine can know which machines she is and it is in some way a  
<br />
personal concern which escapes public or sharable norms. &quot;Yes doctor&quot;  
<br />
entails the right to say &quot;No doctor&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We don't like the idea that our precious consciousness could be a mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; illusion
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I have not the slightest insight of why you say our consciousness  
<br />
could be an illusion. I can conceive that any content of consciousness  
<br />
is an illusion, but consciousness itself, sorry I cannot.
<br />
I can believe that the Universe is an illusion, that time and space  
<br />
are illusion, or this or that bosons or galaxies, but how could I  
<br />
doubt myself doubting? I try often, but have never succeed, which  
<br />
confirms personnally the idea that I copuld be a machine, as self- 
<br />
referentially correct machine capable of a very small amount of  
<br />
inductive inference can't doubt this. Consciousness is a fixed point  
<br />
of doubt, somehow.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; because our sense of self is something we cling to with the fervor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of evolutionary self-preservation
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;... in some theory, which btw I think mostly correct. Yet I can  
<br />
doubt them, where I cannot doubt consciousness. Nor do I find any  
<br />
reason to explain away consciousness by an appeal to Darwinian-like  
<br />
theories. On the contrary, my whole point is that if we take seriously  
<br />
the mechanist theory then it is matter which becomes an illusion, and  
<br />
we gat a theory of matter and of the apparition of matter in machine  
<br />
observer's mind which does no more need any reification or  
<br />
essentialist justification of it. Mechanism extends Darwinism to  
<br />
physics. Mechanism, the theory, single out the essentialism in  
<br />
Physics, and this in a verifiable way.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If Everett's is true, you could even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think about a person as only existing for the barest instant: one  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; static state, frozen in time, in an infinite mathematical sea of other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states (well, not really, but roughly).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />This is provably so once you assume mechanism (this is the point of my  
<br />
explanation through UDA and AUDA). Everett is a consequence, or has to  
<br />
be a consequence of mechanism.
<br />
You seem to believe that consciousness is an essentialist notion: it  
<br />
is not. The question is real for doctor in front of some comatose  
<br />
patient. The question is real for saying yes or no for some medical  
<br />
operation. The fact that we cannot prove we are conscious, does not  
<br />
entail the notion is meaningless. We can build theories and prove  
<br />
things with respect of the theories, and verify empirically indirect  
<br />
consequences.
<br />
Peano Arithmetic cannot prove its own consistency, yet its consistency  
<br />
is true.
<br />
(I show that consciousness for self-referentially correct machine  
<br />
behaves very much like &quot;consistency?&quot;. Consistency with an  
<br />
interrogation mark. It is a bet on a reality).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; All the experience of travelling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forward through time could be just an illusion produced by our own  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and meta-cognitive ability.
</em><br />
<br />I agree. It is a correct consequence of the MEC hypothesis. But not  
<br />
just time is an &quot;illusion of consciousness&quot;, space and energy follows.  
<br />
Yet the digital hypothesis forces, and makes it possible, to be 100%  
<br />
explicit of how those thing appears to mathematical machines, and why  
<br />
such illusion persists and obeys laws.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a sense, we'd cease to be every instant no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less surely than if we'd just died.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Again, this follows from the MEC thesis. But today this still entails  
<br />
an inflation of possibilities. The physics seems to be too rich,  
<br />
except that if we take computer science (and provability logic) there  
<br />
are reasons to hope this inflation is bound up by the SWE. But this  
<br />
remains to be justified, without postulating Everett or the SWE. See  
<br />
the AUDA part of my papers for paving a way. (the UDA part explain  
<br />
*why* we have to do that). UDA = the Universal Dovetailer Argument,  
<br />
and AUDA = the Arithmetical translation of the UDA.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I guess the underlying philosophical question is, what does it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a conscious person?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't think so. We know well what it means (too well will say some).  
<br />
It means to be a subject, to live experience, like the smell of  
<br />
coffee, the softness of velvet, the weirdness of dreams and life, the  
<br />
hardness of taxes,  and of death of people we care about, it means  
<br />
headache, peace, serenity, joy, pleasure, pain. it means to feel  
<br />
understanding of a proof, to feel the joy of understanding a joke, or  
<br />
of solving a puzzle; It means many things, that we can not share, but  
<br />
we can approximate some share through science, art and religion.  
<br />
Through movie, novel and theater, etc.
<br />
No need to define that. There is only one zombie participating to this  
<br />
list, if I remember well ... You need only to believe that you are not  
<br />
zombie to understand the argument.
<br />
<br />We can share enough on consciousness to be able to reason in a theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Socially it's useful to think of a person as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history of that person's memories, but I don't know if there's a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; useful way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to think about it scientifically.
</em><br />
<br />Why not? If you discourage science (that is: doubt) in a field, you  
<br />
will encourage the authoritative argument in that field.
<br />
I think that when science are inexact, they get inhuman in the run.
<br />
Science is the art of being able to be ameliorated or refuted. The  
<br />
scientific attitude is a modesty attitude.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even as I type this, there's no way for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me to demonstrate that I exist for more than an instant, and I doubt  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ever will be.
</em><br />
<br />You are right! Then there is a theory where you can prove that there  
<br />
is no proof of that this kind indeed. So your feeling here confirms  
<br />
that theory (which is MEC). But the theory explains why and how matter  
<br />
emerges, so that we can test the theory with more observations which  
<br />
are more easily and &quot;scientifically&quot; repeatable and sharable than you  
<br />
feeling and intuition.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As you read this last sentence, please enjoy your first and last  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmmm.... Here you have to think more, at least if your intuition is  
<br />
based on the mechanist theory (like it seems above).
<br />
You die at each instant, that is correct, but you survive at each  
<br />
dying experience too (just think!, or follow the explanation I give to  
<br />
Kim, and criticize if not convinced).
<br />
That is the probably most disturbing part of the MEC hypothesis (and  
<br />
of Everett's QM).
<br />
It makes consciousness a prison, as the physicist Otto Rossler sums up  
<br />
Descartes so well.
<br />
A last moment of existence? That could be wishful thinking.
<br />
<br />I don't like this feature of comp and of QM (Everett, SWE without  
<br />
collapse) at all, but then science is not wishful thinking, all right?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ;)  Oh, and happy holidays.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Happy holidays Anna, and thanks for posting. You seems to have a  
<br />
rather good intuition of mechanism, but you seem to be not aware that  
<br />
by using the digital hypothesis, such intuition can be made part of a  
<br />
theory which has many verifiable startling consequences. The theory  
<br />
has the advantage of not eliminating knowledge, persons,  
<br />
consciousness, and it has the advantage of explaining where matter  
<br />
comes from. And that theory can be shown wrong, and so permits us to  
<br />
progress.
<br />
<br />I hope I will have other opportunities to show how the  
<br />
computationalist or digital mechanist hypothesis is really an essence  
<br />
destructor, at the ontological level (indeed what really remains are  
<br />
numbers and arithmetical relations), all &quot;essence&quot; are  
<br />
&quot;phenomenologised&quot; through the possible &quot;number's discourses&quot; about  
<br />
their own discourses and silences.
