<br />I think you and I are living in two completely different argument-universes 
<br />
here. :) I'm not arguing that our universe is computable. I'm not arguing 
<br />
that our universe can definitely be modeled as a 4D cube. I'm not arguing 
<br />
that only integers exist. The only reason why I keep using CA models is 
<br />
that they're extraordinarily easy to picture and understand, *and*, since I 
<br />
believe that SASs can exist even in very simple computable universes like 
<br />
CAs, it makes sense to use CA models when trying to probe certain 
<br />
philosophical questions about SASs, physical existence, and instantiation. 
<br />
Quantum physics and the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle are simply 
<br />
irrelevant to the particular philosophical questions that I'm concerned with.
<br />
<br />Forget about our own (potentially non-computable) universe for a second. 
<br />
Surely you agree that we can imagine some large-but-finite 3+1D CA (it 
<br />
doesn't have to be anything like our own universe) in which the state of 
<br />
each bit is dependent on the states of neighboring bits one tick in the 
<br />
&quot;future&quot; as well as one tick in the &quot;past&quot;. Surely you agree that we could 
<br />
search through all the possible 4D cube bit-strings, discarding those that 
<br />
don't follow our rule. (This would take a Vast amount of computation, but 
<br />
that's irrelevant to the particular questions I'm interested in.) Some of 
<br />
the 4D cubes that we're left with will (assuming we've chosen a good rule 
<br />
for our CA) contain patterns that look all the world like SASs, moving 
<br />
through their world, reacting to their environment, having a sense of 
<br />
passing time, etc.
<br />
<br />This simple thought experiment generates some fascinating philosophical 
<br />
questions. Are those SASs actually conscious? If so, at what point did they 
<br />
become conscious? Was it at the moment that our testing algorithm decided 
<br />
that that particular 4D block followed our specified CA rule? Or is it 
<br />
later, when we &quot;animate&quot; portions of the 4D block so that we can watch 
<br />
events unfold in &quot;realtime&quot;? These are not rhetorical questions - I'd 
<br />
really like to hear your answers, because it might help me get a handle on 
<br />
your position. (I'd like to hear other people's answers as well, because I 
<br />
think it's a fascinating problem.)
<br />
<br />Anyway, the point that I'm really trying to make is that, while these 
<br />
thought experiments have a lot of bearing on the question of mathematical 
<br />
existence vs. physical existence, they have nothing at all to do with 
<br />
quantum physics or Heisenberg uncertainty. The fact it seems so to you 
<br />
makes me think that we're not even talking about the same problem.
