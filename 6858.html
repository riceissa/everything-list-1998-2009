<br />
Lee,
<br />
<br />Your comments touch on important issues. Having read the article on your web 
<br />
page I think we may basically agree but there are some differences. If you 
<br />
look at it from a third person perspective, continuity of personal identity 
<br />
over time is not only a delusion but a rather strange and inconsistent 
<br />
delusion. Nevertheless, in the manner of delusions, realising this 
<br />
intellectually does not make the delusion any less real at the &quot;gut&quot; level 
<br />
of first person experience. Using my example where I am to be copied 10 
<br />
times tomorrow and one copy tortured, I view this as a 10% chance that I 
<br />
will be tortured tomorrow. You point out that this is not really correct: 
<br />
there is a 100% chance that one copy of me will be tortured and a 0% chance 
<br />
that the other 9 copies will be tortured, and all 10 copies have an equal 
<br />
claim to being &quot;me&quot;. This is the objective truth, but that doesn't make me 
<br />
feel any differently about the matter. I still feel that there is a 10% 
<br />
chance I will be tortured, and I still feel relieved that I am one of the 
<br />
lucky copies when tomorrow comes and I am not tortured. There is an 
<br />
inconsistency here in that today I identify with all the copies and tomorrow 
<br />
I identify with only one, but so what? As you say, that is how our minds 
<br />
have evolved.
<br />
<br />If the experiences of the copy who is to be tortured will eventually be 
<br />
merged with those of the non-tortured copies, that changes the situation, 
<br />
because then it is *guaranteed* that I will eventually experience the 
<br />
torture. I would worry similarly if I were to inherit the experiences of any 
<br />
unrelated third person; the fact that it is other copies of me who are 
<br />
suffering does not in itself make any selfish difference.
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The same is true here. It must follow from the laws of physics (which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; include the effects of simulations) that there are indeed many more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of you at t2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, we can say that there are more *copies*, i.e. more instantiations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and that these provide altogether more runtime at t2 (whatever X is).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In dealing with this type of problem you have to consider not only the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physics, which I'm sure you understand much better than I do, but also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; psychology of how the first person experience of being a unique 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; persisting through time is constructed from observer moment building 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;blocks.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, nature would naturally construct creatures that looked at it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this way. It would not do, for example, for a lion to have other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than a single memory stream that described his current environment,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and, to the degree it is useful, how he got there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is not as obvious as may first appear; specifically, it does not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;follow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in general that more copies/ greater measure at time t = more likely to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience time t. The important thing to keep in mind is that each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; individual experiences only one OM at a time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As I say it, one is *certain* to experience time t under your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hypothesis. I consider whether one experiences time t to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an objective question: an examination of, say, the solar system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;during a certain interval (Jan 2006 to Dec 2006) reveals that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;either Stathis got runtime there or he didn't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But &quot;only one OM at a time&quot;?  No, not if we are speaking of time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the objective sense: again, a piecemeal examination of a certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;region of space could easily show that Stathis is running at two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;separate locations even at the same time t1.  In fact, one possibility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is that Stathis(X1, t1) has the same OM as Stathis(X2, t1).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If I consider the future, then there is a potential that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could &quot;become&quot; any of the many OM's who consider me to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in their past.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I suggest that it is better to drop the language of probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;here. It is *certain* that you will become all the Stathis's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of 2006. You will be some of them in greater measure than others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; However, when I arrive at the future, and also when I remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the past, I consider myself to be unique. All the other OM's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which from a third person perspective are other versions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;me&quot; (and this third person perspective includes me looking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at my potential futures) from my perspective are completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; separate people.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would say that they are separate instances, but not separate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;people. (A corollary from the usual belief that we are the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person from day to day even though our memories, obviously, are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not identical.) You are the same person that you were yesterday,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and tomorrow you will be the same person you are today, unless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we do great violence to what we mean by &quot;person&quot;.  Derek Parfit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot; (1986) analyses this in great detail,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;along with Mike Perry in &quot;Forever For All&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So if I am told that tomorrow I will be copied ten times and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one of these copies will be tortured, I am worried, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that means there is a 1/10 chance I will be tortured.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Good example, but I would say that you will be tortured with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;100% probability at some places, and tortured with 0% probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at nine others. The characterization of a piece of matter &quot;Stathis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is undergoing torture&quot; is looked upon from the 3rd person as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entirely physically characterized objective process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But when tomorrow comes and I am not the torture victim, I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relieved, because it is someone else who is suffering, and I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; feel sorry for him in the way I feel sorry for suffering strangers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I suggest that this is not the correct, selfish way that you should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;look at it. It's just the same as in MWI when there &quot;really is&quot; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;version of you who saw the other outcome. He's you. I have a so-called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proof of this proposition at <a href="http://www.leecorbin.com/dupproof.html">http://www.leecorbin.com/dupproof.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What this means is that if you trace an individual's history from his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;birth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to his ultimate demise (which may never come, if QTI is correct), at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; time point he is associated with only *one* OM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps my insistence wherever possible of describing what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happening in our universe from the 3rd person is responsible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for our different ways of talking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Two or more individuals may share two or more OM's at some point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in their life, for example when a duplication occurs, but from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the point of view of each of them, they still only experience one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; OM at a time for their entire life history. Two OM's may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; also &quot;combine&quot; in one of two ways: either a third OM exists with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;content
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the other two, or they do not really combine but a later OM has the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; memory of having been both in the past. The one OM per time point for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; individual rule is maintained.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The conclusion from the above is that the absolute measure of an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at any time point, from that individual's point of view, is unity. When
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; looking into the future, the other copies in the multiverse do matter, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in this case it is the relative measure of different outcomes rather 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the absolute measure which is important. Once the future becomes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;present,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the other copies from the first person perspective are just other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;people.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, we aren't yet used to having more than one of us around
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at any given time. Perhaps our gut feelings on this issue will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;change when the technology allows duplicates. I, for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would never dream of regarding my duplicate as another person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;He's me, just running at a different location. (Just as, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;example, my future and past selves are also me, just running
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at different times.)
