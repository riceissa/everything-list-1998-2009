<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Universal Dovetailer Argument (UDA) *is* the proof that physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is reducible to computer science. The proof is informal, non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical, yet complete in itself.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I got indeed sort of quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logics, and I take this as a confirmation (not a proof) of comp. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; results has recently been generalized for large portion of non-comp!
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But it does rather make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the presupposition that physics and all its applications are to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; grounded in old quasirationalist values.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is debatable. To put it roughly, I show that if comp is true,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then we must backtrack 2300 years of Aristotelian Naturalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In short Plato is correct and Aristotle is wrong, as far as we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; look on their conception of reality.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point is really that physics is a branch of computer science, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even just number theory.
</em><br />
<br />I think I see what you are saying here.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In what sense does quantum suicide eliminate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual consciousness? I thought the point is that it does not.
</em><br />
<br />There are by now a lot of papers on that subject, and many views.
<br />
I am trying to write up a further step at this time.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  There are so many intermediary conditions between life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and death  that exist or are manmade.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but you need to be conscious of them in some way to talk about,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and in that case they cannot be 1-death or 1-loss-of-consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (by definition!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I see what you are saying, I think. I do think that a more detailed
<br />
consideration of the fine structure of individual cases might be
<br />
necessary to be sure of that. And I am still very dubious about
<br />
Tegmark's original argument anyway, though it has now had its form
<br />
varied in many ways - to cases of multiple suicide, quick suicide
<br />
etc. etc. A lot still to be done.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There is a lot more that can be written on the topic. Some claim a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; similar effect occurs with 'lucid dreaming' as well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that &quot;Conscience et Mécanisme&quot; contains a full chapter on lucid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dreaming. But in the more recent work I have substituted it for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use of video (a-la &quot;matrix&quot;) in the reasoning because the notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lucid dreaming is not yet well understood by the average scientists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And this despite lucid dreaming has been clarified and confirmed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experimentally by the famous (independent) experiments of Hearne
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and LaBerge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I'll read it then, though I would have been happier with an English
<br />
rendition.
<br />
<br />I have found that many psychological phenomena like 'lucid dreaming'
<br />
tend to disappear when you look at them in detail, but then reappear
<br />
when someone else studies them. The case that I usually refer to on
<br />
that is the Perky effect which has a long and varied history. (I think
<br />
it
<br />
is now out of favour but the point is that results are not as clear
<br />
cut
<br />
sometimes as we would like. The same is often true in very important
<br />
physics experiments but these are usually a little easier to clarify).
<br />
But
<br />
bearing that fact in mind, I can see why you went over to a video
<br />
version, but I am far from sure that that may not be an unfortunate
<br />
many to few mapping, which may bring omissions etc.Because
<br />
obviously the video camera is not directly equivalent to the human
<br />
eye and brain.
