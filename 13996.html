Many thanks! I'll give my current attitudes to your hints:
<br />
<br />Bruno:
<br />
<br />You mentioned the ASSA. Yesterday, motivdated by your hint, I have
<br />
read about the ASSA/RSSA debate that is said to have divided the list
<br />
into two camps. Since I have trouble with the reasoning I read, I will
<br />
probably send a new message hoping for leaving the misunderstanding
<br />
behind.
<br />
Searching for the Universal Dovetailer Argument, I found a quite
<br />
formal demonstration that you wrote in the list, and an even more
<br />
formal demonstration that you published in the original work. I do see
<br />
the advantage to have such a formal demonstration when it comes to
<br />
detailed discussions, but sometimes I'd prefer a simplified outline to
<br />
get the basic idea and the main conclusions before going into detail.
<br />
If you have written such an outline (in English or in French as well)
<br />
I would be thankful to get the link. Otherwise I'll read one of the
<br />
formal versions in the future.
<br />
<br />Hal (and partially Russell):
<br />
<br />I still like your approach to the Everything ensemble using a
<br />
countable set P of 'properties'. In fact, if we describe any object or
<br />
world by a sequence of properties, the objects form a set equivalent
<br />
to {0,1}^P (e.g. we assign 0 if the object does not have the property
<br />
and 1 if it has the property) which is the power set of P
<br />
(equivalently we could have formed subsets of P). Since P is
<br />
countable, we can work with the Everything ensemble {0,1}^IN of
<br />
infinite bitstrings. As you have mentioned, this set is uncountable.
<br />
So far, there isn't any mathematical problem. In contrast to Marc, I
<br />
do also agree identifying objects with the corresponding subset of P.
<br />
In this picture, &quot;states and behaviours&quot; as Marc calls it, must also
<br />
lie in the properties. Thus, the term 'property' is used in a more
<br />
comprehensive sense than in programming.
<br />
But now, we come to much more serious criticism. Russell noticed that
<br />
regarding the ensemble of infinite bitstrings to be based on
<br />
properties jumbles the ensemble (a simple mathematical entity) with
<br />
interpretations by the observer. His separation between &quot;syntactic&quot;
<br />
and &quot;semantic&quot; space is essential. I agree with Russell, but I do also
<br />
see the necessity to interpret (not in an exact sense) mathematical
<br />
entities in our theories within our &quot;everyday theory&quot;; because this is
<br />
what makes a mathematical theory a (meta)physical theory as I have
<br />
pointed out. Russell also uses such an interpretation, but on a more
<br />
implicit level: An observer reads bits of the world's description. In
<br />
order to make this a (meta)physical theory, we must be able to find
<br />
ourselves within the theory, namely as observers. So, we must know
<br />
what the process of reading bits of the word's description is meaning
<br />
for us. And I'd say that it means measuring 'properties' of the world.
<br />
<br />To give a concise explanation: Properties should not be a fundamental
<br />
ingredient to the mathematical theory. The mathematical theory uses
<br />
&quot;syntactic&quot; space. Though, in order to understand the mathematical
<br />
theory by means of the everyday theory (and thus to link the
<br />
mathematical theory to &quot;concrete reality&quot;), we need (at some point of
<br />
our theories) a translation. This translation can possibly be done by
<br />
interpreting the ensemble via 'properties'. Conversely, we can
<br />
motivate the ensemble of infinite bitstrings (ant thus &quot;syntactic&quot;
<br />
space) starting from a countable set of 'properties'.
<br />
<br />Maybe it would be the best for your theories, Hal, to interrupt after
<br />
having motivated the ensemble of infinite bitstrings. Then, the
<br />
infinite bitstrings are considered to be fundamental (and no longer
<br />
the properties themselves). Russell (and surely others, too) has
<br />
provided a good framework to work with this ensemble and the role of
<br />
observers. Perhaps, you can try to translate some of your ideas to
<br />
Russell's more strict and formal language. Then, it will be easier for
<br />
us to follow your thinking.
<br />
<br />Marc:
<br />
<br />Thank you very much for the definitions. I did not know how this was
<br />
commonly called.
<br />
<br />Brent:
<br />
<br />I do still defend extensional definitions even for infinite sets.
<br />
Mathematics shows how useful this is. I come back to the example of a
<br />
real function f that maps every real number to another real number. In
<br />
mathematics, this function is defined by the infinite set {(x,f(x)); x
<br />
being a real number}. And the space of all these functions has very
<br />
nice mathematical properties, we can work with it and prove theorems.
<br />
Of course, in practice I will not have the set but merely a formula
<br />
defining f. For example f(x)=x+1. But this does not disprove the
<br />
possibilty of working with the sets on an abstract level. Mathematics
<br />
indeed proves that it is possible.
<br />
<br />Your second point, Russell's (&quot;Bertie's&quot;) paradox, is much more
<br />
striking. In fact, if we allow every property the English (or the
<br />
German, following Cantor) language can express, we will end up with
<br />
contradictions. This is why the set of properties is somehow
<br />
restricted. We need, as I wrote, &quot;a set of distinct and independent
<br />
properties&quot;. I don't really know if such a postulate makes sense.
