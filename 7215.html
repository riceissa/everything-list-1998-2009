<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything there is to know.  There is no further question of &quot;which

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one will &gt;I&lt; be&quot;?  This is simply a situation which pushes the folk

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of &quot;I&quot; past its breaking point; we don't need to posit any  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of dualism to paper over it, we just have to revise our concept  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of &quot;I&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />I agree that this view makes sense.  We come up with all these mind
<br />
bending and paradoxical thought experiments, and even though everyone
<br />
agrees about every fact of the third-person experience, no one can agree
<br />
on what it means from the first person perspective.  Maybe, then, there
<br />
is no &quot;fact of the matter&quot; to agree on, with regard to the first person.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, in a world where Star Trek transporters were common,
<br />
it seems likely that most people would carry over their conventional views
<br />
about continuity of identity to the use of this technology.  Once they
<br />
have gone through it a few times, and have memories of having done so,
<br />
it won't seem much different from other forms of transportation.
<br />
<br />Copies seem a little more problematic.  We're pretty cavalier about
<br />
creating and destroying them in our thought experiments, but the social
<br />
implications of copies are enormous and I suspect that people's views
<br />
about the nature of copying would not be as simple as we sometimes assume.
<br />
<br />I doubt that many people would be indifferent between the choice of
<br />
having a 50-50 chance of being teleported to Moscow or Washington, vs
<br />
having copies made which wake up in both cities.  The practical effects
<br />
would be enormously different.  And as I wrote before, I suspect that
<br />
these practical differences are not to be swept under the rug, but point
<br />
to fundamental metaphysical differences between the two situations.
