<br />David Shoemaker, /Personal Identity and Ethics: A Brief Introduction/,
<br />
Broadview Press, 2009, 296pp., $26.95 (pbk), ISBN 9781551118826.
<br />
<br />*Reviewed by Amy Kind, Claremont McKenna College*
<br />
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Although there are many excellent texts dealing with the metaphysics of
<br />
personal identity, Shoemaker's /Personal Identity and Ethics/ is the
<br />
first book I know to tackle in such an extended way the question of the
<br />
relationship between personal identity and our practical concerns. It is
<br />
a very welcome addition to the philosophical literature. While even
<br />
experts on the subject of personal identity will undoubtedly learn
<br />
something new from this rich discussion, I expect the book's primary use
<br />
will be in undergraduate (and perhaps graduate) classes, and its
<br />
exceptionally clear presentation of some very thorny issues makes it an
<br />
excellent choice for this purpose.
<br />
<br />Shoemaker has divided his discussion of the relationship between
<br />
personal identity and our practical concerns into two broad parts. The
<br />
first half of the book focuses on our self-regarding practical concerns.
<br />
Which theories of personal identity make it rational for us to
<br />
anticipate an afterlife? More generally, when is it rational for someone
<br />
to anticipate, or have self-regarding concern about, a future
<br />
experience? The second half of the book focuses on other-regarding
<br />
practical concerns. What light can theories of personal identity shed on
<br />
ethical issues at the beginning of life, such as abortion, genetic
<br />
intervention, and the creation of life through cloning? What light can
<br />
they shed on ethical issues at the end of life, such as the legitimacy
<br />
of advance directives? What can they tell us about the proper treatment
<br />
(or &quot;cure&quot;) in cases of multiple personalities? What role should
<br />
theories of personal identity play in our assessment of moral
<br />
responsibility? What is the relationship between personal identity and
<br />
ethical theory, and in particular, do certain theories of personal
<br />
identity make certain ethical theories more plausible?
<br />
<br />Shoemaker's first chapter focuses on the question of whether an
<br />
individual can survive the death of her body, and he frames his
<br />
discussion around John Perry's /Dialogues Concerning Personal Identity
<br />
and Immortality/. (Those adopting Shoemaker's book for classroom use
<br />
would likely want to assign these /Dialogues /along with it.) He also
<br />
introduces four different theories of personal identity -- the Soul
<br />
Criterion, the Body Criterion, the Memory Criterion, and the Brain-Based
<br />
Memory Criterion -- each of which is ultimately dismissed as inadequate.
<br />
Though Shoemaker argues that the last three views suffer from serious
<br />
problems that prevent them from being plausible accounts of our identity
<br />
over time, he offers a different sort of argument against the Soul
<br />
Criterion: There are good practical reasons to &quot;insist on a tight
<br />
connection between the nature of personal identity and our practical
<br />
concerns, and thus reject any theory of personal identity -- like the
<br />
Soul Criterion -- that denies this connection.&quot; (33) Even if souls
<br />
exist, we lack any kind of epistemic access to them; rather, we
<br />
reidentify individuals in terms of their bodies and/or their
<br />
psychologies. Thus, souls are irrelevant to the practical issues under
<br />
consideration, and this irrelevance is taken to justify the rejection of
<br />
the Soul Criterion. Whether we're right to insist on such a tight
<br />
connection between the nature of personal identity and our practical
<br />
concerns is a question that recurs throughout the book, but which
<br />
Shoemaker addresses in the concluding chapter. I'll return to this issue
<br />
below.
<br />
<br />In the second chapter, which deals primarily with the problem of when we
<br />
can rationally have self-regarding concern about a future experience,
<br />
Shoemaker discusses what he takes to be the &quot;two most sophisticated
<br />
theories of personal identity on offer&quot; (112): the Psychological
<br />
Criterion and the Biological Criterion, often called /Animalism/. Like
<br />
the book as a whole, this chapter is admirably clear as it rehearses the
<br />
standard considerations for and against each of the two views. Having
<br />
argued that proponents of these criteria end up in a kind of stand-off
<br />
-- each view faces a set of problems that are overall roughly equal in
<br />
seriousness -- Shoemaker uses the third chapter to introduce two
<br />
alternative approaches: the Narrative Identity Criterion and the
<br />
Identity Doesn't Matter view (IDM).
<br />
<br />Unlike the previous theories considered, the Narrative Identity
<br />
Criterion proposed by Marya Schechtman aims to explain what makes an
<br />
individual who she is rather than to offer a theory of her numerical
<br />
identity over time. On this view, an experience or action can be
<br />
properly attributed to an individual only if it is correctly
<br />
incorporated into the self-told story of her life. This criterion seems
<br />
tailor-made to account for our rational anticipation and self-concern;
<br />
as Shoemaker puts it, &quot;rational anticipation requires the kind of
<br />
personhood and psychological unity that only narrative identity
<br />
delivers.&quot; (95) However, Shoemaker suggests that the Narrative Identity
<br />
Criterion fails to account for other practical concerns, such as our
<br />
ability to reidentify other individuals, and sometimes has trouble even
<br />
accounting adequately for rational anticipation and self-concern. When I
<br />
am concerned about whether I will survive a medical procedure, for
<br />
example, I may want to know whether whoever wakes up from that procedure
<br />
will be /me/, a question that seems to depend on numerical identity.
<br />
Finally, Shoemaker also suggests that the Narrative Identity Criterion
<br />
suffers from some fundamental unclarities, for example, whether it is
<br />
meant to be a prescriptive or descriptive theory. So, while he deems
<br />
this alternative to traditional theories of personal identity worthy of
<br />
our continued consideration, the view appears to face its own set of
<br />
problems which are as serious as those of the Psychological Criterion or
<br />
the Biological Criterion.
<br />
<br />Shoemaker reaches a similar conclusion about IDM, Derek Parfit's view
<br />
that what matters for survival is not identity but rather psychological
<br />
continuity. Unlike identity, psychological continuity is not a 1:1
<br />
relation; an individual at time t1 may be psychologically continuous
<br />
with two individuals at time t2. But, as Shoemaker explains, the IDM
<br />
view claims that it can be rational for the first individual to
<br />
anticipate both of the two later individuals' experiences, even though
<br />
the first individual will be identical to neither of them:
<br />
<br />What matters in ordinary survival -- what I look forward to in
<br />
day-to-day survival -- is that the person who wakes up in my bed, say,
<br />
will remember my life, act on my intentions, see and approach the world
<br />
as I would have, love and take care of the things I love and take care
<br />
of, and so forth. And whether or not there is one person or there are
<br />
two people who will do this is -- at least to some extent --
<br />
unimportant. (107-8)
<br />
<br />Furthermore, because psychological continuity comes in degrees, the IDM
<br />
view implies that our practical concerns themselves may be matters of
<br />
degree. For example, a teenager likely has considerably more
<br />
psychological continuity with her middle-aged self than with her
<br />
retirement-age self, so according to the IDM view, she should care more
<br />
about her middle-aged self. Following Mark Johnston, Shoemaker
<br />
criticizes the IDM view for this radical implication. The IDM view is
<br />
motivated in large part by consideration of fission cases, which we
<br />
never confront in real life. Thus, though there might be possible
<br />
situations in which identity doesn't matter, given the actual situation
<br />
in which we find ourselves, it seems reasonable for us to ground our
<br />
practical concerns in facts about numerical identity.
<br />
<br />The subsequent chapters on other-regarding concerns in the second half
<br />
of the book suggest, however, that Shoemaker does not find this
<br />
objection compelling. More generally, although Shoemaker aims to remain
<br />
neutral throughout the book about which of the four contending theories
<br />
(the Psychological Criterion, the Biological Criterion, the Narrative
<br />
Criterion, and the IDM view) we should adopt, his discussion at times
<br />
seems to betray a sympathy for the IDM view. In Chapters Four and Five,
<br />
for example, after surveying various ethical issues concerning the
<br />
beginning of life, Shoemaker reaches the tentative conclusion that
<br />
whichever metaphysical theory turns out to be correct, there are no
<br />
identity-based objections to the morality of practices such as abortion,
<br />
stem cell research, genetic intervention, or cloning. This finding
<br />
relates to a general strategic approach he cautiously recommends for
<br />
dealing with ethical issues: &quot;we might get more traction in applying
<br />
metaphysics to morality if we perhaps focused less on identity per se
<br />
and more on the direct psychological and physical relations in which
<br />
identity might consist.&quot; (173) This strategy seems directly to favor the
<br />
IDM view.
<br />
<br />Consider also his rebuttal of Don Marquis' influential anti-abortion
<br />
argument. On Marquis' view, the wrongness of killing an individual can
<br />
be explained in terms of the value that her future has to her; he then
<br />
argues that abortion is morally impermissible because a fetus has a
<br />
valuable future just as we do. Against this, Shoemaker suggests we can
<br />
best understand the value of an individual's future in terms of facts
<br />
about her psychological continuity with her future self. In looking
<br />
ahead to the future, I want someone to exist who is psychologically
<br />
continuous with me -- who remembers my experiences, who will care about
<br />
and carry out my current plans, and so on. Whether or not I am identical
<br />
to that person is less important than whether she bears the right
<br />
psychological relations to me. But if what matters for having a valuable
<br />
future is psychological continuity, then fetuses cannot have valuable
<br />
futures like ours; since they lack basic psychological capacities, they
<br />
cannot have any psychological continuers. Thus, according to Shoemaker,
<br />
Marquis' argument fails. Importantly, however, Shoemaker's discussion
<br />
relies on intuitions about various hypothetical fission cases to
<br />
motivate his claim about what makes our futures valuable, and someone
<br />
disinclined to accept the IDM view might not share his intuitions about
<br />
the fission cases -- or might, like Johnston, worry that these
<br />
intuitions do not generalize. Though I myself am inclined to agree with
<br />
Shoemaker's general line of response to Marquis, I do not always share
<br />
his intuitions about the cases he uses to motivate this response, and I
<br />
thus wish the discussion did not rely so heavily on those cases.
<br />
<br />Chapter Six, which takes up questions about the legitimacy of advance
<br />
directives and about the proper way to treat Dissociative Identity
<br />
Disorder (DID), is to my mind one of the richest in the book. As
<br />
Shoemaker himself notes, when DID is invoked in discussions of personal
<br />
identity, it is usually in the context of the &quot;one body/one person&quot;
<br />
principle. The distinct personalities of someone with DID, which may
<br />
seem to correspond to distinct persons, pose a challenge to this
<br />
principle. Shoemaker takes up a related but different issue, namely,
<br />
that if these multiple personalities are distinct persons, then certain
<br />
kinds of psychiatric treatments seem to be morally questionable.
<br />
Attempts to eliminate some of the personalities, or even to integrate
<br />
them, might be akin to murder. In Shoemaker's discussion of this issue,
<br />
he manages to navigate through some difficult philosophical terrain
<br />
without getting unnecessarily bogged down, and also without
<br />
oversimplifying. I can easily see the material on DID stimulating lively
<br />
conversation in an undergraduate class, perhaps in conjunction with the
<br />
material on the Christine Beauchamp case in Kathleen Wilkes' /Real
<br />
Persons/ (which Shoemaker cites). I expect the discussion of advance
<br />
directives would likewise make for compelling classroom dialogue. Though
<br />
most of us share the strong intuition that an individual has the moral
<br />
authority to dictate the terms of her future medical treatment, it turns
<br />
out to be enormously difficult to find the grounds for that moral
<br />
authority. Shoemaker's treatment of the issue does an excellent job of
<br />
making this difficulty vivid.
<br />
<br />This chapter also raises an intriguing methodological question --
<br />
namely, what role our moral intuitions should play in our evaluation of
<br />
theories of personal identity. If a theory of personal identity cannot
<br />
account for our intuition about the moral permissibility of advance
<br />
directives, for example, then does this count against the theory? Or, if
<br />
we have a theory that otherwise does quite well in accounting for
<br />
personal identity, should we re-evaluate our intuition about advance
<br />
directives? This general methodological question about the role of
<br />
intuitions (which arises again in Chapter Eight, &quot;Personal Identity and
<br />
Ethical Theory&quot;) relates to another intriguing methodological question
<br />
that recurs throughout the book, arising most prominently in Shoemaker's
<br />
discussion of moral responsibility in Chapter Seven: &quot;should we simply
<br />
try to account for our practices as they are, or should we insist that
<br />
our practices must depend on the metaphysical truth, whatever that turns
<br />
out to be?&quot; (238) These methodological questions, having been explicitly
<br />
set aside for most of the book, are finally taken up in the concluding
<br />
chapter, &quot;Notes on Method.&quot; To my mind, however, this chapter falls a
<br />
bit short of expectations. Given the importance of these methodological
<br />
questions to the enterprise in which Shoemaker is involved, I had hoped
<br />
that he would be able to provide more of a defense of his own
<br />
methodological assumptions -- why, for example, certain intuitions that
<br />
we have about practical concerns are treated as virtually untouchable.
<br />
<br />It turns out that when we try to clarify our intuitions, as Shoemaker
<br />
himself recognizes, they may turn out to be inconsistent -- or, even if
<br />
they can be made consistent, it is still hard to see how they could all
<br />
be compatible with a single theory of personal identity, or indeed, with
<br />
a single theory of the relation between personal identity and ethics. I
<br />
would have thought that this is a reason to reevaluate these intuitions,
<br />
i.e., that we have compelling grounds to give some of them up, even if
<br />
they are deeply held. But Shoemaker draws a different, and to my mind,
<br />
surprising conclusion. In his view, we should adopt pluralism about the
<br />
relation between identity and ethics, that is, we should accept &quot;that
<br />
there is no single relation between identity and ethics, but instead
<br />
there are multiple relations, each depending on the methodological
<br />
approach one takes to the relation.&quot; (283) If I understand what he means
<br />
by this, however, it implies that there is no single correct criterion
<br />
of personal identity. Rather, the question of numerical identity -- &quot;is
<br />
X at time t1 identical to Y at time t2?&quot; -- is ambiguous; sometimes we
<br />
mean X and Y qua agents, sometimes X and Y qua human animals, etc.
<br />
Different practical concerns require us to read the question in
<br />
different ways.
<br />
<br />In his brief defense of pluralism, Shoemaker acknowledges that the view
<br />
&quot;is all fairly complicated, messy, and disunified.&quot; But, as he says, &quot;it
<br />
could well be that the truth about the relation between personal
<br />
identity and ethics, like persons themselves, is complicated, messy, and
<br />
disunified.&quot; (284) Though I recognize that we cannot always clean up the
<br />
philosophical messes in which we find ourselves, I think we must be sure
<br />
not to give up too easily. Particularly in light of the many instances
<br />
throughout the book where the messy issues were explicitly put on hold
<br />
until the final chapter, I had high expectations for the methodological
<br />
discussion -- expectations that unfortunately were not met. I should be
<br />
clear, however, that my disappointment with the concluding chapter does
<br />
not alter my opinion that the book as a whole is an excellent treatment
<br />
of the relationship between personal identity and ethics, and one that I
<br />
would highly recommend to any professor looking for a textbook for a
<br />
class addressing these issues.
