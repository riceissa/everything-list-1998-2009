<br />
Causality is a fascinating topic and one I hope to learn more about,
<br />
perhaps via the Pearl book Tim mentioned or another that someone might
<br />
recommend.  Here are some very random and disorganized thoughts on the
<br />
topic.
<br />
<br />Googling on &quot;causality&quot; led to a brief web page that summarized
<br />
2000 years of philosophical thought in a few paragraphs,
<br />
<a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~mqsalo/documents/causalit.htm">http://www.helsinki.fi/~mqsalo/documents/causalit.htm</a>.  Generally there
<br />
seem to be two schools of thought; one is that causality is an artifact
<br />
of our minds' efforts to understand and interpret the world; the other
<br />
is that causality has objective reality.
<br />
<br />The modern philosopher's definition of causality has always struck me as
<br />
somewhat backwards: &quot;The cause of any event is a preceding event without
<br />
which the event in question would not have occurred.&quot;  This means that
<br />
&quot;A causes B&quot; is equivalent to A happening before B, plus the logical
<br />
proposition, &quot;if B then A&quot;.  You'd think that A causes B would mean &quot;if
<br />
A then B&quot;.  But philosophers interpret it to mean &quot;if not-A then not-B&quot;,
<br />
as stated above (I've read this elsewhere also), which is equivalent to
<br />
&quot;if B then A&quot;.
<br />
<br />So if we say &quot;heavy rains cause flooding&quot; we mean that if there were no
<br />
heavy rains then there would be no flooding; or equivalently, if there
<br />
is flooding then there must have been heavy rains.  This is consistent
<br />
with there being heavy rains and no flooding.  It really doesn't make
<br />
sense to me.
<br />
<br />The problem with judging causality is the well known cautionary rule
<br />
that &quot;correlation is not causation&quot;.  Just because A and B always
<br />
occur together, and A comes before B, that doesn't mean that A causes B.
<br />
This is a common danger that scientific researchers have to guard against.
<br />
It's easy to observe correlation but hard to determine what is the
<br />
true cause.  This is a reason to view causality as just a matter of our
<br />
perceptions.
<br />
<br />A strange aspect of causality is that to a large degree our laws of
<br />
physics appear to be time symmetric.  This means that you can reverse the
<br />
time sequence of events and get a physically valid (although possibly
<br />
unlikely) scenario.  If that is so, then if A causes B in the forward
<br />
direction, can we with equal validity say that B causes A when we look
<br />
at things backwards?  In that case the causal roles are fundamentally
<br />
arbitrary.
<br />
<br />Of course in most situations we have a strong arrow of time based on
<br />
the growth of entropy which allows us to break this apparent symmetry.
<br />
But this is not always the case.  Systems in thermodynamic equilibrium,
<br />
if considered in isolation, have no arrow of time.  We can look at a
<br />
microscopic part of such a system and see fluctuations which appear to
<br />
be describable in causal terms.  For example, a temporary void forms
<br />
randomly, causing matter at the edges to move towards the center.
<br />
Or in reverse we say that matter moved away from the center, causing a
<br />
void to form.  Both are equally valid ways of describing the situation,
<br />
indicating that there is no true causality.
<br />
<br />The real mystery is why our physical laws are time symmetric.  A priori
<br />
it does not seem to be absolutely necessary for life to evolve.  I mean,
<br />
of all sets of physical laws that allow life to evolve, will most be
<br />
time symmetric?  I'm not aware of any reason why this should be the case.
<br />
<br />One final point regarding causality.  Although it seems to be more
<br />
a matter of metaphysics than physics, there are some places where
<br />
people take causality to be a fundamental part of physical reality.
<br />
Specifically, this is done in some theories of consciousness.
<br />
<br />Functionalists adopt essentially the view that Bruno calls COMP,
<br />
that consciousness is a computational phenomenon and any system which
<br />
implements the corresponding computation will be conscious.  This is
<br />
the foundation for ideas of &quot;uploading&quot;, that is, brain simulation by
<br />
computer.  Functionalists believe such simulations are conscious in the
<br />
same way that the brain was, provided that the simulation is performing
<br />
the same computation that the brain did.
<br />
<br />This then raises the question of whether a particular physical system
<br />
(like a computer) is implementing a particular computation (which is
<br />
an abstract program, perhaps expressed in some computing language).
<br />
Surprisingly, this is a difficult and yet unsolved question in philosophy.
<br />
No one has ever come up with a widely accepted, hard and fast rule or
<br />
procedure to decide whether a physical system is implementing a given
<br />
computation.
<br />
<br />Broadly speaking, the basic approach is to set up a mapping or
<br />
correspondence between aspects of the physical system and aspects
<br />
of the abstract computation.  For example, with today's computers
<br />
the registers and memory elements work by holding electrical charge.
<br />
One could map these charge concentrations to values of variables in
<br />
the abstract representation of the computation and there would be a
<br />
good correspondence.
<br />
<br />This works well in this case, but there are two problems.  The first is
<br />
that it does not capture the causal nature of the program.  A computer
<br />
which was not actually computing, but just playing back a recorded pattern
<br />
of charge distributions, would successfully satisfy the mapping.  I'll say
<br />
more about this in a moment.  The second problem is that by making the
<br />
mapping more elaborate, one can show that simple, even trivial systems
<br />
are implementing complex computations; essentially you do all the work
<br />
in the mapping.  It's hard to set up a concrete rule for how complex
<br />
the mapping can be, and I don't believe anyone has succeeded in this yet.
<br />
<br />But the more relevant problem for now is the issue of causality.
<br />
Most functionalist philosophers believe that for a physical system to be
<br />
truly implementing a computation, it must include all of the causality
<br />
of that computation and not just &quot;passively&quot; reproduce the patterns.
<br />
When we apply this rule to the functionalist model of consciousness, it
<br />
works out like this: if a system has the right causality, it is conscious;
<br />
if it is only passive, it is not conscious.
<br />
<br />This elevates causality to having a functional role in the physical world!
<br />
It makes the difference between a system having a mind and just being an
<br />
elaborate tape recorder.  It means that we cannot view causality as just
<br />
an artifact of our perceptions, it must be a true element of reality.
<br />
That would put significant constraints on how philosophers treat the
<br />
concept of causality.
<br />
<br />Anyway, these are some of the issues and musings which make causality
<br />
of great interest to me.  I hope to learn more about it in the next
<br />
few years.
