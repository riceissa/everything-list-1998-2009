<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be solved.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	First of all, I don't think a string can give rise to

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness.  It doesn't seem to have the right sort of structure.  To
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; some degree it's a matter of personal intuition, and some people have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; same kind of problem with computationalism as dealing only with math and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not being able to give rise to consciousness.  While I can convince myself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that a computation, with its decision making and counterfactuals, can do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the trick, I find it harder to believe that a mere string can.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's a central insight of computer science that any discrete structure can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be encoded as a binary string. You haven't told me what your definition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;a computation&quot; is yet, but if it is a discrete structure than it too can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be encoded as a binary string. Therefore the real question is not whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a string can give rise to consciousness, but rather whether &quot;a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation&quot; (whatever that means in this context) can give rise to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness and whether a brain/AI state can give rise to consciousness. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As far as I can see there is no reason why a brain/AI state cannot give
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rise to consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I basically have told you the definition, as well as referred you
<br />
to my web page for a more detailed discussion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A computation involves a set of states, labeled by one or more
<br />
indices, with state transition rules between them.  A trace of the
<br />
computation occurs when it starts out in one state, transits to the next
<br />
state indicated by the rules, and so on.  A physical system implements
<br />
such a trace when there is a legitimate mapping from the physical states
<br />
to the formal states, such that the states mapped to perform the trace.
<br />
The unsolved problem is which mappings are legitimate and reflect the
<br />
information in the physical system, and which are illegitimate and
<br />
artificially introduce too much information.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a string lacks is the state transition laws.  There is no way
<br />
that what the concept of 'if ... then' refers to can be a property of a
<br />
string.  A string just is what it is; counterfactuals have no meaning for
<br />
it.  A physical system has not only functions like x(t) and y(x), it has
<br />
laws of nature such as x(t+1) = y(x(t)), and computations reflect that
<br />
very important aspect of nature, dynamics.  Note that a law must be a true
<br />
equation, but a true equation is just a coincidence, a mere fact (even if
<br />
it holds for all x,y,t) unless it is a law.  Laws are prescriptive, not
<br />
descriptive, unlike information; they make decisions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	Second, I am not at all convinced that P1 would have the structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that you mentioned.  The second part - finding the brain state - would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; require a huge amount of code.  It might be more efficient to create a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bunch of neural nets, let them interact and breed for a while, and print
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; out their state once they show some sign of having evolved an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intelligence, for example.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think that would work. The subroutine for recognizing intelligence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must itself be intelligent, otherwise you will only get a bunch of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neural nets that evolved/learned to fool the detection subroutine (for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example by spitting out nonsense sentences that are grammatically correct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or otherwise satisfies whatever criteria the detection subroutine is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; checking).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt that.  Remember, they are printed out at the end, but
<br />
having that criterion would confer no evolutionary advantage in the
<br />
meantime.  Intelligence would.  I think it would be very likely that some
<br />
criterion could be selected that would be both easy to recognize and
<br />
unlikely to occur before the evolution of intelligence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand the state extraction subroutine I mentioned is probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shorter than you think. The first part of this subroutine would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain the space-time coordinates of the computer running the AI, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; second part would use some simple pattern recognition to group the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subatomic particles in that space-time region into atoms, molecules, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory elements, then the third part would &quot;read&quot; the memory elements and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; output the AI's state.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that would have to be a huge program.  Huge.  Each step -
<br />
Plank scale to low energy, wave functional to particles, types of atoms,
<br />
molecules, neurons and their connections, etc. - huge.  I mean, you try
<br />
writing that algorithm.  How long would it take you?  If not long, then
<br />
show me the money.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	I don't think that having larger memory elements would really make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the algorithm much shorter.  More important would be to have a regular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; arrangement of memory elements - with the disturbing implication that an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; artificial digital intelligence would have much more measure than a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; messy human brain.  Perhaps our own experience then argues against the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; proposal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What makes you think messiness would make such a big difference? The state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extraction subroutine for a human brain should be very similar to the one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the AI. After grouping the subatomic particles into neurons, it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just output the neural-net structure and its current firing pattern.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structure labeled how?  By connections and interaction strengths
<br />
among the neurons?  For the AI, the pattern of spatial locations of the
<br />
momory elements would be much of the needed info.  Not so the human.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	Third, in order for such a distribution of strings to arise, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; must be the case that all of those programs are really in operation.  You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; call it the 'a priori distribution', but in fact it is a nontrivial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distribution, and nature surely does not know all of that information - it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; must be calculated.  The true default distribution would be to just let
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; each bit have an equal chance of being 0 or 1.  That being the case,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; strings that arise during such calculations ought to also be able to give
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rise to consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One justification for ignoring the intermediate strings that arise during
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation is that their distribution, unlike the distribution of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; final outputs, is highly dependent on the model of computation. Another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; justification is to think of all of the computations as occuring in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe that doesn't end. Then all of the intermediate strings last for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finite amount of time, whereas the final outputs last for eternity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore the intermediate strings contribute zero measure.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's just one choice of model among the many possibilities.  And
<br />
what about the computations that never terminate?
