<br />
An essence of being an SAS is to perceive lawlike behavior in the
<br />
universe it inhabits. Laws are essentially ways an SAS organizes what it
<br />
observes about the world around it. In this way an SAS is able to learn
<br />
from its surroundings, generalize event patterns into laws and constants
<br />
that characterize its universe, and predict the likelihood of future
<br />
events. An SAS with finite knowledge will allow for rare, apparent
<br />
violations of laws, but assumes that an explanation exists for that
<br />
apparent violation, which fits in with the laws it has knowledge of.
<br />
<br />So it is no surprise, that, for example, a dragon event is never
<br />
observed. If some SAS reported the sighting of a dragon event, its
<br />
fellow SAS's would pass it off as a hallucination. That would be the
<br />
'natural' (i.e., fits in with the known laws) explanation. Similarly, if
<br />
a group of SASs reported the dragon event, it would be passed off as a
<br />
group hallucination, or possibly, a hoax. If there is an 'objectively'
<br />
confirmed string of dragon sightings by SAS scientists, either the known
<br />
laws would be updated while maintaining their simplicity (if that were
<br />
possible) or else there would be great effort by the SASs to find a
<br />
'natural' explanation (e.g., the SAS's passed through a wormhole into
<br />
another universe).
<br />
<br />Similarly, the Strong Anthropic Principle is really a statement that any
<br />
SAS will find itself will observe itself in a universe that allows it to
<br />
exist. The SAS should be aware which conditions that allow SAS's to
<br />
exist and conditions which do not allow SAS's to exist. The appearance
<br />
of fine-tuning really becomes rather subjective - how narrow should the
<br />
range of values of allowed parameters should be so that there appears to
<br />
be fine-tuning?
<br />
<br />Interpreting MWI is very difficult - I prefer to think of &quot;many
<br />
histories&quot; myself. There are countless universe-histories which follow
<br />
the same laws of physics that we have come to know and love. I am not
<br />
sure if it is possible to talk about the actual probability of a
<br />
particular history of our universe having occurred, or the probabilities
<br />
of possible futures of our universe. Given the history of the universe
<br />
up to now, the algorithmic complexity will presumably be the same for
<br />
each member of a large set of possible consistent futures. The number of
<br />
members of this set is unknown. For another set of equally less
<br />
consistent futures, the algorithmic complexity is probably higher, but
<br />
again the number of members of this set is unknown (though we expect it
<br />
to be smaller).
