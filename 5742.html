<br /><br /><br />OK.

<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consider each of these examples:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;117. q
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;...
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;207. p -&gt; q
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, we will say that the machines &quot;believes&quot; something if it is one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;its theorems, right?  So we can say that the machine &quot;believes q&quot;, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;believes Bp&quot;, and it &quot;believes p-&gt;q&quot;, right?  We could equivalently say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it &quot;believes q is true&quot;, etc., but that is redundant.  If it writes x
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;down as a theorem, we will say it believes x, which is shorthand for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;saying that it believes x is true.  The &quot;is true&quot; part has no real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meaning and does not seem helpful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We also have this shorthand Bx to mean &quot;the machine believes x&quot;.  So we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(not the machine, but us, you and I!) can also write, Bq, BBp and B(p-&gt;q),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and all of these are true statements, right?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Until here you are right.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The problem arises when we start to use this same letter B in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machine's theorems.  It is easy to slide back and forth between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machine's B and our B.  But there is no a priori reason to assume that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they are the same.  That is something that has to be justified.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />The problem arises here, indeed. And I disagree with what you are saying.
<br />
We take, by personal choice, the total NAIVE STANCE toward the machine.
<br />
That means that by definition Bx means for us, and for the machine
<br />
that the machine believes x. Exactly like when the machine believes
<br />
(p -&gt; q), it means, like for us (-p v q), that p is false or q is true.
<br />
If the machine believes Bp, it just means that the machine believes it
<br />
will believe p. In case the machine print Bp and then never print p, it
<br />
will means (for us) that the machine has a false belief.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Focus on 207. p-&gt;q for a moment.  We know that, according to the machine's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rules, this theorem means that if it ever writes down p as a theorem,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it will write down q.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Take care. &quot;p-&gt;q&quot; is also true in case p is false (by propositional logic),
<br />
it could means that the machine believes -p.
<br />
Let us look at the following example: with f denoting any contradiction
<br />
(that is f can be seen as an abbreviation of (p &amp; -p))
<br />
The machine obeys to classical propositional calculus (CPC). Thus
<br />
the machine believes all proposition  f-&gt;p (with any p).
<br />
And what you said is correct, that will entails that if the machine
<br />
believes f, then it will believe p, and then, if we add the assumption
<br />
that the machine is consistent, it will never believes f, that is Bf is false
<br />
for the machine, and so we know then that [Bf -&gt; &lt;what-you want&gt;]
<br />
will always be true (because we know also the CPC.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Therefore it is true that Bp-&gt;Bq.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes. Because the machine obeys CPC.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;another way of saying the same thing!  Bp means that p is a theorem,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by definition of the letter B, in the real world.  And similarly Bq
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;means that q is a theorem.  Given that p-&gt;q is a theorem, then if p is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a theorem, so is q.  Therefore it is true that B(p-&gt;q) -&gt; (Bp -&gt; Bq).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is not a theorem of the machine, it is a truth in the real world.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Right.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What I want to say is that 207. p-&gt;q &quot;means&quot; Bp -&gt; Bq.  It means that if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the machine ever derives p, it will derive q.  This is a true statement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about the operations of the machine.  It is not a theorem of the machine.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, but what is a theorem by the machine, is &quot;p-&gt;q&quot;, independently
<br />
that *we* know this entails Bp -&gt; Bq. So your expression
<br />
&quot;p-&gt;q&quot; means Bp -&gt; Bq, is misleading. The naive stance is that the
<br />
machine believes p-&gt;q. (or, if we want to insist, that the machine
<br />
believes &quot;p-&gt;q&quot; is true, but as you said this does not add anything.
<br />
Actually p-&gt;q could be false, and the machine could have false beliefs,
<br />
in which case both &quot;p-&gt;q&quot; and &quot;(p-&gt;q) is true&quot; are false.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;When we talk about what something &quot;means&quot;, I think it has to be what it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;means to us, not what it means to the machine.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Why? If you talk with any platonist, you should better keep the naive
<br />
stance. If not it is like you suspect some problem with the platonist
<br />
brain, and you will no more talk about the same thing with him.
<br />
It will be much harder for you to show him that he is doing a mistake
<br />
for exemple.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;When the machine writes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;117.q, it doesn't mean anything to the machine.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Why? With the naive stance, it means the machine believes q.
<br />
For perhaps unknown reason to us the machine believes q. Perhaps
<br />
the machine has make a visit to the KK island; and some native
<br />
told her that &quot;if I am a knight then q&quot;. Or more simply the native said
<br />
&quot;1+1 = 2&quot;, and then latter said q.
<br />
I have said that the machine believes all classical tautologies, and that
<br />
if the machine believes X, and then X-&gt;Y, then the machine believes Y.
<br />
But I NEVERsaid that the machine believes ONLY the tautologies.
<br />
The machine can have its personal life and got some personal
<br />
non logical beliefs (non tautological belief) on its own. Like in some
<br />
of the problem I gave where machine develops beliefs on the knight/kanve
<br />
nature of the natives.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To us it means that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machine believes q, or that the machine believes q is true.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is right, but keep in mind that it means something for the machine.
<br />
It means q, or &quot;q is true&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Given this approach, I am very hesistant to say that 191. Bp means that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the machine believes that it believes p.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are hesitant because you hesitate to keep the naive stance.
<br />
But with it, things are very clear and simple. By definition (so to say),
<br />
if the machine believes ever Bp (perhaps at the 191 day), it means
<br />
the machine believes it believes p. If later we got reason to change our mind
<br />
we will unhesitatingly change our interpretation of B. Perhaps When the
<br />
machine said Bp she was really meaning that her friend &lt;another machine&gt;
<br />
believes p. Such circumstance will happen later!
<br />
But until we met such machine, Bp is supposed to have exactly
<br />
the same meaning for us and for the machine, like for the theorems
<br />
of CPC.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have no problem saying that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;means that the machine believes Bp.  But to say that the machine &quot;believes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that it believes p&quot; uses the word &quot;believes&quot; in two very different and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;confusing ways.  The first &quot;believes&quot; is just a statement about what the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machine has derived as a theorem.  We choose to say that the machine's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theorems are what it &quot;believes&quot;.  I am OK with that.  But the second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;believes&quot; refers to the letter B, which we are arbitrarily choosing to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;identify with this word &quot;belief&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />By decision. We are interested in self-referentially correct machines.
<br />
Those will be the machine which handle the B correctly with respect that
<br />
to what they believe.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To the machine, B is just a letter.  I still say that I need to know what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the rules are that the machine will apply to that letter.  I see that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was wrong to think that p -&gt; Bp was a rule the machine would have if it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;were &quot;normal&quot;.  You said that for a normal machine, if it ever proved p,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it would also prove Bp.  Okay, but how could it possibly do this without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ANY rules to deal with the letter B?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Good question. But it would be misleading to think we need to answer
<br />
it now. Later we will interview a self-referentially correct universal machine
<br />
and justify why that machine is normal. But, since recently, I have decide
<br />
to follow Smullyan's idea to work a little bit axiomatically before going
<br />
the arithmetical machine. B will get a purely arithmetical interpretation,
<br />
and the normality of the SRC universal machine will be a theorem of
<br />
arithmetic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Normality is not something one can just assert about a machine.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here I disagree, but of course this is due to the fact that I'm
<br />
a classical mathematician. I can just say: let us consider a normal
<br />
machine, let us suppose that machine makes a visit to the KK island, ...
<br />
And then study the consequence of its normality when, for example, the
<br />
machine meets some knight, knaves, whatever ...
<br />
Later we will interrogate a Universal Machine, and we will know (like her!)
<br />
why she is normal. But I prefer to modularize the difficulties in the
<br />
manner of Smullyan. At least for now.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;need to give it a rule for dealing with the letter B, then you could prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(not the machine proving, you would prove it) that if the machine ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;derived p, its rules for dealing with the letter B would then cause it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to derive Bp.  In this way you would show that the machine was normal.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Right, at least when we will choose some particular (universal) machine
<br />
to deal with. But that's not so easy (it needs some amount of computer
<br />
science), and the very reasoning leading to G and G* can be done easily
<br />
without. I could even say: look any SRC universal machine is normal,
<br />
see Boolos 93 for a proof. But of course your question was genuine.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My axiom, which I should have written as, &quot;0a. for all x, x-&gt;Bx&quot;, would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in fact be sufficient to show that a machine which had that axiom would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be normal.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I will avoid quantification on proposition (and you notation will prompt
<br />
some futur discussion) but it could be confusing to focus on it now.
<br />
So okay: p -&gt; Bp  (as an axiom scheme: taken as true for any p),
<br />
makes the machine normal. But it makes it complete too, and that's
<br />
is *quite* demanding. (See my last post to Jesse for a futur capital
<br />
role for the formula p-&gt;Bp though, but that's anticipation).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;A machine which had this rule for dealing with the letter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;B would be normal, because any time it derived p, it could immediately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;derive Bp using this axiom.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, this machine may be too powerful.  Although it is normal, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is much more.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Agreed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So my question to you is, what is an example of an axiom for dealing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with the letter B that would make a machine be &quot;just&quot; normal, but no more?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />There could exist ten thousand reasons making a machine normal, but
<br />
not complete (that is making Bp-&gt; BBp true without making p-&gt;Bp true).
<br />
My favorite is that a machine needs only to believe in the Peano axiom
<br />
of Arithmetic. Another: to believe in the axiom of any theory recursively
<br />
extending PA, or ZF, .... Another is to believe in classical logic
<br />
and in any programming language, etc.
<br />
But we can, like any mathematician, just define a machine normal
<br />
by saying Bp-&gt;BBp is true about the machine, that is saying that a
<br />
machine is normal if she believes that she believes p when she believes p.
<br />
You can also say that a machine is normal when she has enough
<br />
introspective power to BBp any time when she Bp.
<br />
Oh, any accurate machine (for which Bp-&gt;p is true) is
<br />
obviously normal.
<br />
last but not the least (but here I anticipate), but in case you remember
<br />
what I said about the Kripke Possible World semantics of modal logic,
<br />
normality can be defined in that semantics: a machine is normal when
<br />
it just *has* a semantic of Kripke, i.e. a semantics in term of possible 
<br />
worlds.
<br />
(the machine should better know also that B(p-&gt;q)-&gt;(Bp-&gt;Bq))
<br />
(Note that some logician, like Krister Segerberg use &quot;normality&quot; in a
<br />
slightly more general sense). But you can remember as an heuristic
<br />
(it could give a good motivation): a machine is normal if she lives
<br />
in a multiverse ...  G will be normal. G* will NOT be normal ...
