<br />I think that there has been a good deal of confusion between
<br />
<br />(I)  computationalism: the doctrine that robots running classical
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;programs can be conscious
<br />
<br />(II) Bruno's theories which build on this long-standing belief
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(computationalism) and which go much further.
<br />
<br />This confusion has not been helped at all by Bruno continuing to
<br />
use the term &quot;comp&quot; indiscriminately for both computationalism
<br />
(which is also basically &quot;functionalism&quot;) and his valiant attempts
<br />
to derive his &quot;comp&quot; from computationalism (involving use of Gödel's
<br />
Theorem, etc.)
<br />
<br />It must be added that I have *never* --- since 1965 when I argued
<br />
for (what I didn't know was called) computationalism against others
<br />
in my high school.
<br />
<br />It must also be stressed that Turing's most famous essay embraced
<br />
what is today called *computationalism* and which---basically---
<br />
was called functionalism in the 1980's and 1990's.
<br />
<br />The YD (Bruno's rather picturesque way of describing uploading)
<br />
has also been argued about---especially by cryonicists---for over
<br />
twenty-five years. When I first became a acquainted with it, we
<br />
all called it &quot;downloading&quot;: the notion that one's consciousness
<br />
could be downloaded into a piece of silicon, with all the advantages
<br />
of speed, durability, and backup capabilities that this entails.
<br />
<br />In 1989 or so the people that I hang out with began to call this
<br />
&quot;uploading&quot; instead.  You'll have no trouble with Google finding
<br />
all the thousands of emails and papers written about uploading.
<br />
The name was changed when it was realized that &quot;downloading&quot; oneself
<br />
into a small or large silicon device had many disadvantages over
<br />
&quot;uploading&quot; one's self into distributed, possibly Solar System wide,
<br />
communications nets.
<br />
<br />TO BE SURE: the main point of contention among people is still whether
<br />
functionalism is true.  Is it true, in other words, that &quot;if it sounds
<br />
like a duck, walks like a duck, and acts in every way like a duck, then
<br />
it's a duck!&quot;?  We who say *yes* to computationalism and functionalism
<br />
are not in the same camp, as Stephen Paul King points out, as a number
<br />
of notable theorists like Roger Penrose, who believe in their bones
<br />
that there has to be a connection between quantum mechanics and
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
<br />On the contrary, people who dismiss functionalism (computationalism)
<br />
will hopefully realize their mistake before long if (when) robots
<br />
attain the same behavioral capabilities that humans have. On the other
<br />
hand, if this proves to be truly impossible without quantum computation,
<br />
then we computationalists will have to admit that we were wrong.
<br />
<br />Lee
