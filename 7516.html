<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Stephen;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have a couple of quesitions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Emulations involve some notion of a process and such are temporal. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea that a process, of any kind, can &quot;occur&quot; requires some measure of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both transitivity and duration.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The mere *existence* of a process only speaks to its potential for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occurrence.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Im not quite sure what you mean by this. Possibly you mean that to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coherently describe time it isnt enough to have laid out in succession a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; series of moments, or events, described by real numbers or however. There 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must also be something running through the series in order for the concept 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of time to make any sense. If you like, there must be a 'now' - a temporal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; position of sorts - in which raw sensory experience - audio and vision 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps - comes together synaesthetically into a coherent perspective and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is then consigned to memory. Put another way, there are many strips of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; film one could thread through a projector but until one does so the well 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ordered sequence of frames remains static, time is not realised in any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coherent way in a film until it is shown. I think that if this is what you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean (or close) i'ld like to add my support to you're objection.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you seem to be considering is the distiction between 1st and 3rd 
<br />
person aspects! The &quot;...laid out in succession a series of moments, or 
<br />
events, described by real numbers or however&quot; is the 3rd person: The &quot;view 
<br />
from the outside&quot; of time. The 1st person aspect is: &quot;running through the 
<br />
series in order for the concept of time to make any sense&quot;. This is the view 
<br />
from the inside in the sense that at any given &quot;present moment&quot; - 'now'- an 
<br />
observer (that has the capasity of making a report) will find itself within 
<br />
an experience.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What ever the means are considered to generate that &quot;experience&quot;, what 
<br />
does not change here is that the any observer will have a 1st person 
<br />
experience of something and within that experience there will be some means 
<br />
of distinguishing the overall content of that experience and some sense of 
<br />
somehow being seperate from it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this &quot;seperateness&quot; that, I believe, connect the 1st and 3rd 
<br />
person aspects and this is where the &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot; framing obtains. 
<br />
One way of thinking of this is to consider a video game that is set up so 
<br />
that on can switch between seeing the computer generated scene, as one 
<br />
&quot;moves around&quot;, from the point of view of &quot;where the eyes are&quot; to the point 
<br />
of view of a camera &quot;floating overhead&quot;. What remained the same in the 
<br />
switching?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [CP]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, you might mean that there must be some sense of duration and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transitivity within each individual moment. If you like, a series of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events (frames, real numbers) which individually have no duration (or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense of transition) can not therefore collectively be considered to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obtain such properties. I disagree with that. duration and transitivity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can obtain accross a span of events, and to be strict I dont undestand the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; requirement for change at all.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, if we are taking the notion of a moment to an infinitesimal &quot;slice&quot;. 
<br />
It seems that in our eagerness to mathematize everything in sight, we 
<br />
neglect the consequences that obtain. Numbers by themselves do not naturally 
<br />
code for the operations on those numbers. We can arbitrarily assign some 
<br />
number to &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, etc. as we find in Goodel numbering, but this is not 
<br />
natural, it must be assigned &quot;by hand&quot;! Thus we find ourselves in the 
<br />
predicament of having to account for where the notions of duration and 
<br />
transitivity come from.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the requirement of change, I am claiming that we must have some 
<br />
prior notion of change, at least the potential to change, in order to have a 
<br />
coherent notion of transitioning from one &quot;frame&quot;, number, Observer Moment, 
<br />
Time capsule, or whatever. Even is we are going to use numbers, the simplest 
<br />
of the ideas here, we have to have some &quot;change&quot; between the numbers 
<br />
themselves as some quantity to relations between the numbers. The mere 
<br />
existence of quantities is not sufficient to include both the numbers 
<br />
themselves and the relationships between them (the latter including the 
<br />
operations on the numbers). Figuratively, somewhere somehow, there must be 
<br />
included some form of change.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Time, from what I have studied so far, involves two distinct notions: a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;measure of change&quot; and an &quot;order of succession&quot;.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [CP]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can see that time involves an 'order of succession'. I dont see that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time is a 'measure of change', if by that you mean that time depends on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change to exist. I can concieve an infinate universe consisting of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solitary glove over time, a universe in which there are moments but no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change. Awareness of time might not be possible in the absense of change, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but that is not the same thing as time not existing. Moreover, it seems 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; odd to insist - if you are insisting - that events (frames, real numbers) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change rather than the just the substances which characterise the event 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a &quot;clock&quot; if not an means to measure change? Time is not the 
<br />
change itself, it is the valuation of that change. Change is what is taken 
<br />
to be a priori in the notion of time; in requers some process of 
<br />
differentiation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Distance&quot; is a measure of extention, requiring some prior co-existence 
<br />
of differenciable entities. The how and the why of this differenciation is 
<br />
what we need to look at carefully. We can assume that the differentiated 
<br />
entities exist a priori, like numbers, but if we errace all vestiges of a 
<br />
means to &quot;know a difference&quot; such as an observer, what coherence remains?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numbers, in-themselves (dasein), are meaningless.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [CP]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In boiling water, the water (substance) changes temperature, the event at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which all the water has passed temperature 'd' requires no inherent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'becoming' to make sense temporally, it just needs to 'identify' the state 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the water at that time, doesnt it?
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your claim here depends on looking only at an abstract slice 'd' that 
<br />
has some quantitative value within some assumed coordinate system; 
<br />
temperature vs. time. This is going back to the cellular automata results 
<br />
where I pointed out that the range of values over the checker board of 
<br />
results can only be taken after the act of rendering the result, not prior 
<br />
to it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does a &quot;history&quot;&quot; include values that can be associated with either of 
<br />
McTaggart's A or B series? No! It has boundaried at some initial point and 
<br />
spans to some &quot;present moment&quot;. Again, we are considering an order of events 
<br />
after the fact of their ordering. The &quot;measure of change&quot; aspect goes from 
<br />
the 1st person aspect of &quot;being there as the history was happening&quot; to the 
<br />
3rd person aspect of comparing the events at one date of a history to 
<br />
another.
<br />
