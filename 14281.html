<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Le Wednesday 28 November 2007 09:56:17 Torgny Tholerus, vous avez  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; écrit :

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; You only need models of cellular automata.  If you have a model and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; rules for that model, then one event will follow after another event,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; according to the rules.  And after that event will follow another  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; event, and so on unlimited.  The events will follow after eachother  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; if you will not have any implementation of this model.  Any physics  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; not needed.  You don't need any geometric properties.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Sure, but you can't be ultrafinitist and saying things like &quot;And  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; after that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; event will follow another more event, and so on unlimited&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a difference between &quot;unlimited&quot; and &quot;infinite&quot;.  &quot;Unlimited&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just says that it has no limit, but everything is still finite.  If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; add something to a finite set, then the new set will always be finite.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is not possible to create an infinite set.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Come on! Now you talk like a finitist, who accepts the idea of  
<br />
&quot;potential infinity&quot; (like Kronecker, Brouwer and the intuitionnist)  
<br />
and who rejects only the so called actual infinities, like ordinal and  
<br />
cardinal &quot;numbers&quot; (or sets).
<br />
<br />At the ontic level, (or ontological, I mean the minimum we have to bet  
<br />
on at the third person pov), comp is mainly finitist. Judson Webb put  
<br />
comp (he calls it mechanism) in Finitism. But that is no more  
<br />
ultrafinitism. With finitism: every object of the &quot;universe&quot; is finite,  
<br />
but the universe itself is infinite (potentially or actually). With  
<br />
ultrafinitism, every object is finite AND the universe itself is finite  
<br />
too.
<br />

<br />
<br />How would the set &quot;omega-1&quot; be defined? It doesn't make sense unless  
<br />
you believe in a &quot;last finite ordinal&quot;, which of course a  
<br />
non-ultrafinitist will not believe in.
<br />
<br />Actually this makes sense in what is called non standard model of  
<br />
arithmetic. In Peano Arithmetic you cannot define what is a finite  
<br />
number (the notion of finiteness is typically a second order notion).  
<br />
So it is consistent to add some &quot;infinite numbers&quot; in the model of PA.  
<br />
But you can prove in PA that any number, except zero, has a  
<br />
predecessor, so a non standard model of arithmetic can have infinite  
<br />
objects, but then also its predecessor, and all their successive  
<br />
predecessors. A non standard model will have the following order on it:
<br />
<br />0 1 2 ...     ... infinity-1  infinity  infinity+1 ....   (and possibly  
<br />
other so called Z-chain).  Such order are NOT ordinals, note.
<br />
<br />All this is not important now, but I say this in passing.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My instinct would be to say that a &quot;well-defined&quot; criterion is one  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that, given any mathematical object, will give you a clear answer as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to whether the object fits the criterion or not. And obviously this  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one doesn't, because it's impossible to decide where R fits it or not!  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I'm not sure if this is the right answer, since my notion of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;well-defined criteria&quot; is just supposed to be an alternate way of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceptualizing the notion of a set, and I don't actually know why  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;the set of all sets that are not members of themselves&quot; is not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered to be a valid set in ZFC set theory.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Frege and Cantor did indeed define or identify sets with their defining  
<br />
properties. This leads to the Russell's contradiction. (I think Frege  
<br />
has abandoned his work in despair after that).
<br />
One solution (among many other one) to save Cantor's work from that  
<br />
paradox consists in formalizing set theory, which means using  
<br />
&quot;belongness&quot; as an undefined symbol obeying some axioms. Just two  
<br />
examples of an axiom of ZF (or its brother ZFC = ZF + axiom of choice):  
<br />
is the extensionality axiom:
<br />
AxAyAz ((x b z &lt;-&gt; y b z)  -&gt; x = y)   &quot;b&quot; is for &quot;belongs&quot;. It says  
<br />
that two sets are equal if they have the same elements.
<br />
AxEy(z included-in x -&gt; z b y) with &quot;z included-in x&quot; is a macro for  
<br />
Ar(r b z -&gt; r b x). This is the power set axiom, saying that the set of  
<br />
all subsets of some set is also a set).
<br />
<br />Paradoxes a-la Russell are evacuated by restricting Jesse's  
<br />
&quot;well-defined criteria&quot; by
<br />
1) first order formula (in the set language, that is with &quot;b&quot; as unique  
<br />
relational symbols (+ equality) ... like the axioms just above.
<br />
2) but such first order formula have to be applied only to an already  
<br />
defined set.
<br />
For example, you can defined the set of x such that x is in y and has  
<br />
such property P(x). With P defined by a set formula, and y an already  
<br />
defined set.
<br />
<br />Also, ZFC has the foundation axiom which forbids a set to belong to  
<br />
itself. In particular the informal collection of all sets which does  
<br />
not belongs to themselves is the universe itself, which cannot be a set  
<br />
(its power set would be bigger than the universe!).
<br />
But there are version of ZF without foundation, or even with diverse  
<br />
versions of the negation of the foundation axiom, like Stephen Paul  
<br />
King appreciates so much.
<br />
<br />Actually, I will not use set theory at all, but I will mention often ZF  
<br />
and its many brothers (like ZFC, ZF+&lt;some big cardinal&gt;, ...) as  
<br />
example of very rich lobian machine. ZF can prove the complete  
<br />
(propositional) theology of a lesser rich (in provability power)  
<br />
machine like PA.
