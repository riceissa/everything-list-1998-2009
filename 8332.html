I should make another point, that it seems very likely that the worm 
<br />
has no way of developing the in-apple technology to find out about 
<br />
quantum mechanics or DNA.  This emphasizes the fact that we, with our 
<br />
quantum theories, M-theories, and loop gravity etc. could be just as 
<br />
far away from explaining the universe as the worm is.

<br />Hal, 
<br />
 
<br />
I disagree. How can the worm apply a probability distribution over 
<br />
things that he knows nothing of, such as trees, people, and evolution? 
<br />
Using the Wormopic Principle, when the worm proclaims that, &quot;The 
<br />
universe is just complex enough to produce and sustain such a worm as 
<br />
I, and the inside of an apple,&quot; how can he be meaning anything (in his 
<br />
own mind, mind you, since explanatory power refers to being able to 
<br />
explain the universe to him) that even remotely resembles our universe? 
<br />
 (As an aside, as much as we know about our universe, we totally cannot 
<br />
rule out the possibility that a worm that understands &quot;sufficient 
<br />
mathematics&quot; actually exists in our universe!) Instead, even if he 
<br />
developed the in-apple technology to explore quantum mechanics and DNA, 
<br />
he might come up with a quantum theory similar to ours (but who knows 
<br />
the probability of that?!!), but he would likely come up with a very 
<br />
weird theory of how his DNA was formed, having nothing to do with how 
<br />
it actually was formed (according to our theories). 
<br />
 
<br />
You make a good point about the complexity of living things. If you ask 
<br />
biologists and other non-physics scientists about the Theories of 
<br />
Everything, a lot of them would say that we're a long way from it. 
<br />
Roger Trigg, University of Warwick, in his book, Rationality and 
<br />
Science: Can Science Explain Everything?, makes this point. Also, for 
<br />
instance, the premier biologist Carl Woese, in his recent article, A 
<br />
New Biology For A New Century, calls for biologists to get out of their 
<br />
myopic pursuit of genetically breaking things down into the smallest 
<br />
biological quantum, and to step back and look at the big picture, 
<br />
saying that there are whole levels of complexity that we will totally 
<br />
miss if we don't, resulting in being totally disabled in being able to 
<br />
explain everything in biology (to our satisfaction).

observABLE 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe for the worm is the same as our observable universe. Then 
</em><br />
the worm 
<br />
comes 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up with a multiverse theory along with a Wormopic Principle, saying

that the 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole observable universe is just complex enough to sustain the 
</em><br />
inside of an 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apple. Surely this must be true, since the worm can grasp all of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics? 
</em><br />
 
<br />
The worm would come up with a multiverse theory that says that 
<br />
everything 
<br />
exists, including universes like ours with people, apple trees, apples 
<br />
and 
<br />
worms, and also including other universes which consist of just a 
<br />
single 
<br />
apple, possibly with a worm in it, and every other possibility besides. 
<br />
 
<br />
Among these possible universes there are a certain fraction which 
<br />
contain 
<br />
worms-in-apples consistent with the experiences, observations and 
<br />
memories 
<br />
that the worm has experienced in his own apple. 
<br />
 
<br />
He knows that he is one of those worms. 
<br />
 
<br />
He applies some kind of measure, such as the Universal Distribution, 
<br />
over 
<br />
all of these worms-in-apples and is able to come up with a probability 
<br />
distribution for which one he is. This results in first-person 
<br />
indeterminacy and uncertainty. 
<br />
 
<br />
It may well be that the simplest and most likely case is not a universe 
<br />
containing a single apple, but a universe like ours. The reason is that 
<br />
apples and worms are actually very complex objects at the cellular 
<br />
level, 
<br />
even more complex at the atomic level, and enormously complex at the 
<br />
sub-atomic Planck scale. The physics going on in the apple is every 
<br />
bit as complex as the physics of our own universe. 
<br />
 
<br />
Our universe has the advantage in that its initial condition was very 
<br />
simple - some say it was completely smooth and uniform in the initial 
<br />
instances of the Big Bang. Then we went along in a very natural and 
<br />
simple way and developed planets, where life evolved into apples and 
<br />
worms. 
<br />
 
<br />
The apple-only universe must create all this by fiat. It must be 
<br />
hard-wired into the initial conditions: everything about the apple, 
<br />
about the worm, and about the physics. 
<br />
 
<br />
It's very plausibly would take a more complex program to run a universe 
<br />
consisting of just an apple and a worm, than our whole universe where 
<br />
apples and worms evolve out of much simpler initial conditions. 
<br />
 
<br />
Hence the worm might well conclude that he is likely to be in a giant 
<br />
universe with billions of other apples and worms, as well as many other 
<br />
forms of life. Even though he has not yet observed any of these things, 
<br />
not yet having come to the surface of the apple, he can deduce it. 
<br />
 
<br />
But perhaps not. Suppose that this super-intelligent worm deduces 
<br />
that universes like ours are actually less likely than ones which 
<br />
are all apple. In that case, assuming that his reasoning is sound, 
<br />
then he is probably right. From the first-person perspective, when he 
<br />
chews up to the surface, he will probably find that he is indeed in 
<br />
an apple-only universe. The multiverse has many kinds of universes 
<br />
with worms in apples, and it may be that our own universe has only a 
<br />
small fraction of all the worms in apples, that most worms do in fact 
<br />
find themselves in other kinds of universes. That would be a possible 
<br />
conclusion of multiverse theory, and it might well be right. 
<br />
 
<br />
In short, there is no reason to expect a super-intelligent worm in an 
<br />
apple to come up with a different multiverse than the one we would, if 
<br />
we were also super-intelligent. We might be in different components of 
<br />
the multiverse than the typical worm, but that is not evidence against 
<br />
the theory or an example of a flaw in its explanatory power.
