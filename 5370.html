<br />QUOTE-
<br />
<br /><br />Stathis Papaioannou wrote (and Eric Cavalcanti did assess it)
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, you probably _could_ drive your brain into &quot;seeing red&quot; if you 
<br />
knew exactly what physical processes occur in the brain in response to a red 
<br />
stimulus, and if you had appropriate neural interface equipment. Such 
<br />
capabilities do not currently exist - not even close - but the idea is the 
<br />
basis of many SF stories (eg. William Gibson, Greg Egan). The same sort of 
<br />
thing frequently occurs naturally: the definition of a hallucination is a 
<br />
perception without the stimulus that would normally give rise to that 
<br />
perception. The point is, even if you knew in perfect detail what happens in 
<br />
your brain when you see red, you would not actually know/feel/experience the 
<br />
qualia unless you ran the software on your own hardware.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Of course I mainly agree with Stathis here, and with Eric's
<br />
assessment, but Stathis formulates it in just the way which
<br />
makes people abusing the box analogy. Indeed, the only way
<br />
to actually know/feel/experience the qualia is to &quot;run&quot; the right
<br />
software, which really *defines* the owner.
<br />
The choice of hardware makes no difference. The owner
<br />
of the hardware makes no difference. This is because the owner
<br />
is really defined by the (running) software.
<br />
To be even more exact, there is eventually
<br />
no need for running the software, because eventually the box
<br />
itself is a construction of the mind, and is defined by the
<br />
(possible) software/owner.
<br />
That illustrates also that you cannot see &quot;blue&quot; as someone else
<br />
sees &quot;blue&quot; by running the [someone else's software] on
<br />
&quot;your hardware&quot;, because if you run [someone else's software]
<br />
on your hardware, you will just duplicate that someone-else,
<br />
and your hardware will become [someone else's hardware!]
<br />
And *you* will just disappear (locally).

<br />-ENDQUOTE
<br />
<br />Well yes, the mind IS the software. I am reminded of a frequent discussion I 
<br />
have with schizophrenic patients who have improved on medication and then 
<br />
think they no longer need it. I warn them that on other occasions when they 
<br />
have done this their delusions have returned and they have ended up in 
<br />
hospital, to be restabilised on antipsychotic medication. &quot;That will never 
<br />
happen again,&quot; they confidently say, &quot;because I now know those thoughts were 
<br />
crazy, and if they recur, I will be able to think rationally and hence 
<br />
dismiss them&quot;. Now, a psychotic delusion occurs(due to complex and poorly 
<br />
understood neurochemical pathology) precisely because the mind/brain 
<br />
dysfunction causes the patient to think IRrationally; so what are they going 
<br />
to use to talk their ailing mind into seeing sense again? We may have an 
<br />
extra kidney and lung for backup, but we only have one brain! Yet this is 
<br />
how many people (not just the mentally ill) seem to see it: that they have 
<br />
this magical &quot;I&quot; which can stand back and assess things no matter what is 
<br />
actually going on inside their heads - as if they don't really believe they 
<br />
think with their brain at all.
