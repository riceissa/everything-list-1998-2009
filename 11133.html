Le 12-sept.-06, ¨¤ 19:20, 1Z a ¨¦crit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You have not yet answered my question: what difference are you making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; between &quot;there exist a prime number in platonia&quot; and &quot;the truth of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; proposition asserting the *existence* of a prime number is independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of me, you, and all contingencies&quot; ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;P is true&quot; is not different to &quot;P&quot;. That is not the difference I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right then. It is an important key point for what will follow.
<br />
It will help me to represent the modality &quot;True(p)&quot; by just &quot;p&quot;; that  
<br />
is useful because correct machine cannot represent their notion of  
<br />
truth (by Tarski theorem).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm making a difference between what &quot;exists&quot; means in mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sentences and what it means in empiricial sentences (and what it means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in fictional contexts...)
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. So with this phrasing, the consequence of the UDA (including either  
<br />
the movie-graph argument, or the use of the &quot;comp-physics&quot; already  
<br />
extracted + OCCAM) can be put in this way:
<br />
<br />The appearance of &quot;empirical existence&quot; is explain without ontological  
<br />
empirical commitment from the mathematical existence of numbers. Indeed  
<br />
empirical existence, assuming comp, has to be an internal arithmetical  
<br />
modality.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The logical case for mathematical Platonism is based on the idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that mathematical statements are true, and make existence claims.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That they are true is not disputed by the anti-Platonist, who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must therefore claim that mathematical existence claims are somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weaker than other existence claims -- perhaps merely metaphorical.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But the whole point is that if you take the &quot;yes doctor&quot; idea seriously  
<br />
enough, then &quot;empirical existence&quot; appears to be more metaphorical than  
<br />
mathematical existence.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That the the word &quot;exists&quot; means different things in different contexts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is easily established.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Right. Now a TOE is supposed to explain all those notion of existence  
<br />
and to explain also how they are related.
<br />
I take the &quot;simple&quot; math existence as primitive, and explain all other  
<br />
notion of existence from it. Perhaps you should wait for it, or peruse  
<br />
in the archive or in my url to see how that works.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics is not a fiction because it is not a free creation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematicians are constrained by consistency and non-contradiction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a way that authors are not.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. But after Godel, mathematicians know, (or should know) that the  
<br />
consistency constrained is not enough.
<br />
Simple example: all sufficiently rich and consistent theory T remains  
<br />
consistent when you add the axiom asserting that T is inconsistent. You  
<br />
get a consistent but unreasonable and incorrect theory.
<br />
Yes: Godel's second incompleteness result is admittedly amazing.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Incidentally, this approach answers a question about mathematical and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth. The anti-Platonists want sthe two kinds of truth to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also needs them to be related so as to avoid the charge that one class
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement is not true at all. This can be achieved because empirical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statements rest on non-contradiction in order to achive correspondence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If an empricial observation fails co correspond to a statemet, there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a contradiction between them. Thus non-contradiciton is a necessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but insufficient justification for truth in empircal statements, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a sufficient one for mathematical statements).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Alas no. After Godel's second incompleteness theorem (or Lob extension  
<br />
of it) non-contradiction is insufficient even for the mathematical  
<br />
reality. Any machine/theory can be consistent and false with respect to  
<br />
the intended arithmetical reality.
<br />
Like Chaitin is aware, even pure arithmetic has some objective  
<br />
&quot;empirical&quot; features.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If you agree that the number 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... exist (or again, if  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; prefer, that the truth of the propositions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Ex(x = 0),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Ex(x = s(0)),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Ex(x = s(s(0))),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is independent of me), then it can proved that the UD exists. It can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; proved also that Peano Arithmetic (PA) can both define the UD and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that it exists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But again this is just &quot;mathematical existence&quot;. You need some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason to assert that mathematical existence is not a mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphor implying no real existence, as anti-Platonist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematicians claim. I do not think that is given by computationalism.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is not given by comp per se. It follows from the UD Argument. Don't  
<br />
hesitate to ask question about any step where you feel not being  
<br />
convinced.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Occam does not support conclusions of impossibility. It could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a brute fact that the universe is more complicated than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strcitly necessary.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are *trivially* right. This could kill ANY theory. You can say to a  
<br />
string theorist : what about the particles which we have not yet  
<br />
discover and which would behave in a way contradicting the theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; All the facts about mathematical truth and methodology can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; established
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without appeal to the actual existence of mathematical objects.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I believe that what you want to say here is this:
<br />
[All the facts about mathematical truth and methodology can be  
<br />
established without appeal to the empirical (or metaphysical, ...)  
<br />
existence of mathematical object&quot;].
<br />
And I agree with this. But you still need mathematical existence. Then  
<br />
I explain why (UDA) and how (arithmetical UDA, lobian interview) to  
<br />
extract the other notion of more contextual form of existence.
<br />
My problem here is pedagogical (if not sometimes diplomatic): you have  
<br />
to possess some good understanding of mathematical logic. Even just  
<br />
concerning the arithmetical propositions p, you have to realize the  
<br />
differences between
<br />
<br />p    (p is true, or satisfied by the school-learned  mathematical  
<br />
structure (N, +, *, 0, 1));
<br />
Bp  (p is provable by the lobian machine M, fixed once and for all)
<br />
Bp &amp; p  (p is provable by M and p is true in (N, +, *, 0, 1))
<br />
Bp &amp; Dp (p is provable by M and p is consistent with M's other  
<br />
belief/theorems)
<br />
Bp &amp; Dp &amp; p (p is provable, consistent and true).
<br />
<br />Now if M is a sufficiently simple correct lobian machine compared to  
<br />
you (like Peano Arithmetic), then *you* can prove that  Bp, Bp &amp; p,  Bp  
<br />
&amp; Dp,  Bp &amp; Dp &amp; p  are all equivalent with respect to the arithmetical  
<br />
sentences p. But then you can also prove that this equivalence cannot  
<br />
be proved (Bp) nor known (Bp &amp; p) nor observed (Bp &amp; Dp) nor &quot;felt&quot; (Bp  
<br />
&amp; Dp &amp; p) by the machine M, or by any correct machine when &quot;B&quot; is its  
<br />
own provability predicate.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the specialness of Time depends on the specialness of nautral
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers, depends on the specialness of Robinson Arithemtic ?
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are right and wrong.
<br />
Right because RA is a very precise machine/theory which has the  
<br />
advantage of being both a subset of all rich lobian machine, and at the  
<br />
same time a turing-complete or universal machine, and this makes it  
<br />
possible to identify computability with provability in RA, or  
<br />
Sigma1-provability.
<br />
You are wrong because any other machine or language could have been use  
<br />
instead. Any theory capable or representing the FI and the Wi would  
<br />
work. I have already try to sell the ontic SK combinator theory which  
<br />
has other advantage (relating computation theory with computability  
<br />
theory), but people didn't react to the posts I have send(*) about  
<br />
them, and I guess the choice of RA will just make things easier if only  
<br />
by allowing us to treat computability as a special case of provability.  
<br />
The lobian machine we have to interview are just the extensions of RA  
<br />
by induction axioms: for any formula F we accept that
<br />
[F(0) &amp; An(F(n) -&gt; F(n+1))] -&gt; AnF(n).
<br />
This gives PA tremendous introspective ability, making her, not only  
<br />
able to compute all the Fi and Wi like RA or any universal machine, but  
<br />
able mainly to reason deeply about those things.
