&gt;Marc,
I would agree with you that aesthetics is an important driving
principle, and the top scientist _do_ recognize this (see for
instance
many quotes by Albert Einstein in this direction).
Also, you should have a look at Nietzsche - science and the aesthetic
pervade his work!
Cheers,
Günther
Yes, good Kim and Gunther- I’m now adopting the radical belief that
intelligence has a lot more to do with art, than math ;)
Good initial link on aesthetics:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics</a>
So throw away all those math books , forget about Bayes, and start
studying the arts: painting, music and so on and so forth.
We’ll finally solve the AI stuff…with art.

&gt; &gt; Two issues I wish to mention, here.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Firstly, I present a few rapid-fire ideas about objective morality,
&gt; &gt; culminating in an integration of aesthetics, intelligence, and
&gt; &gt; morality, all in a few brief sentences ;)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Secondly, I give a mention to computer scientist Randy Pausch, who
&gt; &gt; recently died.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; As regards the first issue:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; It’s been said there are clear ways to determine physical and
&gt; &gt; mathematical facts, but nothing similar for values. But, in point (2)
&gt; &gt; below I point out what appears to be an objectively existing set of
&gt; &gt; values which underlies *all* of science.  I present two brief but
&gt; &gt; profound points that I what readers to consider and ponder carefully:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Point (1) there is a clear evolution to the universe. It started from
&gt; &gt; a low-entropy-density state, and is moving towards a higher-entropy
&gt; &gt; density, which, remarkably, just happens to coincide with an increase
&gt; &gt; in physical complexity with time. In the beginning the universe was in
&gt; &gt; a state with *the lowest possible* entropy. This is expressed in the
&gt; &gt; laws of thermodynamics and big bang cosmology. So it simply isn’t true
&gt; &gt; that there is no teleology (purpose) built into the universe. The laws
&gt; &gt; of thermodynamics and modern cosmology (big bang theory) clearly
&gt; &gt; express the fact that there is.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Point (2) the whole of science relies on Occam’s razor, the idea that
&gt; &gt; the universe is in some sense ‘simple’. It must be emphasized that
&gt; &gt; Occam’s razor pervades all of science – it is not simply some sort of
&gt; &gt; ‘add on’. As Popper pointed out, an infinite number of theories could
&gt; &gt; explain any given set of observations; therefore any inductive
&gt; &gt; generalization requires a principle – Occam’s razor – to get any
&gt; &gt; useful results at all.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Here is the point that most haven’t quite grasped - Occam’s razor is
&gt; &gt; *a set of aesthetic principles* - the notion of ‘simplicity’ is *a set
&gt; &gt; of aesthetic principles*; Why? Because it is simply another way of
&gt; &gt; saying that some representations are more *elegant* than others, which
&gt; &gt; is the very notion of aesthetics! I repeat: the whole of science only
&gt; &gt; works because of a set of *aesthetic principles* - a *set of values*.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; If all values are only subjective preferences, it would follow that
&gt; &gt; the whole of science relies on subjective preferences. But subjective
&gt; &gt; preferences have only existed as long as sentiments – therefore how
&gt; &gt; could physical laws have functioned before sentiments? The idea that
&gt; &gt; all values are subjective leads to a direct and blatant logical
&gt; &gt; contradiction.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Both these points are related and simply inexplicable without
&gt; &gt; appealing to objective terminal values. At the beginning of time the
&gt; &gt; universe was in the simplest possible state (minimal entropy density).
&gt; &gt; Why? Occam’s razor is wide-ranging and pervades the whole of science.
&gt; &gt; The simple is favored over the complex – that is– Occam’s razor is a
&gt; &gt; set of aesthetic value judgments without which not a single Bayesian
&gt; &gt; result could be obtained.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; *Every single Bayesian result rests on these implicit value judgments*
&gt; &gt; to set priors. It must be repeated that *not one single scientific
&gt; &gt; result could be obtained* without these secret (implicit) value
&gt; &gt; judgments which set priors, that our defenders of the Bayesian faith
&gt; &gt; on these forums are trying to pretend are not part of science!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The secret to intelligence is aesthetics, not Bayesian math.
&gt; &gt; Initially, this statement seems preposterous, but the argument in the
&gt; &gt; next paragraph is my whole point, so it merits careful reading (the
&gt; &gt; paragraph is marked with a * to show this is the crux of this post):
&gt;
&gt; &gt; *As regards the optimization of science, the leverage obtained from
&gt; &gt; setting the priors (Occam’s razor – aesthetics – art) is far greater
&gt; &gt; that that obtained from logical manipulations to update probabilities
&gt; &gt; based on additional empirical data (math). Remember, the aesthetic
&gt; &gt; principles used to set the priors (Occam’s razor) reduce a potentially
&gt; &gt; infinite set of possible theories to a manageable (finite) number,
&gt; &gt; whereas laborious mathematical probability updates based on incoming
&gt; &gt; empirical data (standard Bayesian theory) is only guaranteed to
&gt; &gt; converge on the correct theory after an infinite time, and even then
&gt; &gt; the reason for the convergence is entirely inexplicable.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The * paragraph suggests that aesthetics is the real basis of
&gt; &gt; intelligence, not Bayesian math, and further that aesthetic terminal
&gt; &gt; values are objectively real.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; For those who do initially find these claims preposterous, to help
&gt; &gt; overcome your initial disbelief, I point to a superb essay from well-
&gt; &gt; respected computer hacker, Paul Graham, who explains why aesthetics
&gt; &gt; plays a far greater role in science than many have realized:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ‘Taste for Makers’:<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html">http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html</a>
&gt;
&gt; &gt; As regards the second issue, I’d like to draw readers’ attention to
&gt; &gt; computer scientist Randy Pausch. Randy Pausch was a computer scientist
&gt; &gt; who developed the famous ‘Alice’ software to teach programming in a
&gt; &gt; virtual reality setting. He was a virtual reality expert, a professor
&gt; &gt; in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. In
&gt; &gt; August, 2007 he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and given 3-6
&gt; &gt; months to live. He gave a famous ‘Last Lecture’ which spread virally
&gt; &gt; (via ‘YouTube’) and inspired millions (this was followed by a book
&gt; &gt; ‘The Last Lecture’). He died on 25th July, 2008 .
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The Randy Pausch Memorial Footbridge connects the Gates Center for
&gt; &gt; Computer Science, with an adjacent arts building, symbolizing the
&gt; &gt; bridge between art and science.
