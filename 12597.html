<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I would say &quot;relative to a theory explaining the appearances&quot;, not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; just to the appearances.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well, it is relative to appearance, but people go on to theorise that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; these appearances are &quot;true reality&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  From Pythagoras to Proclus, &quot;intellectuals&quot; were proud not making that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; error. Aristotle is in part responsible for having made &quot;appearance&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality, coming back to the (provably wrong assuming comp) common sense 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in those matters.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (of course as you know we have to rely on common sense to go beyond 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; common sense).
</em><br />
<br />OK, but we have to start with some basic observation. It looks like objects 
<br />
are pulled to the Earth by a force - that is a basic observation, with a minimal 
<br />
implicit theory. General Relativity explains this differently, but it takes a rather 
<br />
complex series of arguments to arrive at GR. You can't call Newton stupid because 
<br />
of this. Similarly, your conclusion that there is no separate physical reality follows 
<br />
from a number of carefully argued steps, and at the start of the chain is the fact 
<br />
that there does appear to be a physical world... if there did not, we would not be 
<br />
having this or any other discussion. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Searle's theory is that consciousness is a result of actual brain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; activity, not Turing emulable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nooooo....... True: Searle's theory is that consciousness is a result 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of brain activity, but nowhere does Searle pretend that brain is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turing emulable. He just implicitly assume there is a notion of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actuality that no simulation can render, but does not address the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question of emulability. Then Searle is known for confusing level of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description (this I can make much more precise with the Fi and Wi, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the very important difference between computability (emulability) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and provability.
</em><br />
<br />Searle seems to accept that CT implies the brain is Turing emulable, but he 
<br />
does not believe that such an emulation would capture consciousness any 
<br />
more than a simulation of a thunderstorm will make you wet. Thus, a computer 
<br />
that could pass the Turing Test would be a zombie.
<br />
<br />See here for example:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Py104/searle.comp.html">http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Py104/searle.comp.html</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This theory is in keeping with the facts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah?
</em><br />
<br />At least, it isn't contradicted by any empirical facts, although neither is comp.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and allows us to keep materialism as well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Abandoning the comp hyp. OK.
</em><br />
<br />Searle is not a computationalist - does not believe in strong AI - but he does 
<br />
believe in weak AI. Penrose does not believe in weak AI either.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The main problem I see with it is that it allows for the existence of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; philosophical zombies, such as computers that act conscious but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; aren't. If this were possible it would mean that consciousness was an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; optional evolutionary development, i.e. we could all have evolved to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; live in a world exactly like our own, except we would be zombies. It's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not a knock-down argument, but it strikes me as odd that something as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; elaborate as consciousness could have evolved with no real benefit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. Of course COMP admits local zombie. One day it will be possible to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; build an artificial museum tourist, looking and commenting picture and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; art like a real tourist, which nobody will be able to distinguish from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a real tourist, but which will be only a sophisticated machine looking 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for presence of bomb in the museum.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With comp, consciousness has a big role, many big role (relative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sped-up of computations, give the ability to face personal relative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ignorance and alternate reality guessing and contemplation, ...). Cf I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; define in first approximation &quot;consciousness&quot; as the quale which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accompanies the instinctive believe in reality/self-consistency.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I agree there is no way to know whether you are being run in serial, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; parallel, etc. But mathematically multiple shorter parallel streams 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; have to be able to be glued, at least mathematically, for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; constituting a proper computation. If not literally anything can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; described as a computation. That is why I explicitly use a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; mathematical definition of computation, and then(and only then) try 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; to figure out what is a rock, for example.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Would you speculate that there is some indivisible atom of conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computation?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not at all. Consciousness, or instinctive belief in a reality (or in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oneself) and/or its associated first person quale needs an infinity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (even non countable) of computational histories. It depends in fine of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all nameable and unameable relations between number. Nothing deep here, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the primeness of 17 is also dependent in some logical way of the whole 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mutilicative structure of the natural numbers. Machine are lucky to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; able to prove the primeness of 17 in a finite time, because the *truth* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of even something as mundane than 17's primeness already escapes the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine capability of expression.
</em><br />
<br />You seemed to be disputing the idea that a serial computation cannot be broken 
<br />
up arbitrarily into parallel components, or suggesting that they need to be glued 
<br />
together in some way if they are. This seems to contradict most of the teleportation 
<br />
thought experiments we have discussed, in which it is sufficient for continuity of 
<br />
conscious that I vanish at A and a copy with close enough brain be created at B: 
<br />
there need be no glue, no causal connection (although of course it would help to 
<br />
make the copy if you had the right information, the result would be the same if the 
<br />
copy just came about by random processes), no regard for temporal or spatial 
<br />
displacement. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Because it doesn't seem that you need any &quot;glue&quot; to have a continuous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; stream of conscious in teleportation and mind uploading thought 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One day I will have to ask you what you really mean by computation. An 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrary sequence of sign can be interpreted as a computation (cf your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;rock&quot;). I am OK with that if, and only if you can show me the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal machine for which this sequence describes a computation. And 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you do that, each of those sign will need to have, at least,  an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical connection: there will be a number (finite piece of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information) capable of relying all the signs. This makes computations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non trivial object, and it is easy to prove that arbitrary sequence of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers/signs are NOT computations (there is an uncountable number of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrary sequences, and a countable number of third person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations. The glue I was thinking about is not physicalist glue, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but already arithmetical glue. Does that help?
</em><br />
<br />If there are more arbitrary sequences than third person computations, how 
<br />
does it follow that arbitrary sequences are not computations?
<br />
<br />Simplistically, I conceive of computations as mysterious abstract objects, like 
<br />
all other mathematical objects. Physical computers are devices which reflect 
<br />
these mathematical objects in order to achieve some practical purpose in the 
<br />
substrate of their implementation. A computer, an abacus, a set of fingers, 
<br />
pencil and paper can be used to compute 2+3=5, but these processes do not 
<br />
create the computation, they just make it accessible to the user. The fact that 
<br />
2 birds land on a tree in South America and 3 elephants drink at a watering hole 
<br />
in Africa, or 2 atoms move to the left in a rock and 3 atoms move to the right 
<br />
is essentially the same process as the abacus, but it is useless, trivial, lost in 
<br />
randomness, escapes the notice of theories of computation - and rightly so. 
<br />
However, what about the special case where a more complex version of 2+3=5 
<br />
on the abacus is conscious? Then I see no reason why the birds and the elephants 
<br />
or the atoms in a rock should not also implement the same consciousness, even 
<br />
though there is no possibility of interaction with the outside world due to the 
<br />
computation being lost in noise. What this really does is destroy the whole notion 
<br />
of physical supervenience: if you shot the elephants or smashed the rock, the 
<br />
computation could as easily spring from the new noise situation. Thus, it would 
<br />
appear that consciousness comes from computation as pure mathematical object, 
<br />
and is no more created by the physical process that addition is created by the 
<br />
physical process. Either that, or it isn't computational at all. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The real question is not &quot;does a rock implement computations&quot;, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question is &quot;does a rock implement computations in such a way as to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changed the relative measure of my (future) comp states in a relevant 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way?&quot; And for answering such question we need to know what a rock 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really is, and both physics and comp are not near at all to answer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this. Comp has less trouble here because it does not have to reify any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primary reality associated to the rock, which already emerge locally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from many non material computations.
</em><br />
<br />No, as I implied above, a rock makes no difference whatsoever to the measure of 
<br />
computation it might be seen as implementing.
