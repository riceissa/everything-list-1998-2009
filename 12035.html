<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Schaeffer maintained that the basis for antithesis is not that it was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an invention of Aristotle or anyone, but that the basis for antithesis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is reality itself, based on the God who is there (as opposed to not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being there).  The existence of the personal God answers the questions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Why is there something rather than nothing?  i.e. the question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the origin of the form of the universe, why does it &quot;make sense&quot;?  What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is the basis for the nature of reality and beauty?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Why is man the way he/she is?  Why is man able to have language and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do science, and make sense of the world?  Why is man able to love and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; figure out what is right?  What is the basis for meaning?  What is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; basis for mind?  How can persons know one another?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) Why is man able to know anything, and know that he knows what he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knows?  What is the basis for truth?  What is truth?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The first two questions are difficult, but they apply to God as much as the universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; despite ontological argument trickery whereby God is just defined as existing necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; (Gaunilo's answer to Anselm was that you can also just define a &quot;perfect island&quot; as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; island which exists necessarily, and therefore cannot not exist).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The other questions are easy: blind evolution made us this way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The word &quot;blind&quot; here is a statement of faith in impersonality.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would paraphrase Brent Meeker and ask, &quot;Why does 'blind' have to be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; default?&quot;  My response to Bruno addresses the assumption of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; impersonality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's Occam's Razor: why add the complication of guided evolution (or other theistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intervention) when you can explain a phenomenon without it? There doesn't seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be anything in biology that could not have come about through random processes in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe with physical laws such as our own. If God played any role in it he is at best
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely indifferent to the plight of his creatures. It suits blind evolution very well that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being devoured by a predator is as unpleasant as possible for the prey, but how does this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fit in with the plans of the gentle God of modern Christian apologists?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I'm not talking about the practice of science.  I'm talking about the
<br />
underlying beliefs.  The practice of science concentrates on what we
<br />
can see, the road past and present.  Our underlying beliefs are what
<br />
really count when it comes to what our destination is going to be.
<br />
This is the level at which Carl Woese is talking in his paper A New
<br />
Biology For A New Century.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, from the birth of modern science, we have taken a journey to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dispense with any kind of faith and try to be exhaustive in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automony and control.  Ironically we have abandoned rationality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (including antithesis), and we have abandoned ourselves to ourselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are lost in a silent sea of meaningless 0's and 1's, and man is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is why I said that when we put ourselves at the center of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worldview, it is a prison.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Er, science is usually taken as more concerned with rationality than religion and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; less anthropocentric than religion. Turning it around seems more a rhetorical ploy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; than a defensible position.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Science has to take rationality by faith.  Without a personal God both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; science and religion are anthropocentric because in such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; configuration there is no one else besides us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Science doesn't have to take anything by faith, even though scientists, being after all the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; species that created religions, often do. Science is at bottom just systematised common sense. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see storm clouds so I take my umbrella: that's meteorology. If you want to call it &quot;faith&quot; because there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no way of being certain that past storm cloud behaviour will be repeated in future, then what term
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would you reserve for the person who leaves his umbrella behind because he believes that today God
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will miraculously make the raindrops miss him?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />As I've mentioned in my other more recent posts, I'm talking about our
<br />
different beliefs underlying the fact that we live as though there is a
<br />
nature to reality, as though we have personal meaning and significance,
<br />
that there is a why to our existence, not just a how (evolution etc.
<br />
etc.)
<br />
<br />1) I say that a true belief in the existence of a personal God would
<br />
make it possible for me to take my eyes off of myself.
<br />
<br />2) You say that the false belief in the existence of a personal God
<br />
implies that looking at God is just a weird way of looking at myself.
<br />
<br />Both of the above statements are true.  We are talking about two
<br />
different underlying beliefs.
<br />
<br />But, I am saying that if you accept that the existence of a personal
<br />
God is false (in line with what #2 is talking about), modern
<br />
philosophy, literature, art, etc. has concluded that there is no basis
<br />
for personal meaning and significance.  Yes lab scientists and
<br />
engineers (I'm one) are perfectly content living in the lab, but
<br />
hopefully they too eventually wonder what's the point of it all.
<br />
<br />Tom
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for anthropocentricity without a personal God, I think that is a subterfuge. Of two groups of fish,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one believing that God is a big fish watching over them and the other lacking any such belief, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; group would you say is the more fish-centric?
