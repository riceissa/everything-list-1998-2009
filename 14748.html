Hi Russell, thanks very much for your reply.
<br />
<br />It's possible that I'm arguing at cross-purposes here, because I
<br />
gather that the whole reason for this list is to discuss models of the
<br />
universe that are very different from standard cosmology, but I hope
<br />
you won't mind if I pursue a defence of my specific claims at the N-
<br />
Category Café, which are intended to apply to reasoning about standard
<br />
cosmology.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There may be no physical process doing the sampling like pulling balls

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from an urn, but it is nevertheless a sampling. My attributes (eg

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attributes. Why not some hypothetical property like &quot;observer class&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as set up in this toy problem?
</em><br />
<br />Your height and weight can be understood as arising from a complicated
<br />
sequence of local, causal processes and a set of assumptions about
<br />
your initial conditions (at the very least, including the assumption
<br />
that you are human).  Whether some health statistician samples a sub-
<br />
population to which you belong, or whether you, in the process of
<br />
living your life, sample various probabilistic influences, the
<br />
relevant distribution needs to be *accessible* for this way of looking
<br />
at things to make sense.
<br />
<br />For example, suppose an Australian health statistician is forbidden to
<br />
leave Australia or to access data collected elsewhere, and that there
<br />
is no migration between countries.  Then the *global* distributions of
<br />
human height and weight become completely invisible to her, and
<br />
completely irrelevant to a child growing up in Australia.
<br />
<br />Suppose theory A claims that children who receive less than X
<br />
kilojoules a day will all have a height of less than 120 cm at age 15,
<br />
while theory B claims that half of these malnourished children will
<br />
nonetheless exceed 120 cm at age 15.  I currently have no reason to
<br />
prefer theory A over theory B, but I'd like to gather some empirical
<br />
data to see which one is right.
<br />
<br />But suppose I have access only to data about Australia, and it so
<br />
happens than in Australia, there are *no* children who receive less
<br />
than X kilojoules a day.  Then it doesn't matter what I do or how I
<br />
reason, I am never going to have a justification to distinguish
<br />
between theory A and theory B.  Noticing, say, that my own height
<br />
would have different relative frequencies in the global population
<br />
under the two theories is not informative, because there is no
<br />
relevant sense in which I can be viewed as a random sample of the
<br />
global population.
<br />
<br />A cosmologist who hopes to distinguish between cosmological theories
<br />
based on their predictions about future populations of Boltzmann
<br />
brains is in exactly the same situation.  The data to which she has
<br />
access does not discriminate between the theories.  It is pointless
<br />
for her to note that one theory implies that the overwhelming majority
<br />
of observers in the history of the universe will be Boltzmann brains,
<br />
while another theory reverses the proportions; she simply does not
<br />
have access to the global populations in question.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Given that humans are class 2 observers, all we have is the fact H:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    H := &quot;The number of class 2 observers in the history of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universe is at least of the order 10^10.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We also have the fact that I am of class 2.
</em><br />
<br />But there is no &quot;also&quot; here, because it is a necessary consequence of
<br />
H that someone exists who says &quot;I am of class 2&quot;.   To say &quot;I am of
<br />
class 2&quot; means no more and no less than:  &quot;The number of class 2
<br />
observers in the history of the universe is at least 1.&quot;  It does
<br />
*not* mean &quot;Someone was picked at random from the set of all observers
<br />
who have ever lived, or ever will live, and was found to be class 2&quot;.
<br />
<br />Ultimately this boils down to locality.  I, here and now, do not know
<br />
the future, so of course I can't discriminate between rival theories
<br />
that make identical predictions about the present but different
<br />
predictions about the future.
