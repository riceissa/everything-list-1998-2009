<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Message -----
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From: &quot;Jeanne Houston&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To: &quot;Stathis Papaioannou&quot; , r.standish.domain.name.hidden
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Subject: Re: Many worlds theory of immortality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Date: Tue, 10 May 2005 07:19:01 -0400
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I didn't read the article but I am aware of the conceptual basis for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this idea. To answer your question, it is possible that altered 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states, including those caused by mental illness, can allow the brain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to pick-up information from elsewhere. However, the differentiation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be made between such elsewhere (or elsewhen) awarenesses and true 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hallucinations (the same goes for dreams. Some people postulate that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some dreams could be awarenesses of other realities but then use lucid 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dreaming as an example. Right idea, wrong type of dream). Many of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hallucinations common to schizophrenics are based on outside stimuli 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; triggering a preconvieved viewpoint which is then externalized as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hallucination. For example, such a patient may be on his way to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pharmacy to get a prescription filled and see a billboard for an auto 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; body repair shop that features a close-up shot of a man cowering in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fear that says &quot;Watch Out! The Morons are Out There!&quot; (a true 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; advertisement). This billboard could stimulate a reaction in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; patient based upon the apprehension that the doctor may not know what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he's doing and prescribed the wrong medication. This reaction could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manifest itself as a merely a thought, &quot;Yeah. And I bet my shrink's a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moron too!&quot; or it could extend into the outside world if the patient 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looks back at the sign. Suddenly the sign could have its own response 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to this sudden thought that the patient's psychiatrist is a moron and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could read something like &quot;Yes! Your shrink's a moron and he's out to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get you!&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is based on research done by Janssen Pharmaceutica 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/aug/schizophrenia/">http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/aug/schizophrenia/</a> in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the development of a simulator of the schizophrenic experience. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulator was created with the input of actual patients to make it as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realistic as possible, and I have used it before, as part of my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; research. In this case, the hallucinations of the schizophrenic are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based on internal apprehensions and are not observations of some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parallel reality. The tendency should be resisted to simply assume 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that just because someone is perceiving something that we aren't, that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what they're are perceiving is somehow linked to some interdimensional 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge or higher reality. If one wants to take that tact, then they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must also engage in the very real hard work of substantiating exactly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what the nature of these perceptions are and if they have any kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective basis. To do that takes a considerable amount of work. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Otherwise the question goes unanswered and any consideration of what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is or isn't going on is simply unbridled speculation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hope that helps. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I'm not one to shy away from what others would perceive to be &quot;unbridled 
<br />
speculation,&quot; however there are a few fundamental problems with the idea 
<br />
set forth by Jeanne.  First, to the best that I understand, there is no 
<br />
evidence that we will ever be able to access the information of the 
<br />
parallel outcomes (worlds) in question.  We can access the processing 
<br />
power of the other worlds, but the laws of physics seem to prevent our 
<br />
pulling information from another &quot;world&quot; into our world given the 
<br />
collapse that happens at the end of a computation (when we get our 
<br />
result from a quantum computer).  So the idea seems to be prohibited by 
<br />
the laws of physics.  And lets not even get into the proof problem.  
<br />
It's sort of like UFO's.  Is it easier to believe that someone  is 
<br />
crazy/seeing things/misinterpreting stimuli, or that they really are 
<br />
seeing other worlds/aliens?  Spectacular claims  require spectacular 
<br />
proof, and I don't see how this idea presents the prospect of any 
<br />
proof.  Perhaps, if someone could in a statistically significant way 
<br />
predict future events or the location of hidden items, like remote 
<br />
viewing, could provide evidence, but there would still have to be some 
<br />
way to establish the link between that phenomena and other worlds.
