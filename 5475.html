<br />I don't believe there are any grounds for assuming that, so the problem

<br />I don't agree with this. I can imagine an infinite 2D lattice of cells, 
<br />
seeded with the binary digits of pi, and ask the following question: if the 
<br />
rules of Conway's Life were applied to this lattice, what would it look 
<br />
like after a million ticks of the clock? There's an objective answer to 
<br />
this question, and that answer exists in Platonia. I believe that this 
<br />
implies that the universe I just described (and all other possible CA 
<br />
universes, and much more) exists in Platonia. I define &quot;time&quot; as the 
<br />
&quot;ticking of the clock&quot; in such computational worlds, so I believe time 
<br />
exists in Platonia. (Of course, in another sense, Platonia exists in a 
<br />
timeless &quot;all at once&quot;. This is similar to the way that time exists in the 
<br />
&quot;block universe&quot; of relativity theory.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is no conditional probability for your

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;next experience given what you have experienced now. A valid question is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What is the probability that you will be in a state P that contains the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;memory that you have been in a state P'.
</em><br />
<br />I find this way of looking at things very confusing. What do you mean by 
<br />
&quot;you&quot; in this formulation? Is &quot;you&quot; a thing that jumps from state to state? 
<br />
If so, then we have some form of time. If not, what is this &quot;you&quot;? 
<br />
Obviously it is something that can be said to be &quot;in a state P&quot; (otherwise, 
<br />
you wouldn't consider your above question valid). But what does it mean for 
<br />
&quot;you to be in a state P&quot;? If it's true that &quot;you are in a state P&quot;, are you 
<br />
just timelessly in state P, or what? How can you even talk about something 
<br />
&quot;being&quot; without talking about time?
