&nbsp;The universe is not just black and white...
<br />
Or another way to state that is that two truth values (true and false)
<br />
are insufficient to describe all propositions.
<br />
<br />I propose the following:
<br />
If the universe exists and if for all things X and Y, the utterance &quot;X
<br />
contains Y&quot; is &quot;proposition,&quot; then the universe must &quot;operate&quot; with
<br />
more than the two usual truth values, true and false.
<br />
<br />Consequently, since the universe does exist, and if we assume that &quot;X
<br />
contains Y&quot; is decidable, then at least three truth values are
<br />
necessary to describe the state of all &quot;propositions.&quot;
<br />
<br />First the definitions and then the argument for the above proposition.
<br />
IMHO, the only room you might have for disagreement is in the
<br />
definitions, as the argument is valid.
<br />
<br />Definitions
<br />
Proposition
<br />
Define a proposition to be something that can be decided, given enough
<br />
resources (such as computational power), and mapped to a single truth
<br />
value. An example of a proposition is &quot;I perceive the sky to be blue&quot;
<br />
as that is decidedly true (in good weather). Another is &quot;I perceive
<br />
the sky to be green,&quot; which is decidedly false. A proposition is a
<br />
statement that is decidable, meaning there is a &quot;best&quot; truth value to
<br />
assign to that statement. If there are only two truth values then an
<br />
example of a non-proposition is &quot;this statement is false,&quot; the liar's
<br />
paradox. Later, we will see that &quot;If the universe exists then it
<br />
operates on more than two truth values&quot; is a proposition as well
<br />
because it will be decidedly true.
<br />
<br />TV
<br />
Let TV be a set, to be determined, consisting of truth values,
<br />
possibly such as TV = {true, false}, that represents all truth values -
<br />
sufficient- to allow for -all- propositions to have a unique,
<br />
assignable truth value, i.e., sufficient to decide all propositions.
<br />
<br />The universe
<br />
For the purposes of this argument, the universe is the totality of all
<br />
that exists. Remark: what exists isn't completely clear and people
<br />
disagree on what exists; some, for example, believe that nothing
<br />
exists save themselves; this is called solipsism. Nevertheless, the
<br />
definition of universe stands as whatever that totality of all that
<br />
exists is.
<br />
<br />Thing
<br />
X is a thing if, and only if, X is or can be an object of thought.
<br />
(Slightly modified version of definition 3 from dictionary.com.)
<br />
<br />Containment
<br />
One thing contains another thing (where the 'another thing' is allowed
<br />
to be the first thing) if and only if the first thing has all of the
<br />
second thing's contents or constituent parts. In other words, all
<br />
content and/or constituent parts within the second thing is also
<br />
content of the first thing. (Slightly modified version of definition 3
<br />
from dictionary.com.) Examples: the solar system contains the planet
<br />
earth and water molecules contain hydrogen. The primary example is the
<br />
universe: the universe contains -all- things.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Argument
<br />
Overview
<br />
The argument is an augmented form of Russell's theorem, sometimes
<br />
referred to as Russell's paradox, which proves that in Zermelo Frankel
<br />
set theory there is no set which contains every other set. The twist
<br />
is, this time, when talking about the universe, we know it exists.
<br />
However, we'll use the fact that a particular statement is a
<br />
proposition except it is neither true nor false. Recall that a
<br />
proposition must have a decidable truth value in order to be a
<br />
proposition; so since this statement is a proposition, there must be
<br />
at least one extra truth value that this proposition is most
<br />
accurately mapped to in TV.
<br />
<br /><br />The case for the universe operating on more than two truth values.
<br />
<br />Premise 1
<br />
The universe as defined exists.
<br />
<br />Premise 2
<br />
For all things X and Y, the utterance &quot;X contains Y&quot; is a proposition.
<br />
(Intuitively, I think the proposition &quot;X contains Y&quot; is 'usually'
<br />
false.)
<br />
<br /><br />Suppose the universe exists and for all things X and Y, the utterance
<br />
&quot;X contains Y&quot; is a proposition. Consider the thing that contains all
<br />
things that don't contain themselves. Let's denote this thing by the
<br />
letter D. D is a thing because it is now an object of thought. The
<br />
universe, which contains all things, and itself exists by assumption,
<br />
contains D in particular as D is a thing.
<br />
<br />Now consider the utterance &quot;D contains D.&quot; By assumption, &quot;D contains
<br />
D&quot; is a proposition. (X and Y are both D in this particular case.)
<br />
<br />&quot;D contains D&quot; can't be true
<br />
Suppose that &quot;D contains D&quot; is a true proposition. Then, by the
<br />
definition of D, &quot;D does not contain D&quot;. Therefore, &quot;D contains D&quot; is
<br />
false. Since &quot;D contains D&quot; can't be both true and false, our original
<br />
assumption that &quot;D contains D&quot; is a true proposition is incorrect.
<br />
Consequently, &quot;D contains D&quot; is not a true proposition.
<br />
<br />&quot;D contains D&quot; can't be false
<br />
A similar argument shows that &quot;D contains D&quot; can't be false. If we
<br />
suppose &quot;D contains D&quot; is false, then &quot;D does does not contain D&quot; is
<br />
true. However, by the definition of D, &quot;D contains D&quot; is then true
<br />
since D contains all things that don't contain themselves. This
<br />
contradiction implies that &quot;D contains D&quot; is not false.
<br />
<br />Conclusion
<br />
So we've established that &quot;D contains D&quot; is neither true nor false. By
<br />
premise 2, &quot;D contains D&quot; is a proposition; by the definition of
<br />
proposition, &quot;D contains D&quot; must have a decidable truth value. Since
<br />
this truth value is neither true nor false, there must be a third
<br />
truth value which &quot;D contains D&quot; is assigned to. This completes the
<br />
argument.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />BTW, I apologize if this gets posted twice; I sent it with Thunderbird
<br />
40 minutes ago and it's still not appearing so I'm &quot;manually&quot; posting
<br />
it.
