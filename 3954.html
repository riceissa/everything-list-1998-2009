<br />
I've read the paper more closely and I think I understand it somewhat
<br />
better.
<br />
<br />The paradox in the paper is actually closely related to the comments with
<br />
which I concluded my earlier message.  What they are saying is that if
<br />
we are part of a Poincare recurrence, it is overwhelmingly likely that
<br />
the past is false.  And worse, it is overwhelmingly likely that the past
<br />
is inconsistent; that we were or are on a trajectory that could not be
<br />
continued all the way back to the Big Bang.
<br />
<br />That is because the entropy at the time of the Big Bang was very low
<br />
compared to today, so the vast majority of today-like worlds have no
<br />
plausible continuation back to a Big Bang.
<br />
<br />The specific example they give is, what if the cosmic microwave
<br />
background was 10 degrees rather than 2.7 degrees?  If we think about a
<br />
Poincare recurrence in the process of forming, time running backwards,
<br />
a hotter than usual microwave background will not cause any problems.
<br />
You could still get planets being un-destroyed, life becoming un-extinct
<br />
and running backwards, etc.  Eventually you get back to the present day.
<br />
And we look around and see a universe that's at 10 degrees.
<br />
<br />That's a big problem.  There's no way our universe could have formed from
<br />
a Big Bang if the microwave background was that hot.  It means the Big
<br />
Bang was completely different, we wouldn't see the elemental abundances we
<br />
see today, galaxies wouldn't have formed properly, and so on.  We would
<br />
see a world which was inconsistent with its putative past.
<br />
<br />Yet we don't.  Broadly speaking we seem to live in a universe to which we
<br />
can ascribe a reasonably consistent model of the past.  This contradicts
<br />
what we would predict if we lived in a Poincare recurrence, hence we
<br />
probably don't.
<br />
<br />Now you might say, so what, the whole idea that we formed in this way
<br />
was so absurd that no one would ever take it seriously anyway.  But the
<br />
authors of this paper seem to be saying that if you assume that there is
<br />
a positive cosmological constant (as the cosmological evidence seems to
<br />
show), eventually we will get into this de Sitter state, and based on
<br />
some assumptions (which I didn't follow) we really should see Poincare
<br />
recurrences.  Then by the anthropic principle we should be overwhelmingly
<br />
likely to be living in one.  Hence there may be something wrong with
<br />
our cosmological theories.
<br />
<br />Another point, Tim is of course right that the time for one of these
<br />
recurrences to happen is enormous.  The formula they give is
<br />
t = exp(S1-S2), where S1 is the entropy of the equilibrium state, which
<br />
they estimate as 10^120 for the de Sitter universe, and S2 is the entropy
<br />
of the state we are going to chance into, which they say would be about
<br />
10^10 for time near the Big Bang.  So this means that the time until
<br />
something interesting happens is about exp(10^120).  The authors comment,
<br />
&quot;This seems like an absurdly big time between interesting events, which by
<br />
comparison last for a very short time. Nevertheless dismissing such long
<br />
times as 'unphysical' may be a symptom of extreme temporal provincialism.&quot;
<br />
<br />As far as the de Sitter model, the references I have found agree that
<br />
it has rapid, exponential expansion, with no beginning and no ending,
<br />
and that it is a &quot;steady state&quot; model of the universe, which looks the
<br />
same to all observers at all times.  However some authors say that it has
<br />
no matter, and others say that it has a constant density of mass-energy,
<br />
and I'm not sure how to reconcile that.  In this paper the authors do a
<br />
coordinate change where the de Sitter model can be considered to have a
<br />
constant volume and density, so that sooner or later recurrences should,
<br />
well, recur.
