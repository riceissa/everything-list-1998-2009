Lee Corbin writes (replying to Jesse Mazer):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Obviously my sadness is not because the death of the copy here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; means that there are only 10^10^29 - 1 copies of that person...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;By the way, this figure 10^10^29 is a *distance*. It is, according
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to Tegmark, very approximately how close in terms of meters the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nearest exact copy of you who is reading this is.  (And it doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;matter whether one uses meters or lightyears.)
</em><br />
<br />A strange fact: when you get up to numbers that big, a light year is as many 
<br />
times bigger than a metre as it always is, but the double exponential 
<br />
notation makes the difference between the two look negligible. Can anyone 
<br />
say how widely accepted Tegmark's infinite universe model is amongst 
<br />
cosmologists?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let me resort to another torture experiment. Suppose that I invite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you into my house, take you down to the torture chamber, and allow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you to look through a tiny peephole inside the entire steel-encased
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chamber. You see some Nazis torturing a little girl, and her screams
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are reproduced electronically so that you hear them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You are appalled. You beg me to dissolve the chamber and put an end
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the atrocity. But then I say the following peculiar thing to you:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Ah, but you see, this is an *exact* molecular---down to the QM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;details---reenactment of an incident that happened in 1945. So you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;see, since it's identical, it doesn't matter whether the little girl
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suffers once or twice.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />This brings up an interesting conundrum that I raised three or four torture 
<br />
experiments ago. Given 10 instantiations of a person having an unpleasant 
<br />
experience E (in the terminology of mild-mannered Hal Finney, who eschews 
<br />
torture even in thought experiments), for example 10 sentient programs 
<br />
running in parallel, is it better, if we aim to reduce suffering, to (a) 
<br />
terminate 9 of the 10 programs and leave one still running and experiencing 
<br />
E, or (b) stop 5 of the 10 programs from experiencing E, but leave them 
<br />
running, and leave the other 5 programs continuing to experience E?
<br />
(Assume for the sake of argument that, as with dogs, painless termination is 
<br />
better than continuing to live with pain. Why we automatically assume this 
<br />
for dogs but not for humans is another question.)
<br />
<br />If you do the total suffering equation assuming that each instantiation is 
<br />
separate, (a) is better. But I would argue that if you are one of the 
<br />
suffering victims, (a) does you no good at all: subjectively, you will 
<br />
continue to suffer, since the one remaining program that is running will 
<br />
serve as continuation for any of the 9 terminated ones. In fact, there is no 
<br />
way for someone inside the simulated system to know that any of the 
<br />
instantiations had been terminated, as long as at least one keeps running. 
<br />
On the other hand, with (b) there is subjectively a 50% probability that 
<br />
your suffering will end. If you simply added up the total number of 
<br />
instantiations and attempted to minimise the number experiencing E, you 
<br />
would be doing the victim(s) a great disservice. Whether you say there is 
<br />
one victim or 10 to begin with is a moot point, but the conclusion still 
<br />
stands.
