Hello, Quentin:
<br />
we agree in spite of a different formulation:
<br />
<br />&quot;death&quot; - I wrote about it as a process in a concept, while I feel you refer
<br />
to the 'death' of a 'person' or whatever, as a state.
<br />
<br />The person (or whatever) is a complex entity of its (his?) interconnected
<br />
and self-reflective (yes, even 'lifeless' features) components - in
<br />
connection with &quot;the rest of the world&quot; and when &quot;death&quot; (my semantics)
<br />
steps in - such complex entity starts ;losing connection and accordingly
<br />
ceases to exist altogether (as in its entirety). Portions of it do not
<br />
qualify for the (entire) complex entity subjected to the 'death' (your
<br />
semantics) process. It may continue to be something partially similar, but
<br />
not anymore the entire complex. I have to differentiate in this respect
<br />
between &quot;essential&quot; and &quot;non essential&quot; ingredients: a limb does not seem to
<br />
be essential to a person, so the loss of a leg does not destroy the 'person'
<br />
complexity into death. Even a (larger) part of the neuronic brain is not
<br />
necessarily 'death-inducing', nor the partial loss of mentality. I have yet
<br />
to find the criteria for identifying the kinds of 'ingredients' the loss
<br />
(destruction, paralysis, dysfunction) of which we may qualify for
<br />
'death-inducing' - I do not rely on the ongoing medical terms which allow
<br />
'near-death' and reversible 'clinical' death (coma?) and consider the
<br />
medically pronounceable death in a physiological restriction.
<br />
I have no acceptable (for me) identification for &quot;life&quot;. For sure I consider
<br />
it wider than the churning of C-H-O-N based molecules in the Terrestrial
<br />
biosphere.
<br />
<br />Feeling identical with that kid of 5 is a funny notion: emotionally it is
<br />
memory of that early &quot;I&quot; in my present terms, mentality is the present one,
<br />
not that 5 year old (logic, experience, cognitive inventory, even use of
<br />
memes) and - allegedly none of my present 'atoms' in my 'body' is the same
<br />
anymore. So what is what I feel as &quot;MYSELF&quot;? In spite of Saibal's 'killing
<br />
of a person by adding too much new information to his experience'??? I am
<br />
still 'alive'(?) and feel identical to that (Saibal-killed) infant. And when
<br />
I die, that kid also dies (with/in me).
<br />
<br />This question of the two of us is real, within common sense normalcy, no
<br />
teleportation or duplication involved.
<br />
<br />Regards
<br />
<br />John M

<br /><br /><br />Hi John,
<br />
<br />Le Vendredi 30 Juin 2006 21:06, John M a Ã©crit :
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An interesting observation from Saibal that increasing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the info-input to one's brain kills person(ality?).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would not say &quot;dead&quot;,  rather 'changed' as into some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different one. (It is a gradual change, death is being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought of as something more abrupt and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comprehensive.)
</em><br />
<br />For me death means to never be conscious again... never. That's why death is
<br />
meaningless in a 1st person point of view, because it is impossible by
<br />
definition to feel being dead, because if you could feel being dead, it
<br />
means
<br />
you're not (dead), if you were by definition you couldn't feel/experience
<br />
it.
<br />
<br />So &quot;the you&quot; at 3 years old could not be dead, because you remember being it
<br />
(in your &quot;bones&quot;). That's why I think speaking of 1st person
<br />
experience/identity as being illusionary is a bad step for explaining 1st
<br />
person experience, which is the only thing we ever experience, the only real
<br />
thing we can be sure of.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In spite of that, knowing that when as a 5-yo I had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different person-ality and ideas, brainfunction and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emotions, I still feel NOW identity with THAT PERSON.
</em><br />
<br />I totally agree with this. And I think speaking (bis repetita) of 1st person
<br />
experience/continuous identity through time as being an illusion can not
<br />
explain the feeling of being &quot;a self&quot; every day till ... ? ;)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The best
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; John M
</em><br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
Quentin
