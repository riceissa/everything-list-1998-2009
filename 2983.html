<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The formulations are as numerous than the philosophical systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; For a materialist the problem is to explain what are the necessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and sufficient conditions for having the feeling of pain in a leg.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consider me a materialist then, I suppose.
</em><br />
<br />In the literature a materialist is someone who believes in a 
<br />
physical (or material) universe, and nothing else.
<br />
<br />I called ``weak materialist&quot; someone who believes in a physical
<br />
universe and also in something else (number, game, justice, for
<br />
naming a few examples).
<br />
<br />Now I am afraid that even ``weak materialism&quot; is hardly compatible
<br />
with computationalism (which you are using in your TOE approach).
<br />
<br />Most on this list, I think, are willing to accept the idea that
<br />
&quot;materiality&quot; occurs in mathematical structures, as seen from
<br />
inside by some SSA.
<br />
What I try to show is that, if you accept the comp hypothesis (under
<br />
the form of the survival through digital substitution, with survival
<br />
in the &quot;great mother&quot; psychology sense) then you must substitute
<br />
the mathematical structure by sort of continuous sheaf of possible
<br />
first person histories. This happens at a very basic level, and I
<br />
illustrate it formally with the logic of self-reference in my thesis).
<br />
In the process I illustrate the loss of explicativeness of the
<br />
concept of &quot;empirical realities&quot;, but I have also a direct 
<br />
argument.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The mind body admit a lot of subproblem, like what is free-will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;An illusion.
</em><br />
<br />An illusion? That is a rather quick answer. Let us not enter into
<br />
that perenial debate. Perhaps I should ask you exemple of what is
<br />
not an illusion, what is your ontology. 
<br />
I should have you ask this before, if your TOE is a cellular
<br />
automata, what does execute it?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  is there an afterdeath,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes.
</em><br />
<br />That rather quick too! Amazing for a materialist, plausible for
<br />
a computationalist, I guess. But then I don't believe
<br />
materialism being compatible with computationalism.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Qualia are internal states.
</em><br />
<br />Right! (imo). But &quot;internal&quot; in which sense? Would you agree that
<br />
it is related with the first person viewpoint.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ok, thank you Bruno.  I think I understand the terminology now (first and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;third person viewpoints), but I fail to see the importance of it all.
</em><br />
<br />If you want I open a new thread. I send you a post with one question.
<br />
Normally if you are computationalist you will answer yes. The same
<br />
for the second post, etc. At the end you will understand (or at least 
<br />
to have an idea) the importance of it all. OK? If you prefer, read the
<br />
UDA. You can ask me question or challenge me on the reasoning.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;For the record: I think the third person point of view does not exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Confirmation is never permanent and can always be unconfirmed.  (i.e. One of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the observers on the phone can later admit that she or he was lying, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;confused.)  For each of us, there is only the first person.
</em><br />
<br />We certainly have some acquaintance with ourself from the first person
<br />
point of view (and even the third ). I dont' see why we should not trying
<br />
most objective possible theories of realities, though. 
<br />
Of course such theories are always sort of &quot;anticipation&quot;, but that 
<br />
game is part of science and even consciousness. 
<br />
Nevertheless I believe that the fact that 17 is prime is 
<br />
3-person (objective) verifiable. It is a sharable
<br />
reality.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If your cellular automata generates everythings it will do it in an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; extraordinary terrible redundant way. The computational indeterminacy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; must be quantified on the set of *all* consistent continuations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Huh?  What does that mean?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Let us take your cellular automata which generates everything.
<br />
You will be generated at some &quot;moment&quot; (where the moment can be defined
<br />
in the universal cellular automata terms).
<br />
The problem is that you will be generated infinitely often, and your
<br />
average &quot;next&quot; first person point of view depends on all the consistent
<br />
computational continuations generated by your universal automata.
<br />
(See the UDA, or answer yes for my thread proposition if you want).
<br />
The basic point comes from the fact that from you first person
<br />
point of view you cannot be aware of 10^billion moments between the 
<br />
generation of similar next instant.
<br />
Like in quantum physics there is eventually a sum over infinities 
<br />
of histories which are needed here.
<br />
<br />Bruno
