<br />
I can see why Jacques is an enthusiastic supporter of the notion that
<br />
our entire experience is a single &quot;observer moment&quot; unconnected with
<br />
any others. For one thing, if it were true, his argument against QTI
<br />
would work i.e. the observer moment we do see would need to be
<br />
proximally maximal - ie of high relative probability in the space of
<br />
all such observer moments. This would rule out experiencing observer
<br />
moments of advanced age.
<br />
<br />On a side note, can anyone explain to me why the observer moment
<br />
should be of someone in their mid-thirties, rather than of a baby in
<br />
its first six months of life? Such infant observer moments are
<br />
probably the simplest compatible with conscious existence, and hence
<br />
the most probable.
<br />
<br />I'm not entirely sure why James Higgo is so enthusiastic. Presumably
<br />
it is related to his belief in Bhuddism, but I haven't followed the
<br />
connection.
<br />
<br />I have tended to react with charges of solipsism to this idea, mainly
<br />
because its seems that some of its proponents are unwilling to follow
<br />
through on the ideas consequences, and rather dismiss them as
<br />
meaningless questions. This is like the solipsist argument that the
<br />
real doesn't actually exists, so there is no point discussing it, or
<br />
the religious argument (not _all_ religions) that the world is just so
<br />
because God made it that way.
<br />
<br />So lets follow up on some of the consequences:
<br />
<br />The idea of &quot;observer moment&quot; initially presupposes that the moment
<br />
has no temporal duration - it is instantaneous. The problem with this,
<br />
is that there is no time whatsoever in which the observer can
<br />
experience its moment. In particular, the observer is unable to
<br />
implement a Turing machine, hence computationalism is false.
<br />
<br />(Incidently, there are two converse assertions making up
<br />
computationalism. That Turing computability is necessary and
<br />
sufficient for consciousness. This implies that all conciousness is Turing
<br />
emulable. The former clause is simply a statement of the Church-Turing
<br />
thesis in its weakest form, and is fairly uncontroversial - it is
<br />
almost a definition. The latter clause, sufficiency, is actually a
<br />
very strong form of the CT-thesis, and personally, I don't believe
<br />
it. Consequently, I would describe myself as a semi-computationalist!
<br />
However, even semi-computationlism is false if this single observer
<br />
moment is durationless.)
<br />
<br />If we then introduce the concept of an extended observer moment with duration,
<br />
what duration should we choose? If shorter than a &quot;quantum of
<br />
conscious time&quot; (about 1/10th of a second), then how does one explain
<br />
the accrual of knowledge about the observer moment. How can you be
<br />
aware of historical data? If longer, then how do you explain change
<br />
observed in the world. If change is to be included in the &quot;observer
<br />
moment&quot;, why does the moment have to have finite duration at all?
<br />
Could it not be semi-infinite? (or a least a lifetime - whatever that
<br />
is). Unless there is some &quot;Groundhog day&quot; scenario (from the movie of
<br />
that name, where Tom Hanks gets trapped into living the same day over
<br />
and over again), surely in this case we get back to my picture of the
<br />
(quantum) history being the primordial object. Time is a psychological
<br />
entity. I have no problem with this. If one accepts Bruno Marchal's
<br />
conclusion, Physics and Psychology are ontologically reversed. All
<br />
physical concepts are fundamentally psychological phenomena. I suspect
<br />
that this conclusion actually follows from the Plenitude + Anthropic
<br />
Principle, without the need of some of Bruno's strong AI type
<br />
assumptions, but that remains to be seen.
<br />
<br />In a quantum history view of the world, the lack of extremely aged observations
<br />
does not contradict QTI (Jacques' argument).
