</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Let us define &quot;faith&quot; by belief in unproved or unprovable truth. The

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you enlarge the sense of &quot;physics&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a somewhat idiosyncratic definition of &quot;faith&quot;.  It makes my

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief that I'm married to a woman named Marsha a matter of faith,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since that is unprovable in the logical or mathematical sense of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proof.  On the other hand if you accept the commonsense or legal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standard of proof, then belief in physical reality is very well 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proven.




</em><br />
I am not sure we can apply the common sense or legal standard of proof.
<br />
Having said this, again I DO agree that a belief in physical reality is 
<br />
very well founded or &quot;legally proved&quot; ...
<br />
But I was talking about a *primitive* physical reality. Of course, in 
<br />
all plausibility, we have been &quot;programmed&quot; by years of evolution to 
<br />
attribute sense or reality to what we perceive, and until QM or comp 
<br />
this kind of belief works well FAPP (For All Practical Purpose), but 
<br />
here we approach fundamental questions so we have to introduce nuances: 
<br />
in particular we have evidence for a physical reality---I have never 
<br />
doubt this--- but this does not mean we have evidence that physical 
<br />
reality is *primitive* (a much stronger statement which is addressed to 
<br />
and by philosophers or theologians or fundamental scientists, not to 
<br />
busy people or animal trying to survive in their local neighborhood.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'd say let us continue to define &quot;faith&quot; as a belief in the absence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of evidence or contrary to the weight of evidence. All that is needed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to pursue comp and AR is an hypothesis - not a belief.


</em><br />
I have never met someone having belief in the absence of evidence. Even 
<br />
concerning insane or mentally ill people, I suspect they have internal 
<br />
and just incorrect (or 1-incorrectly interpreted) evidence.
<br />
Of course comp is an hypothesis. Axioms for theories are always 
<br />
hypothesis (although some nuance can be added at some point but I would 
<br />
say that this can be premature here).




<br />
You say also in another post:

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is the basis for truth?  What is truth?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; True (and false) are abstract values we assign to sentences for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purpose of making inferences.



</em><br />
Actually many logicians would define logic by the art/science of making 
<br />
inference independently of ascribing truth value on sentences or 
<br />
propositions. From A &amp; B you can deduce A, says the logician, 
<br />
independently of the truth of A or B.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In application we usually try to assign &quot;true&quot; to those sentences 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that express facts supported by evidence -



</em><br />
In daily application, ok. Not in research on fundamental things where 
<br />
we put anything in doubt, if only by cartesian methodology.





<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless we are religious, in which case we may ignore evidence and go 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with revelation.



</em><br />
Of course here, given the results I usually refer too, but also given 
<br />
the history of theology (on which I do allusion too) I would just say 
<br />
&quot;... unless we have been victim of some tyranny confusing state and 
<br />
religion, collective brainwashing, etc.&quot;.




<br />
Here you quote Frank Wilczek, the guy who made very interesting work on 
<br />
condensed matter and open my interest in axiomatic quantum field 
<br />
theory, something which has helped me to get some concrete view on what 
<br />
could be a quantum topological computer:


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The reason that there is Something rather than Nothing is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nothing is unstable.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       -- Frank Wilczek, Nobel Laureate Physics 2004.



</em><br />
OK, that's funny, but that shows only that the quantum nothingness is 
<br />
not nothing. This does not explain why there is something, because we 
<br />
have to ask why is there a &quot;nothing&quot; obeying QM.  Note that through the 
<br />
work I have completed I am proposing something very specific, perhaps 
<br />
wrong but testable, and which, well,  does not explain why there is 
<br />
something, but which at least explains why, once we accept numbers and 
<br />
their additive and multiplicative structures, there will be stable 
<br />
belief in quanta and qualia.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Part of it makes sense to us because we evolved to make sense of it.


</em><br />
True, but begging the fundamental question.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quantum mechanics doesn't really &quot;make sense&quot;, it's just an inference 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from what does make sense.


</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, but unless we abandon the &quot;search of knowledge&quot;, it is up to us to 
<br />
make sense of the QM. The MWI helps in that direction, for example. 
<br />
Then with comp we see that *classical* physics does *no more* make 
<br />
sense at all and many (not yet all to be sure) quantum weird facts are 
<br />
no more weird in that setting.

<br />
&quot;Making sense&quot; is relative. Many people find the idea of an all-loving 
<br />
all-powerful God letting his son being tortured sense-full, I guess the 
<br />
reason is just that most people take sense to be the opinion of the 
<br />
majority or even just the teaching of their parents.

<br />
But (in free country) we are free to think twice, and to put in doubt 
<br />
any theory and to pursue the research ...
