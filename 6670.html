I'd like to take advantage of having a bona fide physicist on the list to
<br />
ask a question about decoherence and its implications for the MWI.

<br />I understand that there is research into attempts to measure decoherence,
<br />
using special conditions and experimental arrangements.  As you say, in
<br />
ordinary situations, environmental influences make observing any effects
<br />
from other branches effectively impossible.  But it is possible to set
<br />
up experiments that decohere &quot;gradually&quot; and where they can measure any
<br />
residual interference effects, comparing the results to the predictions
<br />
of QM.
<br />
<br />As far as I know, these experiments so far are consistent with QM theory.
<br />
Of course it's always possible that departures would show up eventually,
<br />
which is part of why they do the experiments.  But I would assume that
<br />
most physicists would not be astonished to find that QM continued to
<br />
work correctly no matter how far out these experiments were pushed.
<br />
In fact, that would presumably be the expected result, and any confirmed
<br />
departures from QM predictions would be surprising and even revolutionary.
<br />
<br />If this is true, then how can a physicist not accept the MWI?  Isn't that
<br />
just a matter of taking this decoherence phenomenon to a (much) larger
<br />
degree?  Either you have to believe that at some point decoherence stops
<br />
following the rules of QM, or you have to believe that the mathematics
<br />
describes physical reality.  And the mathematical equations predict the
<br />
theoretical existence of the parallel yet unobservable branches.
<br />
<br />Of course, given that they are in practice unobservable, a degree of
<br />
agnosticism is perhaps justifiable for the working physicist.  He doesn't
<br />
have to trouble himself with such difficult questions, in practice.
<br />
But still, if he believes the theory, and he applies it in his day to
<br />
day work, shouldn't he believe the implications of the theory?
<br />
<br />To me, it almost requires believing a contradiction to expect that
<br />
decoherence experiments will follow the predictions of QM, without also
<br />
expecting that the more extreme versions of those predictions will be
<br />
true as well, which would imply the reality of the MWI.  You either have
<br />
to believe that a sufficiently accurate decoherence experiment would
<br />
find a violation of QM, or you have to believe in the MWI.
<br />
<br />Don't you?
