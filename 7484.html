<br />
Differences in Twins
<br />
NICHOLAS WADE - The New York Times
<br />
<br />Identical twins possess exactly the same set of genes. Yet as they grow 
<br />
older, they may begin to display subtle differences.
<br />
<br />They may start to look different, develop different diseases or slide into 
<br />
different personalities. Women who are identical twins may differ in their 
<br />
fertility or in the age at which they reach menopause.
<br />
<br />These discrepancies are usually attributed to ill-defined differences in 
<br />
environment.
<br />
<br />But a whole new level of explanation has been opened up by a genetic survey 
<br />
showing that identical twins, as they grow older, differ increasingly in 
<br />
what is known as their epigenome. The term refers to natural chemical 
<br />
modifications that occur in a person's genome shortly after conception and 
<br />
that act on a gene like a gas pedal or a brake, marking it for higher or 
<br />
lower activity.
<br />
<br />Identical twins have the same set of epigenetic marks on the genome when 
<br />
they are born. But differences in the epigenome emerge as the twins grow 
<br />
older and become greater the longer they live apart, say a team of 
<br />
researchers led by Dr. Manel Esteller of the Spanish National Cancer Center 
<br />
in Madrid.
<br />
<br />Their report appears in today's issue of The Proceedings of the National 
<br />
Academy of Sciences.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is one of the most fascinating things I have read,&quot; said Dr. Nancy 
<br />
Segal, a psychologist who studies twins at California State University at 
<br />
Fullerton and the author of &quot;Indivisible by Two,&quot; a forthcoming book on 
<br />
twins. &quot;By giving us a handle on something specific, it opens up many new 
<br />
avenues of inquiry as to why twins are different.&quot;
<br />
<br />There are two possible explanations for Dr. Esteller's findings. One is 
<br />
simply the well- known fact that epigenetic marks are lost as people get 
<br />
older. Because the marks are removed randomly, they would be expected to 
<br />
occur differently in two members of a twin pair.
<br />
<br />A second possible explanation is that personal experiences and elements in 
<br />
the environment - including toxic agents like tobacco smoke - feed back 
<br />
onto the genome by changing the pattern of epigenetic marks.
<br />
<br />Dr. Esteller believes he is seeing both processes at work. The evidence for 
<br />
the second process, he said, is that twins who reported that they had lived 
<br />
apart the longest also had the greatest differences in their epigenome.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is a way for the genome to be responsive to the environment,&quot; he 
<br />
said, noting that it is easier for chemical marks on the genome to change 
<br />
than for the genome itself to mutate.
<br />
<br />His study suggests that the epigenome may be involved in many diseases that 
<br />
can affect identical twins differently, like schizophrenia, bipolar 
<br />
disorder and cancer. Although schizophrenia evidently has a genetic 
<br />
component, the epigenome may hold the clue to its nongenetic aspects.
<br />
<br />Differences between identical twins could also help pinpoint the epigenetic 
<br />
differences that contribute to cancer. &quot;We think that epigenetic changes 
<br />
are very common in cancer,&quot; said Dr. Peter A. Jones, the president of the 
<br />
American Association for Cancer Research and a professor at the University 
<br />
of Southern California.
<br />
<br />Dr. Jones said Dr. Esteller's finding &quot;is exceptionally interesting in that 
<br />
it underlines the importance of epigenetic changes in human development and 
<br />
disease.&quot;
<br />
<br />Dr. Jones recently convened a workshop to discuss starting an international 
<br />
human epigenome project. The proposal could rival the Human Genome Project 
<br />
in complexity because the human genome is the same in every cell of a 
<br />
person's body, while the epigenome is expected to be different for each of 
<br />
the 250 or so human cell types.
<br />
<br />Among the most important components of the epigenome are small chemical 
<br />
handles known as methyl groups, which are added directly to the chemical 
<br />
units of DNA.
<br />
<br />A wave of demethylation occurs in a sperm's genome shortly after an egg is 
<br />
fertilized, followed by the extensive readdition of methyl groups in early 
<br />
embryonic development.
<br />
<br />These methyl groups, which generally inhibit the activity of the genes in 
<br />
which they occur, tend to be lost during aging. Dr. Esteller's team studied 
<br />
the total amount of methylation in the twins' genomes, as well as another 
<br />
kind of epigenetic modification, the addition of acetyl groups to the 
<br />
histone proteins that act as a scaffolding and as a control system for DNA.
