The following version of my system description may aid reading it.
<br />
<br />xxxxxxxxxxxxx
<br />
<br />Proposal: The Existence of our and other universes and their dynamics are 
<br />
the result of unavoidable definition and logical incompleteness.
<br />
<br />Justification:
<br />
<br />Definitions:
<br />
<br />[1] Information: Information is the potential to establish a boundary.
<br />
<br />[2] Kernel of information: The information required for the potential to 
<br />
establish a specific boundary.
<br />
<br />[3] The All: The complete kernel ensemble.
<br />
<br />[4] The Nothing: That which is empty of all kernels.
<br />
<br />[5] The Everything: The boundary which contains the All and separates it 
<br />
from the Nothing and thus it also contains the Nothing.
<br />
<br />[6] A Something: A division [by a boundary] of the All into two subparts.
<br />
<br />[7] True noise: An inconsistency of the evolution of a Something reflected 
<br />
in the course of physical reality given to universes within it.
<br />
<br />Justification steps:
<br />
<br />1) Notice that &quot;Defining&quot; is the same as establishing a boundary between 
<br />
what a thing is and what it is not.  This defines a second thing: the is 
<br />
not.  A thing can not be defined in isolation.
<br />
<br />2) Given definitions [3], [4], and [5]:
<br />
<br />3) These definitions are interdependent because you can not have one 
<br />
without the whole set.
<br />
<br />4) These definitions are unavoidable because at least one of the [All, 
<br />
Nothing] pair must exist.  Since they form an [is, is not] pair and the 
<br />
boundary between that pair they bootstrap each other into existence as a 
<br />
single definition.
<br />
<br />5) The Nothing has a logical problem: since it is empty of kernels it can 
<br />
not answer any meaningful question about itself including the unavoidable 
<br />
one of its own stability [persistence].
<br />
<br />6) To answer this unavoidable question the Nothing must at some point 
<br />
&quot;penetrate&quot; the boundary between itself and the All [the only place 
<br />
information resides] in an attempt to complete itself.  This could be 
<br />
viewed as a spontaneous symmetry breaking.
<br />
<br />7) However, the boundary is permanent as required by the definitions and a 
<br />
Nothing must remain.
<br />
<br />8) Thus the &quot;penetration&quot; process repeats in an always was and always will 
<br />
be manner.
<br />
<br />9) The boundary &quot;penetration&quot; produces a shock wave [a boundary] that moves 
<br />
into the All as the old example of Nothing becomes a Something and tries to 
<br />
complete itself.  This divides the All into two evolving Somethings - 
<br />
evolving multiverses.  Notice that half the multiverses are &quot;contracting&quot; - 
<br />
losing kernels.
<br />
<br />10) Notice that the All also has a logical problem.  Looking at the same 
<br />
meaningful question of its own stability it contains all possible answers 
<br />
because just one would constitute a selection i.e. net internal information 
<br />
which is not an aspect of a complete kernel ensemble.   Thus the All is 
<br />
internally inconsistent.
<br />
<br />11) Therefore the motion of a shock wave boundary in the All must be echo 
<br />
this inconsistency.  That is each step in the motion as it encompasses 
<br />
kernel after kernel [the evolution of a Something] can not be completely 
<br />
dependent on any past motion.
<br />
<br />12) Some kernels are states of universes and when the boundary of an 
<br />
evolving Something passes about a kernel, the kernel can have a moment of 
<br />
physical reality.
<br />
<br />13)  From within any Something the future course of reality would be non 
<br />
deterministic i.e. suffer True Noise.
<br />
<br />14) The All of course contains a kernel re the founding definition and thus 
<br />
there is an infinitely nested potential to have All/Nothing pairs.  This 
<br />
completes the system in that the origin of the dynamic basically destroys 
<br />
[Nothing, All] pairs but there is an infinite potential to form new 
<br />
Nothings.  The infinite nesting in this definition does not effect the zero 
<br />
information of the All because kernels that are definitions [is, is not] 
<br />
pairs can be balanced by an [is not, is] definitional pair kernel which 
<br />
defines the same entities.
<br />
