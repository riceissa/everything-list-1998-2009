Philosophers are at the opposite extreme of engineers, in that they
<br />
consider the practical details of their thought experiments to be
<br />
unimportant. I think the idea that Parfit is exploring in the term
<br />
&quot;psychological spectrum&quot; is how much one can change and remain the
<br />
&quot;same&quot; person. I think I'm the same person I was yesterday even though
<br />
my brain has changed physically and my mind has changed to reflect that
<br />
change. Even though it is very unlikely to happen in reality, it is easy
<br />
enough to imagine that the relatively minor physical/psychological
<br />
changes that have occurred in the past day are exaggerated, so that
<br />
instead of changing from me-yesterday to me-today, I change from
<br />
me-yesterday into Napoleon. The point is that this type of radical
<br />
change would be different in *degree*, not different in kind from the
<br />
type of change that occurs normally. One could even argue that turning
<br />
into Napoleon is not as great a psychological change as that experienced
<br />
by an infant growing up, or an adult who becomes demented in old age.
<br />
Given these examples, what criterion can one come up with which allows
<br />
that one is the &quot;same&quot; person over the course of one's life, but a
<br />
&quot;different&quot; person if one changes into Napoleon (not having been
<br />
Napoleon previously)?
<br />
<br />That last question is the search for a criterion for personal identity.
<br />
Parfit's answer is that the question is misguided. There is no objective
<br />
truth regarding continuity of identity over time, or as the result of
<br />
teleportation, or brain duplication, or all the other processes which
<br />
may in future become reality. What matters to us is not continuity of
<br />
personal identity in some absolute sense, but the feeling of
<br />
psychological continuity. And the reason *this* matters to us is simply
<br />
that our brains evolved that way: those organisms that do not believe
<br />
they are the &quot;same&quot; individual from moment to moment or day to day and
<br />
hence have no regard for their future well-being would soon die out.

Subject: Reasons and Persons
<br />
<br /><br />Several list members cajoled me into reading David Parfit's &quot;Reasons
<br />
and Persons&quot;. So I braved our dragon infested library, and sourced a
<br />
copy. I can see why his book is relevant to this list, particularly
<br />
part 3 of his book &quot;Personal Identity&quot;. It was a good recommendation -
<br />
I can certainly recommend this as one of the background readers - too
<br />
late it missed the cutoff for my book :)
<br />
<br />However, there was one thought experiment that concerned me, and it
<br />
relates to his notion of psychological spectrum. We are to suppose
<br />
that it is possible to generate psyches in between our mind and that
<br />
of Napoleon Bonaparte, by progressively swapping in neurons from NB's
<br />
brain.
<br />
<br />Since we have a number of closet computationlists here, I paraphrased
<br />
the thought experiment as what if we swapped the transistors in my PC
<br />
for that of a (old-style PPC) Mac. At first, there would be little
<br />
difference, and the machine would be indistinguishable from that of a
<br />
PC - save a few bugs (anyone remember the Pentium division
<br />
bug?). Similarly, at the other end of the spectrum, the machine would
<br />
be virtually indistinguishable from a Mac. But what about the machines
<br />
in the middle? Surely these machine would simply be
<br />
non-functional. Replacing PC transistors with Mac transistors would be
<br />
no different from simply disabling the PC transistors - eventually a
<br />
critical path would be severed, and the machine would be defunct.
<br />
<br />No two human brains are wired identically - indeed our daily
<br />
experience updates the connections between our neurons. Gradually
<br />
replacing neurons in our brain by someone else's neurons would have
<br />
the same effect as simply removing neurons one-by-one. For a while,
<br />
there would be little noticable effect - brains are, after all quite
<br />
robust against damage. But eventually, and well before the magical 50%
<br />
mark I would suggest, the structural organisation of our brain would
<br />
be lost, and we'd lose consciousness.
<br />
<br />Since quite a bit of Parfit's later arguments depend on this
<br />
psychological spectrum thought experiment, it seems some of his
<br />
identity issues aren't in fact problems at all. Anyone have a comment
<br />
on this, or is it all obvious philosophy 101 stuff that I missed.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
