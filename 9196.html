Why is it that we talk about caring and preference, pleasure and pain, 
<br />
and &quot;proper behavior&quot;, when it comes to trying to figure out the basic 
<br />
nature of reality?  (I've noticed that a lot of the thought experiments 
<br />
on this list feature pleasure or pain decision making.) For me this is 
<br />
a rhetorical question, because I believe that personhood is at the very 
<br />
core of reality.  However, the point of my post is that this is one of 
<br />
those assumptions that we tend to take for granted without thinking 
<br />
about why we can assume it, and what its implications are.  Or we just 
<br />
insert it into our thought experiments thinking that we aren't really 
<br />
assuming it as basic to everything but just making the argument more 
<br />
tangible.  However, I would discourage this since there are those of us 
<br />
like me who take personhood to be at the core, and so this makes the 
<br />
thought experiment loaded to begin with.  On the other hand, can we 
<br />
have a theory of everything without making that assumption?  If so, 
<br />
what would that look like?  What would the comparison between math and 
<br />
physical reality look like without it?  (Perhaps something like the 
<br />
Riemann hypothesis TOE would fall into that category.)  Can Wei Dai's 
<br />
approach below be done without it?

Subject: proper behavior for a mathematical substructure
<br />
<br />Is there a difference between physical existence and mathematical 
<br />
existence?
<br />
I suggest thinking about this problem from a different angle.
<br />
<br />Consider a mathematical substructure as a rational decision maker. It 
<br />
seems
<br />
to me that making a decision ideally would consist of the following 
<br />
steps:
<br />
<br />1. Identify the mathematical structure that corresponds to &quot;me&quot; (i.e., 
<br />
my
<br />
current observer-moment)
<br />
2. Identify the mathematical structures that contain me as 
<br />
substructures.
<br />
3. Decide which of those I care about.
<br />
4. For each option I have, and each mathematical structure (containing 
<br />
me)
<br />
that I care about, deduce the consequences on that structure of me 
<br />
taking
<br />
that option.
<br />
5. Find the set of consequences that I prefer overall, and take the 
<br />
option
<br />
that corresponds to it.
<br />
<br />Of course each of these steps may be dauntingly difficult, maybe even
<br />
impossible for natural human beings, but does anyone disagree that this 
<br />
is
<br />
the ideal of rationality that an AI, or perhaps a computationally 
<br />
augmented
<br />
human being, should strive for?
<br />
<br />How would a difference between physical existence and mathematical
<br />
existence, if there is one, affect this ideal of decision making? It's 
<br />
a
<br />
rhetorical question because I don't think that it would. One possible 
<br />
answer
<br />
may be that a rational decision maker in step 3 would decide to only 
<br />
care
<br />
about those structures that have physical existence. But among the
<br />
structures that contain him as substructures, how would he know which 
<br />
ones
<br />
have physical existence, and which one only have mathematical 
<br />
existence? And
<br />
even if he could somehow find out, I don't see any reason why he must 
<br />
not
<br />
care about those structures that only have mathematical existence.
