Why shouldn't a more natural process prevent Alice from doing this
<br />
experiment with the lottery? Something far more probable than winning the
<br />
million which does not let this quantum trick happen? This would be similar
<br />
to the reasoning you applied to the quantum suicide. It could be much more
<br />
probable to implant a natural doubt in quantum immortality in Alice's brain
<br />
which causes her not to carry out the lottery trick. I definitely have this
<br />
doubt. In this way one could conclude that doubts in quantum immortality
<br />
would be a consequence of quantum immortality.

Subject: Quantum Immortality - the principle of the least
<br />
improbability/influencing things
<br />
<br /><br />If Quantum Immortality (QI) is true, then we can ask the question what
<br />
is the TYPICAL history for an &quot;immortal&quot;. The typical history (or the
<br />
typical time/space trajectory) would be the path most of the immortals
<br />
take (and remember that in QI all of us are immortals)
<br />
<br />For each immortal history its weight in the space of all histories
<br />
diminishes each time an improbable event takes place. Therefore,
<br />
although in QI all of us are immortals, for a typical immortal the
<br />
history will follow the principle of the least improbability. Things
<br />
will be have in the least crazy way that will still allow the immortal
<br />
to survive.
<br />
<br />Lets say an immortal decides to commit a suicide for a particular
<br />
reason. It is then much more probable for some life event to occur
<br />
that will persuade the immortal to abandon its attempt, then for the
<br />
bullet to go through the immortal's head without actually killing the
<br />
immortal. As an example, Alice decides to commit a suicide because her
<br />
boyfriend Bob left her, Bob can change his mind, call Alice etc. so
<br />
that the reason for the suicide is removed.
<br />
<br />Therefore, for a typical immortal there will be no bulllet going
<br />
through the head, no disfigurement etc. Instead, an event will occur
<br />
which will naturally remove the need for the suicide.
<br />
<br />In other words, immortals will not typically perceive themselves
<br />
living in the world where strange things happen. Instead, the world
<br />
will somehow make sure that immortals stay alive AND that things
<br />
behave relatively reasonably.
<br />
<br />Let us assume that QI is true and that all of us are immortals. What
<br />
is the least improbable thing that can allow us to stay alive forever?
<br />
Life extension. With the modern progress of biology it is not
<br />
completely improbable that a technology is discovered within say next
<br />
10 years that will reverse aging. In this scenario a typical immortal
<br />
will not even tribute his immortality to QI. Instead, immortality
<br />
will be a natural consequence of life extension.
<br />
<br />Now lets apply the principle of the least improbability to actually
<br />
influence things.
<br />
<br />Lets assume, that Alice who believes in QI wants a certain probable
<br />
event to happen, for instance win 1,000,000 in a casino. Alice then
<br />
comes to a casino with a loaded gun and promises to herself, that she
<br />
will kill herself if she does not win 1,000,000. You can even think
<br />
about a suicidal lottery machine, which will automatically kill Alice
<br />
if Alice does not win 1,000,000.
<br />
<br /><br />Since Alice is immortal, there are two possivle outcomes
<br />
<br />1). Alice wins 1,000,000 and the trigger is not pulled
<br />
2). Alice does not win 1,000,000, the trigger is pulled, the bullet
<br />
goes through Alice's head without killing Alice
<br />
<br />Now although 1) is highly improbable 2) is much much more improbable.
<br />
<br />Due to the principle of the least improbability 1) is going to happen
<br />
for a typical immortal - meaning that Alice wins 1,000,000
<br />
<br />If you accept that, you should accept that QI provides a way for
<br />
immortals to influence the world by doing attempted suicides.
<br />
Essentially, anything becomes possible for an immortal.
