&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, while I'm posting I might as well ask, if you guys are so
<br />
&nbsp;darn sure consciousness is continuous and that it somehow means it cannot
<br />
&nbsp;end, how come you seem to have no problem with birth?  It seems to me that
<br />
&nbsp;your arguments would apply equally in that direction.  How come you have
<br />
&nbsp;no trouble picturing a boundary for it in the past?  I'm sure you'll come
<br />
&nbsp;up with some BS answer but this once again shows the foolishness of your
<br />
&nbsp;position. &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Congratulations Jacques, this is a great problem to talk about.
<br />
<br />I assert that we can define time as the link between observer frames that can 
<br />
be sequenced without violating the (physical) laws required for the existence 
<br />
of consciousness. The Self Sampling condition is the Self which drives the 
<br />
Anthropic principle which defines the physical laws. The links between 
<br />
observer frames defines the MW as a network that branches as well as merges.
<br />
<br />I also assert that consciousness defines the &quot;direction&quot; of the links. In 
<br />
other words, it can only exist in one direction which we define as &quot;forward,&quot; 
<br />
and hence there appear to be an assymetry in the MW network.
<br />
<br />My third assertion (that rest on the self sampling assumption) is that once a 
<br />
particular consciousness is created, this particular consciousness never 
<br />
dies. Note the emphasis on locality. (This assertion resembles the final 
<br />
anthropic principle by Barrow and Tipler which is more global in nature: 
<br />
&quot;Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the Universe 
<br />
and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.&quot;)
<br />
<br />This being said, the past is just as uncertain as the future. This can be 
<br />
proven by performing an experiment in which the past is recorded and then 
<br />
played back. The uncertainty of the recording device reflects the uncertainty 
<br />
and actual multiplicity of the past(s). 
<br />
<br />Regarding the lack of boundaries in the future and in the past, here are some 
<br />
scenarios:
<br />
<br />1) Toward the future: as death apparently approaches, events which are more 
<br />
and more unlikely actually occur to prolong life. (i.e., new drugs 
<br />
discovered, aliens landing on earth bringing new life saving technology... 
<br />
etc... )
<br />
<br />2) Toward the past: We are newborn babies with very dim consciousness and few 
<br />
memories. Birth approaches (going backward in time), we become fetuses, and 
<br />
embryos... loss of consciousness occurs in most branches. Self Sampling 
<br />
ceases to be possible. However, very few &quot;branches&quot; (&quot;merges&quot; in forward 
<br />
time) involve states of higher consciousness being degraded to the fetal 
<br />
state of low consciousness, that is of being highly conscious before birth 
<br />
and then losing memories. Scenarios are difficult to come by and rely on 
<br />
science fiction and religious allegories and , so bear with me.... For 
<br />
example being just part of a (computer) simulation (Re: Simulacron by Daniel 
<br />
Galouye of a previous post by Marchal) in which we may assume that this 
<br />
erasing of memory process actually happens... or being (sentient) angels with 
<br />
memories and receiving the body of a newborn, thereby losing our 
<br />
memories..................................
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
............Remaining immortal while going backward in time somehow does not 
<br />
have the same urgency as going forward in time.
<br />
<br />George Levy
