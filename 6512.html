Le 14-mai-05, à 16:04, Lee Corbin a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If they are furthermore enough rich in complexity to have &quot;abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; inhabitants&quot;, it is reasonable or plausible (at least) that for those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; inhabitants their abstract universe will look as it is real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This rests on the surprising conclusion that the inhabitants actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compute later states from earlier ones.  Of course, it can always be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made to *look* as though that is what &quot;happened&quot;.  Eternal Truth #6:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seek and ye shall find.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is precisely this latter &quot;surprising conclusion&quot; that is resisted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by so many (including me).  Just as it would seem that anyone should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resist making conclusions about the relationships between the books
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in Borges' Library of Babel.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Borges' Library is different from the UD in this very respect. The UD 
<br />
does not simply generate all programs, but it executes all program. In 
<br />
the platonic sense that it does relate the computational states to each 
<br />
other. Its existence is far from from obvious. It seems easy for a 
<br />
mathematician to refute its existence by simple cantor-like 
<br />
diagonalisation. It takes the genius of Kleene or Post to unravel the 
<br />
paradoxes, to show that the set of programmable functions is close for 
<br />
the diagonal procedure, to show this entails the absoluteness of the 
<br />
computability relation, and the relativeness of any provability 
<br />
relation. It is a whole new mathematical world which has been 
<br />
discovered.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And this will make sense if, furthermore again, their relative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computational continuations have the right measure. And theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computer science can justify the existence of such relative measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We may take the books in the Borges library---admittedly in his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scenario none of which is infinite---and begin willy-nilly assigning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a greater measure to some than to others.  It is extremely tempting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to assign greater measure to short ones. But in the infinite-string
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; version of Borges' library, Russell Standish (for one) begins by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assigning equal measure to each bit string.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I do not assign measure to short strings. Nor to any strings. I just 
<br />
use the Godel-Lob Logic to define the particular case of &quot;measure one&quot; 
<br />
in the language of a (Lobian) Universal Machine. Lobian is equivalent 
<br />
with having enough provability ability. I use a result from Goldblatt 
<br />
which translates Quantum logic in modal logic.
<br />
I compute the inverse of Goldblatt transformation on the lobian machine 
<br />
description of that measure one, and I compare with quantum logic. 
<br />
Looks simple but those transformation are not easy to handle and lead 
<br />
to intractable problems and open question.
<br />
Compare to QM or even Newton, I agree, the comp-physics is still too 
<br />
young (to say the least), but this only with respect to pure 3-person 
<br />
prediction, let us say the quanta.
<br />
But thanks to incompleteness, which in the modal setting is captured by 
<br />
the gap between two amazing modal logics G and G*, I can say that with 
<br />
respect, to the existence of 1 and 3 person, an to the explanation of 
<br />
why quanta and qualia, and why they are different, the comp-physics is 
<br />
already in advance.
<br />
<br />Modal logic is just a tool for adding possible nuance to classical 
<br />
logic. My experience is that modal logic is more easy to understand 
<br />
than to understand the difference between atheist and agnostic. Indeed, 
<br />
I am used to explain the difference between atheist and agnostic by 
<br />
using the belief modality. I'm sure you know the difference between 
<br />
atheist and agnostic, but let me explain it with an explicit modality. 
<br />
Let d be the proposition according to which God exists. Let B be the 
<br />
belief modality as applied to someone. And let - represent negation. 
<br />
Then, by definition I would say:
<br />
<br />-a religious believer is someone who believes in the existence of God, 
<br />
i.e. about who  'Bd'  is true.
<br />
-an atheist is someone who believes God does not exist, i.e. about who 
<br />
'B-d' is true.
<br />
-an agnostic is someone who does not believe in the existence of God, 
<br />
and he does not believe in the non existence of God. Both '-Bd' and 
<br />
'-B-d&quot; are true for him (or her, it, ...).
<br />
<br />People tends to confuse, and natural language does not help, 
<br />
propositions like -Bd and B-d. Most acts of putting the mind-body under 
<br />
the rug, or using Godel theorem against comp, can be seen at some level 
<br />
of description of the argumentations as error of that kind. That's why 
<br />
the discovery of G and G* by Solovay is a formidable event for 
<br />
simplifying the life of those who want to study the counter-intuitive 
<br />
lesson of the universal machine which introspect itself: what machine 
<br />
can prove and cannot prove but can correctly guess about their 
<br />
consistent extensions, and their geometry. The modal logic G is the 
<br />
study of the Beweisbar Gödel probability predicate Bew(x) which is true 
<br />
if there is a number coding a proof of x.
<br />
<br />You should'nt reduce the whole of computer science in the Library of 
<br />
Babel. Machine have dynamics, even if they are on the type discrete, 
<br />
digital, and, when seen in Platonia, looks like static abstractions. 
<br />
Here the movie-graph or Olympia+Klara (Klara = the counterfactual 
<br />
block) makes understand that comp makes it impossible for a machine to 
<br />
distinguish the real and the virtual, but also the virtual and the 
<br />
arithmetical. With comp, machine lives in Platonia, but with Godel, 
<br />
platonia admits internal view which looks quite dynamical.  At least 
<br />
that what the machine says, according to the arithmetical translation.
