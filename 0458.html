<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I may be wrong, but it seems to me that the notions of computer, program,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;UD ans so on... require the notion of (time ) ordering. A Turing machine is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;decribed as a sequence of states, not a set of states. But if time (as I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;think too) is an illusion, why invoke a computation instead of some static
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;state? Then the set of all possible finite computations is N.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;So you are basically saying: the Universe is N. But why not R, P(R) or any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;more complicated set?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am not really saying &quot;the Universe is N&quot;. I am saying (loosely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;speaking):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If I am N then I will see R P(R) and a lot of complicated set, including
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a lot of universes and minds.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe we have to better define the word &quot;Universe&quot;, like in MWI. I suppose
<br />
that you call &quot;universe&quot; a observable macroscopic universe? If &quot;Universe&quot;
<br />
means the globality of all things that exist , it really includes a lot of
<br />
universes. So I think you are really defending the thesis that the Universe
<br />
is N.
<br />
<br />I still have difficulties in accepting the idea that the reality &quot;is&quot; a
<br />
mathematical abstraction. The mathematics as we know them are mental
<br />
concepts than can be applied to modelize *approximately* what we observe
<br />
from the world. There is no example so far of a really &quot;exact&quot; theory, free
<br />
from any unconsistency and unaccuracy. Modern epistemology is seeing the
<br />
evolution of science as an always improving approximation of reality. So
<br />
you can as well defend the idea that mathematics will *never* give a
<br />
complete description of reality.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But Descartes (and his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;predecessors) failed to discover most of the physical laws. Only Galileo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and Newton, by trying to explain experimental facts with laws, did really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;found modern Science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Gosh!... I am afraid only a french can be so unfair to Descartes !
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What about the optic laws, his pionnering work on dreams and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;neurophysiology, etc. Descartes also emphasized the important role of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;personal conviction in both science and philosophy ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Without Descartes'arithmetization of geometry, neither Newton, nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Leibnitz would have invented calculus, etc.
</em><br />
<br />I agree that it may be surprising that a French prefers the anglo-saxon
<br />
school to the French one! I think we have to distinguish between
<br />
mathematical theories, which do not require any comparison with experiment
<br />
to be proven, and physical ones, which do; I recognize that Descartes was a
<br />
great mathematician, and a good philosoph. But his contribution to physics
<br />
was not so great. Excepted the laws of refraction (which BTW he did not
<br />
justified rigorously), many of his ideas were not correct and had a
<br />
negative influence on the French scientists, who lasted to admit Newton's
<br />
ideas. 300 years later, the same happened with de Broglie...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;It is not surprising that the people of the last XX century imagine the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;world based on a computation, just like Greeks have imagined it as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;combination of four elements, or theologist have imagined it as driven by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;God (it confirms that consciouness can only produce ideas from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;interaction with an outer world!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;... unless you find God in yourself ! (Take this as a pun).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But honestly I think that in the XX century there has been Church,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Turing, Post, Godel, and Kleene, which lead to theoretical computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;science.
</em><br />
<br />I agree, but all these works were done to deal with computers, or with
<br />
formal logics, not with physical reality! be cautious not to mix different
<br />
fields and problems. The physics of XX century has not been built by these
<br />
great researchers, but by other great researchers like Einstein, Bohr,
<br />
Dirac, Schroedinger and so on. BTW they also contributed to the emergence
<br />
of new mathematical problems, but they were not pure mathematicians. (some
<br />
extraordinary workers like Kolmogorov brought decisive contributions in
<br />
both types of field, but in separate works).
<br />
<br /><br />I don't want you to mistake what I am saying. I am not saying that doing
<br />
physics is better than doing mathematics or computer science. i am just
<br />
saying that each field has its own domain of relevance ; although at some
<br />
precise interfaces, they can mutually enrich, one should be cautious in
<br />
applying them to domains for which they were not built.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To derive explicitely laws of nature, there is a difficulty (both my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;director and Jacques Baihache have seen rather clearly) which is that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cannot draw a clear line between the necessary and the contingent laws :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comp makes necessary to deduce (by pure thinking) only the necessary part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of physics.
</em><br />
<br />but you have to do that before convincing a physicist!.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Have you follow the PE-omega experience ?
</em><br />
<br />I missed that, could you explain it ? (I'm afraid it is not an experiment
<br />
in my sense!)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;If yes you should understand
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;how comp makes it possible to predict indeterminisme, non-locality, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even some kind of quantum logic. Obviously physicist have discovered all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that before computer scientist.`
</em><br />
<br />What I think is that only the methods of physics could discover all that. I
<br />
don't think you can deduce that from N (see below).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;But computer science is still very young,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and the idea that computer science can be &quot;the&quot; fundamental science is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;still &quot;in-birth&quot; (to say the least).
</em><br />
<br />Let assume that theoretical computer science would have been developped
<br />
well before the technical feasibility of computers and the development of
<br />
modern physics. (It is possible in principle although mankind use to
<br />
develop only what is immediately useful...). With the idea that it is &quot;the&quot;
<br />
fundamental science, some people would have tried to apply it to try to
<br />
imaginate the most fundamental laws of physics, for which no experimental
<br />
data would have been available. Most probably, they would have arrived to
<br />
some atomic theory (because of the discreteness of computations) but also
<br />
most probably seeing the atoms like classical particles, like Democrite,
<br />
Epicure and Lucrece. Schmidhuber's programms, for example, could most
<br />
simply interpreted like the generation of classical worlds where &quot;1&quot; means
<br />
the presence of a classical particle and 0 an absence. There is nothing
<br />
wrong logically...just that you cannot make good physical laws with this
<br />
idea.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
