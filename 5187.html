Let me interleave - although I don't like to continue an exchange beyond 3:
<br />
from the 4th arguments go astray and fall into 'in other words' rather than
<br />
saying sthg. I will use [JM]: insert lines.

Subject: Re: Determinism - Mind and Brain
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; According to the dictionary of Philo of Mind Self awareness id synonymous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with consciousness.
</em><br />
[JM]: a fine definition, others define it differently, eg during the series
<br />
of the
<br />
Consciousness Worldwide Symposia since 1991 in Tucson (yearly?) with
<br />
thousands of concerned professionals from all the world. They could not
<br />
agree so far. My take is rather 'abiotic' and consider it an &quot;acknowledgment
<br />
of and response to information&quot; (with some details on the details) which
<br />
leaves open
<br />
the way to 'conscious' particles as well.
<br />
Yet... this is a sidetrack (3rd response?) because I mentioned only a def.
<br />
of &quot;mind&quot;:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Would a artificial self-aware entity emerging from human technology
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; represent &quot;mind&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (depends on YOUR definition of mind, of course) - but....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; self-aware? does that mean that if the program calls for some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; math-churning,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the computer will say &quot;I rather play some Bach music now&quot; and does so?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I 'm not convinced that being conscious, it necessarily follows that you
</em><br />
are
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contrarian as well.
</em><br />
[JM]: to have a mind on one's own does not mean contrarian IMO, just having
<br />
ideas, (dis?)likes, emotional responses, putting logic aside sometimes,
<br />
dicisions
<br />
to refrain from the 'best' solution, etc. etc: a &quot;human&quot; behavior
<br />
(imperfect),
<br />
as contrasted to the machine-reliability. Politicians know that.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, one can imagine a &quot;program&quot; that monitors various inputs, external
</em><br />
and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; internal, that are reinforcing to varying degrees and prioritized via a
</em><br />
some
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;value&quot;  hierarchy most likely pre-supplied by the &quot;masters&quot;. Of course,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where I'm going with this is &quot;training the baby&quot; and, of course, such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; projects are currently underway at various locations and with varying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; results(!). But it's early days. In any case, as I've alluded to in prior
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; posts, something that could &quot;spot the dot&quot; (manage convince a sufficient
</em><br />
set
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; humans of it's self-awreness: see below) may emerge unannounced from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collective tinkering underway. Only the Shadow knows.
</em><br />
[JM]: Ignorantia non est argumentum. To say: we don't know that, but it
<br />
proves... - is not very convincing, just as well as: There is a possibility
<br />
and I
<br />
base my argument on that, however not yet discovered/realized.
<br />
This is why I call &quot;MY&quot; MWI-BigBang-cosmological version a &quot;narrative&quot; and
<br />
just &quot;tell it&quot;, don't argue it. I like it, because it fits my human logical
<br />
mind
<br />
(with all its non-machine illogicalities) and 'explains' some paradoxes
<br />
which
<br />
are left open in 'science'. So I don't take the &quot;conditionals&quot; at face
<br />
value.
<br />
Could be is fine, but only as that. We don't have those computers and I
<br />
think
<br />
you do not assign to &quot;them&quot; really every aspect/facet of the human &quot;mind(!)&quot;
<br />
not even in spe. If they 'will' realize, will they be sexy?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or would you assume in that (hard) AI to program EVERYTHING what a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; human (callable normal or derailed) might react by? We are back to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; infinite time comp with unlimited memory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My limited little 'mind' does not go that far.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This would appear to assume that self-awareness equates to being human (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in homo sapien?); I don't see that as the being the case. I certainly
</em><br />
don't
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe the infinite time/memory device is required; maybe a Linux Beowulf
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cluster running on some g5s?
</em><br />
[JM]: We did not settle the self-awareness puzzle. I believe thath HUMAN
<br />
self-awareness is homo sapientist, as we know it (do we indeed?). I don't
<br />
argue your Linux, just show me. In non-conditional terms. No 'maybe'.
<br />
What I started out with was the mind &gt; brain inequality. Brain as the
<br />
bio-machine-component in the human complexity of a 'more'  (consider
<br />
Aristotle's  -  Aris-Total).
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ultimately, I believe I'm self aware (although, decidedly not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-actualized); I assume you are but can't prove it beyond doubt. For
</em><br />
that
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter, given our mode of communication, you might indeed be a machine
</em><br />
and,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this case, just passing the Turing test. If you we here in person I
</em><br />
might
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sneak a red dot on your forehead (during a blink?), hold up a mirror and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; watch your reaction (apparently passes muster regarding self-awareness in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our relatives). If some such procedure that meets at least that level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acceptable evidence suffices for a chimp, then it  should as well for an
</em><br />
AI,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I should think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cheers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CMR
</em><br />
[JM]: thanks for your benevolence.
<br />
re-Cheers
<br />
John, the self-aware AI-chimp
