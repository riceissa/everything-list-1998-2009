Hi everythingers,
<br />
<br />I have been invited to make a talk at the 26th Dubrovnik 
<br />
Philosophy of Science Conference.
<br />
<br />I forward you Michel Ghins's information (with his kind
<br />
autorisation) because the topics are quite
<br />
relevant with our discussion.
<br />
<br />I apologize for possible duplication of this message.
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***
<br />
<br /><br />INFORMATION ON THE  26th DUBROVNIK PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE CONFERENCE
<br />
<br /><br />THEMES : The three topics for 2000 are :
<br />
<br />-Philosophy of Biology
<br />
-Causality, Laws and Explanation
<br />
-One Hundred Years of Quanta
<br />
<br />DATES : April 10-15.
<br />
<br />THE CONFERENCE is run in a very informal fashion. We make up the schedule
<br />
only a day or two in advance, depending on who is present at the time. If
<br />
you arrive you will be fitted in. I don't plan to write again with further
<br />
information ; on the other hand, please let me know of your intention to
<br />
come (by the end of February, if possible). That way we can get a good idea
<br />
of what to expect and can plan accordingly. 
<br />
If you want to call me,  I'm at either : office : +32-10-47 47 84 or home :
<br />
+32-2-771 33 95, e-mail : ghins.domain.name.hidden
<br />
You can also contact other organizers of the conference :

<br />

<br />
<br /><br />PRESENTATION : This is an international conference. While English is the
<br />
working language, it is not the mother tongue of the majority of your
<br />
listerners. So, it is more than usually important to be clear. Talks
<br />
(perhaps with a handout or transparencies) are preferred to readings. The
<br />
presentation should be no longer than about 30 minutes. (If you could bring
<br />
outlines or copies of your paper, it would be much appreciated).
<br />
<br />THE I .U.C. : Sessions are normally at the Inter-University Centre, located
<br />
just outside the old city. It was badly damaged in the 1991 bombardment,
<br />
but has been beautifully re-built. The sessions usually start at 9:30 am. A
<br />
US$20 registration fee will be charged.
<br />
<br /><br />GETTING THERE : Travel to Dubrovnik is easy since there is an international
<br />
airport not far from the city. However, you may have to fly through Zagreb,
<br />
which will cause some delay due to long stopover there. You can also fly to
<br />
Dubrovnik directly  from some other cities such as Rome or Paris.
<br />
There also is a slow but very scenic route : Go to Venice ; take the
<br />
morning train to Trieste (2 hrs) ; noon bus to Rijeka (3hrs) ; afternoon
<br />
coastal ferry to Dubrovnik (22hrs cabins available). It's a very nice trip,
<br />
if you have the time. Be sure to double-check the times ; they may change.
<br />
The situation is constantly changing, especially in light of increasing
<br />
tourism, so be sure to check with your travel agent.
<br />
<br />ACCOMMODATION : The Hotel Lero is the most convenient place to stay. It has
<br />
been completely refurbished last year and is cheap : the full board IUC
<br />
rate is about $US 32 per day. The Lero's phone is +385 20 411 455 and their
<br />
FAX  is + 385 20 432 501. Another good place to stay is the Hotel
<br />
Argentina. It is fancier but more remote and more expensive : the half
<br />
board IUC rate is about $US 66.. Their phone is +385 20 440 555 and their
<br />
FAX is +385 20 432 524. It is wise to reserve early, and be sure to mention
<br />
that you would like the IUC rate. Private rooms are also widely available
<br />
in town and booking is made on the spot at the main bus station ; but make
<br />
sure you don't stay too far from the old city.
<br />
<br />As for safety, there is nothing to fear and tourism is flourishing again in
<br />
Croatia. You may, however, have other misgivings about travel to this
<br />
region. It's perhaps worth mentioning that the I.U.C. has long been a
<br />
bastion of enlightened internationalism - during the cold war and through
<br />
the recent troubles. Your attendance would help support this institution,
<br />
not the forces of reckless nationalism.
