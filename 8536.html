Hi Stathis,
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I replied to the first part of your post earlier, but it took a bit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more time to digest the rest. For what it is worth, I have included my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;thinking out loud&quot; below.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Thanks for replying, and thanks for authorizing me to comment online.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Mmmmmhhhhhh.... I know this could look like jargon. Let me give 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;easy&quot; exercises for anybody following this list.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Let me define a  Multiverse (called also &quot;frame&quot; by Kripke) as any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; non-empty set  W together with an accessibility relation R defined on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the set. Elements of that set are called &quot;world&quot;, by definition, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I follow the convention to denote worlds by greek letters (or their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; english transcription: alpha, beta, gamma, delta, eta, epsilon, iota, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; kappa, omega, nu, theta, etc.). R is called the accessibility 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is W the entire multiverse, containing everything past, present and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future, or is it a snapshot of the multiverse at a particular time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point? If it contains everything, are the elements then snapshots of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular worlds at particular times?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does R operate on W mapping its elements to another set, or does it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indicate that a particular element of W is related to another element? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What exactly does &quot;accessibility&quot; mean in reality? Does it mean a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world is accessible from my present situation if it is possible that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will experience that world in my subjective future? What is and isn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accessible in this sense is subject to debate, rather than being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-evident.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I totally agree with you. The point of modal logic and their multiverse 
<br />
semantics does not consist in closing that debate, but just in giving 
<br />
us a tool to manage the subtleties inherent with the subject. As you 
<br />
correct yourself below, W is any (non-empty) set, and R is any relation 
<br />
mapping some element of W to element(s) of W. One element goes to zero, 
<br />
one, or more elements. W cannot be empty, by definition, but R can be.
<br />
I am really acting like mathematicians are used to act. I provide a 
<br />
very general notion of multiverse: any set with any binary relation 
<br />
will do. Only later we will reason to find out which multiverses are 
<br />
more interesting than others, for example with respect to the measure 
<br />
problem, or the 1-3 distinction problem, or the comp hyp, etc.
<br />
At this point anybody should be able to begin a list of all 
<br />
multiverses, or at least the finite one ...
<br />
The list will be like (with set notation):
<br />
<br />{a} with R = empty
<br />
{a} with R = {(a,a)}
<br />
{a,b} with R = empty
<br />
{a,b} with R = {(a,a)}
<br />
{a, b} with R = {(b,b)}
<br />
{a, b} with R = {(a,a),(b,b)}
<br />
{a, b} with R = {(a,a), (a,b), (b,b)}
<br />
{a, b} with R = {(a,a) (a, b)}
<br />
{a, b} with R = {(a,b)(b,b}}
<br />
etc.
<br />
<br />I use set notations because I cannot make drawings here, but please 
<br />
&quot;translate&quot; all those description into little drawings, it is much more 
<br />
readable. To say R = {(a,a) (a,b)} is the same as saying that aRa and 
<br />
aRb, that is (in multiverse terms): the world a can reach the world a, 
<br />
and the world a can reach the world b. In a drawing the world are 
<br />
points and the relation are arrows from a to b when aRb, etc. OK?
<br />
The very nature of the worlds a, b, c is left unspecified, and the 
<br />
relation of accessibility R is entirely defined by its graph (its set 
<br />
of inputs/outputs).
<br />
The multiverse {a} and the multiverse {b} really denote the same 
<br />
multiverse if nothing special is said about a and b. &quot;Snobbish 
<br />
algebraists&quot; would say they are isomorphic, and that could be wise at 
<br />
some point, but that would be too much at this stage.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So the simplest  example of multiverse is given by the set {alpha} +  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the empty relation (so just one dead end!). Another example is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; set of natural numbers with the divisibility relation ( n R m iff n 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; divide m iff there is a k such that n * k = m).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, I think this means R indicates one element in W is related to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another element in W.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Let me define a notion of illuminated multiverse (called &quot;model&quot; by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the modal logicians). It is just a Kripke multiverse where we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; associate to each world a value 1 or 0 to each sentence letter. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Kripke multiverse is &quot;illuminated&quot; when a truth value (1 or 0) is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assigned to each proposition, in each world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Remember that in (propositional) logic we have sentence letter p, q, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; r, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We also say that p is true in alpha for p has value 1 in alpha (in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some illuminated multiverse).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To clarify: each world alpha, beta etc. in W contains many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions p, q, r etc., and W is called &quot;illuminated&quot; when we know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for each proposition whether it is true (1) or false (0).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes, except I prefer to say that a proposition is true at or in a 
<br />
world, instead of saying the proposition is in the world.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This confuses me a bit, because I think of physical worlds as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; containing things, not propositions.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Just what I was saying! Except that I am not limiting myself to 
<br />
&quot;physical worlds&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suppose you could redefine a world as containing only propositions.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />There is a sense to do that, once the multiverse is illuminated. There 
<br />
is a sense to identify a world with the set of propositions which are 
<br />
true at that world.
<br />
Now beware a little bit: there is also a sense to identify a 
<br />
proposition with a set of worlds: the set of worlds at which the 
<br />
proposition is true. Modal logicians do that all the time. Yes, you can 
<br />
conclude that (in an illuminated multiverse)  a world is a set of of 
<br />
set of worlds. Thanks to God, we will not do such identification ... 
<br />
until the lobian machine will show us some multiverse where such 
<br />
identification will accelerate our reasoning ... (no need to worry 
<br />
before).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, the world I find myself in now contains the propositions 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; p=&quot;I am typing on my computer&quot;=1; q=&quot;there are unicorns in China&quot;=0; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; r=&quot;all bachelors are unmarried&quot;=1; and so on, thus accounting for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every possible true and false fact about the world. Is this what is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meant?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes. One of the reason we tend to shift from &quot;p is true at world a&quot; is 
<br />
the drawing of the illuminated multiverse: to say that p is true at or 
<br />
in a, we draw the world a itself by a circle and we put p in it.
<br />
Only latter,  when I will explain the notion of maximal consistent sets 
<br />
of formula, we will meet a situation where worlds, in some multiverse, 
<br />
will be concrete set of formulas; but no worry before we meet them.
<br />
Those are the erzats worlds that David lewis did criticize, although he 
<br />
seems to have change its mind since. Will come back on this...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now Kripke semantics can be given in a very simple way, by just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; asking that,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1) each world obeys to classical logic (that is: if 1 is assigned to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; p in the world alpha, and if 1 is assigned to q in alpha, then 1 is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assigned to (p &amp; q) in alpha, etc. The &quot;etc&quot; is just a pointer to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; usual truth table of classical propositional logic. I have already 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explain this on this list but I can do it again if asked). In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; particular each classical tautologies are true in all worlds, whatver 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the illumination chosen (whatever the truth value of the sentence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; letter are in each world: like (p -&gt; p) or (p v ~p), etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What do you mean by &quot;whatever the illumination chosen&quot;? If you define 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;illumination&quot; as above, it seems to mean only one thing, so where is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the choice?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />For the sake of simplicity let us say that we have in our propositional 
<br />
language only the three sentence letters {p, q, r}. It could be the 
<br />
three proposition you mentionned before:
<br />
<br />p = &quot;I am typing on my computer&quot;
<br />
q = &quot;there are unicorns in China&quot;
<br />
r = &quot;all bachelors are unmarried&quot;
<br />
<br />Let us take now the simplest of all multiverse: the set {a}, and R is 
<br />
empty.
<br />
Then it is exactly like classical (non modal) logic: we have 8 possible 
<br />
illuminations
<br />
<br />p q r
<br />
1 1 1
<br />
1 1 0
<br />
1 0 1
<br />
1 0 0
<br />
0 1 1
<br />
0 1 0
<br />
0 0 1
<br />
0 0 0
<br />
<br />giving just 8 illuminated multiverse (of *that* kind of multiverse). 
<br />
Each line is one illumination. In a multiverse with two words, you 
<br />
would have 8 times more illumination, given the remaining 8 choices for 
<br />
the illumination in the second world.
<br />
<br />The last one of those (one element)  illuminated multiverse, 
<br />
corresponding to the last line of the tableau above, is such that you 
<br />
are not typing on your computer, they are no unicorns in China, and 
<br />
some bachelor are married.
<br />
No contradiction, because p, q, r ... in propositional logic are not 
<br />
suppose to be analysed further. We are interested in propositions true 
<br />
in all worlds of all multiverses *of a certain kind&quot;. In this example 
<br />
it should be clear that all classical tautologies are true in all world 
<br />
(there is only one). verify for (p -&gt; p), (p V ~p), (p -&gt; (q -&gt; p), 
<br />
etc.
<br />
<br />Now is Bp -&gt; p respected in {a}+R empty, that is:  is &quot;Bp -&gt; p&quot; true in 
<br />
all world whatever the illumination is?
<br />
No. Look at the fifth line, where p = 0, q = 1, and r = 1. Bp is true 
<br />
in a (because R is empty, and so a is a dead end where we have already 
<br />
see that B&lt;anything&gt; is true, and D&lt;anything&gt; is false. In particular 
<br />
Bp is true, but given that p is false, Bp -&gt; p is false.
<br />
<br />If R was not empty and such that aRa, then the Kripke semantics forces 
<br />
p to be true in a. (I recall that Bp is true in a if p is true at all b 
<br />
such that aRb). In that case Bp -&gt; p is true in a (whatever the value 
<br />
of p is).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2) Kripke says that Bp (also written box p, []p, etc.) is true in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; world alpha if p is true in all worlds beta accessible from alpha. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; From this it follows that Dp (defined as an abbreviation of ~B~p) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will be true in some world alpha if there is some world beta, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; accessible from alpha, and with p true in the world beta.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am familiar with the idea that p is necessarily true if p is true in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all possible worlds. How does this relate to the above?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />p -&gt; p is true in all worlds,   (I mean: of the fixed simplest 
<br />
multiverse {a} with R empty).
<br />
B(p -&gt; p) also
<br />
Bp -&gt; p is true only in the world where p is true, given that Bp is 
<br />
always true (given that a is a dead end). So Bp -&gt; p is not respected 
<br />
by the class of one-element-multiverse with R empty.
<br />
etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And a point on terminology: you say &quot;true in all worlds beta&quot;, but I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought beta refers to only one particular world... I suppose you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; using beta here as a variable rather than a constant.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. Just to avoid the greek letter xi, zeta, ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now I will say that a formula A of modal logic is valid in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; illuminated multiverse (W, R, V)  if A is true in all the worlds of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that illuminated multiverse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; V means &quot;illuminated&quot;?
</em><br />
<br /><br />You get the idea. V denotes some illumination. An attribution of truth 
<br />
value (0 or 1) to any sentence letter {p, q, r, ...} for each world in 
<br />
W.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And I will say that a formula A of modal logic is respected by a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; multiverse (W,R)  if A is valid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in all illuminated multiverse (W, R, V). Or equivalently: A is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; respected in (W,R)  if A is true in all worlds in W and this for all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;illuminations&quot; V, i.e. for all assignment of truth value of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sentence letters in all worlds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Last definition: a multiverse (W,R) is said to be reflexive if the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relation R is reflexive (that is: if for all world in W we have xRx, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; i.e. if each world is accessible to itself by the relation R.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What could this mean in a real world example?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Take W as the set of places in Brussels. Take R to be &quot;accessible by 
<br />
walking in a finite number of foot steps&quot;. Then each places at Brussels 
<br />
is accessible from itself, giving that you can access it with zero 
<br />
steps, or two steps (forward, backward, ...).
<br />
<br />Take W as the set of humans, say that aRb if a can see directly, 
<br />
without mirror, the back of b. Then a can access all humans except 
<br />
themselves. R is said to be irreflexive.
<br />
<br />Another important &quot;concrete&quot; example, which will help us latter to 
<br />
study the modal logic of quantum logic. Take the worlds to be the 
<br />
vector of an Hilbert Space (or of the simpler 3-dimensional euclidian 
<br />
space). Say that a is accessible to b, i.e. aRb,  if the scalar product 
<br />
of a and b is non null (i.e. a and b are not orthogonal). Each a can 
<br />
reach itself, so again this &quot;multiverse&quot; is reflexive. Can you see that 
<br />
is also symmetrical?
<br />
Take its &quot;anti-multiverse&quot;, that is the mutiverse (W,R') where aR'b iff 
<br />
not aRb. This means that aR'b iff a is orthogonal to b. Then (W, R') is 
<br />
irreflexive (no vector is orthogonal to itself) but still symmetrical 
<br />
(if aR'b then bR'a).
<br />
Such &quot;multiverse&quot; will help us to find out a modal logic where B 
<br />
captures the quantum probability 1 (the sure bets).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The easy exercise is the following: show that if the multiverse is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reflexive then the multiverse respects the formula Bp -&gt; p.
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bp is true in alpha if p is true in all worlds accessible from alpha. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the multiverse is reflexive, then for Bp to be true, p must be true 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in alpha (which is one of the worlds accessible from alpha). Since 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this applies to any world alpha in W, the formula is respected in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (W,R).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />That's exact.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Slightly less easy: show that the reverse is true: show that if a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; multiverse respects Bp -&gt; p, then the multiverse is reflexive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I have to think about this longer.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />All right. It is less easy. I tend to do it by a reductio ad absurdum. 
<br />
I suppose the multiverse respects Bp -&gt; p, and I suppose it to be non 
<br />
reflexive, then it is enough to find one precise valuation V making a 
<br />
contradiction with Kripke semantics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would like to know if that exercise *seems* difficult. For those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; who cannot do it, it just means there is a need to refresh some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;naive set theory&quot; knowledge, and I will think about a book who can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; help.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Don't hesitate to answer out of line if you prefer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Sorry to annoy you with that modal stuff, but we are at a point I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could no more comment the posts without making nuances which will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; resemble jargon if you don't invest a little bit in modal logic. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This, by the way, could provide us with a language capable of  make 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; clearer many other &quot;everything-like philosophy clearer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have two general difficulties with the above. One is that I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always trying (even without wanting to) to relate the mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic to real world examples, and it gets confusing.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />It is always a good idea to find examples. &quot;Real world&quot; examples can be 
<br />
confusing, because &quot;real worlds&quot; are generally very complex.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The other problem is that it is not clear to me where the theorems/ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axioms/ definitions, such as what is a &quot;valid&quot; and what is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;respected&quot; formula , come from.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I will probably explain it all along. They really come from the goal of 
<br />
studying deduction and independencies among modal formulas.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Should I accept them as self-evident? My understanding is that there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are several possible modal logics, so how does one choose between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them?
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is *the* question! Many classical logicians just hate modal logic 
<br />
because there are so many of them (instead of the secure cocoon of 
<br />
&quot;one&quot; (propositional) classical logic).
<br />
But here I have a sort of incredible answer, which actually appears 
<br />
also in the book by Boolos. You know that what I really want to explain 
<br />
here is how to derive physics from computer science, and what I am 
<br />
doing is &quot;just&quot; to interview the lobian machine. This will give a 
<br />
unique modal logic: the logic of self-reference G. And this modal logic 
<br />
just reflect a mathematical phenomenon (the incompleteness of sound 
<br />
machines or theories). Then all the other modal logics will appear when 
<br />
the machine, taking its own incompleteness into account, will introduce 
<br />
by itself the modal nuances between proof and truth (to begin with, and 
<br />
this will explain G*), and the modal nuances between 1-person and 
<br />
3-person, knowledge and probabilities, and eventually between comp and 
<br />
not-comp.
<br />
the comp + 1-person + truth nuances, motivated by the UDA, and applied 
<br />
to the self-reference logic will give the searched quantum logic.
<br />
<br />Poetically (to breath a little), the physical laws will appear to be 
<br />
the necessary invariant structure living on the border of the machine's 
<br />
ignorance. And all (honest, sound) machine can discover that, soon or 
<br />
later (in platonia, but remember with comp we *are* already in 
<br />
platonia).
