<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horrors!  But then there are already a lot of crackpots infesting

the list, so by comparison, not really a sign that the neighborhood has
<br />
slid downhill.  But really, why anyone would think that particular
<br />
chemicals would be needed to give rise to consciousness is beyond me.  I
<br />
would even prefer dualism over that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My Searlean objection to the above brand of functionalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is, How can computation as such be sufficient to generate consciousness,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when it obviously isn't an intrinsic process of any physical system?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, I assume that by &quot;the above&quot; you meant computationalism.  Well
<br />
there are of course two possible answers to the above.  1) You are
<br />
wrong; it is intrinsic; or 2) Computations can exist without needing to be
<br />
implemented by a physical system.  More on both below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To clarify:  There is a distinction between intrinsic and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-relative features of reality.  The former include all properties     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that are logically independent of the intentional attributions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers, such as the molecular structure of the object I am sitting on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The latter are properties that exist only relative to such attributions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such as being a chair.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think the molecular structure is as intrinsic as you
<br />
obviously think.  But let's move on.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that this is not equivalent to the Chinese Room argument, which says
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that syntacs is not sufficient for semantics;  it denies instead that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics is sufficient for syntax. 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.  I'm glad you didn't use the Chinese Room &quot;argument&quot;, which
<br />
is just a foolish bit of rhetoric.  The problem you _did_ use is indeed a
<br />
nontrivial one.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computation and all other syntax is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-relative, and in one sense exists only from a 1. person point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view.  Please release me from the spell of this simple consideration.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll try.  First a little history: After Searle presented his
<br />
argument that 'computation is observer-relative', Putnam picked up on this
<br />
theme and showed that a rock appears to implement all computations.  
<br />
Chalmers then improved on Putnam's argument and proved that with the
<br />
standard type of definitions, any system that could be though of as
<br />
containing a clock and a dial implements all computations.  (For example,
<br />
if two particles are moving away from each other, the clock could be the
<br />
distance and the dial could be the speed.  With the right mapping from 
<br />
physical to formal states, this system could be seen as implementing any
<br />
given computation.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But being a computationalist himself, Chalmers did not take this
<br />
to be a death blow to computationalism.  So he decided that the definition
<br />
of implementation was missing something, and that adding extra
<br />
restrictions on the mappings that were motivated by our ideas of which
<br />
systems should implement which computations could save the day.  But his
<br />
attempts to do this were unsatisfactory.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is my belief that he was more or less on the right
<br />
track, and I have also tried to find such additional restrictions.  I
<br />
admit that I have not been entirely successful yet, but I do have ideas
<br />
that I will persue when time allows.  My attempts to do this have led me
<br />
to consider the shortest algorithms that can produce certain outputs
<br />
related to the labeling of the formal states.  One problem is that at the
<br />
moment, the shortest algorithm that can output a given string is not a
<br />
completely objective concept either (see Kolmogorov complexity); but, as I
<br />
have mentioned on this list, I have ideas on a possible way to fix that.
<br />
On my web page under &quot;interpretation of quantum mechanics&quot; I discuss some
<br />
of the above.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also mention that there are a few other people (such
<br />
as a student (whose name I forget) of the well-known computationalist
<br />
Dennett) who have also worked on the implementation problem, but my
<br />
approach is a bit different from what others have done.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, so one way to be a computationalist is to assume that some
<br />
program such as mine will eventually succeed (or has succeeded, as some
<br />
think of my competition) in getting the implementation problem under
<br />
control, or at least to think that in principle there is a solution.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But many people on this list have another idea: that computations
<br />
exist, as such; and that the physical world we see is just the way a 
<br />
fairly typical computation models its existance.  No mapping from
<br />
physical to formal states would be needed; the formal states would
<br />
already be the existing states.  Showing that a typical computation would
<br />
see fairly simple physical laws such as ours is part of what is known here
<br />
as the &quot;white rabbit problem&quot;; see the posts about that.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally I think all possible physical (or mathematical) systems
<br />
exist, and that they implement computations.
