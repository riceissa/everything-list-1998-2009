<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equations.

<br />I'm looking forward to the upcoming high energy experiments that just 
<br />
might settle the issue of a gravity force carrier. My thought is that 
<br />
it will never be found, that gravity ultimately is but another 
<br />
expression of inflation; a kind of tension between our universe and 
<br />
the meta universe that is trying to reclaim its virtual particles 
<br />
that are our universe. I'm at loss to explain the physical properties 
<br />
of that &quot;tension&quot; because I don't think there are any that can be 
<br />
expressed in matter/energy terms (because they are space/time terms, 
<br />
and I don't think the matter/energy and space/time can ever be 
<br />
unified even though they do have effect upon each other). And it is 
<br />
difficult to imagine a force carrier that could climb out of a black 
<br />
hole and be expressed as &quot;gravity&quot; with particles in our universe.
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;How is this argument consistent with the very accurate 
</em><br />
prediction
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;decay rates based on quantum analysis of potential barriers 
</em><br />
which
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;not consider inflation or any other aspect of gravity?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You refer to quantum mechanical tunneling, a probabilistic event?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We're getting Spooky again! It's a form of expression related to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Planck's constant. There is no &quot;in between&quot; state in QM, a 
</em><br />
particle
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is either here or it's there when it comes to the smallest packet 
</em><br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; energy that can be expressed. When decay occurs due to a particle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; being &quot;there&quot; instead of being &quot;here&quot; (i.e. bound as it was to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; nucleus) we are simply seeing QM probability on display. This is 
</em><br />
not
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the same mechanism of decay being caused by inflation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But you postulated,&quot;... one reason behind a decay of  any particle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (radioactive or not) is because of inflation...&quot;  I'm just pointing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out that quantum tunneling already explains and accurately predicts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the decay of radioactive atoms and unstable particles without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considering inflation.  So this seems to leave no role for 
</em><br />
inflation
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as &quot;one reason&quot; for decay.  Maybe you are referring to some kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decay that has not been observed?  like decay of the proton?
</em><br />
<br />I postulated a different (non energy exchange) mechanism for decay, 
<br />
not the only mechanism for decay (another being interaction with 
<br />
another energy sources). I mean there's a difference to having pumped 
<br />
something up to an unstable state and QM then doing its decay thing 
<br />
versus something that is in a ground state which then suddenly decays 
<br />
due to sudden bond breakage caused by space volume changes that 
<br />
result from inflation. The two decay mechanisms are not related 
<br />
whatsoever, although they both result in a decay. Unless pumped up to 
<br />
a higher energy state by interaction with energy, particles seek to 
<br />
be at ground state. Once all the &quot;foreign&quot; energy has been shed from 
<br />
a particle via QM, it undergoes no more decay and is 100% stable. 
<br />
Well, maybe not, but I think that it is so. Stable until the volume 
<br />
of local inflation relative to that particle reaches a specific 
<br />
value.
<br />
<br />No, I don't think we're likely to observe much in the way of locally 
<br />
detectable decay due to inflation right *now*, because the rate of 
<br />
and the volume of inflation locally has not exceeded the speed of 
<br />
light at the atomic level - yet. Only where space/time inflation 
<br />
between 2 points surpasses the speed of light to the point where a 
<br />
particle within that volume can not interact with other particles can 
<br />
one expect that *total* decay occurs. This is likely to occur in 
<br />
voids and black holes sooner than elsewhere in the universe. 
<br />
Unfortunately, when it happens it can not be observed. Well, maybe 
<br />
there might be some really very high energy decay observed due to 
<br />
some QM effect when the expansion rate relative to a particle is at 
<br />
an infistimately small fraction below the speed of light, and we 
<br />
might in result detect flashes of super high energy seemingly coming 
<br />
randomly and from anywhere. But we detect nothing from within areas 
<br />
where inflation is expanding faster than light.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, as volume of inflation increases and before it reaches 
<br />
light speed there will still be observable effects of decay. Total 
<br />
decay doesn't happen all at once, the process comes in packets of 
<br />
energy decay over time as the space/time inflation volume increase 
<br />
forces nuclear components away from each other. I suppose that total 
<br />
decay will follow partial decay in a rather short time period.
<br />
<br />Another good way to observe the effects of such a decay might be at 
<br />
the event horizon of a black hole (just barely before entering it). 
<br />
I've argued in this topic already that a black hole is, relative to 
<br />
everything in our universe, just a localized example of an inflation 
<br />
rate that has exceeded the speed of light. And that what we term 
<br />
&quot;gravity&quot; is really what dark matter is, a tension being expressed 
<br />
between our universe and the meta universe - it is everywhere and it 
<br />
is not composed of matter/energy, it is composed of space/time. 
<br />
Overall, dark matter is very highly uniform in its distribution 
<br />
throughout the universe. But there are exceptions, the most obvious 
<br />
being where there are black holes and anywhere else there is 
<br />
matter/energy, so the concentrations vary at local scales. Higher 
<br />
local concentrations of matter/energy simply mean there is higher 
<br />
local &quot;tension&quot; involved.
