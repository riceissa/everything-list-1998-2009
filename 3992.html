</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; battle in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this respect at least intellectually.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I'm not set one way or the other about discreteness, especially as the 
<br />
level of quantization is at Planck length scales, presumably. That is, 
<br />
10^-34 cm or so. Maybe even smaller. And the Planck time is on the 
<br />
order of 10^-43 second.
<br />
<br />One reason discrete space and time isn't ipso facto absurd is that we 
<br />
really have no good reason to believe that smooth manifolds are any 
<br />
more plausible. We have no evidence at all that either space or time is 
<br />
infinitely divisible, infinitely smooth. In fact, such infinities have 
<br />
begun to seem stranger to me than some form of loops or lattice points 
<br />
at small enough scales.
<br />
<br />Why, we should ask, is the continuum abstraction any more plausible 
<br />
than discrete sets? Because the sand on a beach looks &quot;smooth&quot;? (Until 
<br />
one looks closer.) Because grains of sand have little pieces of quartz 
<br />
which are smooth? (Until one looks closer.)
<br />
<br />But, more importantly, the causal set (or causal lattice) way of 
<br />
looking at things applies at vastly larger scales, having nothing 
<br />
whatsoever to do with the ultimate granularity or smoothness of space 
<br />
and time. That is, a set of events, occurrences, collisions, clock 
<br />
ticks, etc. forms a causal lattice. This is true at the scale of 
<br />
microcircuits as well as in human affairs (though there we get the 
<br />
usual &quot;interpretational&quot; issues of causality, discussed by Judea Pearl 
<br />
at length in his book &quot;Causality&quot;).
<br />
<br />You say you prefer continuity and connectedness....this all depends on 
<br />
the topology one chooses. In the microcircuit case, the natural 
<br />
topology of circuit elements and conductors and clock ticks gives us 
<br />
our lattice points. In other examples, set containment gives us a 
<br />
natural poset, without &quot;points.&quot;
<br />
<br />(In fact, of course mathematics can be done with open sets, or closed 
<br />
sets for that matter, as the &quot;atoms&quot; of the universe, with no reference 
<br />
to points, and certainly not to Hausdorff spaces similar to the real 
<br />
number continuum.)
<br />
<br />The really interesting things, for me, are the points of intersection 
<br />
between logic and geometry.
