<br />
Hi all,
<br />
<br />It is very hard for me to tell on this list what is being sent me 
<br />
privately and what is coming over the list.  I am trying to respond 
<br />
in the mode I received.  Sorry for any mistake.  Norman and John, I 
<br />
believe, responded on list, so here goes.
<br />
<br />Norman, you say:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Also, I'm unable to find a meaningful (to me) argument against
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;reductionism.  Why is it in trouble?  It seems to me that even a complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;human being can be defined in concept by discrete quantum states and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;particles, atoms and electrical charges.  &quot;Thoughts&quot; are therefore NOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;infinite because they can be conceptually defined in terms of particles and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quantum states, and there are not an infinite number of these permutations.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Okay, well here you have just asserted that human beings can be 
<br />
defined as the sum of discrete quantum states and the like and that 
<br />
thoughts are therefore not infinite.
<br />
<br />If what you suggest is true, then your conclusion would follow.  I 
<br />
claimed, though, that the reductionist thesis is in trouble, and you 
<br />
asked why. There is a huge literature on emergentism and 
<br />
reductionism, but let me just stick with the so-called mind-body 
<br />
issue that Hal also alluded to.
<br />
<br />There have been two main reductionist strategies to deal with mental 
<br />
states, and they both -- to say the least -- have stalled.  The two 
<br />
strategies are:
<br />
<br />1.  Eliminative materialism
<br />
2.  Identity theory
<br />
<br />Eliminative materialism argued that human behavior could be explained 
<br />
scientifically without reference to the mental states of folk 
<br />
psychology.  S-R behaviorism -- as in Skinner -- was the great effort 
<br />
here, and it is now largely judged a failure.  We seem to need mental 
<br />
states to explain human -- and even lower animal -- behavior.
<br />
<br />So then there is the identity theory, the attempt to show that each 
<br />
mental state is identical to some (or finitely many) physical states. 
<br />
Well, this has not panned out either.  At worst, we may be in for 
<br />
some many-to-many correspondence between mental states and physical 
<br />
states, which spells doom for identity theory and reductionism.
<br />
<br />I probably have not said enough to convince anyone here. This is a 
<br />
big issue, and much more could be said.  I am just trying to 
<br />
summarize the current status of the mind-body debate.  At the very 
<br />
least, the reductionist argument has been stalemated -- and there are 
<br />
good reasons, having to do with the role of language, for thinking it 
<br />
is false.
<br />
<br />Norman suggests the upshot for the Tegmark thesis:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Thoughts&quot; are therefore NOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinite because they can be conceptually defined in terms of particles and
</em><br />
quantum states, and there are not an infinite number of these permutations.
<br />
<br />Well, only if reductionism succeeds.  If reductionism fails, then, 
<br />
unlike universes, which, on my reading of Tegmark, are discrete and 
<br />
countable, thoughts are not only infinite but uncountably infinite. 
<br />
In that case, thoughts -- and persons -- comprise an even larger 
<br />
infinity than universes.  And -- although this is another argument -- 
<br />
at least a part of the universe would not behave deterministically.
<br />
<br />If you tend to resist what I am suggesting, consider three things:
<br />
<br />1.  How do you even individuate thoughts so as to count them or 
<br />
correlate them with physical states?  Is the belief that Mark Twain 
<br />
wrote Huckleberry Finn the same as or different from the belief that 
<br />
Samuel Clemens wrote Huckleberry Finn?  Would that be one physical 
<br />
state you would seek to correlate with it or two?  There are lots of 
<br />
well-discussed conceptual problems here.
<br />
<br />2. The mind-brain relation has sometimes been compared to the 
<br />
relation between software and hardware in computers.  A certain 
<br />
software function might be endlessly realizable by different physical 
<br />
(hardware) configurations in different computers. Similarly, I 
<br />
suppose, the same hardware configuration might realize different 
<br />
software functions in different computers.  The analogy might break 
<br />
down, but this is the idea.
<br />
<br />3.  The denial of reductionism does not necessarily entail belief in 
<br />
what is called &quot;a ghost in the machine,&quot; i.e., a soul or other 
<br />
mystical something.  The denial of reductionism may instead imply 
<br />
that not only is there no ghost, there also is no machine (i.e., we 
<br />
don't behave in machine-like ways). (This is a point made by Searle.)
<br />
<br />John, I am not sure I understand everything you said. One thing I 
<br />
would say along lines I think you suggest:  Determinism suggests a 
<br />
closed system.  If you don't have a closed system, you don't get 
<br />
deterministic predictiveness.  Human thought is both holistic and 
<br />
unclosable.  Those features do not preclude mental causality, but 
<br />
they do preclude deterministic, causal laws.
<br />
<br />Well, I hope I have not bored you all, but I do think that there are 
<br />
considerations from the social sciences that bear on -- and possibly 
<br />
challenge  -- Tegmark's thesis.
<br />
<br />Thanks for your responses.
<br />
<br />doug
