<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And (added McCarthy) I let you know that all the Gods, although

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means &quot;yes&quot; and which means &quot;no&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Wow, that was a hard one!
<br />
I have been thinking about it all day, but I think
<br />
I got to the solution. Let's see...
<br />
<br />I developed a whole method for solving this kind of
<br />
problem. :)
<br />
<br />Labelling the Knights' God as T, the Knaves' God as F,
<br />
and the Knives' God as R, we have 6 possible 'states'
<br />
we want to distinguish, which are all the permutations
<br />
of them. I'll make 3 questions, which can have two
<br />
possible outcomes each, &quot;JA&quot;(J) or &quot;DA&quot;(D). This means
<br />
that in the end my &quot;experiment&quot; has 8 possible outcomes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From this initial analysis it is clear that I cannot aim
</em><br />
to ask questions which would give me information about
<br />
the statements &quot;JA=YES&quot; or &quot;JA=NO&quot;, because for that I
<br />
would need to distinguish between 12 states. 
<br />
But since I have 2 outcomes more than states, it is
<br />
possible that I might in some cases get this last answer,
<br />
but only as a bonus.
<br />
<br />So I make a table where I try to fit a set of 3
<br />
questions whose outcomes are going to distinguish these
<br />
states. One possible table is the following:
<br />
<br />State   1st     J  D    JJ  JD  DJ  DD  Final
<br />
-----------------------------------------------
<br />
TRF     J       J       J               JJJ 
<br />
TFR     D          J            J       DJJ
<br />
FRT     J       D           J           JDJ
<br />
FTR     D          D                J   DDJ
<br />
RTF     J/D     J  D    D           D   JJD/DDD
<br />
RFT     J/D     D  J        D   D       JDD/DJD
<br />
-----------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />The blank spaces mean that we don't care what would
<br />
be the answer in those cases, because they have been
<br />
already ruled out. It's important to leave blank
<br />
spaces in at least two lines which correspond to
<br />
'R's in the same column, because we can always make
<br />
the question to the the God in that column so that
<br />
we can arrange the random answers to fall in those
<br />
places. The columns 'J', 'JJ' and so on indicate the
<br />
outcomes that I wish the next question to have given
<br />
outcome 'J', 'JJ' and so on for the previous questions.
<br />
<br />Some more thought shows that you can always come up
<br />
with *some* question that fits whatever choice of
<br />
outcomes you want, given the constraints above. So
<br />
we have a lot of freedom to choose the outcomes in
<br />
the above table, the only problem will be to think
<br />
of the corresponding verbal questions.
<br />
<br />So the first problem is to come up with some question
<br />
which would be answered as in the '1st' column.
<br />
This question could be, using the idea of Jesse Mazer,
<br />
but with an extra trick:
<br />
&quot;If I asked you &quot;Is the 2nd God the 'R'&quot;, would
<br />
you say 'JA'?&quot;
<br />
The interesting thing is that this question does not
<br />
tell us if JA is YES or NO, but a minute of thought
<br />
shows that the outcomes are the same whatever JA means.
<br />
<br />After some thought, the other questions can be:
<br />
Column'J': &quot;3rd god, if I asked you 'Are you the 'F'',
<br />
would you say 'JA'?&quot;;
<br />
Column'D': &quot;2nd god, if I asked you 'Are you the 'F'',
<br />
would you say 'JA'?&quot;;
<br />
Columns 'JJ' and 'JD': &quot;3rd god, if I asked you 
<br />
'Is the 2nd god 'R'', would you say 'JA'?&quot;;
<br />
Columns 'DJ' and 'DD': &quot;2nd god, if I asked you 
<br />
'Is the 3rd god 'R'', would you say 'JA'?&quot;.
<br />
<br />So I think these would solve the problem. It was a
<br />
lot of fun! Let me see what you guys think. 
<br />
<br />As an extra challenge, can you think of a way to
<br />
find out if JA=YES in some of the outcomes? It
<br />
would involve different questions, but I think it
<br />
should be possible in principle.
<br />
<br />Eric.
