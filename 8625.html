<br />(After being away for a couple weeks, I'd like to follow up with yours
<br />
and others replies.)
<br />
<br />I find this line of argument hard to follow.  I think where we differ is
<br />
that I assume there must be some physical causality connecting observer
<br />
moments.
<br />
<br />That is, if a person is in physical state A and is experiencing state
<br />
E(A), then their next subjective moment E(B) must have some connected,
<br />
causal path between physical state A and physical state B. This
<br />
reasoning makes the materialist assumption that subjective experience E
<br />
is entirely defined by the physical state of the observer.
<br />
<br />According to MWI, physical state A actually evolves into a superposition
<br />
of discrete physical states B, each with a different &quot;density&quot; or
<br />
&quot;measure.&quot;  So, by the logic of the previous paragraph, subjective
<br />
experience E(A) must evolve into a superposition of discrete Es, each a
<br />
function of the particular discrete physical state B it arises from, and
<br />
each with a particular measure.
<br />
<br />Some subset of this superposition of physical states B, however, do not
<br />
support the creation of subjective experience (say, where the person has
<br />
died.)  So some proportion of E(B)'s are null.
<br />
<br />So my original question about &quot;what is happening to Tookie now&quot; can be
<br />
rephrased as the following thought experiment:
<br />
<br />Physical state A is Tookie lying on a gurney, experiencing E(A), which
<br />
is getting injected with lethal toxin by the State of California.
<br />
<br />Clearly, the vast majority of the elements of superposition of states B
<br />
which follow the execution are with him being dead, and do not give rise
<br />
to any subjective experience at all.
<br />
<br />What are the possibilities for causally connected physical states which
<br />
don't involve his death?  Which B's exist which continue to give rise to
<br />
new E(B)'s?
<br />
<br />In other words, which observer moments for Tookie exist which include
<br />
the memories of his having received the lethal injection, but not of
<br />
dying as a result?
<br />
<br />Does there have to be any at all?  QTI says yes, there must be, and no
<br />
matter how unlikely--there is always escape in some form.  What was
<br />
Tookie's?
<br />
