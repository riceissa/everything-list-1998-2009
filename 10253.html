If we are living in a simulation (and I believe the matrix hypothesis is a
<br />
real possibility) and if we are all just software constructs then the
<br />
architect has some options available to it. If it is benevolent, then it
<br />
could copy (and save) the state of the simulation at various times.  It
<br />
could then hunt through the saved states to find the nearest copy to the
<br />
state of death of a &quot;person&quot; (ist person experiencer?) in the simulation and
<br />
paste it into a new environment (resurrect it!).  Maybe it might like to
<br />
&quot;grow&quot; individuals that learn to be better this way.  This is my wishful
<br />
thinking of how the simulation might work and how its creator might
<br />
&quot;interfere&quot; with it to get what it wants.  All the usual arguments from
<br />
theology about the purpose/reason of evil and suffering etc. can be brought
<br />
into the debate wholesale from here on.  However because the architect may
<br />
not be benevolent towards us it may not choose to resurrect us.  If it is
<br />
intelligent enough to make such a simulation then maybe it is moral too but
<br />
some have speculated against this (Dainton for example see: Innocence Lost
<br />
Simulation Scenarios: Prospects and Consequences
<br />
Barry Dainton (2002, October), The University of Liverpool). I can send you
<br />
a pdf if you want but give me an e-mail to send to.
<br />
<br />When I look at nature it does seem &quot;bloodied tooth and claw&quot;.  Is this what
<br />
a &quot;good&quot; simulator would have done? Then again in simulations things don't
<br />
always work out the way the maker's figured.  I dunno - I've never managed
<br />
to go beyond this because there is no data to support anything other than to
<br />
say the simulation argument is compelling.

<br />Nick
<br />
<br />I certainly don't know that I'm right and you're wrong.  I didn't post
<br />
my original thoughts because I believe that I have knock down arguments
<br />
either that we do or should live in a world with specific moral
<br />
imperatives, whether or not it is a 'simulation'.  Rather, I hadn't
<br />
seen the sorts of value-based issues you mention given an airing in the
<br />
somewhat bloodless 'technical' discussions I've previously read on this
<br />
possibility.  So my 'questions' aren't at all intended to be merely
<br />
rhetorical, but to elicit intelligent responses such as your own.
<br />
<br />However,since I do believe that we're lost if we feel we can't take the
<br />
issues in our lives seriously, my motive in posting was in a sense to
<br />
test whether others felt in any way influenced in their moral or
<br />
practical thinking or behaviour by the possibility (some would say
<br />
probability) that our lives are simulations being run for somebody
<br />
else's benefit. Some parallels with certain sorts of religious outlook
<br />
strike me, in that I've often felt that these do indeed encourage just
<br />
such an attitude - that our lives should be ultimately dedicated to
<br />
some deity's purposes, not to exploring our own.
<br />
<br />One thing you don't say in your interesting response is whether such
<br />
considerations influence you personally in any way, or whether they're
<br />
just a diverting thought experiment. Your comments would be
<br />
interesting.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear David
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why is it so difficult to conceive that the simulators should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unwittingly? Or in some way non ethical and thoughtless of the pain,
</em><br />
fears,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; loves etc of an interesting by product (or even possibly irritating by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; product) of their simulation.  Do you eat meat?  Trap mice? kill flies?
</em><br />
Wash
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bacteria from your hands?  How much  time and concern do you (we) give to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these  life forms?  For all we know the cockroach may be the purposeful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; study of the simulation we are in - or even whichever species is &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surviving species&quot; of interest at t=time to stop.  I know it feels like we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be important but, in the scale of things - it's probably just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wishfull thinking. A hugely more intelligent species may not even be
</em><br />
moral.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Who says morality to all other species is useful anyway (for survival) and

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But your observation goes to the heart of my question.  If we were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed 'merely incidental' (from whose perspective?) then what would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this say about the ethical position of the simulaters?  Further, if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are merely playing the role of 'simple automata' then what is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purpose (from the simulaters' viewpoint) of our *conscious* fears,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pains, loves, life struggle, and so forth?  Are these just an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unavoidable and unimportant (except to us) 'epiphenomenon' of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation method?  Or are they what you mean by an 'interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pattern'?  Are we to take our creators' position as being 'superior' to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ours and if so what does this imply for our own (periodic) moral
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delicacy about the rights and feelings of others - should we perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view this as mere naivety or lack of intelligence in the light of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; masters' indifference to ours?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These are the issues I'm attempting to raise in the context of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'simulation hypothesis'.  Of course, there's an aspect of this that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recapitulates the struggle throughout history to establish humane moral
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criteria in the face of various arbitrary and omnipotent god-figures,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or for that matter 'blind necessity'.  Even in the teeth of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creator, you are not forced to accept the justice of his position, even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as you bow to his overwhelming force, as Job shows us.
