</em><br />
<br />Well, it's a very reasonable *conjecture*, I'd suggest.
<br />
It seems like that sort of conclusion has worked very,
<br />
very well in the past.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Brent Meeker

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Science is just common-sense writ large.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How *very* true. [I want to rant] against the doctrine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the scientific method!!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;the scientific method&quot; - the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothetico-deductive method?  So far as I know all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; methods of science are just common sense applied carefully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and thoroughly.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, and that's *all* they are: just ordinary common sense applied,
<br />
as you say, carefully and thoroughly.  It's what Galileo and
<br />
Kepler did.  Sure, Kepler would come up with wild conjectures
<br />
(or at least ones that we think of as wild today), and some
<br />
were right and some were wrong. He usually respected valid
<br />
criticism, (although everyone's ego gets in the way from time
<br />
to time).
<br />
<br />A good detective or a good housewife does exactly the same.
<br />
The detective formulates a theory that he hopes explains the
<br />
crime, and goes about (usually with a bias) looking for 
<br />
evidence that supports his theory.  The housewife guesses
<br />
and guesses at the best way to remove stains from various
<br />
articles in the house, and by &quot;applying common sense carefully
<br />
and rationally&quot; gets closer and closer to the truth.
<br />
<br />All was well until the philosophers stepped in.  They looked
<br />
at what Galileo, Newton, Kepler, and Lavoisier did, and began
<br />
to think about it.  Unfortunately.  They abstracted from what
<br />
all these worthies were doing a so-called &quot;scientific method&quot;.
<br />
It had five steps.  Well, it did when I was in school.  To
<br />
execute the scientific method, you follow those steps. Even as
<br />
a child I was skeptical (rather, it just didn't do anything 
<br />
for me) because I fancied that in my understandings of astronomy
<br />
I was already a scientist.  Sort of.  A junior scientist, at
<br />
least.  And what I did and what I learned didn't have anything
<br />
to do with all this fancy stuff.
<br />
<br />Next the philosophers evolved this doctrine into Scientism, so
<br />
that they could look down their noses at the thoughts of many
<br />
other people and pronounce them &quot;unscientific&quot;.  This was
<br />
strange, since the other people were for the most part using
<br />
the same genetically originated homo sapiens type thinking
<br />
that the real scientists were.  But it was good propaganda,
<br />
and it enabled them to put pressure on textbook publishers 
<br />
so as to curtail the spread of opinions that they disagreed
<br />
with. (It was the 20th century, after all.)
<br />
<br />Fortunately, another philosopher (Popper) came to the rescue,
<br />
and so far as I know, didn't talk much about the Method. He
<br />
described what people were doing---scientists, detectives,
<br />
housewives, animals---as making conjectures and learning from
<br />
their mistakes.
<br />
<br />But in the schools it's still taught that there is a Scientific
<br />
Method, and that's what makes scientists' opinions better than
<br />
the non-credentialed.  (The scientists usually *do* have better
<br />
opinions, but only because they've studied something longer or
<br />
have been more careful, as you write, not because they use a
<br />
Method.)
<br />
<br />You wanna teach a kid how to be a scientist?  Just have him
<br />
or her look into some subject matter in detail where there is
<br />
the possibility of obtaining a unified understanding, or there
<br />
is the possibility of performing experiments.  Save him from
<br />
pedantic doctrines, such as &quot;The Scientific Method&quot;.
