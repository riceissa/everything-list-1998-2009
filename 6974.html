<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to be any sufficiently similar

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; physical process, it is bad for

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; any of them to suffer.  (That one of

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; me ends up being prejudiced as regards
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; his own special skin seems to be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunate legacy of evolution, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; one that doesn't support much consistency.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You're looking for sense and consistency where there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; isn't any. My moment of enlightenment was when I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; realised the whole thing is a crazy mess. But I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; no more ignore the effects of the crazy mess on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; my psychological processes than I can command my body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to grow an extra head.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But come the future, I don't really care what happens
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to my duplicates, because I can only be one person at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; once (that isn't really consistent, but I can't shake
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that feeling either).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, you probably still *feel* that the Earth is flat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as you walk around on it; but you *know* better.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You *could* adopt the point of view I espouse in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first paragraph, above, and then it wouldn't be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inconsistent mess, would it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [It's] a matter of definition. What if tomorrow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all my memories are replaced with different memories,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; perhaps those of a made up person?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, it would *definitely* be someone else, not you!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It simply definitely true that if your body woke
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tomorrow with all Bush's memories, and yours were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;expunged from the Earth, then you'd be dead (here).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the bricks have been replaced. Is it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the same building or a different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one? Philosophers could scratch their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; heads and write papers in the learned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; journals for years to come debating this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, the good old Ship of Theseus. IN the ship case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we know all the facts; the problem is which one we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;want to call the &quot;real&quot; Ship of Theseus. As for me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;both are the Ship of Theseus in this way or that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We are getting to the heart of the disagreement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; here. There is *no* correct answer! You could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probably come up with a definition to cover all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; eventualities, but even if it actually did this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consistently (which I think would be very, very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; difficult), in the final analysis, it would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to be an arbitrary one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, yes, it would be arbitrary to say whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or not you are the same person you were ten years
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ago.  Or at age 10.  But there *are* important
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;FACTS OF THE MATTER, in my opinion.  One fact of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the matter is that you are the same person you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;were yesterday, and will be tomorrow. It's perfectly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;clear that what is up for grabs is the *degree* to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which one is an earlier or a later version.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the viewpoint of physics, your duplicate across
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the room created a moment ago much more vastly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;resembles you than the &quot;you&quot; of a month ago. Since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you are the same person that you were a month ago,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then it follows that you are the same person as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your duplicate across the room.  That it doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*seem* that you are the same person is just one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;those things (like MWI itself) that physics is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;trying to tell us and that we have to just get used to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I take as more inescapable the assertion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; that I am the same person I was yesterday, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; will be the same person tomorrow. Further,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; physics seems to grab me by the throat and FORCE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; me to accept that my duplicate across the room
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; and I don't differ significantly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Do you mean duplicate as in identical twin?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Not quite!  It turns out that everyone who knows them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;regards identical twins as different persons. And so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;regards them, I am pretty certain as different people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a way that they were *NOT* so regard you and your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;duplicate.  You and your duplicate---created yesterday,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;say---would be SO SIMILAR I claim, that people would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;regard you as the same person.  It seems that identical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;twins always do have slightly different personalities,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and that a lot of the differences they exhibit were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;created during the nine months before birth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, if you can't affect it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; that's a reason for non-concern.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; But if you could, then, I contend,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; one intervenes to prevent one's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; duplicate from suffering for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; entirely *selfish* reasons.
</em><br />
<br />It seems that we are just defining the term &quot;me&quot; differently. My definition 
<br />
is that if you stick a pin in a person and I feel it, then that person is 
<br />
me. If you stick a pin in the guy across the room who looks, talks, behaves 
<br />
etc. like me, *I* don't feel anything. Isn't this a rather basic, 
<br />
scientifically verifiable difference?
<br />
<br />You may also have something different in mind to me when using the term 
<br />
&quot;selfish&quot;. In evolutionary biology, animals sometimes engage in apparently 
<br />
self-sacrificing behaviour to help their kin, but in reality the behaviour 
<br />
is &quot;selfish&quot;, because in so acting the animal is propagating its own genes 
<br />
(which is basically all nature cares about). In this sense, you could argue 
<br />
that we should behave altruistically towards those who share our genes, and 
<br />
call this &quot;selfish&quot;. I don't accept this, generally, as an argument: just 
<br />
because it is nature's way doesn't mean it is right. But even if i did 
<br />
accept it, it *still* isn't the same when my copy gets stuck with a pin as 
<br />
when I get stuck with a pin. I might feel guilty about it, but I would 
<br />
prefer that he get stuck ten times rather than that I get stuck once.
