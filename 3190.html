</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So the question is &quot;knowing that I am living (1-person view) this

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My feeling is that Charles and Jesse agree here.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Unlike Jacques Mallah, but like Charles, I cannot give meaning to an

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;absolute a priori probability on &quot;observer-moment&quot;, but I can give,

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;isolating natural nearness relations bearing on computational states
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and histories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree with Jesse that my actual observer-moment is not a matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of definition. Nor will I appreciate, if I ask my doctor if there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is a high chance of surviving a delicate operation, that he answers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;me that it is a matter of definition.
</em><br />
<br />Hmm, I think we actually have a full spectrum of opinions here...Jacques 
<br />
believes only in absolute probability, Bruno believes only in conditional 
<br />
probabilities, and I believe in both. So, of course, I agree with what Bruno 
<br />
said about the importance of conditional probabilities--what happens to me 
<br />
after an operation is not a matter of definition--but I also think there 
<br />
should be an absolute distribution to tell me how likely it is that I will 
<br />
experience one type of observer-moment vs. another in the first place.
<br />
<br />I don't really think there's some &quot;other metaphysical realm&quot; where we get 
<br />
dropped from, but I do think that, as an analogy, the spotlight one is not 
<br />
actually so bad. After all, if you think that you just *are* your current 
<br />
observer-moment, how can you possibly become any other one? The 
<br />
observer-moment itself doesn't transform--it's just sitting there timelessly 
<br />
in Platonia among all other possible observer-moments. So, it's better to 
<br />
think of &quot;continuity of consciousness&quot; as a spotlight moving between 
<br />
different observer-moments, with the probability of going from one to 
<br />
another defined by the conditional probability distribution.
<br />
<br />Similarly, if you just *are* your current observer-moment with probability 
<br />
1, nothing else can be said, so there doesn't seem to be any way to assign 
<br />
meaning to an absolute probability distribution on all observer-moments. I 
<br />
think it makes more sense to think of this distribution as the probability 
<br />
that a randomly-selected spotlight will be shining on a particular 
<br />
observer-moment, like in the Hoyle story. If we abandon the idea of an 
<br />
absolute probability distribution, we have no hope of explaining why I am 
<br />
this particular type of observer-moment experiencing this particular type of 
<br />
universe, and we can only explain why my future experience will have a 
<br />
certain amount in common with my current experience (assuming that's what 
<br />
the conditional probability distribution actually predicts). But plenty of 
<br />
observer-moments might find themselves experiencing universes with very 
<br />
different laws of physics--why am I experiencing these laws as opposed to 
<br />
some other set? Without a global probability distribution this can only be a 
<br />
brute fact, unexplained by the TOE. Likewise, why am I experiencing this 
<br />
particular era of the universe's history, or this unusual spatial region 
<br />
(the surface of a planet containing complex life), or this particular 
<br />
organism's point of view (a human vs. some other animal)? In all of these 
<br />
cases I think the intuitive explanation is something like the &quot;anthropic 
<br />
principle&quot; or the &quot;self-sampling assumption&quot; (this term is explained on 
<br />
<a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com">http://www.anthropic-principle.com</a> by Nick Bostrom, for anyone who's not 
<br />
familiar with it), and my hope is that the global probability distribution 
<br />
would incorporate a formalized version of something like this. But without 
<br />
such a global probability distribution, all this stuff becomes just more 
<br />
brute facts.
<br />
<br />Just because something has probability 1 from your current point of view, I 
<br />
don't think that means it should be treated as a brute fact. If so, all 
<br />
historical scientific theories would be pointless--cosmologists would be out 
<br />
of a job, for example. As long as we can imagine that things *could* have 
<br />
been different, we should try to explain why they are the way they are. Even 
<br />
though I know with probability 1 that I am Jesse Mazer sitting in front of a 
<br />
computer right now, I think I can imagine somehow that this could have been 
<br />
different--that my current experience could have been that of Blackbeard the 
<br />
pirate sailing the high seas, or that of a bat locating bugs through 
<br />
echolocation, or even that of a 12-dimensional alien living in a universe 
<br />
with very different laws of physics. The global probability distribution 
<br />
would hopefully tell me something about which types of observer-moments my 
<br />
&quot;spotlight&quot; is more likely to find itself shining on in the current moment.
<br />
<br />I wrote something about two different meanings of the &quot;anthropic principle&quot; 
<br />
in another post a while ago (at 
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2445.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2445.html</a> ) which might be relevant 
<br />
here. The idea was that the weak anthropic principle can be used in two 
<br />
slightly different ways--one version is just to say that I know with 
<br />
probability 1 that I am a particular type of intelligent organism, and that 
<br />
I use this to reason backwards and make deductions about what the universe 
<br />
must be like, given that fact. But the second version actually tries to go 
<br />
the other way and explain *why* I find myself to be an intelligent organism, 
<br />
by starting from a universe/multiverse large enough to contain at least a 
<br />
few intelligent organisms somewhere, no matter how rare, and then saying 
<br />
that in some sense I am guaranteed to find myself in one of those rare 
<br />
intelligence-containing regions since otherwise I wouldn't be an &quot;I&quot; at all. 
<br />
Here was the section of the post where I talked about the distinction:
<br />
<br />&quot;I think we need to distinguish between two kinds of anthropic reasoning
<br />
here.  The first version just says &quot;I observe that I exist, so I know with
<br />
probability 1 that I must occupy a time and place where my existence is
<br />
possible.&quot;  Obviously this is completely uncontroversial.  In this version,
<br />
though, it's not really important that you say &quot;I exist&quot; or &quot;intelligent
<br />
observers capable of anthropic reasoning exist&quot;--you could just as easily
<br />
have made up the &quot;star-thropic principle&quot; which says that you know with
<br />
probability 1 that stars exist, so you must be in a time and place where
<br />
star formation is possible.
<br />
<br />As originally envisioned by Carter, both the &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; anthropic
<br />
principles were versions of this idea.  In &quot;Modern Cosmology &amp; Philosophy,&quot;
<br />
John Leslie writes that &quot;Carter's weak principle reminds us of the obvious
<br />
but oft neglected truth that our place and time must, granted that we are in
<br />
fact there, be a place and time where observers can exist: they are not, for
<br />
example, fried immediately, as they would be shortly after the Big Bang.
<br />
Carter's strong principle similarly reminds us that our universe must--as we
<br />
do exist in it, don't we?--be a universe whose nature is not
<br />
life-excluding...the 'must' is in both cases like that of 'The photo is
<br />
marked WIFE, so *must* be of a woman.'  No suggestion that the photo *had to
<br />
be* of a woman or that it is somehow especially easy to be a woman!&quot;
<br />
<br />But there's another version of &quot;anthropic reasoning&quot; which, although it
<br />
perhaps deserves a different name, seems to me to be valid as well.  This
<br />
version says that, given that at least some observer-containing regions
<br />
exist, &quot;I&quot; must find myself in one of these regions.  In this case &quot;I&quot; is
<br />
like the &quot;I&quot; in the Doomsday argument, which says &quot;I&quot; could have been born
<br />
at any time in history, despite the fact that I wouldn't be the same person
<br />
if I'd been born at some other time.  In this version the fact that we're
<br />
talking about &quot;observers&quot; is important--it wouldn't work with stars or
<br />
anything else.
<br />
<br />If I win the lottery, I'm pretty &quot;lucky&quot;--I could just as easily have been
<br />
one of the losers.  On the other hand, despite the fact that physically
<br />
realized genetic codes occupy only a tiny fraction of the space of all
<br />
possible human DNA sequences, I wouldn't say I'm &quot;lucky&quot; to have an existing
<br />
sequence rather than a nonexisting one--it isn't possible to &quot;be&quot; a
<br />
nonexistent person, so of course I'm one of the existing ones (assuming for
<br />
the moment that these other sequences aren't realized in a parallel universe
<br />
or something).  This is an application of the second version of anthropic
<br />
reasoning.
<br />
<br />The distinction between these two versions still may not be entirely clear.
<br />
Another way to put it is that the second version, when coupled with the
<br />
assumption of multiple universes/regions, allows you to *explain* why you
<br />
find yourself in what is possibly a quite unlikely set of circumstances.
<br />
For instance, if we assume that many physical constants are indeed set
<br />
randomly, then it seems the fact that our universe's constants are
<br />
fine-tuned to allow life becomes less puzzling if we assume multiple
<br />
universes (or multiple regions with different constants).  In this case, the
<br />
&quot;explanation&quot; for the apparent fine-tuning is that at least one
<br />
correctly-tuned universe is likely to exist, and the second version of the
<br />
anthropic principle says that's the universe that &quot;I&quot; must find myself in.
<br />
In contrast, the first version can't explain anything at all--it's just a
<br />
statement about your prior knowledge.
<br />
<br />An even clearer way to distinguish the two versions is that the second
<br />
version allows you to make new inferences about reality, while the first
<br />
only describes what you already know.  For example, if we find that our
<br />
universe is indeed fine-tuned, then by a version of Bayesian reasoning we
<br />
can say we should be more inclined to believe in the existence of other
<br />
universes with different constants, in order to explain the &quot;coincidence&quot; of
<br />
observed fine-tuning (to make this more obvious, feel free to assume we know
<br />
a priori that there's a 50% chance God created a single universe and a 50%
<br />
chance he created a multiverse).
<br />
<br />This is similar to &quot;copernican&quot; reasoning, like the Doomsday argument, which
<br />
also allows you to infer new things about reality just by observing your own
<br />
position in it.  In fact, I'd make a case for distinguishing the two
<br />
anthropic principles by saying the second is identical to what's sometimes
<br />
called the &quot;copernican anthropic principle.&quot;  For example, most people who
<br />
say fine-tuning increases the probability of multiple universes would also
<br />
say that we're more likely to find ourselves in a universe where observers
<br />
(or observer-moments) are more common rather than one where they are rare,
<br />
assuming the number of each kind of universe is about equal.&quot;
