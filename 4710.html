<br />
I am an Italian student of Cosmology and it is the first time I write
<br />
something in this mailing list. I didn't have the time to read all your
<br />
messages, so I don't know if my thought about multiverses is a new one or
<br />
not. Anyway I would like to propose you my reflection about this topic.
<br />
<br />My reasoning is rather simple. Dealing with an infinite level 1
<br />
multiuniverse, if an event, even an improbable one, doesn't violate any
<br />
pshysical laws, it necessarly has to happen infinite times and in infinite
<br />
different points of the space.
<br />
So we can try to reason upon some examples which has a meaning from a
<br />
physical point of view. For instance, we can think about the second
<br />
principle of thermodynamics, according to which the entropy of a closed
<br />
system necessarly has to increase. That means that, for instance, a gas
<br />
put into a container of volume V will tend to spread by occupying all the
<br />
available volume. This way we get the most possible disorder and the state
<br />
is the most probable. Anyway the state in which all the gas is firmly in a
<br />
v &lt; V volume is not forbidden by thermodynamics; it is just a rather
<br />
improbable state. But this event, having some chances to take place, has
<br />
to happen in infinite places and times in our multiverse. So there will be
<br />
infinite Hubble spheres in which everything happens exactly as in our own
<br />
sphere, but in which any time you put a gas into a container, it will
<br />
never occupy the whole volume. At the same time, there will be infinite
<br />
spheres in which some day the gas will occupy all the volume and some
<br />
others not. And so on.
<br />
<br />But we can go further, considering another example. According to
<br />
Heisemberg&#x2019;s principle of indetermination of time and energy, anything can
<br />
originate from nothing provided that it lowers itself soon after and
<br />
immediately desappears. For instance, there can be the effetcs of the
<br />
creation of particles and antiparticles living for very few moments and
<br />
soon after desappearing. But a macroscopic object might originate from
<br />
nothing, too: also in this case, it is just a very improbable event. Let&#x2019;s
<br />
consider then the following absurd thought. There may be an Hubble sphere
<br />
identical to our&#x2019;s but in which, as soon as a living being on the Earth
<br />
mentions any objects, they appear immediately. Also in this case, the
<br />
above-mentioned event has some chances to take place, so that we are sure
<br />
that this event necessarly has to happen in infinite different places and
<br />
times.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;At this point we can draw some conclusions. Let&#x2019;s consider the case of an
<br />
observer (there must be infinite observers) living in a world in which a
<br />
gas never spread in all the available volume, or maybe it spreads only on
<br />
Friday. Even though moved by the same techniques and methodologies we
<br />
have, what would that observer think? May he be unlucky because he lives
<br />
in a part of the universe in which anything improbable happens regularly?
<br />
Well, this is a possible event, so infinite observers will think like
<br />
that. But as many infinite observers, reasoning as we would, would think
<br />
that entropy lowers. And what about the people living in a world in which
<br />
any time you mention anything, it appears immediately? Probably all the
<br />
infinite observers reasoning as we do would create a completely different
<br />
physics in which, among the other things, the principle of relativity
<br />
would not be valid. According to this principle, it is impossible to
<br />
overcome the speed of light; but if these people mention any objects and
<br />
they immediately appear (by chance!), the above-mentioned principle would
<br />
not be valid for them.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From all these examples we should deduce that, if all the infinite
<br />
observers we have considered took advantage of the same approach we have,
<br />
they would obtain very different interpretations. So the model seems to
<br />
admit in itself the chance of being wrong. It is consistent with its
<br />
foundamental hypotheses the fact that it is inconsistent. So here we have
<br />
the paradox. But shall we put into discussion our experimental method just
<br />
because some unlucky observers are not in the condition to understand the
<br />
universe and the way it works?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;To answer this question I have tried to go even further with my
<br />
reflection. I believe we have no reason to think of being privileged
<br />
observers just because we observe the universe moving according to our
<br />
physical laws. Moreover, physics has been formunlated just starting from
<br />
our observations, so it is clear that our models come out to be consistent
<br />
with them. If these observations were not like that, we would discard
<br />
them. But the same thing would be valid for all the other infinite
<br />
observers and any of them could think of being privileged. Besides, from
<br />
one day to another, we could also realize that all our models are no
<br />
longer valid. What would happen if we lived in an Hubble sphere in which,
<br />
by chance, entropy began to lower all of a sudden?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;At last we could object that all of this is admitted by our own model
<br />
and, if this absurdity really happened, we should only notice that we live
<br />
in a very improbable universe. But if it was true, it would be completely
<br />
unuseful for us to keep our mathematics and physics. For instance, if we
<br />
started, by chance, to obtain number 6 any time we throw a die, and if
<br />
this would be like that till the end of time, it would be unuseful for us
<br />
to go on considering the theory of probability as valid. There would be no
<br />
sense for us to think of having 1/6 of chances to obtain number 6, seen
<br />
that we would obtain it in any case. Unfortunately, it is obvious at this
<br />
point to draw the following conclusion: we should give up all the physics
<br />
we have got to know so far! But, once more, there is a nonsense. We have
<br />
proved that the whole physical system is wrong, but we have been able to
<br />
draw this conclusion because we have considered the hypotesis of applying
<br />
the physical system itself. But if it was wrong, the conclusions would be
<br />
wrong, too. Here we have the paradox.
