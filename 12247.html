<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. Note that such an &quot;empathy&quot; is hard wired in our biological 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constitution. Many mammals seems to have it at some degree. Some form 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of autism are described by pathological loss of that empathy. Perhaps 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis could say more.
</em><br />
<br />Autism, psychopathy and psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia can all involve 
<br />
a loss of empathy. It is sometimes said that autistic children lack a &quot;theory of mind&quot; 
<br />
so that they can see others as being like themselves, with a similar view of the 
<br />
world to themselves. As they grow up, they realise intellectually that other people 
<br />
are like them but it seems that they lack the intuitive grasp of this fact that non-
<br />
-autistic individuals have. 
<br />
<br />People with schizophrenia can develop a blunting of affect, which perhaps is a 
<br />
different process but can have the same effect. They may be able to compare 
<br />
their feelings to when they were well and may say things like, &quot;I can longer feel 
<br />
things like I used to, I know I ought to feel happy when others around me are 
<br />
happy and sad when something sad happens, but I feel nothing, I just register 
<br />
the facts&quot;. 
<br />
<br />Psychopaths are different again in that they usually have a full range of affect, 
<br />
understand that others may suffer as they do, but don't care and can't understand 
<br />
why they should care, other than to keep the legal authorities happy. Young 
<br />
children are all psychopathic: they refrain from behaving badly only because they 
<br />
might get punished. As they grow up, they internalise the &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; 
<br />
behaviour paterns so that they seem to have these characteristics intrinsically.
<br />
<br />Autism and schizophrenia are almost always dysfunctional conditions, but intelligent 
<br />
psychopaths often do very well, in business and politics for example, because they 
<br />
can lie and manipulate people without compunction. In fact, they often seem 
<br />
unusually charming and likable when you first meet them, because they have learned 
<br />
to act the way that will best serve their selfish purposes. It is conceivable that an 
<br />
entire society of psychopaths might be able to function with rules of conduct 
<br />
similar to the moral rules that most normal societies live by, but arrived at in a practical 
<br />
and dispassionate manner. That is, thieves are punished because it is expedient to do 
<br />
so in the same way as it is expedient to take an umbrella with you if expecting rain, 
<br />
and saying &quot;theft is wrong&quot; is like saying &quot;rain is wrong&quot;.
