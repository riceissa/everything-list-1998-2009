<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think your position is consistent. If you apply what you said &quot;All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that really matters is whether the program is instantiated at all.&quot; to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wavefunction as a whole, then either a program is instantiated in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wavefunction or not, and therefore a conscious experience must have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same measure as any other conscious experience.
</em><br />
<br />I meant that in the context of a single universe.  In any given universe,
<br />
all that matters is whether a program is instantiated at all.  Instantiating
<br />
exactly the same program multiple times in that universe does not increase
<br />
its measure, or the subjective probability of its occurance.
<br />
<br />I say this not as an assumption, but because of the thought experiment
<br />
I described.  Two computers, running in lock-step, performing exactly the
<br />
same calculation at every instant, seem to me to be effectivelly the same
<br />
as a single computer.  Make a computer with extra wide processing elements
<br />
and data paths, then divide them all down the middle by an insulator.
<br />
You have turned one computer into two.  I don't see how that can be a
<br />
subjective change.  Make the insulator a variable resistor, and we can
<br />
vary smoothly between one and two computers.  But it does not seem that
<br />
we should be able to vary smoothly between one and two conscious entities.
<br />
<br />Perhaps there is some other resolution to this puzzle that I have
<br />
missed.  But this is the basis for my conclusion that multiple identical
<br />
instantiations of a consciousness do not add anything.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If consciousness is based on computation, than it must be that some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations are instantiated &quot;more often&quot; than others. What &quot;more often&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means depends on what &quot;instantiated&quot; means, but so far we don't have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formal definition of &quot;instantiation of a computation,&quot; which is why I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; currently lean towards the position that consciousness is based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information.
</em><br />
<br />I would say, not &quot;more often&quot;, but &quot;with greater measure&quot;, leaving open
<br />
the possibility that the increased measure comes from some other effect
<br />
than being run more often.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me ask my question in another way that avoids this issue for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment. In the MWI, there is a branch of the wavefunction where a spin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measuring device outputs the brain state (or consecutive brain states if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you like) of someone who does not exist in that branch as a flesh and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; blood being or as any other kind of computation. Now the question is does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this branch make any contribution to the measure of the conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience that someone has in that brain state?
</em><br />
<br />I would suggest that the answer is no, or at least, possibly not.
<br />
<br />Just creating a state or series of states is not enough, because it is
<br />
not possible, even in principle, to interact with them.  They are static
<br />
and just sit there.
<br />
<br />I would like to ground the question of whether a consciousness has been
<br />
instantiated by asking whether you could possibly interact with it.
<br />
If the answer is, yes, then I'd say there must be a consciousness
<br />
instantiated, else what are you interacting with?  On this basis I
<br />
would point to active computation as being a necessary ingredient for
<br />
being *sure* that consciousness exists.
<br />
<br />With an inert state, we can't be sure one way or the other.  There is
<br />
no way to know, no way to interact, even in principle.  So the question
<br />
can, perhaps, be ignored.  It is similar to the ephemeral conscious
<br />
brains which flash into existence all around us as air molecules move into
<br />
configurations which happen to match some kind of conscious brain state
<br />
(at least some subset of the air molecules do).  I think we should try
<br />
to ignore these, although I don't have a good enough understanding to
<br />
say exactly why not.  This seems to be one of the biggest puzzles.
<br />
