</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The same should be the case with death if we assume a materialistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;position.
</em><br />
<br />But you should no more expect to end up in a branch where you died than in a 
<br />
branch where you were never born in the first place. Consider, instead of a 
<br />
branching multiverse, a Star-Trek-style transporter/duplicator in a single 
<br />
universe, which can deconstruct you and reconstruct exact copies 
<br />
atom-by-atom in distant locations (assuming the error introduced by the 
<br />
uncertainty principle is too small to make a difference--if you don't want 
<br />
to grant that, you could also assume this is all happening within a 
<br />
deterministic computer simulation and that you are really an A.I.). To use 
<br />
Bruno Marchal's example, suppose this duplicator recreates two identical 
<br />
copies of you, one in Washington and one in Moscow. As you step into the 
<br />
chamber, if you believe continuity of consciousness is &quot;real&quot; in some sense 
<br />
and that it's meaningful to talk about the probabilities of different 
<br />
possible next experiences, it would probably make sense to predict from a 
<br />
first-person-point of view that you have about a 50% chance of finding 
<br />
yourself in Moscow and a 50% chance of finding yourself in Washington.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, suppose only a single reconstruction will be performed in 
<br />
Washington--then by the same logic, you would probably predict the 
<br />
probability of finding yourself in Washington is close to 100%, barring a 
<br />
freak accident. OK, so now go back to the scenario where you're supposed to 
<br />
be recreated in both Washington and Moscow, except assume that at the last 
<br />
moment there's a power failure in Moscow and the recreator machine fails to 
<br />
activate. Surely this is no different from the scenario where you were only 
<br />
supposed to be recreated in Washington--the fact that they *intended* to 
<br />
duplicate you in Moscow shouldn't make any difference, all that matters is 
<br />
that they didn't. But now look at another variation on the scenario, where 
<br />
the Moscow machine malfunctions and recreates your body missing the head. I 
<br />
don't think it makes sense to say you have a 50% chance of being &quot;killed&quot; in 
<br />
this scenario--your brain is where your consciousness comes from, and since 
<br />
it wasn't duplicated this is really no different from the scenario where the 
<br />
Moscow machine failed to activate entirely. In fact, any malfunction in the 
<br />
Moscow machine which leads to a duplicate that permanently lacks 
<br />
consciousness should be treated the same way as a scenario where I was only 
<br />
supposed to be recreated in Washington, in terms of the subjective 
<br />
probabilities. Extending this to the idea of natural duplication due to 
<br />
different branches of a splitting multiverse, the probability should always 
<br />
be 100% that my next experience is one of a universe where I have not been 
<br />
killed.
<br />
<br />The big assumption here, as I said earlier, is that there is some sort of 
<br />
&quot;objective&quot; truth about continuity of consciousness and subjective 
<br />
probabilities, that it's not just a bunch of isolated observer-moments who 
<br />
just have an illusion of a consciousness which changes over time due to 
<br />
memories and expectations. See my thread on &quot;3 possible views of 
<br />
'consciousness'&quot; here:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2358.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2358.html</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If non-observing states are prohibited, then we should never expect to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be in a coma, or anesthesized, for instance. Whenever you would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;submitted to a surgery, you would see that the doctor somehow failed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to apply the anesthesy correctly, and you would have a *very* conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I don't see any justification for that. Why can't your &quot;next&quot; 
<br />
observer-moment after the anesthesia begins to take effect be of waking up 
<br />
hours later? That's a lot what waking up from dreamless unconsciousness 
<br />
feels like, subjectively.
