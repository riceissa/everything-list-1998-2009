<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno, Stathis, Brent, Peter,Brent, Tom, Hal and others,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I have to be very impertinent here and try to draw your attention to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something you are just not getting.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  There is NO ultimate answer to the meaning of life, ...
</em><br />
<br /><br />Assuming the digital mechanist thesis, a case can be made that at least 
<br />
there could be an ultimate *partial* sort of meta-answer. I am not sure 
<br />
about that. Recall that after Godel/Turing &amp; Co., we can no more 
<br />
pretend to really know what are numbers and machines or what they are 
<br />
capable of, including their relations with fundamental question.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... the universe and everything except that IT IS, and you are here to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take part in it and observe yourself and others doing so. Existence is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the source of value, indeed it is the essence of value.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I am not in the habit of putting myself forward, but here I believe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ideas are what count and I believe the issue is very important. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean at 55 yo I know I have already attained 'old fart' status for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most people I meet. But one thing I know for sure is that, just like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me, YOU are not going to live for ever.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This already depends a lot of what you mean by &quot;me&quot; and &quot;you&quot;. In any 
<br />
case I am not sure you can *know* things like that. It could be a form 
<br />
of wishful thinking. And in order to add something obvious: the 
<br />
prediction &quot;you will not live forever&quot; is neither confirmable (with or 
<br />
without comp) nor refutable (with comp).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As most of you seem a fair bit smarter than me I assume that you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can/will mostly choose how you spend your limited lifetime. Choose 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wisely 'cause it's a once-off.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You may be right and sometimes I hope so, but I have no certainty here. 
<br />
After all most among those who say that there is &quot;nothing&quot; after death 
<br />
say also that there was nothing before birth. In that case I (the first 
<br />
person &quot;I&quot;) would have emerge from nothing. Going back to nothing when 
<br />
dead, how could I be sure I will not come back again? Perhaps by being 
<br />
some new born baby? Perhaps with my memories reconstituted by some far 
<br />
away future technologies?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I really do think that before any of you get much older you should 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take a VERY careful look at what I have been writing here. Have a look 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also at the common meanings for the word physics [samples included 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; below]. If you don't then I think you are going to spend the rest of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your lives chasing shadows, and end up a bunch of old men sitting on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the cyberspace equivalent of a park bench, STILL chewing over the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; old problem! Of course, if that is what you want then that's fine. But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't say you weren't warned!  :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  the fact is, being conscious is inherently paradoxical, and there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no escape from the paradox, just like there is no escape from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe - until you die that is.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Let us hope! To be sure even G* provides a hope we can die eventually, 
<br />
but evidences are there that it could be less easy than we are used to 
<br />
think. There could be a rather long Tibetan like Bardo-Thodol to go 
<br />
through before ... I really don't know, for sure. I *can * ask the 
<br />
lobian machine, but it is today intractable, the machine will answer 
<br />
after the sun blows up.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your impressions, perceptions, feelings, intuitions, etc. of being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here now [where you are of course] is what it is like to be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; updating of the model of self in the world which you brain is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constantly constructing all the time you are awake. When you sleep 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are times when enough of the model gets evoked that you have a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dream that you can remember. The paradox is that for most of the time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we assume that this awareness - consciousness, call it what you like - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IS the world, i.e. what it is like to be 'me' here now, whereas in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact it is only what it is like to be the model of 'me' here now.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This does not mean that you don't exist; you do exist, and you must 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pay taxes in partial payment for the privilege, until you die that is. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [I work for the Australian Taxation Office so I know about these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things :-] There is however a lot more stuff going on in your brain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than is actually explicitly involved in your consciousness of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment, as far as I can see there are usually a couple or triple of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very sophisticated tasks going on in parallel but swapping in and out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of focussed attention as needs and priorities of the moment require. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are often also several other tasks simmering away like pots on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the back burners of your stove.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I believe it is the hippocampus which maintains the tasks in process 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through re-entrant signalling to the relevant cortical and other areas 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which embody the salient features of the constructs involved. Binding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is achieved through re-entrant signalling of resonant wave forms such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that each construct EXISTS as a dynamic logical entity able to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maintain its own structure sufficiently to prevent certain other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things happening and to invoke through association [or perhaps through 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reaction to patterns of inhibition, whatever] other constructs as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary. Note the key word 'exists'. The energy is supplied through 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the work done as the neurons re-establish the resting potential of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their cell membranes. And here I should point out that most of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; posts on this list do not seem to talk much about structure, and yet 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is the spatia-temporal structures of interacting cell assemblies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which embody the patterns of information which make muscles move.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is a good local description. Some of us does not mention brain and 
<br />
spatio-temporal structure if only because we want to explain what are 
<br />
and where does such things come from. I don't take &quot;Nature&quot; for 
<br />
granted. To assert without doubt that GOD, NATURE or the UNIVERSE exist 
<br />
is neither correct science and/or theology.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Think about it! This is what you should be really concentrating on, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because you and I are NOTHING if our muscles can't be made to move in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly the right way and the right time.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Certainly not. Just think about people who are &quot;completely&quot; paralyzed. 
<br />
&quot;completely&quot; relatively to the local available technologies. To say 
<br />
they are nothing is a exaggerated shortcut. Have you see the movie: 
<br />
&quot;Jonathan got his gun&quot;?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I know I have written 'I believe' up there a few times, but if you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wish I can go hunting for you and find a bunch of references that back 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up what I am saying. I do not have access to pay-as-you-go academic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; journals, so I have been gleaning ideas and items of interest about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this for the last couple of decades. I put it to you that if you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seriously think I am wrong, then you have a moral duty to show me on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the basis of clear and unambiguous empirical evidence where it is that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am wrong about this. Because otherwise it is just a matter of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opinion and speculation, in which case mine is as good as anybody 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else's that I have seen on consciousness related lists and what I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposing is not in contradiction to any good evidence that I have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heard about. I think William of Occam would be more than happy with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what I am putting forward.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I hope no one is offended by this. Is they are, sorry! But time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; returns for no one and you do not have for ever, just all the time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is - for you. That is what entropy is about.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think I can agree with many things you are saying, except when you 
<br />
are witnessing what I would call a reductionist view of numbers and 
<br />
machine. I could even argue (as I do from times to times) that modern 
<br />
(post-godelian) mechanism is a sort of very powerful vaccine against a 
<br />
vast class of reductionist view of both human and machine.
<br />
