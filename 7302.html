<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; tortured. However, this constraint has been added to the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiment: suppose you end up the copy still in the torture

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; room whenever you press the button. After all, it is certain

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that there will be a copy still in the room, however many

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; times the button is pressed. Should this unfortunate person

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; choose the coin toss instead?

<br />To me, it's always been a big mistake to employ the language of
<br />
probability; you *will* be in the room where the torture is and
<br />
you *will* be in the room where it's not, because you *can* be
<br />
in two places at the same time.

<br />You may want to read a story, &quot;The Pit and the Duplicate&quot; that I wrote many
<br />
years ago, which dwells on the ironies of being duplicates. It's a little
<br />
like Stathis's point here. <a href="http://www.leecorbin.com/PitAndDuplicate.html">http://www.leecorbin.com/PitAndDuplicate.html</a>

<br />
<br />Lee's story linked to above is a good summary of the issues. I fundamentally 
<br />
disagree with Lee and Hal Finney about the status of copies, because I *do* 
<br />
consider that I will only be one person at a time, from a first person 
<br />
perspective. If I am going to be more than one person, it would involve a 
<br />
special process like telepathy or mind-melding, or something. My criterion 
<br />
is that if you stick a pin in someone and I feel it, then that person is me; 
<br />
if I don't feel it, then that person isn't me. There is a reasonable line of 
<br />
argument that says if copying were widespread, then this criterion would 
<br />
change, because people who considered their copies to be as good as self, 
<br />
and worked to increase their number and protect their interests, would 
<br />
eventually come to predominate. However, it would involve a profound and 
<br />
fundamental change in our psychology, so that we would become something like 
<br />
hive insects. Basically, when I look at these thought experiments, I assume 
<br />
that I am me as I am *now*, serving my own selfish interests as they seem to 
<br />
be to me now. If we specify what kind of self-interest is being served in 
<br />
discussing these examples, i.e. whether the traditional human type or that 
<br />
of some post-human ideal, we can avoid misunderstanding.
<br />
<br />Having said that, there is a real paradox in Jonathan's and Lee's thought 
<br />
experiment, which does not occur in a single world/ probabilistic cosmology: 
<br />
the button-presser will always be the loser. From his point of view, he will 
<br />
never escape, but rather is helping others escape. It isn't &quot;others&quot; before 
<br />
he presses the button, but it certainly is &quot;others&quot; the moment after the 
<br />
button is pressed, from the point of the view of the still-and-forever 
<br />
button-presser, since as soon as they are created, the duplicates start to 
<br />
diverge. Psychologically, it is easy to see how the button-presser could 
<br />
decide, against his better judgement, that it is hopeless to keep pressing, 
<br />
and this could happen even if the chance of escape per press is raised 
<br />
arbitrarily close to certainty. The paradox resolves if, at random, all but 
<br />
one of the copies is instantly destroyed the moment they are created, 
<br />
because then the button-presser can be assured that if he presses enough 
<br />
times, the chance of escape will come arbitrarily close to certainty. I 
<br />
suppose this is another situation where *reduction* in total measure can 
<br />
actually be a positive - and this time without even any relative reduvction, 
<br />
on average, of adverse outcomes.
