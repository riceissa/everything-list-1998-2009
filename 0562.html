Bruno Marchal's paper,
<br />
Computation, Physis and Cognition
<br />
<br />English translation 1st draft
<br />
<br />Introduction
<br />
<br />The computationalist hypothesis, or more simply,
<br />
*mechanism*, which I consider here, is the
<br />
hypothesis according to which *I* am a machine or
<br />
*you* are a machine. The precise way in which I
<br />
am interested in the hypothesis that we can
<br />
survive, not just with an artificial heart or kidney,
<br />
etc., but also with an artificial digital brain (finitely
<br />
describable) assuming it is suitably configured at
<br />
an adequate level.
<br />
The aim is not to defend this hypothesis but to
<br />
examine the consequences, notably concerning
<br />
the mind-body problem.
<br />
In particular I shall show, contrary to a very
<br />
widespread belief, among philosophers and
<br />
doctors as much as the layman, that mechanism is
<br />
incompatible with materialism.
<br />
I will demonstrate that mechanism is incompatible
<br />
with materialist monism, which claims that is only
<br />
one universe, which can in principle be described
<br />
entirely in terms of physics. On the way I will
<br />
demonstrate that mchanism is also incompatible
<br />
with dualism, which holds that there is
<br />
simultaneously a tangible world (described by
<br />
physics) and a mental world.
<br />
Hence I will show that mechanism necessitates a
<br />
monist idealism incompatible with any form of
<br />
materialism. This proof will not resolve the mind-
<br />
body problem, but will lead towards a new
<br />
formulation of the question. Essentially, with the
<br />
computationalist hypothesis, the mind-body
<br />
problem is transformed in the research deriving:
<br />
1. a phenomenology of mind - capable of
<br />
explaining the origin and nature of knowledge and
<br />
belief; and
<br />
2. a phenomenology of matter, capable of
<br />
explaining the origin and nature of  our
<br />
observations and our theories of physics.
<br />
The first point can hardly be considered original.
<br />
With computationalism, psychology is, *in
<br />
principle*, trivially reduced to information theory.
<br />
The originality is in the demonstration that to
<br />
resolve the body-mind problem, one is obliged to
<br />
derive the phenomenology of matter from the
<br />
phenomenology of mind. That is, physics is *in
<br />
principle* a branch of psychology.
<br />
This is precisely the reverse of our usual attempts
<br />
to reduce or try to understand psychological
<br />
phenomena from the substrate of the brain -
<br />
physical, or even cosmic or universal.
<br />
On the contrary, mechanism demands a
<br />
psychology which eliminates all materialist
<br />
ontology rather than a materialism which
<br />
eliminates mental ontology.
<br />
Mechanism therefore requires us to consider
<br />
physics as a branch of psychology, itself a branch
<br />
of information theory, which is in turn a branch of
<br />
number theory. The word, &quot;branch&quot; is used here in
<br />
a slightly more general sense than normal; this will
<br />
be clarified during the course of the proof.
<br />
An attentive logician will note that matter is not
<br />
*logically* eliminated. But he would fail at any
<br />
attempt to explain physical sensations through
<br />
physical science alone.
<br />
There is a certain irony in this situation.
<br />
Mechanism is generally invoked by reductionist
<br />
materialists to debunk the spirit and to counter
<br />
dualism and other spiritualism. And it works in
<br />
practice, but on closer examination (as proposed
<br />
here), the dematerialisation does not stop with the
<br />
spirit but extends to the body, matter and the
<br />
universe.
<br />
This work is not speculative. It stands up well to
<br />
demonstration or hypothetico-deductive argument:
<br />
IF mechanism is true THEN physics *must* be
<br />
derived from psychology. I clarify this point in
<br />
Chapter 2.
<br />
<br />Note on methodology
<br />
To help the reader keep track of the proof, I
<br />
decided to be as brief as possible. The poof, which
<br />
starts in Chapter 3, finishes by the end of Chapter
<br />
4. It does not assume any specific knowledge,
<br />
except a familiarity with Church's Thesis and, of
<br />
course, a smattering of high-school classical
<br />
philosopy (good treatments are given in Huisman
<br />
and Vergez, 1996 or Nagel, 1987). Appendix D
<br />
provides an introduction to the mind-body problem
<br />
as well as some supplementry definitions on the
<br />
concept of sufficient conditions for mechanism.
<br />
Chapter 1, which defines the hypotheses of the
<br />
*entire* work, raises some technical points which
<br />
are not ued in the proof. This additional material
<br />
will be used before Chapter 5.
<br />
Chapter 5 examines the search for a solution to
<br />
the mind-body problem in the light of the proof
<br />
given here. Unlike the proof, this research has a
<br />
few prerequisite techniques. You may consult the
<br />
technical report (Marchal, 1995) or the appendices
<br />
of this paper, or certain works such as Boolos,
<br />
1995, Webb, 1980, as well as Albert, 1992 and
<br />
Maudlin, 1994 on physics.
