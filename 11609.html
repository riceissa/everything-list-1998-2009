<br />It's still unclear to me from the above whether we're in agreement or
<br />
not. I'm concerned that you may be assuming what is to be explained,
<br />
owing to an illegitimate sleight of intuition. That is, it's so normal
<br />
for us to think in terms of the overall 'sequence of moments' that it's
<br />
easy to forget that the posit for OMs is that they are *informationally
<br />
closed* with respect to other OMs (this is the point I've been debating
<br />
with Peter, with which I thought you agreed). If OMs are thus closed,
<br />
then it must follow that whatever information is required to generate
<br />
the experience of 'a given moment' (under-defined, but see below)
<br />
*must* be contained in its entirety within *some* (but of course not
<br />
every) OM.
<br />
<br />Were that not the case, *no* individual OM would contain all the
<br />
elements of a coherent conscious experience, and by the same token
<br />
*any* coherent conscious experience would necessarily have to span
<br />
*multiple* OMs. But any such assumption - i.e. meta-assembly of data
<br />
over multiple OMs - is precisely what we wish to rule out of our
<br />
account. A 'successor' OM - and any conscious state dependent on it -
<br />
must simply 'forget' anything about 'prior' OMs that is not re-encoded
<br />
within it - beyond such encoding, everything else is simply radically
<br />
absent. A metaphor here might be a cine-film. An OM is then a frame. If
<br />
all you have is a single frame, then your 'experience' must be strictly
<br />
limited to whatever is contained in that frame, unless you can somehow
<br />
surreptitiously sneak a glance at - or recall at will - other frames.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; we rely on the machinery of the brain keeping track of everything to generate successive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moments of consciousness which pull everything back into coherence.
</em><br />
<br />Is what you say above consistent with the constraints on OMs in my
<br />
account? I think perhaps we may intend the same thing here.
<br />
<br />This consideration, at least, strongly suggests (IMO entails) something
<br />
entirely non-trivial about what the brain is actually doing (your
<br />
'engineering problem'), beyond representing simple 'snapshots' from
<br />
external input. To overcome the 'OM constraint', it needs to assemble,
<br />
from these 'instants', 'rolling constructs', each of which encodes an
<br />
updated version of the 'specious present', *simultaneously*
<br />
representing multiple snapshots and their relations. It may be entirely
<br />
owing to such 'time capsules' (as Barbour, taking this issue seriously,
<br />
implies) that we are able to assemble and implement a dynamic
<br />
experience of 'time'. In fact, we can be pretty sure that there is a
<br />
brain mechanism doing something like this, because as Colin recently
<br />
reminded us, there are syndromes that interfere with it, changing the
<br />
'dynamic granularity' (refresh rate). So our dynamic experience - the
<br />
'A-series' - may depend critically on such 'time-synthesising'
<br />
mechanisms within brain structure and function, rather than mapping in
<br />
a simple sequential way to external 'B-series' events. And this of
<br />
course would then make sense of why such biological time-mechanisms
<br />
would have evolved. That is, because successive improvement in the
<br />
ability to represent, and consequently discriminate and respond to, an
<br />
environment perceived as dynamic events and processes at variable
<br />
levels of granularity, confers obvious survival advantage.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; As for memory being encoded in or accessible to an OM, that is an unnecessary complication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; As you said previously, the OM's are related solely by their information content. If the seconds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of your life were sliced up, shuffled and thrown to the wind, (t1) 3:10:02 PM of 10/10/06 would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; still subjectively follow (t2) 3:10:01 PM of 10/10/06 even though there is no connection or &quot;flow&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of information between them. If you look at how t1 and t2 are generated, then yes, there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; connection - they both come out of your head - but once generated, they form a natural sequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; which cannot be disrupted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But my point about the 'coherence' of consciousness is that it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (especially from what occurs, or fails to occur, when it deteriorates)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that complex representation and processing of *temporally extended*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information sequences (e.g. grasp of the entirety of the content and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; meaning of a sentence or proposition) is necessary for one to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience and act as a fully-functioning conscious individual.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Consequently, it seems to me that such processes must converge on OMs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in which all the necessary information is fully encoded and expressed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (which is essentially what Barbour seems to be claiming for his 'time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; capsules' - e.g. his 'flight of the kingfisher' example). Without this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the alternative seems to be that the individual random, wind-blown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seconds of your metaphor would need to be totalised in some additional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; non-information-based manner in order to coordinate an ensemble of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; informationally incomplete, discrete elements into coherent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiences. AFAICS they only 'form a natural sequence' from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; quasi-objective perspective of our philosophical stance. And such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; coordination is in any case what we were assuring Peter was both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unnecessary and impossible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We have to distinguish between what actually happens to create the moments of a stream of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness and what is the minimum logically necessary that needs to happen. My brain must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at some subconscious level have the structure of the whole sentence spanning a 2 second interval
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; t1-t2 or else the sentence could not be generated. But that's just an engineering problem: if the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moments t1 and t2 come about with exactly the right sort of phenomenal content, magically, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by random processes, then I will experience a coherent 2 second span of consciousness in which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; utter the full sentence. The only way I might not experience this is if there is something wrong with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the actual phenomenal content of t1 and t2: if whatever vague sense I have of the whole sentence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during t1 and t2 is missing during either or both intervals, then I would forget what I was saying.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The vague sense of the whole sentence has two parts, in t1 and t2, just as the sentence itself has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two parts. If we had a longer sentence through further nitervals t3, t4 and t5, it could be, for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that during t4 the sense of the whole sentence is completely absent, and only in retrospect from t5 is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it seen that t4 was part of the whole. This sort of thing happens all the time during absent-minded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moments, and we rely on the machinery of the brain keeping track of everything to generate successive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moments of consciousness which pull everything back into coherence.
