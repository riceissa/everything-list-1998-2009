<br />As 1Z has so nicely put, existence implies causal interaction.
<br />
Numbers cannot causally interact, therefore they do not exist,
<br />
save as thoughts in our brains.
<br />
<br />Of course I do not believe that 37 could be a non prime number,
<br />
simply because what it means to be &quot;prime&quot; has been exactly
<br />
defined in arithmetic. I just say that these are thought constructs
<br />
with no independent existence (independent of human brains, not of a
<br />
concrete human brain).
<br />
<br />You might say, that 37 was prime even in the Jurassic, but I say:
<br />
nobody had invented arithmetic yet, so it's about as true as the
<br />
fact that James Bond was played by Sean Connery was in the Jurassic.
<br />
<br />I define a system:
<br />
<br />1 + 1 = 2
<br />
2 + 1 = 1
<br />
1 + 2 = 1
<br />
<br />That's all. Okay, it doesn't describe much and probably isn't very
<br />
useful, but other than that it is not inferior to peano arithmetic.
<br />
Does my system now exist mind-independtly for all eternity?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have not yet seen a book on human brain which does not presuppose the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding of the natural numbers. 
</em><br />
<br />Of course, because it is a useful way to describe reality. But in our
<br />
brains, not numbers operate, but chemicals.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Numbers are not symbol. Symbols can be used to talk about numbers, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they should not be confused with numbers.
</em><br />
<br />You are right there of course. Symbols are only referents. What counts
<br />
is meaning. What I meant to say is that the meanings we assign to number
<br />
symbols exist only in our minds. Indeed, meaning _is_ only created by
<br />
interactions between an agent and an environment. With both of these,
<br />
no meaning. Indeed, in an mind-and-matter independent (=non existing
<br />
)universe, arithmetic would be about as meaningless as it gets.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The notion of &quot;same number&quot; seems to have occur much before we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discovered counting. Farmers have most probably learn to compare the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; size of the herds of sheep without counting, just by associating each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sheep from one herd to the another. But this as nothing to do with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact that sheeps were &quot;countable&quot; before humans learn to count it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Humans and brains learn to count countable things because they are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; countable.
</em><br />
<br />Not exactly. Animals and babies can distinguish up to 2-3 objects
<br />
(innate arithmetic, subitizing). The experiments with which this has
<br />
been ascertained are both fascinating and entertaining (google is your
<br />
friend ;-)
<br />
This ability has an evolutionary advantage: it is necessary for higher
<br />
organisms to distinguish more or less abundant food sources or numbers
<br />
of predators. But this meaning this &quot;countability&quot;, arises out of the
<br />
physical world, and is not independent of it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you are confusing the subject or object of math, and the human 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical theories, which are just lantern putting a tiny light on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the subject.
</em><br />
<br />Indeed I am not. I am just saying that there is no independent subject
<br />
of math outside of human brains. Mathematics is the study of rules we
<br />
make up (axioms) and what follows of them (theorems).
<br />
If we pick our axioms wisely, we can even model some aspects of the
<br />
real, physical world with it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If numbers and their math was really invented, why should 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematicians hide some results, like Pythagoras with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irrationality of the square root of two, ... As David Deutsch says: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; math kicks back.
</em><br />
<br />That is very easy: the Pythagoreans assumed axioms, and thought they
<br />
knew what would follow from them. Then, to their dismay, they found
<br />
out that also somewhat else followed from the axioms than they had
<br />
ideally envisioned, something that displeased their aesthetic sense.
<br />
Only human factors involved here,
<br />
no independent existence of math. It just shows how limited our thought
<br />
is, and that we do not even anticipate theorems that follow from our
<br />
axioms when they are rather simple.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Also, concepts like infinity are most definitely not universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; concepts &quot;out there&quot;, but products of our mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I doubt any mind could ever produce infinity.
</em><br />
<br />But indeed, _only_ minds produce them, because, as you say, infinity
<br />
is a concept, and concepts exist only in minds.
<br />
<br />In reality, there is no such thing as infinity. Even if space
<br />
would expand infinitely, this &quot;infinity&quot; would not exist as a thing
<br />
(except in the trivial *lol* sense as the universe exists), but would
<br />
be a concept for us humans to talk about it.
<br />
Concepts need not be precisely understood as to be concepts.
<br />
For example, consciousness is definitely not understood, but talked
<br />
about a lot.
<br />
<br />How does the human mind create the concept of infinity:
<br />
Lakoff and Nunez have a nice metaphor:
<br />
Humans see repeated motion in nature, which seemingly does not end.
<br />
For instance, a vulture may appear in the sky, fly over us, and
<br />
disappear in the opposite direction. Combined with the concept
<br />
of iteration (if I can do something once, I can do it again),
<br />
this &quot;motion without end&quot; + &quot;iteration&quot; lead to the concept of
<br />
infinity. In reality, of course, the vulture has to land sometime,
<br />
and we also cannot indefinitely (energy limitations), so infinity
<br />
is a mental concept and not a physical existing thing.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;I let you
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discover that, and feel free to ask questions if you have a problem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with UDA.
</em><br />
<br />Thank you, I will.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is really the point of the UDA. It shows that computationalism (the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea that I am a digitalizable machine) is incompatible with &quot;weak 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; materialism&quot; (the idea that there is a primary stuff or matter or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aristotelian substances).
</em><br />
Ok, I'll watch for this in UDA.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But until now, comp leads only to weirdness, not contradiction. And 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then that weirdness seems to explain the quantum weirdness ... 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Intuitively and qualitatively (already by UDA), and then technically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through the interview of some universal turing machine.
</em><br />
<br />But wouldn't this universal turing machine need to be composed of
<br />
matter, and then the whole caboodle starts from the beginning?
<br />
<br />Occam's Razor recommends materialism.
<br />
