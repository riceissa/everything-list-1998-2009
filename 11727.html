<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universe would instantly disintegrate. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's possible, but then he's a deist God.  He doesn't do miracles in response to prayer.  It seems to me there's a contradiction between &quot;intervenes&quot; and &quot;prefectly consistent&quot;.  There's no more reason to believe that the universe needs &quot;sustaining&quot; than to believe there's a teapot orbiting Jupiter.

</em><br />
A deist God does not intervene once the universe is set in motion. But one can imagine 
<br />
for example a gravity god, who pushes matter around in a perfectly consistent way so 
<br />
as to give the impression of natural laws. If he stopped doing his thing, stars would explode 
<br />
and the universe would fall apart. It's only because the gravity god is very conscientious in 
<br />
his work that we don't notice he is constantly performing miracles. Of course, there is no more 
<br />
reason to believe in the gravity god than there is to believe in any other kind of god, but at the 
<br />
same time it is not possible to be rigidly atheistic about the gravity god just as it is not possible to 
<br />
be rigidly atheistic about Zeus or Thor. 

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;This would make it seem as if God either 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; does not exist or, if he does, he is a deist, whereas in fact he is a theist. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; problem with this idea, and for that matter with deism, is that it is empty of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; explanatory value. Ironically perhaps, it is God-as-miracle-worker which comes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; closest to a legitimate scientific theory, albeit one without any supporting evidence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in its favour.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If it's lawlike it ain't a miracle.  Deism was a common position that come out of the Enlightenment.  It comported perfectly with a Newtonian, clockwork universe.  It avoided the problem of evil.  Franklin, Paine, and Jefferson were deists.  But it fits well with scientific models because it does nothing.

</em><br />
Good old-fashioned miracles are not lawlike, which is what makes them subject to empirical verification. 
<br />
If God is a Protestant, then an examination of a list of lottery ticket winners or people with serious 
<br />
illnesses should show that Protestants are statistically more likely to have their prayers answered than 
<br />
Catholics, Muslims or atheists (who wish for things, even if they don't actually pray). If not, then either 
<br />
God is not a Protestant or there is no point in praying for anything even if you and he are both Protestants. 
<br />
And yet I doubt that there are any Protestants, Catholics or Muslims who be at all perturbed by the findings 
<br />
of such a study, or countless other possible studies or experiments. This cannot be explained away by &quot;faith&quot; 
<br />
in the sense that one can have faith in the gravity god or a deist god (because no empirical finding counts for 
<br />
or against such beliefs): rather, it comes down to a matter of simultaneously believing x and not-x.
