<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;Emergence of Life&quot; paper is talking specifically about those sorts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of life that can emerge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF AN ALREADY SMARTER, MORE-ORGANIZED AGENT.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's why that kind of life (&quot;natural&quot; life) is a truly emergent or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (emergent from less-order) system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Well, I'm an agnostic, but your point is well taken here. That said who was
<br />
that talking about a &quot;god program&quot;, Hal?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One way of looking at A.I. is that it may become in some attributes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life-like (I prefer just to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it will become a true cognitive agent i.e. a true thinker (active
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modeler) without NECESSARILY
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also independently being a fully self-sufficient life-form. If WE can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered part of the environment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of AIs, then they are a life-form that uses US to reproduce (at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; initially).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Paraticism and symbiotic raltioanships are common amoung &quot;natual&quot; life
<br />
forms.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's traditional to think of the environment of a lifeform as less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ordered than the lifeform itself, so this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AI case, where the environment includes extremely ordered self-emergent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SAS's (ourselves)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a little bit strange situation and it's hard to categorize.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Well, speaking of symbiosis, is my gut less &quot;ordered&quot; than the critters like
<br />
ecoli that make a home there? I'm not sure I buy that generalization. I'm
<br />
more of the Starr hierarchal ecology ilk (by way of Koestler) or perhaps
<br />
Joslyn's meta-transition model; adaption is as much about feedback between
<br />
hiearchal scales as within them...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; With AI, it's probably best just to say that there is another emergent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system emerging, which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (at this stage) a combination of humans (the human-species pattern and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its behaviours) and  the software
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (informational) and computing hardware technological/cultural artifacts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we produce, acting together
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to form the new emergent system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />No issues with this view; I wouldn't be at all surprised if cyborgs inherit
<br />
the earth.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; People do talk about AI computers/robots and nano-tech, in combination
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps, becoming self-sufficient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (self-replicating and self-advancing/adapting independent of their human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creators.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have no trouble believing that this is in-principle possible. I just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want to point out that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the properties for true long-term sustainability of pattern-order are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; HARD  (difficult, onerous)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; requirements, not easy ones. Natural life (in the admittedly single case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we know) is highly constrained
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because of the constraints on its long-term survival and incremental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; improvement in a less-ordered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />&quot;Hard&quot; may not be the most useful term here; highly constrained, yes; Once
<br />
the conditions were sufficient, I think the rest was inevitable. Here I have
<br />
to play the &quot;nano-tech&quot; card;  one can imagine some uber termite mound
<br />
encompassing the globe (and beyond) custom designed (grown?) from the atomic
<br />
scale up to our progeny's specs;
<br />
<br />The prototype of just such an ecology may well already be in place (were
<br />
leveraging it now); with evermore bandwidth, interconnectivity, agency and
<br />
now the advent of &quot;grid&quot; distributed computation it's conceivable that
<br />
&quot;something&quot; is already in gestation. But I haven't a clue about that..
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems easier (but is it much easier really?) to get AIs to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-improve/self-sustain purely as virtual (informational) patterns
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or entities (i.e. as software and data ie. pure-informational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities/thinkers/knowledge-bases) rather than as informational/physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hybrids as we are. I suppose some of the people on the everything-list,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; myself included, may see the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction between informational and physical as more just a matter of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; degree than of substance,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so this is a puzzling area. Certainly both human-built computers and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical machines (robots eg mars rovers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nanobots etc) have a long way to go, not only in their basic FUNCTIONAL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; development, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps more significantly and certainly more difficultly in their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ROBUSTNESS (lack of brittleness)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AND EVOLVABILITY (&amp; META-EVOLVABILITY?) criteria, and their raw-material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (natural life uses primarily the most commonly occurring-in-the-universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemically-bondable elements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen etc) for good reason), before they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could hope to be very self-sustainable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Lanier's &quot;phenotropics&quot; speaks to that brittleness factor. The promise and
<br />
the danger may both lay in unleashing genetic programming type strategies on
<br />
the problem; &quot;evolving&quot; our broods towards those goals of robustness and
<br />
self sustainability w/o really having a handle on the process. Might be
<br />
prudent to review Asimov!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is interesting to speculate that the mechanisms available to a future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AI robot/nanotech-conglomerate/web-dweller
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for self-adaptation might be far more flexible and wide-ranging than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those available to early natural life on Earth,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because we are building AI's partly in our image, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we, after all, by becoming general thinker/planners (information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maestros if you will) have managed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to increase enormously the range of ways we can adapt the environment to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our needs. (Caveat: As an eco-aware
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person however I can tell you the jury's out on whether we're doing this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to system-survival-levels of sophistication,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the jury's leaning toward &quot;guilty&quot; of eco-cide - or more precisely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guilty of severe eco-impoverishment and disordering).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I'm no extropian; at some level I'm scared to death (a state of being I
<br />
apparently share with Sun's former CTO); Just because we managed not to nuke
<br />
ourselves into oblivion ( so far), it doesn't necessarily follow that we'll
<br />
weather the coming info-nano-genetic age; far from it. But I'm also
<br />
fascinated by these musings. The combination of being a reformed sci-fi buff
<br />
and having background in evolutionary theory, I suppose.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW I'm most excited today in the AI field by the possibilities that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; combination of the WWWeb's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information as accessed via google (and similar) and AI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insights/technologies will have. The web is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not a big distributed brain yet, but it could get there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Then you gotta be finding the semantic web project intriguing, I would
<br />
imagine
