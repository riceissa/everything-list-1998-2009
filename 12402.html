SP: ' In the end, what is &quot;right&quot; is an irreducible personal belief, 
<br />
which you can try to change by appeal to emotions or by example, but not 
<br />
by appeal to logic or empirical facts. And in fact I feel much safer 
<br />
that way: if someone honestly believed that he knew what was &quot;right&quot; as 
<br />
surely as he knew 2+2=4, he would be a very dangerous person. Religious 
<br />
fanatics are not dangerous because they want to do evil, but because 
<br />
they want to do good. '
<br />
<br />MP: I agree with this, saving only that, on a 'numbers' basis, there are 
<br />
those whose personal evolution takes them beyond the dynamic of 'good' 
<br />
or 'evil' into the domain of power for its own sake. This entails 
<br />
complete loss of empathic ability and I think it could be argued that 
<br />
such a person is 'legislating' himself out of the human species.
<br />
<br />MP: I think a key point with 'irreducible personal belief' is that the 
<br />
persons in question need to acknowledge the beliefs as such and take 
<br />
responsibility for them. I believe we have to point this out, whenever 
<br />
we get the opportunity, because generally most people are reluctant to 
<br />
engage in analysis of their own beliefs, in public anyway. I think part 
<br />
of the reason for this is the cultural climate [meme-scape?] in which 
<br />
Belief in a G/god/s or uncritical Faith are still held to be perfectly 
<br />
respectable. This cultural climate is what Richard Dawkins and Daniel 
<br />
Dennet have been criticising in recent books and articles.
<br />
<br />SP: 'I am not entirely convinced that comp is true'
<br />
<br />MP: At the moment I am satisfied that 'comp' is NOT true, certainly in 
<br />
any format that asserts that 'integers' are all that is needed. 
<br />
'Quantum' is one thing, but 'digital' is quite another :-) The main 
<br />
problem [fact I would prefer to say] is that existence is irreducible 
<br />
whereas numbers or Number be dependent upon something/s existing. 
<br />
<br />MP: Why are we not zombies? The answer is in the fact of 
<br />
self-referencing. In our case [as hominids] there are peculiarities of 
<br />
construction and function arisen from our evolutionary history, but 
<br />
there is nothing in principle to deny self-awareness from a 
<br />
silicon-electronic entity that embodied sufficient details within a 
<br />
model of self in the world. The existence of such a model would 
<br />
constitute its mind, broadly speaking, and the updating of the model of 
<br />
self in the world would be the experience of self awareness. What it 
<br />
would be like TO BE the updating of such a model of self in the world is 
<br />
something we will probably have to wait awhile to be told  :-)

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Le 31-déc.-06, à 04:59, Stathis Papaioannou a écrit (to Tom Caylor):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course: questions of personal meaning are not scientific 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; questions. &gt; Physics may show you how to build a nuclear bomb, but it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; won't tell &gt; you whether you should use it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But Physics, per se,  is not supposed to answer this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Socio-economics could give light, as could &quot;computer simulation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nuclear explosion in cities ...&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And some (still putative) theory of ethics could perhaps put light on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that question too. Well, the ultimate decision is a problem for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;president&quot; .... But the president and its advisers could consult 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some decision theory ... perhaps.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, those theories won't answer the question of whether you should use 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the bomb either. Suppose your theory says something like, &quot;if you wish 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to save a lives by taking b lives, where a&gt;b, then you should use the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bomb&quot;. The scientific part of this theory involves demonstrating that, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in fact, use of the bomb would save a lives by taking b lives. But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this does not tell you whether you should actually use the bomb. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Neither would an ethical theory like utilitarianism tell you what to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do: it might confirm that according to the theory it is the right 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing to do, but utilitarianism cannot tell you that utilitarianism is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;right&quot;. In the end, what is &quot;right&quot; is an irreducible personal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief, which you can try to change by appeal to emotions or by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, but not by appeal to logic or empirical facts. And in fact I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feel much safer that way: if someone honestly believed that he knew 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what was &quot;right&quot; as surely as he knew 2+2=4, he would be a very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dangerous person. Religious fanatics are not dangerous because they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want to do evil, but because they want to do good. The number of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people killed in the name of God vastly outnumbers the number killed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the name of Satan.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Where I think I disagree with you [Tom] is that you seem to want to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; reduce the irreducible and make values and personal meaning real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; world &gt; objects, albeit not of the kind that can be detected by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scientific &gt; instruments, perhaps issued by God. But in proposing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this you are &gt; swapping one irreducible entity extremely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; well-grounded in empirical &gt; evidence (I know I'm conscious, and I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; know that when my brain stops so &gt; does my consciousness) for another 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; irreducible entity with no &gt; grounding in empirical evidence whatsoever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree that you know you are conscious. Well, I don't know that but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I have good evidences and hope. But I don't see any evidence that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; when your brain stops so does your consciousness. I can understand 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the belief (not even knowledge) that when your brain stops relatively 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to mine (in case we share an history), then so does the possibility 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of your consciousness to manifest itself relatively to me; but no more.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Actually what does mean the expression &quot;my brain stops&quot;. In all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe? all multiverses, all computational histories ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You have to be precise which theory you are using when relating some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 3-me (like &quot;my brain&quot;) and some 1-me (like the knower, the conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;I&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree with some critics you make with respect to Tom Caylor notion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of personal God, but sometimes, it seems to me, you have a conception 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of reality which could as criticable as Caylor's one.  Err... i see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your particular point is valid though, but you are using misleading 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; images with respect to the consequence of mechanism (I guess you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; aware but that you want to remain short perhaps).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It gets cumbersome to qualify everything with &quot;given the appearance of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a physical world&quot;. As I have said before, I am not entirely convinced 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that comp is true, precisely because because such ideas as a conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation supervening on any physical process or on no physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process may be considered absurd. It is quite possible, for example, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there is something special about the structure of the brain which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads to consciousness, and a digital computer will not be able to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copy this, even if it copies 3rd person observable behaviour. Against 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that idea is the question of why we didn't evolve to be zombies, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maybe we would have if nature had electronic circuits to play with. If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I had to guess between comp and not-comp I don't think I could do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better than flipping a coin.
