<br />I meant &quot;the idea is that it is possible that there is no

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; it would be a

<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; &quot;mathematical monism&quot; in which one and only one particulat

<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; &quot;mathematical object&quot; would exist. This seems logically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; difficult and then: why just this one?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Why only mathematical objects and not any other kind ?
</em><br />
<br />We were talking of mathematical objects and I asked why only
<br />
one of them would be &quot;given&quot; &quot;physical existence&quot; (as *you*
<br />
suggested).
<br />
<br />The question of whether there could be other type of objects
<br />
than mathematical is a different one. I can figure what could
<br />
mathematical objects and that they can exist (though I am
<br />
afraid I cannot easily transmit that feeling). It is harder
<br />
for me to imagine what non mathematical objects could be and
<br />
how/why they happened to come to existence. Did some God pull
<br />
them out of nothingness?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; We can go some way to explaining the non-existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; of HP universes by their requiring a more complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; set of laws (where &quot;we&quot; are believers in physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; realism).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; Whether HP universes require or not a more complex set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; of laws is a very good question but it seems unlikely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; that it can be easily answered. For some physicists,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; the currently known (or freseeable) set of rules and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; equations for our universe *is* compatible with &quot;HP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; events&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Physical MWI is more constrained than mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; multiverse theories, so there is not so much Harry-Potterness.
</em><br />
<br />This is just an opinion. It must refer to prejudices about
<br />
what physical MWI and mathematical multiverse theories could
<br />
or could not be.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Moreover,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; physical MWIs have measure and can at least predict the HP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; universes will be rare  (or faint, or something).
</em><br />
<br />This question of measure is difficult but I see no reason
<br />
why this should differ between physical MWI and mathematical
<br />
multiverse theories.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; Such events might appear in other portions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; our universe. For others, it is just the opposite, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; might well be that there do not exist any set of rules
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; and equations that would correspond to a &quot;HP universe&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; There cannot fail to be. The HP game my nephew
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; plays on is a mathematical simulation -- what else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; could it be?
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure that what your nephew plays with is a rich
<br />
enough mathematical description so that, even if it was
<br />
&quot;turned physical&quot; by some God or magician, it would contain
<br />
conscious beings. Furthermore, most of this HP universe is
<br />
in the brain of your nephew. What is in the game would be
<br />
almost nothing without your nephew's imagination to fill
<br />
the (huge) gaps.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; However, we are bound to end up with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; physical laws being &quot;just so&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; Not really. What is &quot;just so&quot; is that a conscious being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; has to live in only one universe at once just as he has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; to live in only one place and in only one period of time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; at once.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; That does not follow form the mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; hypothesis. If I am a set, I am a subset of any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; number of other sets. If I am a digit-string, I a m a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; substring of any number of other substrings.
</em><br />
<br />This is where we have a different intuition about what
<br />
mathematical objects can be and what a mathematical object
<br />
containing (description of) conscious beings might be. For
<br />
me this is just like you have to live here and now and not
<br />
in Egypt 3500 years ago. What &quot;aspect&quot; of a mathematical
<br />
object I could be is not so clear to me but it is unlikely
<br />
to be as trivial as a digit string.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; It is no more mysterious that I do not live
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; Harry Potter's life that I do not live Akenaton's life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; From the common-sense POV, yes. From the MM POV, no.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe there is more than one MM POV. MM does not really
<br />
have POV. You and I have POV on what MM can or cannot be.
<br />
And they do differ.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; And lots of &quot;HP-like&quot; events have also been reported in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; *this* world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Nowhere near enough! (compared to what MM predicts).
</em><br />
<br />MM does not predict. You do and I do from our respective
<br />
interpretations of what MM could or should be (or not).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you find that &quot;physical monism&quot; (&quot;mind emerges from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; matter activity&quot;),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All the evidence points to this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OK. So in your view this makes sense and is likeky to be true.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Those are two different claim: it is likely to be true,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; but seeing *how* it is true, making sense of it is the Hard Problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; IMO the hardest part of the hard problem is seeing how mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; emerges from mathematical description -- from physics in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;map&quot; sense, rather than the &quot;territory&quot; sense. Switching to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; a maths-only metaphysics can only make the Hard Problem harder.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; As I perceive it, this is the hard problem even starting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; with a (classical) physical context. A I perceive it also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; placing it in a mathematical context doesn't make it harder
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; or easier. But this is just from my viewpoint indeed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; You didn't say why it doesn't change anything.
</em><br />
<br />I mean that whatever there might be in particles to make
<br />
them real is irrelevant to the question since (this is a
<br />
conjecture) all that is needed to determine the behavior
<br />
of particles is the set of rules and equation they have
<br />
to follow. What they are made of (if any) has no influence
<br />
on that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; that having a richer ontology automatically makes it easier
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; to solve metaphysical problems, since you can say that X , Y or Z
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; is intrinsic to the universe and therefore not to be &quot;explained away&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; as something else. Of course, this manoeuvre should be used sparingly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; An intrinsic theory of heat would have been dead wrong.
</em><br />
<br />As long as what is inside particle has no effect on the
<br />
particle behavior I do not see how it can help to understand
<br />
how sets of interacting particles (this is an image) can
<br />
produce consciousness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Epistemic objectivity of maths&quot; means &quot;every competent mathematician
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; gets the same answer to a given problem&quot;. It doesn't say anything about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; the existence of anything (except possibly mathematicians).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; Well, if &quot;every competent mathematician gets the same answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; to a given problem&quot;, &quot;competent mathematicians&quot; do not have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; much freedom about what they might find as an answer to some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; given problems. So there must &quot;exist&quot; &quot;something&quot; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; &quot;constrain&quot; them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Yes: rules, the principle of non-contradiction.
</em><br />
<br />So. These exist for you too? Are they physical objects?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; And &quot;this&quot; might even exist in the absence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; of &quot;competent mathematician&quot;.

<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt;&gt;&gt; isomorphism is **not** identity!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; This is obviously untrue: it might well be that not all

<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; isomorphisms are identity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; then isomorphism is not identity,
</em><br />
<br />I said &quot;not all&quot;. I did not said &quot;none of&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; since identity is not mere overlap.
</em><br />
<br />Identity is: &quot;f(x) = x&quot;.
<br />
Isomorphism is: &quot;f(a R b) = f(a) R f(b)&quot;.
<br />
I am sure you can make it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; but, indeed, identity is always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; an isomorphism and, hence, at least *some* isomorphisms

<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; *can* be the identity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; can be, yes,
</em><br />
<br />Yes. You finally got it. It *can* be.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; but more is needed for MM than Tegmark's hypothesis.
</em><br />
<br />This is a question of viewpoint. I would rather say that more
<br />
than Tegmark's hypothesis is needed for *something else* (or
<br />
something more) than MM.
<br />
<br />Tegmark's hypothesis is indeed necessary. It might be that is
<br />
is not sufficient but is it necessary to postulate something
<br />
more? What can we explain better with something more? Apart
<br />
from just saying that &quot;it must be richer, we should get more
<br />
out of it&quot;?
