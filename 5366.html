<br />
Greetings again to the list. It has been a while since I posted something to think 
<br />
about, and in that case I did a lot of arguing for my cause! I enjoyed it a lot, and I 
<br />
hope others did too. But I again must stress that I do not rise to the level where I 
<br />
can appreciate deep mathematical discussion, and so I hope that discussion on this 
<br />
topic that I will now raise can be expressed by logic (I have argued before that logic 
<br />
includes mathematics as a subset of logic but that logic also includes all things that 
<br />
mathematics seems to have no good way to define -- because mathematics is 
<br />
ultimately digital and so mathematics by its nature can only approximate the 
<br />
analog). Ok, on to the topic!  :)
<br />
<br />Some experiments have indicated that gravity is associated with a force carrier, and 
<br />
that this force carrier moves somewhere below or at the speed of light. Experiments 
<br />
continue as the indications have not been absolutely proven. Perhaps I will be 
<br />
corrected on this, but it is my understanding that a force carrier is generally thought 
<br />
of as some sort of particle that transfers mass/energy between other particles.
<br />
<br />This presents a logical problem relative to black holes. Beyond the event horizon, 
<br />
nothing with mass can escape there from and make itself known to our observable 
<br />
universe. Apparently every particle has at least some mass, however tiny, else a 
<br />
black hole would be seen to radiate for reasons other than absorbsion of half of a 
<br />
virtual particle pair. (I always had trouble with that absorbsion mechanism of black 
<br />
hole evaporation, since it seemed logical to me that on the average 50% of what 
<br />
gets absorbed would be matter as we know it and 50% would be anti-matter, with an 
<br />
average net gain of zero absorbsion).
<br />
<br />The only logical way that I can fathom for energy to escape from a black hole, and 
<br />
express itself as gravity, is if the force carrier &quot;particle&quot; has absolutely no mass. 
<br />
Again, perhaps I will be corrected, but it is my understanding that gravity can only 
<br />
affect particles that have mass. But a &quot;particle&quot; expressed only as energy does not 
<br />
equate with e=mc^2  (e=0 * [the speed of light squared]) because e must then = 0.
<br />
<br />If a gravity carrier has any mass whatsoever then by what mechanism could it 
<br />
possibly and in such abundance escape from a black hole event horizon and make 
<br />
itself known in our observable universe?
<br />
<br />Or could it be that gravity is, in reality, pure nothing -- that gravity is an expression 
<br />
of the case where e really does = absolutely zero? Is gravity really just an attempt 
<br />
by matter to interact with an absolute nothing? If so, then is a black hole really -- 
<br />
nothing? Could it be that gravity is expressed relative to the *inverse* of e=mc^2?
<br />
