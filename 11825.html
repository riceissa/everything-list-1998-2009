===================================

Appendix A – Introduction to notation
<br />
In this nomenclature to X(.) is simply a notation which labels a literal
<br />
chunk of the universe (the natural world) as a process by using a
<br />
mathematical function as a designation. The symbol X(.) is merely a sign
<br />
or a pointer to a real natural process, not a mathematical model or other
<br />
idealisation of it. It is best thought of as a ‘surgical excision’ of a
<br />
chunk of the universe subsequently labeled X(.). The boundary of a subset
<br />
is notional, or ontological in that it is chosen merely because we wish to
<br />
characterise X(.) explicitly. Please note that the nomenclature does not
<br />
demand a clean boundary between X(.) and its container/parent, U(.).
<br />
Consider the depiction shown in figure 1. Universe U(.) contains scientist
<br />
C(.) and the studied objects C1(.) and C2(.). Within scientist C(.) is
<br />
brain B(.) which has an unspecified subset P(.) responsible for phenomenal
<br />
consciousness.

<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; FIGURE 1 DELETED &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

<br />
The act of ‘being’ B(.) delivers phenomenal consciousness [P(.)]. The
<br />
square brackets are a ‘first person’ operator and [P(.)] can be read as
<br />
‘the contents of P(.)’. This is the mandated first-person source of
<br />
scientific evidence. Scientist C(.) formulates a hypothesised statement hN
<br />
of regularity relating the two objects. This hypothesis is shown as a
<br />
belief configured in the brain of the scientist and is an abducted
<br />
formulation in respect of the actual target generalisation tN that
<br />
correlates the appearance of C1(.) and C2(.). This statement hN, if
<br />
predictively successful, will become tN. Note that the subset of the
<br />
universe that impinges on the senses of scientist C(.) is called T(.). The
<br />
combined effect of all experimental apparatus and measurement transduction
<br />
impinges on the senses of the scientist. The easiest way to imagine this
<br />
is to consider vision where the final transit of photons from the observed
<br />
phenomena (say a meter or C1(.) itself if directly observed) is through
<br />
the intervening space and onto the retina of the scientist. From that
<br />
point the sensory measurements in the eyes through to the brain of the
<br />
scientist is labelled S(.). This sensory data S(.) is then used to
<br />
construct the phenomenal consciousness P(.) which scientist C(.)
<br />
experiences as the visual scene portion of the totality of [P(.)]. As a
<br />
result C(.) experiences objects C1(.) and C2(.) as [P(S(T(C1(.))))] and
<br />
[P(S(T(C2(.))))] respectively. This nomenclature designates the ‘surgical
<br />
resection’ of the previously excised chunks of the universe U(.), allowing
<br />
them to operate as a single whole.

<br />
Appendix B – Proof: zombies can’t do science
<br />
Figure 2 shows human and zombie scientists doing identical science. Their
<br />
bodies are identical with the exception of their brain material. The
<br />
studied objects cause identical impinging sensory interactions via T(.).
<br />
Their identical sensory measurements S(.) transmit the sensory data to the
<br />
brain material. Remember objects C1(.) and C2(.), each embedded in T(.),
<br />
are literally labels applied to real-world phenomena outside the
<br />
scientist. Consider that the visible evidence of a generalisation tN can
<br />
be found in the correlated behaviour of C1(.) and C2(.). Let us depict
<br />
that correlated behaviour as related to tN as follows:

<br />
tN = REGI(fN( C1(.), C2(.) ))			(a)

<br />
This equation depicts the access that an ‘ideal brain’ has to a belief
<br />
that accurately portrays the law of nature tN. The brain involved
<br />
naturally observes C1(.) and C2(.), which is captured by the process
<br />
fN(.). This ideal brain then habituates a regularity (an ‘ínvariant’) from
<br />
the observation using REGI(.) which is reported as tN. Equation (a) tells
<br />
us that chunk on matter that would equivalently and naturally access the
<br />
law tN is REGI(fN(.)). What we can now do is contrast the human and zombie
<br />
scientist’s access to ‘being’ the chunk of ideal matter represented by
<br />
equation (a).

<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; FIGURE 2 DELETED &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

<br />
Firstly we look at the human scientist shown in figure 2. Let us depict
<br />
the correlated behaviour of the objects mapped into the brain of the human
<br />
scientist as follows:

<br />
hN = REGH( P( S( T(C1(.), C2(.)) ) )		(b)

<br />
Hypothesis hN is the human scientist’s formulation in lieu of tN.  This
<br />
has been done by the innate process REGH(.) which extracts regularities
<br />
from the operation of the brain subsystem P(.), the phenomenality
<br />
generator. This has been fed by sensory measurements S(.) which resulted
<br />
from impinging environmental impact T(.) which originated from the objects
<br />
C1(.) and C2(.). Now we look at what brain subprocess P(.) human scientist
<br />
C(.) must have to have in order that:

<br />
tN = hN					(c)

<br />
or, substituting (a) and (b) in (c):

<br />
REGI(fN( C1(.), C2(.) )) = REGH( P( S( T(C1(.), C2(.)) ) )	(d)

<br />
What this is telling us is that regardless of the regularity extractor
<br />
REG, the net result is that ‘observation’ fN(.) is being performed by
<br />
P(S(T(.))). This means that within P(.), in order that the same regularity
<br />
be accessible:

<br />
fN( C1(.), C2(.) ) =  P( S( T(C1(.), C2(.)))		(e)

<br />
To see what this means first consider that we know for sure that human
<br />
scientists can access laws of nature. We have done it for centuries. Human
<br />
regularity extractor REGH(.) works. Our goal is not to contest this
<br />
capability and we can assume that the benchmark regularity extractor
<br />
REGI(.) is at least as capable and therefore we can assume they are equal:

<br />
REGI(.) = REGH(.)				(f)

<br />
Next note we also no that human scientist C(.) has phenomenality [P(.)].
<br />
The phenomenal representation provided by [P(.)] does not have to be
<br />
accurate. It merely has to be repeatable. This means that if the
<br />
measurement is of temperature, there is no need for the brain material
<br />
B(.) to get hot or cold. It merely means that whatever phenomenal
<br />
representation is constructed that varies with temperature, it has to
<br />
consistently, systematically vary with the real temperature as delivered
<br />
by S(.) in depiction of C1(.) and C2(.). Let us assume that brain B(.)
<br />
creates proxy phenomena C’1(.) and C’2(.). to represent C1(.) and C2(.)
<br />
respectively. If our human scientist is to function to enable access to
<br />
our law of nature then equation (e) must have the form such that REG(.)
<br />
will extract tN:

<br />
P( S( T(C1(.), C2(.)))  = fN( C’1(.), C’2(.) )		(g)

<br />
Only when equation (g) is satisfied is regularity tN available to the
<br />
brain involved. If the form of the left hand side does anything else, the
<br />
regularity in it will not be tN. As a result [P(S(T(C1(.))))] and
<br />
[P(S(T(C2(.))))] correlate exactly like objects C1(.) and C2(.) do.
<br />
Impinging S(T(.)) is used to construct P(.) within B(.), which is (via
<br />
mysterious mechanism of  the ‘hard problem’) behaving systematically as
<br />
C1(.) and C2(.) are behaving. This phenomenal representation [P(.)] is
<br />
experienced by C(.). The mysterious mechanism is used to ensure that the
<br />
brain process P(.) is constrained to that end. Without that mechanism and
<br />
constraint P(.) could not be constructed by B(.). The difference between
<br />
the external phenomena C1(.) and C2(.) and the phenomenal representation
<br />
C’1(.) and C’2(.) is merely a systematic error which is correlated out of
<br />
the equations by the act of contrasting phenomenon with phenomenon
<br />
(equivalent to test and control).
<br />
The fact that we don’t know what the exact physics is does not matter. It
<br />
does tell us, however, that somehow P(.) performs an inverse mapping from
<br />
S(T(.)) back to something sufficiently similar to C1(.) and C2(.) to
<br />
betray tN to the human scientist. The net effect is that the scientist has
<br />
a depiction of C1(.) and C2(.) that is independent of that provided by
<br />
S(.). This is achieved through the use of a-priori knowledge of the
<br />
external world acquired genetically and used to create a literal
<br />
phenomenal depiction of the external world within which can be expressed
<br />
the correlative behaviours of the phenomena external to the human
<br />
scientist.
<br />
Things are very different for the zombie scientist. Zombie scientist Z(.)
<br />
has a different brain BZ(.) with no capacity to create P(.). Zombie
<br />
scientist Z(.) has some form of regularity extractor REGZ(.) which it
<br />
applies solely to S(.). The zombie has identical T(.) is impinging on
<br />
identical sensory systems S(.). The zombie equivalent to equation (b) is:

<br />
hN = REGZ( S( T(C1(.), C2(.)) ) )		(h)

<br />
This is all that the zombie has. This places an entirely different demand
<br />
on equation (e) as follows:

<br />
fN( C1(.), C2(.) ) =  S( T(C1(.), C2(.))	(i)

<br />
In order that the zombie brain BZ(.) ends up configured with access to tN
<br />
through the zombie’s REGZ(.) regularity extractor, S(T(.)) has to behave
<br />
like fN(.). There are an infinite number of hN that present the same S(.)
<br />
sensory feeds and an infinite number of different configurations of the
<br />
external world that generate the same T(.). In order that hN be somewhere
<br />
near tN it has to be known already. No unambiguous mental phenomena that
<br />
repeatably and directly reflects the correlative behaviour of C1(.) and
<br />
C2(.) is available. All zombie Z(.) has is S(.) to work with.
<br />
Zombie S(.) is thus fundamentally prevented from any awareness of C1(.)
<br />
and C2(.). The zombie can make an infinite number of hypotheses hN and
<br />
could only ever accidentally be able to get any of them to converge on the
<br />
actual generalisation predictive of C1(.) and C2(.) in any systematic way.
<br />
Even if that happened the zombie could never know it. Indeed the very
<br />
presence of C1(.) and C2(.) is completely absent from Z(.). No science at
<br />
all is possible except for perhaps noting that certain parts of the data
<br />
stream S(.) correlate with certain other parts of the data stream S(.).
<br />
Indeed the regularity extractor REGZ(.) can only extract such regularities
<br />
from S(.). The originating causality is completely hidden from the zombie.
<br />
This correlation’s relationship with C1(.) and C2(.), and therefore
<br />
generalisation tN, is completely out of reach of the zombie. There is no
<br />
way for the zombie to contextualise any sensory data with respect to the
<br />
external world without an a-priori model which mapped all sensory feeds
<br />
into something that presented REGZ(.) something sufficient to find the
<br />
natural law being sought. That model is not available and even if it was
<br />
it would have to be pre-programmed with all potential novelty and how to
<br />
adapt current beliefs to new beliefs. This too means knowing everything
<br />
a-priori and leaves the zombie in the same position.
<br />
Having reached this point we can now generalise the argument to the
<br />
behaviour in respect of novelty. Let us say that completely different
<br />
behaviour in the external world occurs and that it is as a result of
<br />
objects C3(.) and C4(.) never before encountered. Because the humans
<br />
scientist has a phenomenal representation of the external world, the
<br />
novelty is available for the regularity extractor REGH(.) to use. The
<br />
zombie only has S(.) to apply to REGZ(.). The extent to which the novelty
<br />
is visible is dependent on the difference C3(.) and C4(.) present to S(.),
<br />
which is far removed from C3(.) and C4(.). Hence zombies can’t do science
<br />
and conversely phenomenal consciousness is necessary for science.
