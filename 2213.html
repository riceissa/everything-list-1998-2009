<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  My belief is that the quantum nature of the chemicals in our

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  artificial  neural network that didn't have any significant quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  properties, that  it could be made to operate (and be conscious) in

</em><br />
<br />I agree that the quantum nature of the chemicals in our brains is 
<br />
pretty irrelevant to our thinking.
<br />
<br />I also think that it is possible to imagine building an artificial
<br />
neural network without any significant quantum properties,
<br />
which would function in the same way as a human brain.
<br />
<br />If my interpretation of quantum theory is correct however,
<br />
then being conscious is a matter of being a physical structure of a
<br />
precisely characterized type.  Artifical networks may well not be
<br />
of that type, and so would be zombies. 
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, (unlike Penrose and Hameroff, for example), I do not
<br />
believe that consciousness depends on some peculiar large-scale
<br />
quantum coherence of neural chemicals.  I not believe that there is
<br />
any evidence or necessity for such coherence.  I also think that the
<br />
search for it is based on concepts (technically speaking, the idea of
<br />
pure normal states) which were developed for simple quantum
<br />
systems but which cannot be applied to the physically relevant
<br />
local quantum states in quantum field theory.
<br />
<br />This does not affect my point that the natural instability of the
<br />
brain amplifies its underlying (quantum) uncertainties.  (For an
<br />
artifical network to be a good human mimic at the level of
<br />
neural firings, you would need to make very extensive use of a
<br />
random number generator.)
<br />
<br />I wrote
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Nevertheless, Eve still must expect to be typical as an observer. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Otherwise, she has no reason to believe her physical theories.  Her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  birth rank puts her in the position of someone who has tossed a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  fair coin 1,000 times and it has always come up heads.  But she is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  tossing a million other coins at the same time so it isn't really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  that surprising.
</em><br />
<br />Bostrom replied
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  For all she knows, she may simply be one out of two humans -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  pretty  typical.
</em><br />
<br />I replied
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Eve should find her birth rank surprising because of her (assumed)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge of human biology.  The question is whether she can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deduce her own infertility from that surprise.
</em><br />
<br />Bostrom replied
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Ok. However, you also said earlier that she is &quot;tossing a million
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  other  coins at the same time&quot; - I assume you mean that she
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  exists on multiple  branches of the universal wavefunction. Why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  would this make her  observation any less surprising? She could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  think: &quot;If that were true,  how come I - this instance of me -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  would be observing something so  atypical? Why am I not on one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  those normal branches?&quot;
</em><br />
<br />What I'm trying to do here is some thinking aloud about whether
<br />
the Doomsday argument is correct and about what issues are raised
<br />
in an attempt to apply it in a many-minds framework.
<br />
<br />My first point is just a matter of setting probabilistic scales:
<br />
<br />Even with her property of seeing herself as having birth rank 2,
<br />
Eve exists on many many branches of the universal wavefunction. 
<br />
These include, for example, lots of equiprobable branches in which
<br />
she sees stars in different constellations.  She also exists on
<br />
atypical branches in which her nuclear physics is incorrect because
<br />
whenever she has placed Uranium near a Geiger counter it has failed
<br />
to decay and even on branches in which there are particular
<br />
circumstances in which she has seen heat regularly flow from
<br />
hotter to colder without energy input.  We only deduce that such
<br />
branches are atypical from our assumption that our branch is
<br />
typical.  Eve too needs to assume (rightly or wrongly) that her
<br />
branch is typical.  The chance of her seeing the laws of
<br />
thermodynamics disobeyed significantly (assuming our beliefs about
<br />
them are correct) is much much smaller than the chance of her
<br />
seeing the constellations in the precise way that she does, but even
<br />
that is much much smaller than 2 in a trillion.
<br />
<br />My second point is that knowledge of atypical birth rank is not a
<br />
simple branch-causing property.  Information relevant to birth rank
<br />
is distributed all over Eve's possible histories, and in different
<br />
ways in different histories.  It is not possible to take birth rank as
<br />
a fact independent of any of the other properties which make Eve
<br />
who she is.
<br />
<br />Of course, I do not dispute that Eve is correct to see her birth rank
<br />
as interestingly atypical.  The question is whether that knowledge
<br />
should lead her to believe that she is incapable of becoming
<br />
pregnant, or, more plausibly, should lead her to believe in the
<br />
immanence of inevitable planetary catastrophe.  
<br />
<br />My first point says that Eve's birth rank is not even close to
<br />
being as improbable as lots of other (in general less interesting)
<br />
specific facts which any observer knows about herself. 
<br />
<br />The second says that on a technical level, Eve cannot simply apply
<br />
Bayes' theorem to prior probabilities of conception and subsequent
<br />
information about birth rank.  
<br />
<br />Firstly, the prior probabilities will be branch-dependent, being, for
<br />
example, smaller in branches in which Eve is amenoretic.  
<br />
<br />Secondly, only if there was a class of observers all of whom are
<br />
like Eve except that they have different birth ranks would there be
<br />
an objective probability which Eve could use as a genuine measure
<br />
of the improbability of her birth rank.  But such classes are
<br />
undefinable, even in my theory in which the set of all observers is
<br />
well-defined and countable, because hints about her birth rank have
<br />
been built into everything Eve has ever known about herself.
<br />
<br />By analogy, there might be an objective probability for me to
<br />
win the British national lottery next week, but I do not believe that
<br />
there is an objective probability for me being able to communicate
<br />
in a language with a vocabulary significantly influenced by more
<br />
than one prior language.  My knowledge of word pairs from different
<br />
sources; dog/canine, book/literature, meal/banquet is pretty
<br />
well-worked into my mental life but, even with a perfect
<br />
description of my early mental life, you couldn't say with any
<br />
accuracy when it became clear that that was the sort of language I
<br />
was learning.
<br />
<br />I suppose that the best one could imagine doing for Eve would be
<br />
something like this.  Run a lattice simulation of the universe and
<br />
calculate the structures of all observers with complexity bounded
<br />
by a given fixed amount (in theory, given sufficient computer
<br />
power, this is possible because of the finiteness of my theory.)  
<br />
<br />Now analyse all those structures. Let P be the sum of the a priori
<br />
probabilities of those which are decided, by some criterion which
<br />
will certainly be imprecise, to be women of Eve's age with evidence
<br />
for early birth rank and let Q the sum of the a priori probabilities of
<br />
women of Eve's age without such evidence.  Then a crude
<br />
estimate of Eve's current birth rank improbability is P/(P+Q).  This
<br />
number will, I would think, be much smaller than 1.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, what Eve would really like to calculate would be a
<br />
ratio with numerator her own personal current a prior probability.  I
<br />
do not believe that there is a sensible denominator for this except
<br />
that provided by the set of all other observers of her age
<br />
(age is equivalent in my theory to complexity and is effectively
<br />
definable).  My claim is that the corresponding ratio is not
<br />
significantly smaller for Eve than for you or me.
<br />
<br />Should Eve worry about the smallness of P/(P+Q)?  As defined, it
<br />
may depend on the precise Hamiltonian used in the theory.
<br />
Should Eve attach more credence to Hamiltonians giving larger
<br />
ratios?
<br />
<br />I wrote
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  One cannot separate birth rank from the other facts about Eve's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  mental life.  Birth rank is not the sort of fact that one could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  imagine Eve ever being asked to guess, as if she had no idea of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  answer.  As long as she has been aware, she has had lots of clues
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  that her birth rank was expectional, just as we have always had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  lots of implicit clues of our birth rank (e.g. the taste of powdered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  baby milk).
</em><br />
<br />Bostrom replied
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I, for one, am quite uncertain about my birth rank. It looks like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  there  have been infinitely many observers before me, but what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  cardinality I do  not know. Even if the world were finite, I'd still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  not know my rank,  since I don't know (even approximately) how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  many intelligent aliens have  existed before me.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In the case of Eve, it is very easy indeed to describe a situation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  where  she is utterly ignorant as to her rank - just imagine she is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  living on  an isolated island, and she doesn't know whether there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  are other islands  in the world and if so whether they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  inhabited.
</em><br />
<br />These look like fairly good arguments for saying that the Doomsday
<br />
Argument, for example, is empty in your cosmology.
<br />
<br />For Eve, I was trying to imagine the closest possible world to how I
<br />
think the real universe is, in which your scenario, based on the idea
<br />
that Eve knew her true birth rank, could work at all.
<br />
<br />In my theory, all Eve has is her own mental history.  This would be
<br />
unaffected if she lived on an isolated island but did not know about
<br />
the other islands.  Indeed, in my version of the many-minds
<br />
interpretation, she would be the same observer in both cases; with
<br />
the possibility among her (multiple) futures of her discovering other
<br />
islands.
<br />
<br />Whatever her future, Eve currently has reason to believe that she
<br />
has an interesting birth rank, based for example on the purity of the
<br />
air she breathes, the lack of archaeological remains around her, and
<br />
what she has been told by her partner.  Whether she is correct or
<br />
not about her birth rank, she is certainly isolated.  Should she
<br />
deduce from that that most humans are as isolated, and that
<br />
therefore her island will never be crowded with lots of her 
<br />
descendants?
<br />
<br />We also seem to be somewhat isolated in as far as, if our
<br />
species were to continue indefinitely, then we might expect most
<br />
humans to live in societies in which the past appeared
<br />
interminable; with origins at best mythic and most of history
<br />
unknown. (Fictions by Gene Wolfe come to mind.)
<br />
<br />I do suspect that it is possible that our species will continue
<br />
indefinitely.  Nevertheless, I don't think that this makes us
<br />
infinitely improbable, because, in my theory, in which observers are
<br />
defined entirely by their mental lives, there can only be finitely
<br />
many possible observers of complexity less than any given bound.  In
<br />
particular, I do not suppose that observers can always be
<br />
distinguished by spatial-temporal position.  (I suspect that this
<br />
hypothesis may well be needed if we are ever to understand what
<br />
quantization of general relativity might mean.)
<br />
<br />I am also not sure whether observers with long species histories
<br />
are not a priori less likely than observers with short species
<br />
histories on the grounds that longer species-histories means more
<br />
possible different histories with each of these possibilities made
<br />
less likely precisely by its greater detail.  (Information always
<br />
costs probability in many-minds theory.)
<br />
<br />(This point revises what I said about Eve.  Actually, (were she
<br />
plausibly to exist at all), because she has so little evidence of
<br />
prior species history, her individual a priori probability might well
<br />
be somewhat greater than yours or mine.)
