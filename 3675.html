<br />
I thought the debate between Brent Meeker and Wei Dai was quite
<br />
interesting regarding self-predictability in a deterministic universe.
<br />
(Perhaps the same issue would come up in a nondeterministic universe,
<br />
where one sought to predict the probability distribution of one's future
<br />
actions.)
<br />
<br />The issue seems related to the undecideability of the halting problem,
<br />
and Wei's arguments seem to parallel some of the reasoning in that proof.
<br />
<br />One of the proofs of the undecideability of the halting problem works
<br />
as follows.  Take a supposed halting-problem-solving program H, and
<br />
embed it in a program P.  P consists of running H on a copy of P itself,
<br />
then if H returns &quot;halts&quot;, go into an infinite loop.  If H returns
<br />
&quot;doesn't halt&quot;, then P should halt.
<br />
<br />This sets up a contradictory condition where if H says P should halt,
<br />
it doesn't halt, and vice versa.  This contradiction establishes that
<br />
H cannot exist.
<br />
<br />Wei offered a similar argument in saying that no being could predict all
<br />
their future actions.  If they could, they could run this prediction
<br />
algorithm to determine what they would do, then do the opposite, just
<br />
like program P above.
<br />
<br />Brent suggested that it might be impossible for the being to do the
<br />
opposite, that somehow it might be constrained always to do what it had
<br />
predicted that it would do.  And I think that is as far as the debate
<br />
along these lines got.
<br />
<br />Clearly in the case of computers, Brent's alternative would not work.
<br />
We have a model of how computers work and we can always write P in the
<br />
form in which it runs H as a &quot;black box&quot; and then does the opposite of
<br />
what H predicts.  However, what about the case of intelligent beings?
<br />
<br />It seems that based on our understanding of free will, beings ought to
<br />
have the same kind of freedom of action that is needed in this case.
<br />
They ought to be able to run any prediction algorithm, good or bad, as
<br />
a &quot;black box&quot;, and then take whatever actions they choose as a result
<br />
of that prediction.  The nature of free will is such that, given a
<br />
prediction that action X will be taken, the being can therefore refuse
<br />
to take action X.
<br />
<br />So Brent's alternative amounts to suggesting that beings in such
<br />
a universe would not have free will.  Furthermore, they would be
<br />
aware of this fact once they advanced to the point where they could
<br />
make predictions about themselves.  The fact that they did not have
<br />
the freedom to contradict their predictions would directly violate the
<br />
meaning of free will.
<br />
<br />In fact it is worse than that, as people would not only be unable to
<br />
contradict their own predictions about their future actions, they would be
<br />
unable to contradict similar predictions about them, made by other people.
<br />
If being X tells being Y what he will do, based on a completely accurate
<br />
theory, being Y will be incapable of doing other than what is predicted.
<br />
<br />In fact, if these beings actually have this nature, then it would
<br />
seem that their absence of free will would be noticeable even without a
<br />
complete theory of the universe.  If being X tells Y what it will do using
<br />
a complete theory, Y cannot contradict it.  But if X tells Y what it will
<br />
do using an incomplete theory, and it happens to be the same prediction,
<br />
Y can't contradict that either, because the only input it got was the
<br />
prediction from X.  There is no way that Y can know whether X's prediction
<br />
was based on a complete theory or an incomplete one.  If we assume that Y
<br />
is unable to contradict predictions based on complete theories, then he
<br />
must also be unable to contradict predictions based on incomplete ones,
<br />
if they happen to match what the complete theory would say.
<br />
<br />In other words, if Y is about to make a binary choice (calling heads
<br />
or tails), and X tells him which one he will do, X has a 50% chance of
<br />
making the same prediction that a complete theory would.  Hence at least
<br />
half the time Y would be forced to make the same call that X predicted,
<br />
and he would be unable to consistently do the opposite of X's prediction.
<br />
His absence of free will would be manifest, and no such beings could be
<br />
under the illusion that they had free will.
<br />
<br />These are all examples of how different the minds would have to be in a
<br />
universe which uses Brent's alternative.  They would not have free will,
<br />
and in fact in many circumstances they would be unable to do other than
<br />
what someone predicted of them.  This is sufficiently different from
<br />
the workings of minds as we understand them that I doubt whether it
<br />
is relevant to the issues involving decision theory that we may want
<br />
to pursue.
