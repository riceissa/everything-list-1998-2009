<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have been wondering about the possibility that all possible worlds

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist, but sequentially rather than simultaneously, under a conservative

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cosmology with assumptions as follows:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. There exists one, and only one, real, physical universe;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I don't know if this is true, false or meaningless. It fits with common 
<br />
(aristotelian) sense.
<br />
&nbsp;From a &quot;motivation&quot; point of view I cannot take the existence of the 
<br />
universe for granted
<br />
because it is such an existence, or the appearance of such an existence, 
<br />
that I would like
<br />
having an explanation for.
<br />
If we assume comp, and if 1 is true the UDA alone shows that the &quot;physical 
<br />
universe&quot;
<br />
whatever it is exactly must be &quot;little&quot; in the sense of being unable to run 
<br />
the universal
<br />
dovetailer. I call that the Delahaye move. But the filmed graph argument 
<br />
shows that this
<br />
move does not really work unless you drop out the Arithmetical Realist part 
<br />
of COMP.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2. While it is possible to simulate any subset of this universe, including 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conscious beings, with a computer program, this program must be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implemented on a physical computer, or on a virtual machine (or series of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such) which is itself implemented on a physical computer;
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, you take COMP without RA. Then your physical universe is necessarily 
<br />
little in space
<br />
and time. But then it cannot leads to your sequential many worlds.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;3. The universe has a finite age and is comprised of a finite amount of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;matter/space/energy, but it is expanding and cooling and will continue to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do so forever;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />If that cooling is enough to prevent a UD to run forever, it confirms what 
<br />
I was saying. So
<br />
you are coherent indeed. 3, or something similar follows from 1 and 2.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;4. Some single world interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Obviously, from 1 and 2 too.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My understanding is that the above assumptions, which I have deliberately 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chosen as being contrary to many of the ideas discussed on the Everything 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;List, still allow for the possibility of fantastically unlikely events, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such as the spontaneous formation of an exact and stable copy of our solar 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system from the random motion of particles in interstellar space, or from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;vacuum fluctuations posited by the Uncertainty Principle.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Then you need a *very* big unique &quot;little universe&quot;! That seems to me 
<br />
rather ad hoc (but still coherent).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let p(t) = probability that an event P will occur somewhere in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe during the next year, t years from the present. The probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that P will NOT occur at some time between the present (t=0) and (t=a+1) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is then given by the product:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[1-p(0)]*[1-p(1)]*[1-p(2)]...*[1-p(a)]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As a-&gt; infinity this becomes an infinite product, representing the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability that P will NEVER occur. It is easy to see that this infinite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;product diverges to zero in the special case where p(t) is constant for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all t; in other words, that P, however unlikely, will definitely occur at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some point in the future if the probability that it occurs during a unit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time period remains constant over time. The same conclusion applies if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;p(t) increases with increasing t: the infinite product diverges to zero, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more quickly than in the case of constant p(t).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Is that not in contradiction with the cooling? What does mean &quot;a&quot; going to 
<br />
infinity if the universe
<br />
is little. Are you positing a external finite time with an internal 
<br />
infinite time?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Things get more difficult, however, if p(t) decreases over time. A Google 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;search for &quot;infinite product&quot; brought up some very complicated expressions 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for even rather simple p(t), and it is by no means obvious (to me, anyway) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whether the product will converge or diverge.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I see. You want an infinite cooling but suspect this would not prevent 
<br />
unlikely events to occur
<br />
if the 3-time is infinite. As you say such computation can be hard, but I 
<br />
don't see anything inconsistent with such events except that it makes your 
<br />
universe enough big for a DU to proceed
<br />
and this jeopardizes your COMP hyp, even without Arithmetical Realism RA 
<br />
(giving that this UD
<br />
will be &quot;physically concrete&quot; and then UDA will go through.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, my question is, what happens to p(t) over time? I would have guessed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that as the universe expands, chemical and nuclear reactions are less 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;likely to occur, in the same way as chemical reaction rates are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proportional to the concentration the reagents. On the other hand, it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not clear to me how more exotic processes such as spontaneous appearance 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of particles out of the vacuum are affected by the expansion, which after 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all results in &quot;more vacuum&quot; - doesn't it?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />As far as I know, even without the many worlds I would think the 
<br />
probability that a (new) cosmos
<br />
appears is non null ... Cooling the expanding universe is probably not 
<br />
enough to prevent the UD,
<br />
unless you can justify why all the cosmos are little and somehow 
<br />
disconnected. You will be
<br />
obliged to justify some irreversible erasing of information, which cannot 
<br />
exist with QM.
<br />
<br />It seems to me you make a lot of ad hoc hypotheses for justifying an 
<br />
unlikely reality.
<br />
It is also hard for me to imagine comp true without RA. Actually RA is the 
<br />
only part
<br />
of comp which is hard for me to conceive being false (but that could be
<br />
a personal limitation of course).
<br />
Anyway, I am looking for an explanation of the origin of the physical laws 
<br />
so I will
<br />
not take your assumption number one. (But that is a question of goal).
<br />
<br />You seem also to forget that if there are many worlds, even just 
<br />
sequentially, there cannot be
<br />
arbitrary large in time. If they are the UD will be executed integrally and 
<br />
&quot;real&quot; physics must be
<br />
reduced to sum on computational histories (and then with occam or the 
<br />
filmed graph argument)
<br />
we don't have to posit a physical reality.
