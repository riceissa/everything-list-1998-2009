<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But our main criterion for what to believe should be

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what is true, right?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm very interested in whether the apparent tautology
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; is my misunderstanding, his transparent belief, a simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; lack of precision, or something more.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Thanks for the compliments about my writing. I meant that what we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; should believe does not necessarily have to be the same as what is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; true, but I think that unless there are special circumstances, it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ought to be the case.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree within the context you intended.  My point was that we can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be certain of truth, so we should be careful in our speech and thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not to imply that such truth is even available to us for the kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comparisons being discussed here.  We can know that some patterns of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; action work better than others, but the only &quot;truth&quot; we can assess is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always within a specific context.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think we agree. Those &quot;context&quot; are always &quot;theoretical&quot;, with a  
<br />
large sense for &quot;theory&quot;. It could be an explicit theory, like quantum  
<br />
mechanics, ... or an implicit build in belief like our instinctive  
<br />
inference that our neighborhood exists or make sense. This last is a  
<br />
&quot;theory&quot;, which according to a more explicit one (Darwin) is a many  
<br />
millenia relative (and thus contextual) construct.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Brent Meeker made a similar point: if someone is dying of a terminal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; illness, maybe it is better that he believe he has longer to live  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; than the medical evidence suggests, but that would have to be an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; example of special circumstances.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are plenty of examples of self-deception providing benefits  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the scope of the individual, and leading to increasingly effective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models of &quot;reality for the group.  Here's a recent article on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topic:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/26/science/26lying.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/26/science/26lying.html</a>? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pagewanted=print
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks for this interesting reference. In the context of the theory I  
<br />
suggest, it is still an open problem if life itself is a &quot;logical  
<br />
descendant&quot; of a &quot;lie&quot;. Actually, although there are evidences to the  
<br />
contrary, even &quot;appearance of the physical universe&quot; could be a  
<br />
self-deception. This is a stronger statement than the one I am used to  
<br />
say, which is that the &quot;primitive&quot; character of the physical laws are  
<br />
self-deception (but this is only a consequence of taking the  
<br />
computationalist hypothesis seriously enough and is strictly speaking  
<br />
out of the present topic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; If he had said something like &quot;our main criterion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; for what to believe should be what works, what seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to work, what passes the tests of time, etc.&quot; or had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; made a direct reference to Occam's Razor, I would be comfortable  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; knowing that we're thinking alike on this point.  But I've seen this  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; stumbling block arise so many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; times and so many places that I'm very curious to learn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; something of its source.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The question of what is the truth is a separate one, but one  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; criterion I would add to those you mention above is that it should  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; come from someone able to put aside his own biases and wishes where  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; these might influence his assessment of the evidence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree, but would point out that by definition, one can not actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set aside one's one biases because to do so would require an objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view of oneself.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But two observers can agree on some common context, so that some  
<br />
objective view of oneself can be done (although probably not recognize  
<br />
as such ...). So a second observer can, in some situation helps a first  
<br />
one to be less biased.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rather, one can be aware that such biases exist in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general, and implement increasingly effective principles (e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific method) to minimize them.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree with this.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; We might never be certain of the truth, so our beliefs should  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; always &gt; &gt; be tentative, but that doesn't mean we should believe  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whatever we &gt; &gt; fancy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Here it's a smaller point, and I agree with the main thrust of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the &gt; statement, but it leaves a door open for the possibility that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we might &gt; actually be justifiably certain of the truth in *some*  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; case, and I'm &gt; wonder where that open door is intended to lead.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I said &quot;might&quot; because there is one case where I am certain of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; truth, which is that I am having the present experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Although we all share the illusion of a direct and immediate sense of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, on what basis can you claim that it actually is real?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Because we cannot doubt it. It is the real message, imo, of Descartes  
<br />
&quot;diagonal argument&quot;: it is the fixed point of doubt. If we decide to  
<br />
doubt everything, we will find ourselves, at some stage, doubting we  
<br />
doubt of everything. The same for relativization: we cannot relativize  
<br />
everything without an absolute base on which that relativization is  
<br />
effective. If you want (like David and George) consciousness is our  
<br />
criteria of &quot;absolute (but not 3-communicable) truth&quot;. I don't think we  
<br />
can genuinely doubt we are conscious, although we can doubt on any  
<br />
content of that consciousness, but that is different.
<br />
We can doubt having been conscious in some past, but we cannot doubt  
<br />
being conscious here and now, whatever that means.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Further, how can you claim certainty of the &quot;truth&quot; of subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience when there is so much experimental and clinical evidence  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-reported experience consists largely of distortions, gaps, time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delays and time out of sequence, fabrications and confabulations?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The &quot;truth&quot; here bears on the existence of the experience, and has  
<br />
nothing to do with anything which could be reported by the experiencer.  
<br />
If I a complain about some pain, I would take a doctor has incompetent,  
<br />
mad or inhuman, if after having examine me, he tells me: &quot;you have no  
<br />
pain&quot;. Situation like that did occur with the first know case of pain  
<br />
in phantom limb.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I realize that people can acknowledge all that I've just said, but  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim the validity of their internal experience to be privileged on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis that only they can judge, but then how can they legitimately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contradict themselves a moment later about factual matters, e.g. when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the drugs wear off, the probe is removed from their brain, the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tumor is removed, the mob has dispersed, the hypnotist is finished, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fight is over, the adrenaline rush has subsided, the pain has stopped,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the oxytocin flush has declined... What kind of &quot;truth&quot; could this be?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course the subjective self is the only one able to report on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective experience, but how can it *justifiably* claim to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infallible?
</em><br />
<br />Ah but I agree with you. The subject cannot *justifiably* claim to be  
<br />
infallible. Please this has nothing to do with the fact that he is  
<br />
&quot;infallible&quot;. He cannot claim it in a justifiable way of course. Any  
<br />
doll, zombie, could claim the same thing. To come back on the example  
<br />
above, the doctor may be right: I did not have pain (t'was just a trick  
<br />
for not going at school for example). So I cannot &quot;justify&quot; the  
<br />
infallibility of my report of experience, nor can the doctor justify  
<br />
the absence of such experiences, but this is different from saying that  
<br />
conscious experience are infallible as such. (And that is why I  
<br />
appreciate Theaetetus first approximate definition of  
<br />
knowledge---albeit debatable as Russell Standish said once---which  
<br />
consists in defining &quot;to know p&quot; as to &quot;believe p, when p&quot;). For  
<br />
example Machine X knows the earth is flat in case the machine X  
<br />
believes (asserts (say)) that the earth is flat, in case the earth is  
<br />
flat.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be certain of the truth of something implies being able to see it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objectively, right? Or does it equally imply no questions asked?
</em><br />
<br />Objectivity leads to doubt (and thus cartesian science). Certainty is  
<br />
either 100% private and subjective, or a symptom of unnavowable doubt,  
<br />
or of madness. Well, in some probabilistic context it can have the  
<br />
weaker meaning of &quot;probability one&quot;, but even there it can be shown  
<br />
that probability one does not always entail &quot;truth&quot;. This happens with  
<br />
lobian machine where the machine can believe that some proposition is  
<br />
true in all possible worlds, and that there is a least one possible  
<br />
world, and then that proposition can still be false (and the machine  
<br />
remains consistent, but get unsound).
