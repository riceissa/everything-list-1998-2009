<br />
I was stunned to realise the other day that our memory is  
<br />
spacialised. This seems important, particularly in the field of  
<br />
education and secondary school teaching, the area where I work. It  
<br />
appears our brain only remembers something because it takes a  
<br />
snapshot of the place we were physically looking at when we  
<br />
encountered whatever. If we weren't looking consciously at some thing  
<br />
we are much less likely to have a memory imprint.
<br />
<br />You are sitting reading and realise that you are hungry. A biscuit  
<br />
appears increasingly necessary. You get up eventually and go to the  
<br />
kitchen but by the time you arrive there, you have forgotten what you  
<br />
got up to do. You are probably thinking deeply about what you have  
<br />
been reading.
<br />
<br />The cure? Walk back to the place where you had the thought (assuming  
<br />
of course you can at least remember where you were when you had the  
<br />
thought) and the thought pops back into your head. Try it.
<br />
<br />Try this fascinating experiment:
<br />
<br />get a roomful of people (a school classroom full of kids is great for  
<br />
this) and run this algorithm:
<br />
<br />inform them that they are going to be given a list of words to  
<br />
remember. The words will be spoken once only so they are going to  
<br />
have to concentrate like crazy to be in a position to spruke the full  
<br />
list at the end. Part of this involves them not taking their eyes off  
<br />
you for one second.  Then - without telling them this was going to  
<br />
happen - stand in a different part of the room as you slowly deliver  
<br />
each word. Make use of as many different places as there are words on  
<br />
the list, say a maximum of ten words.
<br />
<br />Then, say &quot;It's a race to see who can write out the list correctly  
<br />
first&quot;. You now stand stock still.
<br />
<br />Every single head in the room will be seen turning this way and that  
<br />
in a frenzy as each brain looks at the place where it knows a  
<br />
&quot;snapshot&quot; is stored spatially. In effect they are now consciously  
<br />
looking at nothing much because you are standing still. The point  
<br />
appears to be that it seems to be the physical act of recalling as  
<br />
much data about the *environment* that forms part of the snapshot as  
<br />
the actual datum to be recalled.
<br />
<br />Is memory something you can wind in reverse, like Hermoine does with  
<br />
her watch in Harry Potter?
<br />
<br />Anyone like to comment on this effect?

<br />
Creativity usually means finding a way of being right by being wrong  
<br />
somehow. Being right
<br />
by being right is not a creative act. It is mannerist at best,  
<br />
plagiarism at worst. - Kim Jones
