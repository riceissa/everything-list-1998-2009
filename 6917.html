I remembered Wei Dai posting on this topic in the early days of this
<br />
list, and indeed some of his postings influenced my &quot;Why Occam's
<br />
Razor&quot; paper. However, I do not recall his suggestions as being as
<br />
detailed as what you describe here. Do you have a reference to where
<br />
this might be written up? I'm also intrigued by the possibility of
<br />
demonstrating that transhumanist observer moments would have
<br />
substantially less measure than human observer moments. Such a result
<br />
would be a transhumanist counter to the Doomsday argument of course.
<br />
<br />Cheers

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Years ago Wei Dai on this list suggested a better approach.  He proposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a formula for determining how much of a universe's measure contributes to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an OM that it instantiates.  It is very specific and also illustrates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some problems in the rather loose discussion so far.  For example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what does it really mean to instantiate an OM?  How would we know if a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe is really instantiating a particular OM?  Aren't there fuzzy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cases where a universe is only &quot;sort of&quot; instantiating one?  What about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the longstanding problem that you can look at the atomic vibrations in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a crystal, select a subset of them to pay attention to, and have that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pattern match the pattern of any given OM?  Does this mean that every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; crystal instantiates every OM?  (Hans Moravec sometimes seems to say yes!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To apply Wei's method, first we need to get serious about what is an OM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We need a formal model and description of a particular OM.  Consider, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, someone's brain when he is having a particular experience.  He is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eating chocolate ice cream while listening to Beethoven's 5th symphony,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on his 30th birthday.  Imagine that we could scan his brain with advanced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technology and record his neural activity.  Imagine further that with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aid of an advanced brain model we are able to prune out the unnecessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information and distill this to the essence of the experience.  We come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up with a pattern that represents that observer moment.  Any system which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiates that pattern genuinely creates an experience of that observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment.  This pattern is something that can be specified, recorded and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written down in some form.  It probably involves a huge volume of data.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, now that we have a handle on what a particular OM is, we can more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasonably ask whether a universe instantiates it.  It comes down to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether it produces and contains that particular pattern.  But this may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not be such an easy question.  It could be that the &quot;raw&quot; output format of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a universe program does not lend itself to seeing larger scale patterns.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, in our own universe, the raw output would probably be at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the level of the Planck scale, far, far smaller than an atomic nucleus.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At that level, even a single brain neuron would be the size of a galaxy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And the time for enough neural firings to occur to make up a noticeable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious experience would be like the entire age of the universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It will take considerable interpretation of the raw output of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe's program to detect the faint traces of an observer moment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And as noted above, an over-aggressive attempt to hunt out observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moments will find false positives, random patterns which, if we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; selective enough, happen to match what we are looking for.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wei proposed to solve both of these problems by introducing an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation program.  It would be take as its input, the output of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe-creation program.  It would then output the observer moment in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever formal specification format we had decided on (the exact format
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will not be significant).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So how would this program work, in the case of our universe?  It would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have encoded in it the location in space and time of the brain which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was experiencing the OM.  It would know the size of the brain and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spatial distribution of its neurons.  And it would know the faint traces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and changes at the Planck scale that would correspond to neural firings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or pauses.  Based on this information, which is encoded into the program,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it would run and output the results.  And that output would then match
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the formal encoding of the OM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, Wei applies the same kind of reasoning that we do for the measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the Schmidhuber ensemble itself.  He proposes that the size of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation program should determine how much of the universe's measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contributes to the OM.  If the interpretation program is relatively small,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is evidence that the universe is making a strong contribution to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the OM.  But if the interpretation program is huge, then we would say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that little of the universe's measure should go into the OM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the most extreme case, the interpretation program could just encode the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OM within itself, ignore the universe state and output that data pattern.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In effect that is what would have to be done in order to find an OM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within a crystal as described above.  You'd have to have the whole OM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state in the program since the crystal doesn't actually have any real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship to the OM.  But that would be an enormous interpretation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program, which would deliver only a trivial measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For a universe like our own, the hope and expectation is that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation program will be relatively small.  Such a program takes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the entire universe as input and outputs a particular OM.  I did some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; back of the envelope calculations and you will probably be amazed that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I estimate that such a program could be less than 1000 bits in size.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (This is assuming the universe is roughly as big as what is visible, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neglecting the MWI.)  Compared to the information in an OM, which I can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even guess but will surely be at least gigabytes, this is insignificant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore we do have strong grounds to say that the universe which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appears real is in fact making a major contribution to our OMs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be specific, Wei's idea was to count the measure of a universe's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contribution to an OM as 1/2^(n+m), where n is the size of the program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that creates the universe, and m is the size of the interpretation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program that reads the output of the first program, and outputs the OM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specification from that.  In effect, you can think of the two programs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; together as a single program which outputs the formal spec of the OM,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and ask what are the shortest ways to do that.  In this way you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually calculate the measure of an OM directly without even looking at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the intermediate step of calculating a universe.  But I prefer thinking of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the two step method as it gives us a handle on such concepts as whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are living in the Matrix or as a brain in a vat.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Overall I think this is a very attractive formulation.  It's quantitative,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it gives the intuitively right answer for many cases.  The counting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program contributes effectively no measure, because the only way we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find an OM is by encoding the whole thing in the interpretation program.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And as another example, if there are multiple OMs instantiated by a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular universe, that will allow the interpretation program to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; smaller because less information is needed to localize an OM.  It also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implies that small universes will devote more of their measure to OMs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they instantiate than large ones, which basically makes sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are a few unintuitive consequences, though, such as that large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiations of OMs will have more measure than small ones, and likewise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slow ones will have more measure than fast ones.  This is because in each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case the interpretation program can be smaller if it is easier to find the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OM in the vastness of a universe, and the slower and bigger an OM is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; easier it is to find.  I am inclined to tentatively accept these results.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It does imply that the extreme future vision of some transhumanists,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to upload themselves to super-fast, super-small computers, may greatly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reduce their measure, which would mean that it would be like taking a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; large chance of dying.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is one big problem with the approach, though, which I have not yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solved.  I wrote above that a very short program could localize a given OM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within our universe.  It only takes ~300 bits to locate a brain (i.e. a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain-sized piece of space)!  However this neglects the MWI.  If we take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as our universe-model a world governed by the MWI, it is exponentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; larger than what we see as the visible universe.  Every decoherence-time,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe splits.  That's like picoseconds, or nanoseconds at best.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The number of splittings since the universe was created is vast, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the size of the universe is like 2 (or more!) to that power.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Providing the information to localize a particular OM within the vastness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a universe governed by the MWI appears to be truly intractable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Granted, we don't necessarily have to narrow it down to an exact branch,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but unless there are tremendous amounts of de facto convergent evolution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after splits, it seems to me that the percentage of quantum space-time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occupied by a given OM is far smaller than the 1/2^1000 I would estimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a non-MWI universe.  It's more like 1/2^2^100.  At that rate the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation program to find an OM would be much *bigger* than the one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that just hard-codes the OM itself.  In short, it would appear that an MWI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe cannot contribute significant measure to an OM, under this model.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's a serious problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So there are a couple of possible solutions to this problem.  One is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reject the MWI on these grounds.  That's not too attractive; this line of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument is awfully speculative for such a conclusion.  Also, creating a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program for a non-MWI universe requires a random number generator, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is an ugly kludge and implies that quantum randomness is algorithmic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather than true, a bizarre result.  A more hopeful possibility is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there will turn out to be structure in the MWI phase space that will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allow us to localize OM's much more easily than the brute force method
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I assumed above.  I have only the barest speculations about how that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might work, to which I need to give more thought.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But even with this problem, I think the overall formulation is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; best I have seen in terms of grappling with the reality of a multiverse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and addressing the issue of where we as observers fit into the greater
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure.  It provides a quantitative and approximable measure which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allows us to calculate, in principle, how much of our reality is as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appears and how much is an illusion.  It answers questions like whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copies contribute to measure.  And it provides some interesting and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surprising predictions about how various changes to the substrate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of intelligence (uploading to computers, etc.) may change measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In general I think Wei Dai's approach is the best foundation for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding the place of observers within the multiverse.
