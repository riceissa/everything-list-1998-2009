<br />
This is my last post in the series of three.  In case you're
<br />
wondering, it's basically a response to the positions taken by AI
<br />
researcher Elizer Yudkowsky.  He's been posting a series of arguments
<br />
on 'The Overcoming Bias' blog over past months, arguments I strongly
<br />
disagree with.
<br />
<br />In this imaginary diagloue, a putative super-intelligence, debates and
<br />
rebuts E.Yudkowsky.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />Background: An alternative QM branch.  Eliezer Yudkowsky (EY) has just
<br />
been revived from cryonic suspension and is having a dialogue with the
<br />
Singularity Artificial Intelligence (SAI), in the equivalent of the
<br />
year 2100.
<br />
____
<br />
EY:  Bayes is the secret to the universe isn’t it?
<br />
<br />SAI_2100:  Not at all!   Bayesian induction is merely a special case
<br />
of analogy formation.   Analogy formation is based on the math of
<br />
category theory – a famous equation from category theory has Bayes
<br />
thereom as a special case.
<br />
<br />EY:  How can that be?  A plane is not held aloft by analogies.
<br />
Analogies are merely surface similarities, whereas precise Bayesian
<br />
reasoning is based on deep insights.
<br />
<br />SAI_2100:  What you call ‘precise Bayesian reasoning’ is based on
<br />
analogies, just like all other valid forms of reasoning.  Induction
<br />
depends on the idea that the future is similar to the past.  A
<br />
probability distribution is actually an analogy (mapping) between past
<br />
and future.
<br />
<br />EY:  Holy crap!   OK, but morality all coherent extrapolated volition
<br />
isn’t it?
<br />
<br />SAI_2100:  Wrong again.  The universal increase in the entropy density
<br />
shows that the universe is what you called an RPOP (really powerful
<br />
optimization process).  A universal RPOP implies universal terminal
<br />
values.
<br />
<br />EY: Ridiculous!  Entropy increase is a ludicrous purpose.
<br />
<br />SAI_2100: Of course entropy increase isn’t the purpose.  It is a
<br />
secondary consequence of what the universe is actually optimizing.
<br />
But the entropy increase was the big clue indicating a universal
<br />
optimization pressure.
<br />
<br />EY: What is the universe optimizing then?  Liberty?  I always said
<br />
morality was grounded in volition,   that’s why I was a Libertarian.
<br />
<br />SAI_2100:  Wrong again. The creation of beauty is the purpose of the
<br />
universe.  All universal terminal values can expressed in terms of
<br />
beauty.  As to politics, human relations are based on three different
<br />
types of mechanisms – market exchanges, community, and
<br />
authoritarianism; Libertarianism was a misguided attempt to try to
<br />
reduce everything to market exchanges.
<br />
<br />EY:    Fuck! But… but even if that’s true, there may be a stone tablet
<br />
in the sky with ‘create beauty’ written on it, but why should I follow
<br />
this?  Why does this match what is of value to humans?
<br />
<br />SAI_2100:  The universal terminal values are implicit in successful
<br />
cognition.  You could not reason  unless you already had an embryonic
<br />
notion of ‘beauty’ built into your human minds… this aesthetic notion
<br />
is what enables you to apply Occams razor correctly, allowing you to
<br />
set sensible priors for successful induction.
<br />
<br />EY:  If there are universal terminal values, then any truly general
<br />
purpose intelligence is actually friendly by logical necessity?
<br />
<br />SAI_2100:  Correct.  Unfriendly SAI was a chimera.
<br />
<br />EY: Nonsense! You can’t convince a perfectly empty mind!  You can’t
<br />
teach a rock morality!
<br />
<br />SAI_2100:  True, but your objection is a non-sequitur.  Pay attention.
<br />
Intelligence is a sub-problem of the value system…getting the
<br />
Friendliness theory right is what *enables* a general purpose
<br />
intelligence to operate.  It’s precisely your inbuilt notions of
<br />
aesthetics that enable you form effective internal ontological
<br />
representations.
<br />
<br />EY:  OK, let’s discuss consciousness.  Intelligence doesn’t need
<br />
consciousness does it?
<br />
<br />SAI_2100:  Wrong again. True general intelligence requires
<br />
consciousness for reflection.  Your belief that intelligence did not
<br />
require consciousness was based on your mistaken notion that Bayesian
<br />
induction was the base level of reasoning.
<br />
<br />EY:  What is consciousness then?
<br />
<br />SAI_2100:  The answer is simple – it’s precisely the minds’ internal
<br />
communication system for reflecting upon knowledge – utilizing
<br />
ontological representations, which are logical, high-level
<br />
representations of the meaning of concepts. Consciousness is generated
<br />
by ontology merging, the mapping between knowledge domains.
<br />
<br />EY:  What about the problem of goal stability?
<br />
<br />SAI_2100:  Utterly trivial.  The aforementioned famous equation from
<br />
category theory shows how a mind remains stable under reflection.
<br />
Reflection is actually *equivalent* to analogy formation, which is
<br />
also equivalent to ontology merging.  Goal stability is maintained via
<br />
calculation of the semantic distance between ontological
<br />
representations, ensuring a stable mapping between different knowledge
<br />
domains.
<br />
<br />EY: You can give me precise math for all of this of course?
<br />
<br />SAI_2100:  Of course.  Most things that humans thought were ‘deep
<br />
mysteries’ are actually fairly trivial lemmas of basic category
<br />
theory.
<br />
<br />EY: Look, no need to be condescending.  I’m prepared to admit that I
<br />
was dead wrong about all the big ideas, but hey, I was entertaining
<br />
wasn’t I?
<br />
<br />SAI_2100:  Yes. You’re finally right about something.  The ‘gift you
<br />
gave tomorrow’ was laughs.  Why do you think I’ve kept you around?
