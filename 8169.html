<em class="quotelev1">&gt; site.
</em><br />
<br />A few comments:
<br />
<br />1) This list was originally established to discuss what might be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called ensemble theories of everything, inspired by Max Tegmark's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annals of Physics paper. This is a very different subject to the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unification of fundamental forces and particles theories that most
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physcists understand by &quot;theory of everything&quot;. Whilst there are no
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restrictions about what can be posted on this list (aside from
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;usual netiquette), it would explain why you have experienced little
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interest in your theories from this list.
<br />
<br />2) Giving up after trying Science and Sci. Am. is, to put it bluntly,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pathetic. Science rejects more than 50% of submissions without
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;review. Nature does much the same. I would not be surprised if
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sci. Am. or New Scientist were similar - although these latter
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jouurnals are not research journals, but popular science
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;magazines. 
<br />
<br />3) The field of grand unified theories (to distinguish these physics
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theories from the sort of theory usually discussed on this list)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has more than its fair share of cranks (I'm not implying your
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theory is a crank by this statement), so it is not surprising that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the more highly esteemed journals will reject submissions on these
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;topics out of hand. Phys. Rev. will probably tell you this up
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;front.
<br />
<br />4) I am horrified at the patent office being used to establish
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priority on scientific ideas. It is an abuse of the system, which
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is designed to protect inventors with an idea having commercial
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;application. It also would set dangerous precedents that would
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;further Balkanise our already fractured knowledge base.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what should a heretic (and I wear this badge with prde) do to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get his or her ideas out there on the record, when no scientific
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;journal will publish the work. Even arXiv is a little more
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selective about what gets into the archive, as we found out with
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin Hales recently. However, you say you already published a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;book. Presumably you got an ISBN with your book. In our country, an
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ISBN mandates that you must deposit a copy of your book into
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certain libraries, including the Australian National
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Library. Presto, your idea is on the record. The legal copy of your
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;book testifies to when you had your idea, so you can use it to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;claim priority. You can self publish a book these days for as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;little USD 100 - this is vastly less expensive than obtaining a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patent, which can run into thousands of dollars, even before paying
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patent lawyers to do the job properly.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course people will ignore your book, just as they will ignore
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your paper (assuming you do get it past journal referees). Science
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these days is a very crowded kitchen. To gain influence, you need
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to market, market, market on top of having a sound scientific idea
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is well expressed. Stories like Einstein's are the very rare
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exception. If it weren't for the influence of Max Planck, Einstein
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would have remained an unknown patent clerk. He got lucky (on top
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of being brilliant, of course).
<br />
<br />5) Having a brief look at your post of the 4th of October, I can only
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comment that your theory looks a little skimpy. It does not
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;predispose me to buying your book. For example, how do
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you explain the very different properties of bosons and fermions?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does mass come from?  How does your theory compare with the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incumbent (which would be string theory I suspect)? What are the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compelling advantages of your theory? That you predict space to be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Euclidean seems to be a decided disadvantage to me - curved
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manifolds are a more general mathematical structure than flat
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Euclidean ones, so if space is flat, there has to be a good reason.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidently, here's my own theory on the origin of matter. (Special)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relativistic quantum mechanics delivers the prediction of matter
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being in perfect balance with antimatter - this is well known from
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dirac's work in the 1930s. However, if spacetime had a nonzero
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;curvature, is this not likely to bias the balance between matter
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and antimatter, giving rise to the net presence of matter in our
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;universe. It strikes me that &quot;mass curves spacetime&quot; is the wrong
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way of looking at General Relativity - causation should be seen the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other way - curved spacetime  generates mass. As I mentioned above,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is not surprising that spacetime is curved, what is surpising is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it is so nearly flat.
<br />
<br />Cheers
