<br />
OK, you said All comments welcome.  You asked for it.
<br />
<br />First, there's a lot to read here, so I assumed you were presenting the 
<br />
basic gist of your ideas in the first few paragraphs, and so I have a 
<br />
few comments about those paragraphs.
<br />
<br />I commend you for trying to explain values as part of the framework.  
<br />
I've whinced before when I've read some thought experiments on this 
<br />
list that depended on accepting the existence of such ideas as good and 
<br />
bad.  I believe in the existence of good and bad, but one needs to 
<br />
support his/her belief in good and bad and not take them as a given.
<br />
<br />It seems that your limitation of reality to meaningful existence is 
<br />
actually rejecting Mathematical Platonism.  Why is consciousness 
<br />
required to make a mathematical truth real?  I thought that you are 
<br />
trying to deal with all of existence, not just meaningful existence, 
<br />
since your theory tries to explain &quot;how the most fundamental properties 
<br />
of existence facts fit together into a unified metaphysical framework.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;And yet here you limit existence to what we can perceive.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The core assumption is that existence without perception is 
</em><br />
meaningless. Reality requires not only raw data but something to 
<br />
*interpret* that data, to supply meaning to it. This can only be done 
<br />
by consciousness of *some* kind. If something was hypothesized to exist 
<br />
that could in no way directly or indirectly affect the conscious 
<br />
perceptions of *any* possible observer, then in what sense could it be 
<br />
said to exist at all? Even if it could be successfully argued that it 
<br />
did have some kind of abstract philosophical existence, it could never 
<br />
have any possible value to sentient minds. For the purposes of 
<br />
understanding general intelligence, it suffices to define that which 
<br />
exists as that which could directly or indirectly ( i.e. in principle) 
<br />
affect the perceptions of *some* possible conscious observer.
<br />
<br />So you've eliminated the whole realm of &quot;unperceived reality&quot; in the 
<br />
superset of existence.  You've eliminated the motivation to bring 
<br />
unperceived reality into the realm of perceived reality, since the 
<br />
former does not exist.
<br />
<br />Reading these metaphysical theories doesn't really impress me when I 
<br />
realize that these theories really don't have anything new in them that 
<br />
the ancient Greeks (for instance) didn't have.
<br />
<br />Of course the big gap in all of these theories, which I believe will 
<br />
never be filled, is the integration of consciousness (in general) into 
<br />
physics.  Even if we integrate human consciousness into it (which I 
<br />
don't think is going to happen), that doesn't cover the whole gammit of 
<br />
what consciousness is in the whole universe.  Who knows, there's so 
<br />
much we don't know about stars (and they are so big) that perhaps some 
<br />
stars have consciousness of some kind that is outside of the definition 
<br />
of how we would define it, but may be even more &quot;enlightened&quot; about the 
<br />
universe, and yet we may never know.
<br />
