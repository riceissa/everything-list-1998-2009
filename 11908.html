Stathis,
<br />
I am answering all the mail in time order. I can see below you are making
<br />
some progress! This is cool.
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So, I have my zombie scientist and my human scientist and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I ask them to do science on exquisite novelty. What happens?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The novelty is invisible to the zombie, who has the internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; life of a dreamless sleep. The reason it is invisible is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; because there is no phenomenal consciousness. The zombie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; has only sensory data to use to do science. There are an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; infinite number of ways that same sensory data could arrive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; from an infinity of external natural world situtations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The sensory data is ambiguous - it's all the same - action
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; potential pulse trains traveling from sensors to brain.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Stathis:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; All I have to work on is sensory data also.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No you don't! You have an entire separate set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; perceptual/experiential fields constructed from sensory feeds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The fact of this is proven - think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of hallucination. When the senory data gets overidden
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; by the internal imagery (schizophrenia). Sensing is NOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; our perceptions. It is these latter phenomenal fields
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that you  consciously work from as a scientist. Not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sensory feeds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This seems to be a recurring misunderstanding or something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; people seem to be struggling with. It feels like its coming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from your senses but it's all generated inside your head.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, I'll revise my claim: all I have to work with is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceptions which I assume are coming from sense data which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I assume is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coming from the real world impinging on my sense organs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The same is true of a machine which receives environmental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; input and processes it. At the processing stage, this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the equivalent of perception. The processor assumes that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the information it is processing originates from sensors which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are responding to real world stimuli, but it has no way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowing if the data actually arose from spontaneous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or externally induced activity at any point from the sensors,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transducers, conductors, or components of the processor itself:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether they are hallucinations, in fact. There might be some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clue that it is not a legitimate sensory feed, but if the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; halllucination is perfect it is by definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible to detect.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />By George, you're getting it!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Whatever 'reality' is, it is regular/persistent,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; repeatable/stable enough to do science on it via
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; our phenomenality and come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; up with laws that seem to characterise how it will appear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to us in our phenomenality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You could say: my perceptions are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regular/persistent/repeatable/stable enough to assume an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external reality generating them and to do science on. And if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a machine's central processor's perceptions are similarly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regular/persistent/, repeatable/stable, it could also do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science on them. The point is, neither I nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the machine has any magical knowledge of an external world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All we have is regularities in perceptions, which we assume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be originating from the external world because that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a good model which stands up no matter what we throw
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at it.
</em><br />
<br />Oops. Maybe I spoke too soon! OK.
<br />
Consider... &quot;...stable enough to assume an external reality..&quot;.
<br />
<br />You are a zombie. What is it about sensory data that suggests an external
<br />
world? The science you can do is the science of zombie sense data, not an
<br />
external world. Your hypotheses about an external world would be treated
<br />
as wild metaphysics by your zombie friends (none of which you cen ever be
<br />
aware of, for they are in this external world..., so there's another
<br />
problem :-) Very tricky stuff, this.
<br />
<br />The only science you can do is &quot;I hypohesise that when I activate this
<br />
nerve, that sense nerve and this one do &lt;this&gt;&quot; You then publish in nature
<br />
and collect your prize. (Except the external world this assumes is not
<br />
there, from your perspective... life is grim for the zombie)
<br />
<br />If I am to do more I must have a 'learning rule'. Who tells me the
<br />
learning rule? This is a rule of interpretation. That requires context.
<br />
Where does the context come from? There is none. That is the situation of
<br />
the zombie.
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ..but..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The sense data is separate and exquisitely ambiguous and we do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not look for sense data to verify scientific observations!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We look for perceptual/phenomenal data. Experiences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Maybe this is yet another terminological issue. Sensing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is not perception.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the perception is less ambiguous that the sense data,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is a false certainty.
</em><br />
<br />Less ambiguous means more information content. More discrimination. The
<br />
brain accesses the external world directly, not only via sensing. A
<br />
mystery of non-local access = &quot;hard problem&quot;  = we don't know everything.
<br />
We have to admit to this ignorance and accept that we don't know something
<br />
fundamental about the universe. BTW this means no magic, no ESP, no
<br />
&quot;dualism&quot; - just basic physics an explanatory mechanism that is right in
<br />
front of us that our 'received view' finds invisible.
<br />
<br />It means that the rules of the appearance generation system
<br />
(phenomenality) are NOT the rules we generate using it (which is what we
<br />
traditionally use to do science). It doesn't mean the rules involved are
<br />
inaccessable. Or that the traditional rules of appearances are wrong. It
<br />
just means there are 2 sets of rules, not just one - and that they must
<br />
intimately co-exist. The new set of rules has not even been started yet.
<br />
Again I stress... no magic, no ESP, no dualism... only elimination of a
<br />
pervasive assumption: that the rules of the appearance generation system
<br />
(phenomenality generation) are the rules (scientific laws of appearance
<br />
expectation) constructed using it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Any machine which looks for regularities in sensory feeds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; does the same thing. Are you saying that such a machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; could not find the regularities or that if it did find the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; regularities it would thereby be conscious?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am saying the machine can find regularity in the sensory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; feeds - easily. That is does so does not mean it is conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It does not mean it has access to the external matural world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ..and that is not what WE do....we find regularity in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; perceptual fields.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Looking for regularity in sensory data is totally different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; process fro looking for regularity in a perceptual field.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Multiple sensory feeds can lead to the same perceptual field.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Multiple perceptual fields can arise out of the same sensory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; feeds. No matter how weird it sounds our brains can map
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sensory fields to the world outside...The sensory data is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intrinsically ambiguous and not about the external world,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but the world at the location of the transduction that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; created the sensory measurent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And an indirect transduction at that (a retinal cone protein
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; isomerisation by a red photon is not a 'red photon experience'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it is a protein-isomerisation experience  - ie no experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; at all!)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I had no idea people were so confused about the distinction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; between sensing and perception. I hope I am helping.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's an important distinction, but I think it is more complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the dichotomy sensing/perception suggests. There are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiple stages from the interface between the environment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the sensory organ and the ultimate perception,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and some processing of the signal occurs at each stage:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nerve ganglia, the thalamus, various cortical levels.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What we normally call &quot;consciousness&quot; seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to occur at the highest level of processing, but that may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just be because that highest level is the dictator with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ultimate control over, for example, what my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hands are typing at the moment. Phenomena such as blindsight
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the appearance of consciousness in other animals with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less complex brains at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; raise the possibility that some sort of consciousness/perception
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may be ocuuring at lower levels of processing in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nervous system, maybe all the way down to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ganglia. Of course, ganglia don't come up with scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories, but this may not be because they are unable to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceive but simply because they lack sufficient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processing power. Dogs don't come up with scientific theories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either, and most people think that is because dogs are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; smart enough rather than because they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are not conscious. Similarly, our current machines may be able
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to &quot;perceive&quot; at a basic level, but they aren't smart enough to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; come up with scientific theories based on their perceptions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />All good stuff. In a very real way all behaviour is an experiment to test
<br />
a hypothesis of an expectation of appearances in a phenomenal scene. The
<br />
scientific act is very nearly hardwired into our systems. We have added a
<br />
whole bunch of procedural matters to make formal science possible and we
<br />
create communicable abstractions of expected appearances.
<br />
<br />The empirical evidence is that certain emotional phenomenal scenes
<br />
(related to homeostasis) and probably smell/taste are generated by small
<br />
cohorts in the basal regions. Situational emotions in the amygdala. Other
<br />
more complex phenomenal scenes are localised to collections of whole
<br />
cortical regions.
<br />
<br />There is no reason why animals should not have phenomenal scenes. Indeed I
<br />
predict bats have a primitive monochronme visual scene based on sonic
<br />
sensing. What animals don't have is the non-phenomenal capacity to
<br />
abstract and remember like us. Their behaviour could be thought of as
<br />
'proto-science' in the sense I describe above.
<br />
<br />The main thing is that the creation of a phenomenal scene is an optional
<br />
subset of the whole package enabling intelligence. Knowledge is stored
<br />
devoid of phenomenal content until recall and usage. My knowledge of my
<br />
car's number plate was present all though the typing of this email, but
<br />
only...OFH964...now has it entered a phenomenal scene, first in my
<br />
language/visual imagination on recall, then reported out through my
<br />
fingers and back in my visual scene.
<br />
<br />I don't think you're anywhere near the zombie you claim to be! :-)
<br />
<br />Methinks I better get some exercise! Gonna go ride my bike for a while.
<br />
<br />cheers
