2009/8/28 Flammarion &lt;peterdjones.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. It seems reasonable that relations must have relata. However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relata
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need not have a rich set of properties. You could build a physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a single type of particle and various relations.
</em><br />
<br />What we're trying to get to here, remember, is *many* intrinsically
<br />
differentiable forms of instantiation.  Hence for what you say to meet
<br />
the case (which I would certainly not reject out of hand), any unique
<br />
intrinsic nature you envisage for the particle would need to be
<br />
capable of emergence, purely in virtue of combination in terms of its
<br />
various relations, into many such intrinsically differentiable forms.
<br />
Does that seem feasible on this basis?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Someone's perceptual data are already encoded relationally in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of their brain, so if qualia are intrinisc properties of relata,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something needs to arrange
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they encode the same information, so some novel laws ar required
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in addition to novel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties,
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure if I follow you.  Nothing is 'already' encoded.  As I
<br />
said to Brent, we mustn't be misled into supposing that the state of
<br />
affairs to which we refer literally 'possesses properties'.  As I see
<br />
it, the 'perceptual data' consist in;
<br />
<br />1) An instantiation or substitution level which is self-referentially
<br />
organised in terms of intrinsic differentiables in intrinsic relation.
<br />
&nbsp;This is the qualitative 'causal level' and as such exists independent
<br />
of any extrinsic characterisation.  It makes no reference outside of
<br />
itself.
<br />
2) Second-order 'extrinsic' accounts abstracted from and referring to
<br />
level (1).  These accounts are themselves also instantiated at level
<br />
(1).
<br />
<br />In terms of the above, the 'laws' are simply whatever regularities are
<br />
abstractable at the level of the extrinsic account (2).  The
<br />
instantiation level is not in itself abstractable, but can be
<br />
nonetheless be referred to ostensively via the exchange of relational
<br />
data.  As Chalmers implies, the 'subtle causal effect'(!) of the
<br />
instantiation is to provide a substrate of realisation without which
<br />
the extrinsic account lacks any referent.  Consequently any
<br />
characterisation of level (2) accounts as independently 'causally
<br />
closed' fundamentally mistakes the direction of inference.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3,. The Grain problem
</em><br />
<br />I really can't fathom why anybody thinks that there is a grain
<br />
problem.  ISTM that this is taking full-scale reflective consciousness
<br />
altogether too much for granted.  One might as well complain that
<br />
there should be a grain problem with respect to matter - after all,
<br />
why isn't the brain just explicable at the level of molecules, or
<br />
atoms.  I think, to use Chalmers' notorious terminology, that the
<br />
grain problem is susceptible to 'easy' solution.  For example - and I
<br />
emphasise that this is merely suggestive - conscious perception as we
<br />
know it provides us with an experience of time which is utterly at
<br />
odds with either flux or block temporal models - i.e. the notions that
<br />
time at the 'objective' level is either utterly ephemeral or
<br />
enduringly spatial.   On the basis of this we might well suppose that
<br />
any experience even approximating to subjective consciousness is very
<br />
far from supervening directly on some process naively considered as a
<br />
simple traverse 'through time'.
<br />
<br />We should instead perhaps envision a) highly-evolved, multi-level,
<br />
subject-relative processes of abstraction, synthesis and editing with
<br />
b) high dependence on successions of (very) short-term memory-based
<br />
gestalts that instantiate the qualitative temporal content of the
<br />
'specious present', c) whose adaptive function - to speak
<br />
teleologically - is to mediate sophisticated discrimination of, and
<br />
response to, co-evolving environments.  In the first place, some such
<br />
notion is justifiable as a rationale for the very expensive adaptive
<br />
machinery represented by full reflective consciousness.  But more
<br />
fundamentally, such a gedanken experiment allows us to see that it is
<br />
naive to conceptualise 'experience' as qualitatively uniform and
<br />
indiscriminately available 'through time' to reflective subjective
<br />
consciousness.  Rather, we should expect that 'low-grain' generative
<br />
process will indeed be discarded (i.e. 'forgotten') at the level of
<br />
the reproducible temporal content of any self-conscious subject
<br />
capable of supporting and articulating such experience.

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in and of itself tell us anything fundamental about ontology.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't think it revelas it sown ontology. OTOH, it must somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; be taken accounto fi in any succesful ontology because everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; must.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I've considered the various comments you've made recently and I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; been wondering how best to proceed in our discussion, to try to avoid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; going round in circles.  I'd like to focus on the question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ontology.  You say above that consciousness doesn't &quot;reveal its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ontology&quot;.  If by this you mean that consciousness - in virtue of its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mere presence - doesn't provide its own analysis, then of course this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is obviously true.  But this is not what I'm getting at here.  I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; said pretty clearly that I'm trying to articulate some of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; implications of an 'eastern' metaphysics such as Vedanta.  A typical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; statement in this tradition is something like &quot;everything is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness&quot;, and this is indeed broadly the sense in which I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ascribing ontological primacy to this category.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm more interested in grounds than implications. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consc. does not reveal its own ontology, some other grounds are needed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for making it basic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The term consciousness carries so much freight that I'd prefer some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more neutral expression such as primitive self-availability, but as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you've said, non-standard vocabulary carries its own burden.  Anyway,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it's the uneliminable intrinsic availability that Chalmers is getting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; at in his zombie reductio.   Any claim on this as the primitive ontic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; substrate, naturally entails that all other accounts must in principle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be reducible or paraphraseable in terms of it, and I think that in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fact Chalmers' own information-based dual-aspect approach has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something useful to say on this score.  Essentially, at the end of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; short exposition in &quot;Facing up to the Problem of Consciousness&quot;, he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; summarises the problems pretty well, and comes up with more or less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the same intuition, adjusting for vocabulary.   Here's the quote:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;Once a fundamental link between information and experience is on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; table, the door is opened to some grander metaphysical speculation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; concerning the nature of the world. For example, it is often noted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that physics characterizes its basic entities only extrinsically, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; terms of their relations to other entities, which are themselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; characterized extrinsically, and so on. The intrinsic nature of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical entities is left aside. Some argue that no such intrinsic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; properties exist, but then one is left with a world that is pure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; causal flux (a pure flow of information) with no properties for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; causation to relate. If one allows that intrinsic properties exist, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; natural speculation given the above is that the intrinsic properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the physical - the properties that causation ultimately relates -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are themselves phenomenal properties. We might say that phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; properties are the internal aspect of information. This could answer a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; concern about the causal relevance of experience - a natural worry,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; given a picture on which the physical domain is causally closed, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on which experience is supplementary to the physical. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; informational view allows us to understand how experience might have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; subtle kind of causal relevance in virtue of its status as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intrinsic nature of the physical. This metaphysical speculation is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; probably best ignored for the purposes of developing a scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theory, but in addressing some philosophical issues it is quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; suggestive.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; IOW, he proposes  - with charming professional tentativeness - that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experience is the intrinsic nature of the physical - i.e. in Quinean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; terms, everything is reducible to experience. This allows him to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; paraphrase the extrinsic physical account as 'pure causal flux' - i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the abstractable relational properties of what exists.  It is of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; course this abstractability or extrinsicality that makes it at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; same time shareable and incomplete.  Completing the account - adding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; back the interpretation of the causal flux - then depends on *being*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the 'instantiation' of the flux - i.e. the intrinsic properties in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; specified relation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It would interest me to see how the foregoing squares with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; criticisms you've recently made, and whether we can at least see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exactly where the divergence is situated.
