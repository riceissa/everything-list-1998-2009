<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;were running 10 identical sentient programs. Assume that the torture is so

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;bad that death is preferable, and so bad that escaping it with your life

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;is only marginally preferable to escaping it by dying (eg., given the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;option of a 50% chance of dying or a 49% chance of escaping the torture 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and living, you would take the 50%). The torture will continue for a year, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;but you are allowed one of 3 choices as to how things will proceed:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(a) 9 of the 10 copies will be chosen at random and painlessly killed, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;while the remaining copy will continue to be tortured.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(b) For one minute, the torture will cease and the number of copies will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;increase to 10^100. Once the minute is up, the number of copies will be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;reduced to 10 again and the torture will resume as before.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(c) the torture will be stopped for 8 randomly chosen copies, and continue 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;for the other 2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Which would you choose? To me, it seems clear that there is an 80% chance 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of escaping the torture if you pick (c), while with (a) it is certain that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the torture will continue, and with (b) it is certain that the torture 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;will continue with only one minute of respite.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you impose the condition I discussed earlier that absolute probabilities 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't change over time, or in terms of my analogy, that the water levels in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each tank don't change because the total inflow rate to each tank always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;matches the total outflow rate, then I don't think it's possible to make 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sense of the notion that the observer-moments in that torture-free minute 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would have 10^100 times greater absolute measure. If there's 10^100 times 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more water in the tanks corresponding to OMs during that minute, where does 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all this water go after the tank corresponding to the last OM in this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;minute, and where is it flowing in from to the tank corresponding to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first OM in this minute?
</em><br />
<br />As I understood your model, the tanks have constant volume over time 
<br />
(because net inflow matches net outflow), but you never said they all had 
<br />
the same volume. If they did, every OM would have the same absolute measure, 
<br />
so why bother with the idea of absolute measure at all?
<br />
<br />It appears that we both believe that any individual's consciousness will 
<br />
continue indefinitely, or, as you say in a later post in the current thread, 
<br />
&quot;death only exists from a third person perspective&quot;. However, I don't really 
<br />
understand the mechanism whereby you believe this will happen. Perhaps you 
<br />
could tell me where we differ:
<br />
<br />My understanding of observer moments is that, unlike the water molecules in 
<br />
your tanks, they are *always* created and destroyed. The observer's 
<br />
experience of continuity of consciousness over time results from the 
<br />
stringing together of OM's which are related in the following way: at a 
<br />
particular OM in an observer's stream of consciousness, the &quot;next moment&quot;, 
<br />
or successor OM, can be any OM which identifies itself with that observer, 
<br />
shares the observer's memories up to that point, and fits in as a 
<br />
continuation of the previous OM's thoughts. (These criteria are necessarily 
<br />
somewhat loose, accounting for situations such as waking up with retrograde 
<br />
amnesia after a head injury.)
<br />
<br />Death (from the first person perspective) can be defined as occuring when 
<br />
there is no successor OM, anywhere or ever. As long as there remains even 
<br />
one successor OM, be it in another Galaxy, a parallel universe, or whatever, 
<br />
the stream of consciousness will continue indefinitely. In the multiverse 
<br />
(or larger mathematical structure containing the multiverse), there will 
<br />
always be a successor OM; hence, the quantum immortality idea.
<br />
<br />You may agree with at least some of the above, but it looks like you may 
<br />
have a problem with my 10^100 copies, which I propose are created, live for 
<br />
a minute, then are destroyed. Didn't I just say death can't happen from a 
<br />
first person perspective? Going by the definition of death above, if the 
<br />
copies are to really die, there would have to be no successor OM anywhere or 
<br />
ever (which in this case means the self contained model universe of the 
<br />
thought experiment). But clearly, there *is* a successor OM. As the end of 
<br />
the minute approaches, the copies know that the torture is going to start 
<br />
again. The fact that there is a mismatch between the number of 
<br />
instantiations during the minute and after (10^100 -&gt; 10) doesn't make any 
<br />
difference. This is what the purpose of the thought experiment was: to show 
<br />
that the absolute measure, which is proportional to the number of 
<br />
instantiations of a given OM, cannot make any first person difference. If it 
<br />
could, then option (c) would be the worst choice, reducing the measure of 
<br />
tortured OM's by 80%, while (a) would reduce it by 90% and (b) by almost 
<br />
100%. If you chose (a) or (b) on this basis, you would be guaranteeing that 
<br />
you will experience a year of torture.
