<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I would like to leave copies out of the YD because I think those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would actually invalidate the premise. If you ran into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  a copy of yourself in the street you may suspect that something is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amiss in your world!
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK if it is a temporary interdiction. The YD will entail that we are 
<br />
duplicable in a weak sense (which does not contravene the no-cloning 
<br />
theorem (but here I anticipate the reasoning)).
<br />
You pretend YD is false, show the proof.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  What I propose to do is to show you that your premise, YD, is false. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That allows me to dismiss anything you say based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  on that premise.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course. But of course, everything I say from CT and AR alone will 
<br />
survive. I hope you see this clearly.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  That is actually not general at all but extremely specific. From here 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on I will make no comment on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  any sentence you preface with &quot;But from COMP (or YD) I can prove 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that...&quot; . Nothing personal, please understand.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Sure. Except that in a second round (the &quot;interview&quot; of the lobian 
<br />
machine) I translate &quot;comp&quot; in arithmetic, and I extract *a* physics 
<br />
from that COMP. To understand that translation YD is very useful, but 
<br />
no more. Then if the physics that is extracted from the arithmetical 
<br />
COMP corresponds to the empirical physics, your proof of the falsity of 
<br />
the YD would show that a falsity has helped in discovering the origin 
<br />
of the physical laws. Funny but not entirely impossible. Except that, 
<br />
without wanting to discourage you in advance, it is very hard for me to 
<br />
believe you have find a proof or an argument showing comp is wrong. But 
<br />
that makes me just more curious.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, although 99,99999999 % of the mathematician &gt; are platonist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during the week, most like to pretends they are not (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; week-end!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Ditto.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hope you are not serious!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry! &quot;Ditto&quot; over here in the States is used as a note of agreement.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I take it like that.
<br />
You are telling me you are platonist the week and not platonist the 
<br />
week-end?
<br />
Or &quot;ditto&quot; means you agree with *me*, I guess.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In that case enjoy the prize! If you derived the laws of physics from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CT and AR alone you surely deserve the recognition you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  will enjoy because that is a remarkable accomplishment! 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Congratulations!
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />But there is a derivation of a physics from CT and AR. Just to 
<br />
understand *that* intuitively you need YD.  I have done two things the 
<br />
universal dovetailer argument (UDA) which shows that YD + CT + AR 
<br />
entails that physics emerges necessary from a web of machine dreams 
<br />
(say, dream being entirely defined in term of computer science or 
<br />
number theory).
<br />
But then in the second part, called sometime the arithmetical universal 
<br />
dovetailer argument (AUDA), or more simply the &quot;interview of the lobian 
<br />
machine&quot;,  I translate (UDA) in arithmetic (because comp makes it 
<br />
possible and necessary). YD disappears or is translated in arithmetic 
<br />
(by Godel-like devices). The derivation of physics is purely 
<br />
mathematical of course, I am not a magician extracting the galaxies 
<br />
from someone saying &quot;yes&quot; to a doctor.
<br />
It looks like it disappoints you, but there is two parts in my work:
<br />
<br />UDA: an argument that YD + CT + AR implies physics is necessarily a 
<br />
branch of computer science.
<br />
AUDA: a translation of the argument in arithmetic, with the (modest) 
<br />
result that the logic of the observable proposition is given by the 
<br />
composition of three mathematical transformations operating on a 
<br />
&quot;well-known&quot; modal logic (G). And it already looks enough like some 
<br />
quantum logics to encourage further research. Alas the math are not 
<br />
easy and not well known.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I feel like saying: my work here is done!
</em><br />
<br /><br />But it is done. Yes of course.And  if YD is false (which I doubt), UDA 
<br />
will be dead, ok, but it will make the AUDA much more enigmatic!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Without even trying I have let you relinquish one of your hypothesis!
</em><br />
<br /><br />It looks your goal is shooting me completely:  the UDA and AUDA!
<br />
I have absolutely no worry about YD, but it is a logical fact you ask 
<br />
me to make clear: even if that were true (that YD is false), that would 
<br />
kill one halve only, the one some people ask me sometimes to drop out, 
<br />
but I prefer to keep it for preventing positivistic interpretation of 
<br />
machine's discourses.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Well, YD is so secondary to your purposes, why do you care?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Because many people take YD for granted, already. Because it makes the 
<br />
comp-physics obligatory making the whole of comp testable. YD is 
<br />
secondary for the extraction of physics, but it is necessary for having 
<br />
an understanding why it is a derivation of physics. I am anormaly 
<br />
patient, you could understand this by reading the UDA, and the 
<br />
beginning of the AUDA.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am almost sure you would approve my version but I am not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; putting it down until you give me a good reason to do it!!!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Because that would kill the first half of my PhD thesis and makes the 
<br />
second part enigmatic.
<br />
But many in this list find YD plausible and if you can show it false, 
<br />
please do it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I am sorry, Bruno, but I see no glory in disappointing a few computer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientists(and their grand-mothers)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Only?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  since, you and I agree that their physics stinks! You are the one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that claims to derive the true physics
</em><br />
<br /><br />Assuming comp in UDA, and assuming COMP (as I wrote it sometimes) for 
<br />
the translation of comp in the language of a lobian machine 
<br />
(arithmetic, if you want). The result of the transformation is just a 
<br />
purely mathematical formula (sorry!).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; so you are the one I would like to shoot down! If you really only need 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CT and AR I really have no other choice but to worship at your altar 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (;-) since I really don't want to have to go through your proof and I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am no match for CT or AR. It is a pity because it is a cute little 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument I have up my sleeve ....
</em><br />
<br /><br />My senses detect some arrogance here. Do you mean you would not give 
<br />
the argument once you realize that strictly speaking it could only 
<br />
wound my work without killing it completely? You could have first take 
<br />
a look at the table of content.
<br />
Either you give the argument in the next post, or I will give you the 
<br />
everything-list-prize of arrogance Godfray.
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
