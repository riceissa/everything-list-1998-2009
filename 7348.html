Of course you are right: there is no way to distinguish the original from 
<br />
the copy, given that the copying process works as intended. And if you 
<br />
believe that everything possible exists, then there will always be at least 
<br />
one version of you who will definitely experience whatever outcome you are 
<br />
leaving to chance. Probability is just a first person experience of a 
<br />
universe which is in fact completely deterministic, because we cannot access 
<br />
the parallel worlds where our copies live, and because even if we could, we 
<br />
can only experience being one person at a time.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You made your point. Let me give you an argument showing (incorrectly) that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the notion of probability is not applicable in the duplication situations. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I let you find where is the error. The argument is of course (*) a thought 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiment and I present it through an imaginary story. In the &quot;copy and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the chair&quot; you reverse the situation. Here I show it to be completely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;arbitrary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is the story of my friend Jack. Jack is a computationalist practitioner, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and he is also fond of the planet Mars. Unfortunately he married Jeanne who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was anti computationalist. Nevertheless he promised to never leave her. And 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jack is as honest as possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Today, classical teleportation and duplication were common, but Jeanne just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believes that those who are reconstituted are sort of &quot;impostors&quot;, and that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each time an &quot;original&quot; is scanned and annihilated, well, he just dye.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One day Jack, who is a little bit tired arguing with Jeanne, found a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proposition for a nice Job on Mars. He decides to duplicate itself, by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being scanned, and then send on Mars and be reconstituted on it. All this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;without annihilation of the original, so as to be able not feeling guilty 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in front of Jeanne, and hurt her feeling in case she would know.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jack, who bet on comp, thought that he has a chance of 1/2 to &quot;be the one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;who will enjoy working on Mars&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;After having done the experience. Jack-original was a little bit sad. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jack-1, the copy, was delighted: it has worked!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Soon after, his news paper was offering even more jobs on Mars, actually 64 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;jobs. He decided to reiterate the &quot;copy and paste&quot; (no cut) 64 times. He 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thought that the probability he remains the original was 1/2^64 (= about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1/1,84 10^19) so that he would be rather unlucky to be the one feeling 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;remaining the original!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But as tautologies are tautologies, the original remains the original, so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;he was, as a computationalist, quite astonished failing again. He did even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;begin to doubt comp. On Mars, Jack-2, Jack-3, ..., Jack-65 were delighted 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and were thinking that they knew that trick could hardly fail!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And then new jobs on Mars were still offered, dirty dangerous one. Jack 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(who is Jack-0)  was beginning to doubt comp, and was thinking that Jeanne 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was perhaps right about the reconstituted people being &quot;other&quot;. Still, its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relation with Jeanne were bad enough he really wants to leave her, and its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;frustration not being on Mars was growing and growing. And perhaps Jack was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not so honest, and he makes up the following plan: &quot;I will just LET THE 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ORIGINAL GO ON MARS&quot;. And Jack promises to himself that, would he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;acknowledge to be the copy, he would stay with Jeanne.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;He even decides to delay the reconstitution, following that anti-comp 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;superstition that being scanned, and reconstituted with a delay makes you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sure to remain the original.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So he scanned himself, with a program activating the reconstitution with a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;delay of one hour (say), and then, he was going on MARS, by usual 2 years 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;trip by rocket (he was doubting! Note the irony here: he feels to leave 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jeanne at the time he feels to get her point! ).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You can imagine the disappointment of the copy on earth. &quot;What! it fails 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;again! Come on Please! Will I ever successfully quit earth? Jeanne did not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;see Jack was a copy, and Jack did not despair finding a way to go on mars, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;letting a copy or &quot;an original&quot; of him with Jeanne.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In new attempts, he decides to select the one among copy/oiginal with a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;coin, among the original and the copy. It failed! He decides to use the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;decimal of PI written in binary as selector. It failed! He decides to use 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ieratively a quantum OR gate making the decision &quot;arbitrarily sure&quot;: it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;still failed!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This explains why my friend Jack was rather depressed the last time I saw 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;him. Obviously, anyone on Earth will find eself with a necessarily 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;disappointed &quot;Jack&quot;, given that from our point of view the tautology 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;alluded above is now:  &quot;the one who has been chosen to stay on Earth will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have with certainty the experience of staying on Earth&quot;. For any strategy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of choice (original/copy) we could suggest to Jack, we know, that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Jack&quot; who will stay on earth and come back to the bar will say: &quot;it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;failed&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That day in the bar, my friend Jack was feeling being incredibly unlucky.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Was he right?
