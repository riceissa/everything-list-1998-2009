<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could pick out of a list of 100 possible words, so the probability that a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;higher than the probability it would contain the precise gestalt &quot;sun,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that you already know there's a book/story containing that gestalt is an

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;example of hindsight bias--in the Heinlein example, you wouldn't have

In two words: Conclusions first.
<br />
Can you really offer no scientific procedure to evaluate Heinlein's 
<br />
story?  At the cookie jar level, can you at least grudgingly admit that the 
<br />
word &quot;Szilard&quot; sure looks like &quot;Silard&quot;?  Sounds like it too.  Or is that a 
<br />
coincidence as well?  What are the odds.  Should be calculable--how many 
<br />
stories written in 1939 include the names of Los Alamos scientists in 
<br />
conjunction with the words &quot;bomb&quot; , &quot;uranium. . .&quot;
<br />
<br />You're shaking your head.  This, I assume is already a done deal, for you.
<br />
<br />And that, in my view, is the heart of the problem.  Rather than swallow 
<br />
hard and look at this in a non-biased fashion, you seem to be glued to the 
<br />
proposition that (1) it's intractable or (2) it's not worth analyzing 
<br />
because the answer is obvious.
<br />
<br />If your answer is (1), then fine.  Let others worry about it.  But if your 
<br />
answer is (2), then congratulations---you've likely committed a Type II 
<br />
error.   In all of your posts, you seem to present reasons why the Heinlein 
<br />
story should not be investigated because (I'm paraphrasing, of course) it's 
<br />
&quot;obviously&quot; not worthy of investigation.  You exclude ALL the 
<br />
evidence---even the Bonferroni doesn't do that.  Logically, if you exclude 
<br />
all the evidence, then the probability that you might miss something go to. 
<br />
. .1.   One hundred percent.
<br />
<br />When one chooses to use, say Spearman Correlation Coefficients to evaluate 
<br />
multiple pairs, the usual protocol involves using the Bonferroni 
<br />
correction--in which the alpha (often at 0.05) is divided by some multiple 
<br />
of the number of pairs evaluated--usually simply the number of pairs.  A 
<br />
thousand pairs?  then, the alpha should be divided by a thousand and the 
<br />
resultant p value accepted as similar to a single p value of 0.05.  Problem 
<br />
is, this sort of trick will cost you statistical power.  You may not decide 
<br />
something is significant when it is not, but you may also throw out a value 
<br />
that truly is important.  As the type I error risk goes down, the Type II 
<br />
error risk goes up.  (Reducing alpha increases beta (the probability of 
<br />
making a Type II error.) There are reputable statisticians who suggest not 
<br />
using the Bonferroni at all.  In my work, I evaluate cancer rates against 
<br />
radioisotopes in nuclear fallout---but I require a very high Z score for 
<br />
significance.
<br />
<br />I've yet to see a good protocol defined here to evaluate the Heinlein 
<br />
story, most prefer to fall back onto the soft couch of bias and 
<br />
prejudgment.  But in doing so, your beta goes out the roof--and you 
<br />
guarantee yourself that you'll never recognize *anything* as 
<br />
significant.  It would seem that it would be far easier and more 
<br />
scientifically sound to just admit that you are aware of no tools that can 
<br />
properly evaluate it.
<br />
<br />PS:  Note I haven't mentioned anything about proof or causation---merely 
<br />
the ability to apply the scientific method--properly free of bias---to a 
<br />
set of circumstances.   So far (as with the Thompkins quote)--it looks like 
<br />
&quot;conclusions first, justification later.&quot;
<br />
<br />Hope your drug company doesn't use the same protocol.  Because 
<br />
*that*  wouldn't be right, would it?;-)
