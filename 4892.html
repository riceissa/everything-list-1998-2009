<br />David, I used to puzzle over the definition of this word also, but 
<br />
enlightenment did not come until I realised that granting it the status of a 
<br />
basic and precise concept was the cause of all the philosophical mischief. 
<br />
The &quot;problem of personal identity&quot; mostly goes away if we admit that there 
<br />
is no objective, yes-or-no answer to the question of whether two SAS's are 
<br />
the same person, and instead speak only of greater or lesser degrees of 
<br />
similarity. Of course, there are cases of common usage which most people 
<br />
would not question - that I am the same person today as I was yesterday, for 
<br />
example - but even here, I would argue that the identical/non-identical 
<br />
cutoff is (a) quantitative rather than qualitative, and (b) in the final 
<br />
analysis arbitrary. Certainly, the atoms comprising me-today are not all the 
<br />
same as those comprising me-yesterday, and if we consider me-last-year, none 
<br />
of the atoms may be the same. In fact, if we consider physical continuity 
<br />
the important factor in survival, the person that lived in my house last 
<br />
year is as thoroughly dead and gone as if he had been killed and cremated, 
<br />
and the ashes scattered to the four winds! Add to this all the other 
<br />
actually or logically possible adventures an individual could be subjected 
<br />
to - brain or body transplant, memory loss and dementia, uploading to a 
<br />
computer, melding or splitting of mind, destructive and non-destructive 
<br />
teleportation, resurrection in the far future or in Heaven, multiple or 
<br />
infinite versions in MWI - and it becomes clear that, if it has any meaning 
<br />
at all, &quot;personal identity&quot; must be a very slippery and plastic concept 
<br />
indeed. I feel much better for having got rid of mine!

Subject: RE: Quantum accident survivor
<br />
<br /><br />I'm trying to define &quot;identity&quot;...
<br />
<br />Let's write x~y if SAS's x and y (possibly in different universes) have the 
<br />
same identity.  I propose that this relation must be reflexive, symmetric 
<br />
and transitive.  This neatly partitions all SAS's into equivalence classes, 
<br />
and we have no ambiguity working out whether any two SAS's across the 
<br />
multi-verse have the same identity.
<br />
<br />Consider an SAS x that splits into x1, x2 (in child universes under MWI).  
<br />
We assume x~x1 and x~x2.  By symmetry and transitivity we deduce x1~x2.  So 
<br />
this definition of identity is maintained across independent child 
<br />
universes.
<br />
<br />This is at odds with the following concept of identity...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am, for all practical purposes, one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and only one specific configuration of atoms in a specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe. I could never say that ' I ' is ALL the copies, since I NEVER 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience what the other copies experience
</em><br />
<br />It seems necessary to distinguish between a definition of identity and the 
<br />
set of memories within an SAS at a given moment.
<br />
<br />Is it possible that over long periods of time, the environment can affect an 
<br />
SAS to such an extent that SAS's in different universe that are suppose to 
<br />
have the same identity actually have very little in common?
<br />
<br />What happens if we &quot;splice&quot; two SAS's (including their memories)?
<br />
<br />It seems to me that the concept of identity is not fundamental to physics.  
<br />
It's useful for classification purposes as long as one doesn't stretch it 
<br />
too far and expose its lack of precision.
<br />
<br />This reminds me of the problem of defining the word &quot;species&quot;.  Although a 
<br />
useful concept for zoologists it is not well defined.  For example there are 
<br />
cases where (animals in region) A can mate with B, B can mate with C, but A 
<br />
can't mate with C.
<br />
