Bruno:
<br />
THANK YOU for the statement:
<br />
&quot;I would say that the Church has nothing to do with religion, science,
<br />
ethics, or even politics (in the good reading of the term), etc.
<br />
it is just manipulation by fear. Political power by authoritative argument,
<br />
when not terror.&quot; (see at the conclusion again).
<br />
<br />I worked in my early years for the Hungarian Patent Office (in line with the
<br />
international P-law) as an infringement-researcher. The old-fox boss said:
<br />
...and you be careful to check every angle, for NOBODY invents anything new,
<br />
just reads the literature superficially....
<br />
(Not quite true).
<br />
<br />Later I wondered in realizing the gradual epistemic enrichment of the human
<br />
mindset over the millennia, &quot;how&quot; do we absorb something NEW?
<br />
Is there an undetailed (raw) totality in our 'mind' and development just
<br />
dresses up certain details with relations we already interpreted? Or is
<br />
there a capability of hooking up 'novelties' and it is up to the individual
<br />
to put it into relations of fitting background-knowledge, -  vs. just
<br />
missing it altogether? (which would make the difference between creative and
<br />
not).
<br />
I found 2 different types of 'creative': the &quot;inventor&quot; of a (?) perpetuum
<br />
mobile (joking example), and the perfecting mind to solve problems in new
<br />
ways. Patent Offices have trouble with the 2nd type, how NEW is an improved
<br />
solution? However, if it solves a problem so far unsolved, it is creative.
<br />
<br />When Papin realized that the lid of his boiler-pot lifts to puff out steam
<br />
and returns to position for the next puff and THIS repetition of &quot;up and
<br />
down&quot; can be used to generate movement - that was creative. To get from
<br />
there to the rotating motion of Steveson's locomotive: it was also creative.
<br />
But how creative was Otto's combustion engine to apply a similar effect by
<br />
different conditions? I think it was also highly creative.
<br />
I could make my 38 patents because I was not learning 'deeply' enough my
<br />
math and physics and could free-up my mind from the sci. 'rules' that
<br />
explained thoroughly all the circumstances causing the problems. Most of my
<br />
ideas were results in free thinking about unusual possibilities. And some
<br />
guts to try it out - similarly in unusual ways. And: understanding outcome
<br />
in nonconventional connotations, how to apply them to a quite different
<br />
case.
<br />
<br />Bruno, you are right: it is not 'teachable'. Example: I worked on a glue for
<br />
plywood and just heard about the fast demise of bus-tires. Knowing that my
<br />
stuff is 'wetting' aged rubber, prompted an experiment to wet  the tires
<br />
with my (diluted) glue-stuff and the communal bus-company got a 30% increase
<br />
in tire-durability. How would you teach THAT?
<br />
DuPont had a researcher (Carothers) who had a crazy idea of a &quot;stuff&quot; and
<br />
the company let him work on it for 17 years without intermittent practical
<br />
results. The result was the invention of nylon (66 that is).
<br />
<br />I enjoyed your treatise on medieval suppression of ideas by the Church. Just
<br />
don't you think it was all over by the advent of Reanissance: today
<br />
different ways for different aims work similarly: One of the Pittsburgh
<br />
giants bought an ingenious sand-filter patent from Hungary (I had a
<br />
tiny part in the patent)  and burried it in their archives because it would
<br />
have been a competition to their widely marketed product. Free market, huh?
<br />
Have a good day
<br />
<br />John

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Creativity has been the victim of repression in western thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Socrates, who, along with Plato and Aristotle are the sods
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; responsible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; for giving us the our critical-thinking-dominated and design-energy-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; deficient thinking system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps I should do better. The last Renaissance revived and polished
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the methods of Socrates and the other thinkers of the pre-Roman
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe. The way the knowledge was re-assimilated was with a heavy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flavouring of Roman fascism. The mathematical universe of Islam and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the pre-Islamic thinkers had to be accommodated as well. The argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; method (not the only method of exploring a terrain of ideas) was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps in use before, but Socrates had developed it into a formidable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; procedure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am mainly concerned with the effect of Socrates. Pythagoras and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Plotinus and all the other guys you love are in the pantheon of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematicians - they are the &quot;Good Greeks&quot;. These guys knew how to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ask the right questions. Socrates knew less about asking questions but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he knew a hell of a lot about giving answers. Socrates never asked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fishing questions. (&quot;Fishing question&quot;: a real and honest demand for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information; you don't know if the fish will bite, where, when etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Socrates only asked &quot;Hunting questions&quot;. (&quot;Hunting question&quot;: when you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have the animal - the target - in your sights.) Socrates wanted people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to confirm his opinions which he would hoodwink everybody into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagining were the morally responsible ones to hold.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;You wouldn't elect your best athletes by lot now would you?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;No we wouldn't&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;So why would you elect your politicians by lot?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The required response is embedded in the comparison; a fake
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comparison. The technique involves taking two really quite different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things and making them appear the same. Its a kind of a magic trick.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Works every time. However, there may well be excellent reasons for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electing politicians anonymously (risk of bribery, corruption etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Pure sophistry. I love it. Aristotle was simply wrong so no need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bother with him anymore.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then, Socrates never set out to be a constructive thinker. He is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nowhere as imaginative as Plotinus and Pythagoras. Socrates' purpose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was to attack and remove 'rubbish'. Socrates will show brilliantly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that all suggestions offered are wrong or faulty in some way. Not ONCE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does Socrates offer a better idea. &quot;Not My Job&quot; rules with him. &quot;I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not here to help you forge ideas I am here to help you find the true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideas, the ones you can trust. Its just that you have to come with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideas I criticise.&quot; He seemed to believe that if you simply attack
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is wrong, or in error, then what you are left with will be true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and trustworthy. This has left us with our obsession with criticism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a remarkable paradox in how the revival of Greek argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking in the last Renaissance served a dual purpose. On the one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hand, humanistic thinkers used the system of reason and logic to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attack the dogma that suffocated society. On the other hand, Church
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinkers led by Thomas Aquinas developed the same argument logic into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a powerful way of defeating numerous heresies that were forever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surfacing. This argument/logic type of thinking became standard in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seminaries, universities and schools. The paradox is that Church
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinkers and non-Church (humanistic) thinkers found equal value in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; methods. Perhaps this is not too surprising given that the new methods
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were a clear and obvious advance on the existing ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; OK - so get the bloody Athenian Academy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; doors yanked open and let's get this thing sorted out by golly! You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; have great reverence for Greek thinking, Bruno - I just want to slap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; them all around the gills for their lack of design, their lack of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; creative, generative thinking energy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You try to provoke me, I guess. I am not so much reverent with all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the Greeks. You know that I believe that Aristotle was wrong on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; metaphysics, or at least responsible for the beginning of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; departure from rational mysticism and Platonism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course - I merely continue the triage of defective ancient Greek
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinkers by one more Greek. Plato and Pythagoras and Plotinus and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Euclid are all in the mathematic pantheon and above reproach (I won't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forgive Plato the slaves or the fascination with Sparta, though). I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather concerned with the legacy of Socrates though. The Greeks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bequeathed us argument and democracy and we have wanted to keep the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two together ever since because nobody can conceive of how to operate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a democracy without argument. Plato gave us &quot;the Truth&quot; which we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always said to be after. So our traditional thinking system is like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that: it is based on the search for &quot;the truth&quot;. It was never a case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of being in search of &quot;the best design&quot;. Truth has to be uncovered and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; checked by logic and argument (supplemented by statistics and other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; methods). The result is a strong tendency toward negativity and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attack; the very nadir of creativity in other words. Negativity and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fear are seen to be a powerful way of uncovering the truth or,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; securing compliance with somebody's definition of it. Negativity and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attack can also provide the attacker with a very seductive and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; addictive feeling of satisfaction as well. The Crusades were an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exercise in taking all of this for a jolly walk.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; It's all argument bloody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That is what I like. I appreciate arguments. It is my way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What's wrong with a simple discussion? Why does there always have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a winner and a loser? Why do we have to make like adversaries when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what we want to do is share perceptions and explore a topic? Why can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there be as many theories about something as heads in the room? We all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lay out our piece of the mosaic and in the end we have the Big
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Picture. I try not to confuse thinking with perception. Argument, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the executive function of critical (vertical) thinking lacks design
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; energy. Argument makes you right, that's all. Nothing is constructed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or created by argument. Argument was never for the purpose of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generating new ideas. Argument was invented to weed out all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inferior or incorrect ideas as a way of having some confidence in what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is probably an arbitrary conclusion locked in by the original choice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of premises anyway. Remember, after Goedel, any argument is only as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good as its starting premises which can never be proved from within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I am right sir and you are wrong sir! The truth lies with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; me! No sir it is you who are wrong sir!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Not at all. Once we argument, we never have to talk on who is right
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or wrong. We let people figure out by themselves. Science is doubt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and doubt and doubt, and always doubt. Certainty and conviction is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; madness. Plato never pretends to be right. He presents points of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; view and people discussing and trying to solve problems, like &quot;what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is knowledge&quot; in the Theaetetus.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK - you are being very scholarly in your deployment of this word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;argument&quot;. I do feel there is more, much more though, to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific method than just criticism and attack. A hypothesis arises
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the first place as an act of imagination.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; You are without merit! So what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; have these two guys created while yelling at each other?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The scientific attitude, in all direction, including mystic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiences. It last for 8 century, and stopped when Justinien close
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the academy of Plato in Athen. It never really came back, although a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; few bits survive in the middle east and bubbled out in Europa later.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Just a little bit. The main fundamental inquiry (theology) did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; remain in the hand of the &quot;authorities&quot;, making both science and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; religion a sort of religion. We are still, and actually more and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; more so, victim of that schizophrenia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So - there it is. Just as I say - the Church banished creativity and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the creative interpretation of information. People were forbidden to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use conceptual imagination in understanding data. Creativity was seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as evil and suspect and the work of sorcerers and witches and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alchemists. Anybody who could &quot;think&quot; in the medieval period better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have good connections in society. As soon as &quot;thinking&quot; came back into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fashion at the Renaissance, the Church once again felt threatened by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rising levels of education in society and in some very direct sense,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is WHY the Church invented school. To impart the &quot;right&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge to those who had the right beliefs. We cannot underestimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the extent to which education today is the product of this miserable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state of affairs.
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In Japan, where there was never any exposure to Hellenistic or Arabic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or Roman influences, it turned out rather differently. The Japanese
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never wasted any time arguing about the rights and the wrongs of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything. The Japanese method was to encourage everyone to think how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything might be improved and to trial as many ideas as possible. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high failure rate of ideas must be envisaged in this style, but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result is that innovation and design-thinking is encouraged.
