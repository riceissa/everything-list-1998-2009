Dear David
<br />
<br />Why is it so difficult to conceive that the simulators should be
<br />
unwittingly? Or in some way non ethical and thoughtless of the pain, fears,
<br />
loves etc of an interesting by product (or even possibly irritating by
<br />
product) of their simulation.  Do you eat meat?  Trap mice? kill flies? Wash
<br />
bacteria from your hands?  How much  time and concern do you (we) give to
<br />
these  life forms?  For all we know the cockroach may be the purposeful
<br />
study of the simulation we are in - or even whichever species is &quot;the
<br />
surviving species&quot; of interest at t=time to stop.  I know it feels like we
<br />
should be important but, in the scale of things - it's probably just
<br />
wishfull thinking. A hugely more intelligent species may not even be moral.
<br />
<br />Who says morality to all other species is useful anyway (for survival) and
<br />
even a defining feature of intelligent species?  In war people kill people
<br />
just like themselves, as long as they wear a different uniform! We drop atom
<br />
bombs and say it was to save life!!(Hiroshima).  This may be true.  Truth
<br />
and morality can get in conflict.  Morality can therefore easily get lost in
<br />
the fog.  How expensive it may be to run simulations that generate so many
<br />
forms too.  Perhaps some form of superintelligence decides who will live or
<br />
die in the simulation.  If you've ever been on a hospital waiting list for a
<br />
really life threatening illness it is clear how priorities can change the
<br />
moral landscape.  If I made a simulation I would want it to be moral but I
<br />
don't don't know what dilemmas the pandora's box generated by the simulation
<br />
and the financial or unknown constraints far above my knowing would turn up.
<br />
That's the interesting thing about simulations - they are run to &quot;see what
<br />
might be when we can't guess the answers&quot;. Yet, I hope your right and I'm
<br />
wrong.
<br />

Subject: Re: The moral dimension of simulation
<br />
<br /><br />But your observation goes to the heart of my question.  If we were
<br />
indeed 'merely incidental' (from whose perspective?) then what would
<br />
this say about the ethical position of the simulaters?  Further, if we
<br />
are merely playing the role of 'simple automata' then what is the
<br />
purpose (from the simulaters' viewpoint) of our *conscious* fears,
<br />
pains, loves, life struggle, and so forth?  Are these just an
<br />
unavoidable and unimportant (except to us) 'epiphenomenon' of the
<br />
simulation method?  Or are they what you mean by an 'interesting
<br />
pattern'?  Are we to take our creators' position as being 'superior' to
<br />
ours and if so what does this imply for our own (periodic) moral
<br />
delicacy about the rights and feelings of others - should we perhaps
<br />
view this as mere naivety or lack of intelligence in the light of our
<br />
masters' indifference to ours?
<br />
<br />These are the issues I'm attempting to raise in the context of the
<br />
'simulation hypothesis'.  Of course, there's an aspect of this that
<br />
recapitulates the struggle throughout history to establish humane moral
<br />
criteria in the face of various arbitrary and omnipotent god-figures,
<br />
or for that matter 'blind necessity'.  Even in the teeth of your
<br />
creator, you are not forced to accept the justice of his position, even
<br />
as you bow to his overwhelming force, as Job shows us.
<br />
