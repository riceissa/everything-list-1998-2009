I think that Newcomb's paradox does provide evidence for machine
<br />
consciousness, independent of implementation.
<br />
<br />[A reminder. Newcomb's paradox:  A highly superior being from another part
<br />
of the galaxy presents you with two boxes, one open and one closed. In the
<br />
open box there is a thousand-dollar bill. In the closed box there is either
<br />
one million dollars or there is nothing. You are to choose between taking
<br />
both boxes or taking the closed box only. But there's a catch.
<br />
<br />The being claims that he is able to predict what any human being will decide
<br />
to do. If he predicted you would take only the closed box, then he placed a
<br />
million dollars in it. But if he predicted you would take both boxes, he
<br />
left the closed box empty]
<br />
<br />Let's replace the ``highly superior being from another part of the galaxy´´
<br />
by a machine.
<br />
<br />It seems that choosing only the closed box is the best option. However since
<br />
the contents of the box is already fixed, it seems difficult to understand
<br />
how you could lose a million dollars by choosing both boxes. That seems to
<br />
contradict causality.
<br />
<br />However, we must consider how the machine arrives at the prediction. Suppose
<br />
the machine simulates your brain and just computes what you will choose. It
<br />
is hard to see that there is any alternative to this. Then the paradox is
<br />
resolved if this computation generates your consciousness. If you are
<br />
standing in front of the two boxes, making up your mind, you don't know if
<br />
you are in the real world or the virtual world generated by the machine. So,
<br />
you can't say that the contents of the closed boxed is already determined.
<br />
<br />How could you beat the machine? Suppose that the two boxes are in a room and
<br />
that the machine arrives at the prediction by scanning your brain moments
<br />
before you enter that room, and then calculating what you are going to do
<br />
next.
<br />
<br />I propose this solution. Sneak into the room before the experiment is
<br />
supposed to start. Then, with a pencil, mark a wall with small cross, and
<br />
then leave again. Hopefully the machine won't notice the cross on the wall.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;At the start of the experiment you enter the room and you look at the
<br />
marked wall. If you see a cross, then you are in the real world and the
<br />
closed boxed is already filled. So you choose both boxes.
<br />
<br />But if you don't see the cross, you are in the virtual room generated by the
<br />
machine. To make the machine fill the closed box with a million dollars you
<br />
have to choose only the closed box. Of course, you may ask why your virtual
<br />
version would care about your real version. I suppose that after the
<br />
simulation your virtual copy will live on with memory loss as your real
<br />
version.
