<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The problem with religious beliefs is not that they are bizarre (after all, many

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; scientific theories at first glance are just as bizarre) but that there is no reasonable

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; basis for deciding whether they are true. People usually choose religious beliefs because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; they would like them to be true or because their parents brought them up that way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It may be interesting to know if a religious belief makes a person happy, has inpired
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; good deeds or great art, and so on, but the specific question I want answered is whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it is true. For example, it is true that the smallpox virus causes a severe illness which has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; killed million of people over the centuries, and this is true regardless of whether it is good,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bad, interesting or whatever. I would like to know whether it is the case that Jesus rose from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; his tomb after being crucified or Athena sprang from Zeus' head after Hephaestus struck it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with an axe, and I would like to know this independently of whether it makes an interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or inspiring story.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I assume that your &quot;problem with religious beliefs&quot; also has to do with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the religion's claim that the object/subject of belief is an important
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; key to something, for instance the solution of the problem of evil.  If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the bizarreness is not an issue, then simply the belief that some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contingent event happened thousands of years ago is not preposterous.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would agree with you that whether something is true is of sole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; importance to whether it is worthy of being believed.  The task at hand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then would be to use our finite resources to come to a decision about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether or not we will believe an event occurred.  I agree with your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implied thought that it seems that if something key to our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding of the &quot;universe&quot; is tied to a contingent event in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history, then it would seem only fair that sufficient evidence of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; event should be accessible to us.  I have found that there is.  Again,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the specifics of this topic (Christianity) are probably too contingent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to get into on this List.  However, in this thread, I am talking about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact that such a configuration (a key to understanding our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;universe&quot; and living in it is tied to contingent events in history)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot be ruled out by any &quot;proof&quot; at the Everything level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Furthermore, I claim that the Everything level cannot solve all of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problems.

</em><br />
When I am confident about some empirical belief, I am confident that a perfectly fair, 
<br />
disinterested observer given the same evidence that I have will come to the same conclusion 
<br />
that I do, or at least entertain it as a serious possibility. For example, if I am confident that 
<br />
the Quran was written in Arabic in the 7th century, then I am confident that any reasonable person  
<br />
who went to the trouble to investigate the matter would agree with me. If I am a Muslim, I 
<br />
may be as certain about the evidence supporting that the Quran is the word of God as I am 
<br />
about the evidence supporting that the Quran was written in Arabic in the 7th century. However, 
<br />
while as a Muslim I may be just as confident that a reasonable and disinterested observer would agree 
<br />
about when the Quran was written, I would be far less confident that he would agree about its 
<br />
divine origin (and perhaps be converted to Islam). This presents a problem: I can't say that both 
<br />
my beliefs about the divine origin of the Quran and when it was written are epistemologically 
<br />
equivalent and empirically equally well founded, but hold that a disinterested observer would likely 
<br />
accept one but not the other. I have to say that one of my beliefs is *not* as firmly rooted in the 
<br />
objective evidence as the other, but that in order to drag it up to the same level of believability, it 
<br />
requires something in addition which even the perfectly fair and disinterested observer lacks: namely, 
<br />
faith. And when you allow faith to tip the balance in these equations, anything at all can be taken as 
<br />
true.
