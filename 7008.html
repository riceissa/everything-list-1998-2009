<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;because this would be tailoring the choice of gestalt to Hemingway's

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;book in order to make it seem more unlikely, in fact there are 970,200

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;possible 3-word gestalts you could pick out of a list of 100 possible

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;words, so the probability that a book published earlier would contain

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;*any* of these gestalts is a lot higher than the probability it would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;contain the precise gestalt &quot;sun, also, rises&quot;. Selecting a precise

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;target gestalt on the basis of the fact that you already know there's a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;book/story containing that gestalt is an example of hindsight bias--in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;the Heinlein example, you wouldn't have chosen the precise gestalt of

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Szilard/lens/beryllium/uranium/bomb from a long list of words associated

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;In two words: Conclusions first.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Can you really offer no scientific procedure to evaluate Heinlein's story?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;At the cookie jar level, can you at least grudgingly admit that the word 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;Szilard&quot; sure looks like &quot;Silard&quot;?  Sounds like it too.  Or is that a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;coincidence as well?  What are the odds.  Should be calculable--how many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;stories written in 1939 include the names of Los Alamos scientists in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;conjunction with the words &quot;bomb&quot; , &quot;uranium. . .&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;You're shaking your head.  This, I assume is already a done deal, for you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;And that, in my view, is the heart of the problem.  Rather than swallow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;hard and look at this in a non-biased fashion, you seem to be glued to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the proposition that (1) it's intractable or (2) it's not worth analyzing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;because the answer is obvious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think you misunderstood what I was arguing in my previous posts. If you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;look them over again, you'll see that I wasn't making a broad statement 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about the impossibility of estimating the probability that this event 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would have happened by chance, I was making a specific criticism of *your* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;method of doing so, where you estimate the probability of the particular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;gestalt&quot; of Szilard/lens/beryllium/uranium/bomb, rather than trying to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;estimate the probability that a story would anticipate *any* possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;gestalt associated with the Manhattan Project. By doing this, you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;incorporating hindsight knowledge of Heinlein's story into your choice of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the &quot;target&quot; whose probability you want to estimate, and in general this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will always lead to estimates of the significance of a &quot;hit&quot; which are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;much too high. If you instead asked someone with no knowledge of of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Heinlein's story to come up with a list of as many possible words 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;associated with the Manhattan Project that he could think of, then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;estimated the probability that a story would anticipate *any* combination 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of words on the list, then your method would not be vulnerable to this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;criticism (it might be flawed for other reasons, but I didn't address any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of these other reasons in my previous posts).
</em><br />
<br />Good starting premise.  But words have meaning, and while &quot;the sun also 
<br />
rises&quot; may be interpreted to presage the bomb, it in fact is about 
<br />
bullfighting.  No nukes there.  Heinlein's story is clearly about energy 
<br />
being derived from uranium--*and* has the name &quot;Silard.&quot;  These can not be 
<br />
compared with random number associations, simply because these words 
<br />
involve more information.  To use a crude example, in the science community 
<br />
the name &quot;Szilard&quot; conjures up one prime association.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Look over the analogy I made in my last post again:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose you pick 100 random words out of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dictionary, and then notice that the list contains the words &quot;sun&quot;, &quot;also&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and &quot;rises&quot;...as it so happens, that particular 3-word &quot;gestalt&quot; is also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;part of the title of a famous book, &quot;the sun also rises&quot; by Hemingway. Is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this evidence that Hemingway was able to anticipate the results of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;word-selection through ESP? Would it be fair to test for ESP by calculating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the probability that someone would title a book with the exact 3-word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;gestalt &quot;sun, also, rises&quot;? No, because this would be tailoring the choice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of gestalt to Hemingway's book in order to make it seem more unlikely, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fact there are 970,200 possible 3-word gestalts you could pick out of a list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of 100 possible words, so the probability that a book published earlier
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would contain *any* of these gestalts is a lot higher than the probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it would contain the precise gestalt &quot;sun, also, rises&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />To repeat, Heinlein's story is about uranium energy, the possibility of the 
<br />
factory blowing up, etc.  The context is fairly clear.  Hemingway's story 
<br />
is about Spain, bullfighting and affairs of the heart.  No nukes there.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To simplify things even further, let's say you simply make a list of ten 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;random numbers from 1 to 100, and before you make the list I make the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;prediction &quot;the list will contain the numbers 23 and 89&quot;. If it turns out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that those two numbers are indeed on your list, what is the significance 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of this result as evidence for precognition on my part? Your method would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be like ignoring the other 8 numbers on the list and just finding the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability that I would hit the precise target of &quot;23, 89&quot; by chance, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which (assuming order doesn't matter) would be only about a 1 in 5025 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shot, if my math is right. But the probability that both the numbers I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;guess will be *somewhere* on the list of ten is significantly higher--I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;get that the probability of this would be about 1 in 121. So if this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiment is done in many alternate universes, then if in fact I have no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;precognitive abilities, in about 1 in 121 universes, both numbers I guess 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will happen to be on your list by luck. But then if you used the method of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tailoring the choice of target to my guess, in each such universe you will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conclude that I only had a 1 in 5025 chance of making that guess by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chance. Clearly, then, you get bad conclusions if you use hindsight 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;knowledge to tailor the choice of target to what you know was actually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;guessed in this way. But it's also clear that this example is sufficiently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;well-defined that I would have no general objection to estimating the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability that my &quot;hit&quot; could have occurred by chance, it's just that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the correct answer is 1 in 121, not 1 in 5025.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sorry. In the raw sense, numbers merely represent values---unless you want 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to get into that weird set of coincidences about 1/139--i.e. Enrico 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Fermi's hospital room, etc.   (And I sincerely hope you *don't*.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Again, my concern is that scientists are too willing to prejudge something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;before diving into it.  This sort of behavior doesn't do the conduct of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inquiry any favors at all. (Abe Kaplan wrote a terrific book by that name 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in 1964.  Very quotable--and, I believe, pertinent.)   While some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scientists on this list complain about Heinlein's story being essentially 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unworthy of study, other scientists think the issue of global warming is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;settled (depending whether you're in the WH or not, that is), and there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are (believe it or not) guys getting tobacco money who *still* think the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;smoking-lung cancer link hasn't been proven--and never will be.  And so on.
</em><br />
<br />Even when we debunk using flawless logic, we can still end up with a Beta 
<br />
at infinity and be completely wrong.  Worse, we can be right for wrong or 
<br />
(often) imperfect reasons.  I recall someone mentioning the publication 
<br />
bias.  There's another one among peer-reviewed articles:  the bias against 
<br />
replication studies.  As a result, once a concept has been published, it's 
<br />
often taken as fact (except when scandals like the David Baltimore debacle 
<br />
happens).  In other words, it appears to me that the common urge to debunk 
<br />
the new is more the result of belief than science.
<br />
<br />Prove me wrong: Submit a good reliable protocol that will properly evaluate 
<br />
the kind of conditions associated with the Heinlein story. While science 
<br />
often seems like a religion to some scientists (Sagan comes to mind) 
<br />
science itself is a remarkably flexible engine capable of taking the 
<br />
scientist down just about any path he or she chooses.   Those that 
<br />
endlessly tinker with the components can help that engine become even more 
<br />
powerful.  But at some point, I think it would be a good idea to close the 
<br />
hood, fire it up and take the damn vehicle off the beaten path.
