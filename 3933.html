<br /><br />Y're welcome. I want just add something.
<br />
<br /><br />Your general question was &quot;Why using modal logic when
<br />
quantifying on worlds is enough&quot;. My basic answer was
<br />
that Kripke's possible world semantics works only on a
<br />
subset of the possible modal logics.
<br />
You can do modal logics without semantics. In fact modal
<br />
logic appeared because of apparent existence of modalities.
<br />
The main one is &quot;possible&quot; and &quot;necessary&quot;. But others
<br />
occurred like &quot;permitted&quot; and &quot;obligatory&quot;; &quot;provable&quot; and
<br />
consistent&quot;, &quot;believable&quot; and &quot;imaginable&quot;, etc.
<br />
The fundamental motivation of a logician is to give purely
<br />
syntactical formula and rules for manipulating formula so that
<br />
we can reason and communicating reasoning *without* any
<br />
meaning. The traditional joke is that a logician does not
<br />
want understand what he talk about!
<br />
When you do that you fall automatically on the following sort
<br />
of problem:
<br />
<br />Take a formal theory like S4, again:
<br />
(I suppose a language with the usual logical symbol
<br />
including the propositional constant f and t, + the [])
<br />
<br /><br />AXIOMS:   &lt;axioms of classical propositional logic&gt;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[](p -&gt; q) -&gt; ([]p -&gt; []q)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[]p -&gt; p
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[]p -&gt; [][]p
<br />
<br />RULES:    p p-&gt;q       p
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--------,    ---
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q         []p
<br />
<br /><br />This gives at once an infinity of formula: those derivable
<br />
from the axioms by using finitely many times the rules.
<br />
<br />I recall that -p is an abbreviation for (p-&gt;f), and &lt;&gt;p is
<br />
an abbreviation for -[]-p.
<br />
<br />The question is: is the formula []p -&gt; &lt;&gt;[]p derivable in S4?
<br />
Now that question is not so hard and you can solve it *syntactically*.
<br />
Just find a pathway from the axioms to the formula by using the
<br />
rules of inference. (That is: just prove []p -&gt; &lt;&gt;[]p in S4).
<br />
But I can say this because I know the solution!
<br />
Now logician want not only prove theorems in their system, they
<br />
want also know if the system is consistent, that is, if the system
<br />
does not prove f, and question like that.
<br />
For example, and this is a *very* difficult exercise, try to prove
<br />
that S4 does *not* prove the formula p -&gt; &lt;&gt;[]p.
<br />
<br />Before the rise of semantics such question was almost not answerable
<br />
in general. You cannot solve them by searching all the proofs
<br />
because you have an infinity of proofs.
<br />
<br />Something like Kripke semantics makes such an exercise very easy,
<br />
once you have soundness and completeness metatheorem relating your
<br />
logic (here S4) with the semantics.
<br />
<br />Now it not very difficult to prove such completeness and soundness
<br />
theorem for system as simple as S4 (see also ref in the archive
<br />
below). I give you only the two main metatheorems we can use here.
<br />
<br />I recall that a Kripke frame is just a set (of &quot;worlds&quot;) with some
<br />
binary relation among them (the accessibility relation).
<br />
A model is a frame with, for each world w, a function from L in {0,1}.
<br />
L = our set of propositional letters {p, q, r, ...}.
<br />
(That is: a model assigns truth to the proposition in each world).
<br />
I recall also that classical logic is verify in each world, that is:
<br />
if p is true in world w and q is true in world w, then &quot;p-&gt;q&quot; is
<br />
true in world w, etc. Now the S4/Kripke-semantics soundness
<br />
and completeness (S&amp;C) metatheorem is:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&amp;C theorem: S4 proves A if and only if A is true in any
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world of any model based on a reflexive and transitive frame.
<br />
<br />Now, if &quot;p -&gt; []&lt;&gt;p&quot; was derivable in S4 it would follow from
<br />
the S&amp;C metatheorem that &quot;p -&gt; []&lt;&gt;p&quot; would be true in any world
<br />
of any model based on a reflexive and transitive frame.
<br />
<br />So, to prove that &quot;p -&gt; []&lt;&gt;p&quot; is not a theorem of S4 it is
<br />
enough to find a model based on a reflexive and transitive frame
<br />
in which  &quot;p -&gt; []&lt;&gt;p&quot; is false in some world.
<br />
<br />Let us build that counterexample. For having &quot;p -&gt; []&lt;&gt;p&quot; false
<br />
in a world w1, by classical logic, you need a world with &quot;p&quot; true
<br />
in it, and &quot;[]&lt;&gt;p&quot; false in it, i.e. &quot;-[]&lt;&gt;p&quot; true in it.
<br />
But &quot;-[]&lt;&gt;p&quot; is equivalent with &quot;&lt;&gt;[]-p&quot;, so it is enough to join
<br />
a unique world w2 with &quot;-p&quot; true in it.
<br />
Our counterexample is:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frame = {w1, w2}
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accessibility relation R is given by w1Rw1, w2Rw2, w1Rw2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(if you prefer: R = {(w1 w1) (w2 w2) (w1 w2)}
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The model is given by making p true in w1, and false in w2.
<br />
R being reflexive and transitive, and &quot;p -&gt; []&lt;&gt;p&quot; being false at
<br />
w1, &quot;p -&gt; []&lt;&gt;p&quot; has been shown not derivable in S4.
<br />
<br /><br />Another use of Kripke C&amp;S result is to show that S4, for example,
<br />
is decidable (and then write a theorem prover for S4). This is easy
<br />
if you succeed in refining the completeness part of the C&amp;S theorem
<br />
above with &quot;finite frame&quot; instead of any frame. In that case
<br />
you know that if a counterexample exist you can find it.
<br />
<br />But Kripke semantics is useless with a &quot;non normal&quot;
<br />
logic, for example a modal logic without the necessitation rule.
<br />
Chellas excellent book has a chapter on Scott-Montague semantics
<br />
(also known as &quot;minimal model&quot;) which can be used in the same
<br />
way for weaker modal logic. The Scott-Montague semantics gives
<br />
&quot;topological&quot; or &quot;quasi-topological&quot; structure on the set of worlds.
<br />
In Kripke []p is true at world w if p is true at all worlds x such
<br />
that wRx. In Scott-Montague semantics []p is true at w if the set
<br />
of worlds in which p is true belongs to the neighborhoods of w.
<br />
Just to give you an idea of another semantics for modal logic.
<br />

<br /><br />PS I recall my conversation on modal logic with George Levy in
<br />
this list. For example:
