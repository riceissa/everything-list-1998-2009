<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think of time from the third person perspective as being simply a higher

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spatial dimension above 3 dimensional volume in the same way that 3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimensional volume exists above 2 dimensional area.  In other words it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really the same as the other dimensions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So your comment about &quot;3 dimensional time&quot; is sort of right, but it is of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course actually 4 dimensional.  This means there are connections and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationships between points in this &quot;hyperspace&quot; that we can't imagine with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our normal thought process because it is obviously something more than 3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimensional volume.  
</em><br />
<br />No, 3-d time would be quite different to the standard 4-d block
<br />
universe of general relativity.  Even in relativity, the time
<br />
dimension is not exactly the same as the spatial dimenions.  3-d time
<br />
would result in a 6-d block universe (the standard 3-dimensions of
<br />
space, plus 3 extra time dimensions).
<br />
<br />In any event, I've kinda modified my ideas and am not longer
<br />
postulating three time dimenions in a literal sense.  What I'm
<br />
suggesting is simply that there may be more than one valid way to
<br />
define causality and it may arise from the fact that there are
<br />
different levels of organization.  I'm a non-reductionist.  Although I
<br />
agree there may be physical properties associated with everything,
<br />
there are many different levels of organization and I'm skeptical that
<br />
higher level properties of systems are entirely reducible to
<br />
explanations in terms of the lowest level properties.  This would
<br />
allow for the possibility of there being more than one valid measure
<br />
of time flow.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This 4 dimensional thing is eternal, and is the multiverse.  Actually that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not even correct because it implies the passage of an infinite amount of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time.  Time is ultimately the relationships between things and how those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationships change.  So for the entire multiverse it exists outside of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time, or more accurately time exists as a part of it so it does not make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense to discuss the whole in the context of time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From the first person point of view the sum is greater than the parts.  No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual frame of reference creates an observer moment because it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obviously takes the passage of some time (passage of time being another way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of saying a string of individual universe frames in the first person point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of view).  Therefore the illusion of time passing and moving in one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direction is simply a result of the nature of consciousness.  Consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involves linear thought process and we of course only seem to experience one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outcome as you follow the line of existence of the SAS (that acronym used to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be used a lot around here!) through the multiverse.  From the 3rd person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective, the existence of the SAS is a 4 dimensional space in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diagram (covering its existence in every universe it is described in), but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again from its perspective on the diagram it is a one dimensional line
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through points in the 4 dimensional hyperspace it existed.  This is of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course its self-perceived time line.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This idea may give us a theory as to the total information capacity of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse, which may not be infinite.  It may also explain the holographic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principal, as suggested by Colin Bruce a few years ago.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />There is no doubt that the nature of consciousness is closely
<br />
associated with time in some way - but exactly how?  The relationship
<br />
between time (time flow and also causality) may be far closer than
<br />
many realize.  Could consciousness in fact be *identical* to time in
<br />
some peculiar sense?  This is in fact what I'm getting at with my
<br />
suggestion that there may be more than one valid way to define
<br />
causality.
