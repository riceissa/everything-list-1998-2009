<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bruno: But we can photosynthesize. And we can understand why we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cannot travel at the speed of light. All this by using purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 3-person description of those phenomena in some theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; With consciousness, the range of the debate goes from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; non-existence to only-existing. The problem is that it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that an entirely 3-person explanation of the brain-muscles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relations evacuates any purpose for consciousness and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1-person. That's not the case with photosynthesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can photosynthesize? I certainly can not (not being a tree). If I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; photosynthetic pigments in my skin, I suppose I could; and if I had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rubbery
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wings and sharp teeth I'd be a bat (if my aunt had wheels, she'd be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wagon). I still can not see (intellectually) the &quot;problem&quot; of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />I said I can photosynthetize, like I would said I can fly by taking a 
<br />
plane. I can photosynthetize by building some voltaic cells. This is 
<br />
not the case with the brain-consciousness relation. A thorough 
<br />
understanding of how the brain functions *seems* to put away any 
<br />
purpose of consciousness. A thorough understanding of photosynthesis 
<br />
does not lead to an equivalent problem.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I still can not see (intellectually) the &quot;problem&quot; of consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />It is the problem of relating first person subjective private 
<br />
experience with third person sharable theories and experiments. There 
<br />
is a vast literature. A good intro is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tye, M. (1995). Ten problems of consciousness. The MIT Press, 
<br />
Cambridge, Massachusetts.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consciousness /qualia, 1st person phenomena, etc, IMHO, being very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; poorly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined,
</em><br />
<br />Universes, matter, existence,... are also not well defined. Perhaps you 
<br />
are not interested in such problems. The success of &quot;natural science&quot; 
<br />
is due in great part to the simplifying assumption of 
<br />
psychophysico-parallelism. I have proved such an assumption is just 
<br />
incompatible with the computationalist assumption in cognitive science.
<br />
I have also reduce the problem of the existence of the 1-person to the 
<br />
problem of the existence of third person sharable truth. And partially 
<br />
solve it.
<br />
My problem: few physicist knows what axiomatic methodology is. It is 
<br />
the art of reasoning without even trying to define the concept on which 
<br />
we reason. We need just to agree on properties bearing on those things, 
<br />
captured by formula and inference rules. Mathematicians proceed in this 
<br />
way since more than one century now.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and likely non-existing entities,
</em><br />
<br />What about the person's right? What about pleasure and pain, ... It 
<br />
seems to me you just excluded those things from your definition of 
<br />
science, and I'm afraid you make the category error I have describe 
<br />
recently.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; are a precarious pillar to base
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any cosmology or metaphysics on.
</em><br />
<br />With comp, we just have no choice in the matter. If you are interested 
<br />
at some point we can follow the proof step by step. I'm always 
<br />
interested where, precisely, some people have some difficulties.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To borrow a page from Penrose, I see qualia in much the same light as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shadow.
</em><br />
<br />As an (arithmetical) platonist this is how I conceive anything 
<br />
physical. Qualia are more colourful it seems to me. Wave lenght looks 
<br />
more like shadows imo.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everyone can agree what a shadow is, point to one, and talk about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them. But a shadow is not a thing. The ancients made much ado about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shadows,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ascribing all sorts of metaphysical significance and whatnot to them. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think it is quite likely that the fuss about consciousness and qualia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resurrects this old mistake. Shadows of the mind, indeed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Observer&quot; is far superior, and lacks the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taint of dualism.
</em><br />
<br />As Stephen knows comp leads to monism. In a nutshell there is only 
<br />
numbers.
<br />
And numbers (under the form of digital machine) can provided a complete 
<br />
(and startling) explanation why, from their point of views, it looks 
<br />
there is much more than numbers, and why necessarily it takes the shape 
<br />
of a 1-3 person distinction.
