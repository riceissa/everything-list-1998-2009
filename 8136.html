<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By 'perceivable' I don't necessarily mean 'perceived by humans', what 
</em><br />
I mean is 'perceivable *in principle* ( i.e. by some mind, somewhere in 
<br />
the universe).
<br />
<br />I admit my misunderstanding, and that you are talking about the 
<br />
unperceivable rather than the unperceived, so the argument about 
<br />
eliminating the motivation to discover does not apply, although it does 
<br />
apply to those that reject the existence of an objective reality.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Reality can only ever be understood from the perspective of a mind.
</em><br />
<br />Are you willing to admit that you have to be agnostic (by definition!) 
<br />
about the fact that there could be reality that can't be understood by 
<br />
a mind?
<br />
<br />What I'm asking is: Why do you limit metaphysics, at the outset, to 
<br />
being &quot;for the purposes of understanding general intelligence?&quot; On the 
<br />
other hand, how do we know what &quot;general&quot; intelligence is if all we 
<br />
have is our human understanding?  Thus my example of conscious stars 
<br />
which are enlightened about the universe in ways that don't even fit 
<br />
into our mind's capability of understanding what enlightened can mean.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore only things capable of (in principle) making a difference 
</em><br />
to perceived reality need to be taken into account when devising 
<br />
ultimate theories of metaphysics.
<br />
<br />Is not there a difference between things that &quot;(in principle)&quot; can 
<br />
never make a difference to perceived reality (i.e. unperceivable by 
<br />
some logical contradiction to perceivability, but yet existing 
<br />
somehow), and things that never will make a difference to perceived 
<br />
reality because of the limitations of minds (in general)?  I admit that 
<br />
we can't include the former, but what about the latter?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think the 'perceivable in principle' requirement contradicts 
</em><br />
mathematical Platonism.   What makes you think that mathematical 
<br />
objects aren't perceivable?  True, most *humans* can't perceive 
<br />
mathematical things, but that's probably just a limitation of the human 
<br />
mind.   I think that a mind sufficiently talented at math *could* in 
<br />
principle directly perceive mathematical objects.  Kurt Godel claimed 
<br />
that it was possible to directly perceive mathematical objects.   He 
<br />
even thought the mind was capable of directly perceiving infinite sets.
<br />
<br />What if the proof of Goldbach's Conjecture was such that it could not 
<br />
be perceived by a mind?  Doesn't our incomplete picture of the mind 
<br />
allow for such a possibility?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; THE BRAIN is wider than the sky,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   For, put them side by side,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The one the other will include  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   With ease, and you beside.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-Emily Dickinson
</em><br />
<br />In all of the history of humans' exploration of the universe, the 
<br />
perpetual message that keeps coming back to us from the universe is 
<br />
that the brain is not as wide as the sky.  I think that trying to make 
<br />
an &quot;end run&quot; around &quot;everything&quot; and starting with the doctrine that it 
<br />
is, is not a new thing (even to the ancient Greeks), but it contradicts 
<br />
the evidence.
