You guys  should get a copy of my new self-published book.  It is
<br />
entitled &quot;A Single Particle Universe, The Simplest Yet Theory of
<br />
Everything&quot;.  According to my theory, the single particle is a mass-less
<br />
point particle with a charge of +e or -e.  The particles, I call
<br />
tronnies, attract their opposites and repel their own kind with
<br />
Coulomb-like forces that expand out at the speed of light.  The
<br />
particles also repel themselves so their speed can never be less than
<br />
the speed of light.  This is possible because they have no mass.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Photons are comprised of a plus tronnie and a minus tronnie (net zero
<br />
charge) circling in a circle with a diameter equal to half the photon
<br />
wavelength).  In the photon frame of reference each tronnie travels
<br />
around the circumference of the  circle at 1.57 times c.  It's force
<br />
field traveling at c from the opposite side of the circle provides a
<br />
repelling force that maintains the diameter of the photon.  The two
<br />
tronnies circle because they are attracted to each other.  Each of the
<br />
circling tronnies also push itself in the photon  direction at the
<br />
speed of light.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
An electron (negatron) is comprised of two minus tronnies and a plus
<br />
tronnie (net -e charge) and a positron is  comprised of two plus
<br />
tronnies and a minus tronnie (net +e charge).  Neutrinos are very high
<br />
frequency photons (net zero charge and a very very small diameter
<br />
corresponding to its high frequency).  Electrons and positrons can and
<br />
do  capture neutrinos greatly (by up to several hundred times)
<br />
increasing their mass/energy.  High mass/energy electrons and positrons
<br />
combine to form protons.  So a proton is comprised of at least one
<br />
electron, two  positrons and  the three captured neutrinos that add up
<br />
to 15 tronnies, (8 plus and 7 minus so the charge is +e and  the mass is
<br />
1,800 times the electron mass).  The proton can also capture photons but
<br />
with longer wavelengths (for example, gamma rays).  A neutron is a
<br />
proton combined with a high energy electron.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Neutrinos are the carriers of gravity.  Coulomb force fields expand out
<br />
behind the neutrinos in the direction of the source of the neutrinos.
<br />
The neutrino rides in  front of these expanding force fields like a boat
<br />
riding in  front of its wake.  These force fields expanding behind the
<br />
neutrinos push charged particles in matter through which they are
<br />
passing toward the neutrino source.  This is gravity.  Neutrinos from
<br />
the sun passing through the earth (100 million per square cm per second)
<br />
push the earth toward the sun.  Neutrinos trapped in the  earth and
<br />
later released in random directions provide the earth's gravity.
<br />
Neutrinos from a black hole in the center of our galaxy hold our galaxy
<br />
together.  The Universe is expanding because neutrinos are captured by
<br />
hydrogen in intergalactic space but much longer wavelength photons are
<br />
not.  These much longer wavelength photons are pushing galaxies apart at
<br />
the present time.  Later on  when more of the hydrogen in intergalactic
<br />
space has been sucked into black holes the neutrinos will become more
<br />
effective relative to the  longer wavelength photons and will begin
<br />
compressing the Universe ultimately into a single black hole that will
<br />
shrink to the size of a basketball as molecules, atoms and photons are
<br />
broken down to the basic + and - tronnies.  Then this black will
<br />
experience the next Big Bang initiating the next universe.  The initial
<br />
expansion can be several billion light years in a fraction of a second
<br />
since there is no limit to how fast tronnies can travel if they are not
<br />
tied to an opposite tronnie in a photon or an electron.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
So ours in only one Universe in a long string of a series of universes.

<br />
<br /><br />Hi, Hal,
<br />
I like your nihilistic (oops: zero-based) ontology as a representation
<br />
of our knowledge. Beyond that:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I tried to cut out the 'expansion' as a cute idea which got only a
<br />
justification by ignorance: 
<br />
it was applicable and no other reasonable proposition was competing with
<br />
the millions of slanted (theory laden) experiments to prove it - all
<br />
assuming in advance that it is true. 
<br />
Hubble was a genius. Not &quot;god's&quot; prophet. He may be right (not
<br />
necessarily).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In your logic, if 'everything' increases within (including inter- and
<br />
intraatomic measures, even an expanding space), does it make sense to
<br />
speak about an unobservable overall change? We, our views, the details,
<br />
the connections, all change the same way. Is it a fata morgana, if
<br />
everything stays the same, we just say that the total is getting bigger?
<br />
(while the universe? - space? being infinite?) 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I tried to circumvent this obstacle in my narrative for a beginning
<br />
(without a &quot;creator&quot;), by assigning 'space' (and 'time) to *our*
<br />
organization of *our* universe from within. So 'my' 
<br />
infinite means: the edge of defining space - no such measure beyond
<br />
that.  
<br />
Any other &quot;edge&quot; has something beyond it. (Einstein's joke: north of the
<br />
North Pole?)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Like George, I can dream up occasions for a redshift beside a slow-down.
<br />
<br />The conventional physical edifice resulting in missing (dark) things and
<br />
controversies is the result of views (and calculations!) from an age
<br />
with less epistemic cognitive inventory to base upon, wishful postulates
<br />
upon the then logical explanatory trials (discount phlogiston) in
<br />
concepts not identified to meet our present scrutiny (energy? gravity?
<br />
their prodigies?) 
<br />
but used as base in our religious-like belief system of 'physics. 
<br />
Russell scolded me some years back: Don't I dare call his science a
<br />
'religion&quot; - well I don't 
<br />
but it is a belief system. 
<br />
This list started to attempt to break loose from it - but too many
<br />
conventional physicist-opinions terrorized many free spirits back into
<br />
the 75 subsequent college-generations-brainwashed
<br />
'physicist'-community-memes of classical and well calculated physical
<br />
thought. 
<br />
Becuase it is efficient and productive it is not necessarily true (like
<br />
the redshift).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
As George said: &quot;I now humbly wait for rebuttals ...&quot; not offers to go
<br />
elsewhere, because even if I get silenced, after many years of
<br />
participation, I still want to read this list. 
<br />

<br /><br />Hi George:
<br />
<br />The idea at least for my point of view is more along the lines that the
<br />
multiverse is a form of Nothing something like 256/256 is a form of 1
<br />
and [256/256 - 239/239] is another form of zero.  
<br />
<br />By the way the idea is that space itself expands.  This mechanism does
<br />
not slow photons but rather increases their wavelength.

It seems most logical, to me anyway, that the Universe is truly infinite
<br />
in time and space. Nothing 
<br />
created it, it will never end, and that is more logical, to me, than
<br />
arising from nothingness.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The whole modern concept of big bang etc. is mostly based on Hubble's
<br />
red shift. 
<br />
When I read articles about the cosmos' origins and recent astronomy
<br />
discoveries,
<br />
I keep imagining immense distances and all kinds of possible
<br />
ATTENUATIONS of light and gravity
<br />
from distances that we haven't seen. At least not yet Gravity from
<br />
further reaches of the same U slows 
<br />
light photons and therefore RED SHIFTS the light. I know, the same
<br />
general gravity should act 
<br />
the same everywhere and therefore not attenuate, but I can imagine a
<br />
relative kind of attenuation
<br />
because the light or gravity photon or wave does become affected by all
<br />
sorts of local gravities
<br />
on its way to us. Why not just like the way light is bent around Mercury
<br />
or gravity by Jupiter?
<br />
The immense distances would allow for multiple interactions and a
<br />
gradual slowing or red shift.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
So we don't need the big bang. The church likes it because it allows for
<br />
a creator.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
And the missing energy or mass or dark matter..
<br />
Why not just our parallel universe operating in a kind of 180 opposite
<br />
direction from ours.
<br />
Where else would those positrons and other fleeting particles have to
<br />
go? Into our sister Universe, I 
<br />
would guess.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I have been looking for a forum to express these views....and since I
<br />
know of no one else..
<br />
Everything-list people might be it. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I now humbly wait for rebuttals and offers to go elsewhere.
<br />
&nbsp;

George
