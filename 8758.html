Hi Marc --
<br />
<br />it's interesting to wonder about &quot;what it would be like&quot; to directly  
<br />
perceive mathematics -- but we also have to acknowledge when we ask  
<br />
the question, what are the philosophical assumptions we're smuggling  
<br />
along.  For instance, the human brain is not capable of direct  
<br />
perception of tables, either.
<br />
<br />What raises a flag for me in your question is the following apparent  
<br />
dichotomy:
<br />
1) &quot;The human brain is not capable of direct perception of  
<br />
mathematical entities&quot;
<br />
2) &quot;We could imagine some super-intelligence that possessed this  
<br />
ability . . .&quot;
<br />
<br />It seems what you're encouraging us to do is this: think about of  
<br />
what it's like when we see a table, and then say to ourselves  
<br />
something like the following sentence: &quot;It would be like that, but  
<br />
with *math*&quot;.  But what makes us think we can imagine this situation  
<br />
coherently?  Light from a table excites our photoreceptors in a well- 
<br />
understood way - how could an equation do that?
<br />
<br />I have always thought it strange how McGinn and others eagerly apply  
<br />
&quot;cognitive closure&quot; to some of the very areas where we have made  
<br />
recent amazing progress in understanding!  In the case of math, what  
<br />
exactly is it that motivates your intuition that there might be  
<br />
something more that we're missing?  And is it something that would  
<br />
not apply trivially to any other thing (i.e. - I can look at a rock  
<br />
on the ground, and say to myself, &quot;There's something else about this  
<br />
rock that I'm not sensing - but I could imagine a superintelligence  
<br />
who could perceive what I'm missing.&quot;  My ability to say this  
<br />
sentence to myself doesn't demonstrate anything interesting about the  
<br />
rock.)
<br />
<br />Best regards
<br />
Pete

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A series of intuitions I've been having have started to suggest to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me that mathematics may not at all be what we think it is!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The idea of 'cognitive closure' (Colin McGinn) looms large here.   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The human brain is not capable of direct perception of mathematical

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities.  We cannot 'see' mathematics directly in the same way we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'see' a table for instance.  This of course may not say much about  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the nature of mathematics, but more about the limitations of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human brain.  Suppose then, that some variant of platonism is true  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and mathematical entities exist 'out there' and there is *in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle* a modality ( a method of sensory perception like  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hearing, sight, taste) for direct perception of mathematics.  We  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could imagine some super-intelligence that possessed this ability  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to directly perceive mathematics.  What would this super- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence 'see' ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps there's something of enormous importance about the nature  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of mathematics that every one has over-looked so far, something  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that would be obvious to the super-intelligence with the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical modality?  Are we all over-looking some incredible  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truths here?  Again, McGinn's idea of cognitive closure is that the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human brain may be 'cognitively closed' with respect to some truths  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the physical equipment is not up to the job - like the way  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a dog cannot learn Chinese for instance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For one thing:  Are platonic mathematical entities really static  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and timeless like platonist philosophers say?  What if platonic  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical entities can 'change state' somehow ?  What if they're  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamic?  And what if the *movement* of platonic mathematics  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities *are* Qualia (conscious experiences).  Are there any  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical truths which may be time indexed (time dependent)?  Or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are all mathematical truths really fixed?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Platonists says that mathematics under-pins reality, but what  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the *relationship* between mathematical, mental (teleological)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and physical properties?  How do mental (teleological/volitional)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and physical properties *emerge* from mathematics?  That's what  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every one is missing and what has not been explained.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So... think on my questions.  Is there something HUGE we all  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; missing as regards the nature of mathematics?  Is mathematics  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really what you think it is? ;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Till shade is gone, till water is gone, into the shadow with teeth  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bared, screaming defiance with the last breath, to spit in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sightblinder's eye on the last day&quot;
