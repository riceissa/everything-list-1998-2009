</em><br />
I recall RITSIAR = Real In The Same Sense That I Am Real (introduced by 
<br />
Peter).

<br />
Now, the notion of existence is very difficult, and the notion of 
<br />
&quot;personal existence&quot; is still more difficult, and was the object of the 
<br />
debate.

<br />
Take the expression &quot;I am real&quot;. Does it mean &quot;I am real and this is 
<br />
something I cannot doubt about&quot;, in which case &quot;I&quot; refer to the first 
<br />
person, or is it  &quot;my physical body is real&quot;, in which case it refers 
<br />
to a third person description of &quot;I&quot; based on some theory (for example 
<br />
physics, or comp, etc.).

<br />
So RITSIAR is an highly ambiguous which presuppose many points we were 
<br />
arguing about.

<br />
Let me try shortly to make it less ambiguous in the frame of the AUDA. 
<br />
Now I cannot be 100% rigorous without being long and boring, so I ask 
<br />
you some indulgence, and I am just trying to convey the idea.

<br />
As you know I am realist or platonist about numbers and their 
<br />
arithmetical relations. For example I believe in theorem like &quot;all 
<br />
numbers can be written as a sum of four square&quot; (Lagrange theorem). I 
<br />
take such a truth as being completely independent of me, you, time, 
<br />
place. I take such truth as being primitive and beyond time and space, 
<br />
a-physical if you want.
<br />
Now I also believe in &quot;1-persons, or souls, etc&quot;. I am not a solipsist, 
<br />
and I really believe in my own current experience, but also in yours 
<br />
even if I am currently feeling them differently.

<br />
I don't believe at all that a first person experience is a number, nor 
<br />
do I believe any first person can believe to be a number. Still, I 
<br />
assume comp, so there must be a relation between 1-person experience 
<br />
and numbers. Indeed persons can manifest themselves relatively to me 
<br />
when they are related to some computations (brain activity with comp 
<br />
and some high substitution level for making things simple). Those 
<br />
computations define or are defined by complex set of counterfactuals, 
<br />
and UDA shows that physics emerge or should emerge (with comp) from 
<br />
their structure. It is plausible because quantum logic can already be 
<br />
seen as a logic of counterfactuals. How to get them, and what the 
<br />
results will say for RITSIAR ?

<br />
Let me give you all the person point of views (pov), that is the 
<br />
&quot;complete science and theology&quot; of a simple lobian machine like PA 
<br />
(Peano Arithmetic). It is a fact that if M1 and M2 are lobian machine, 
<br />
and if M2 has stronger provability abilities than M1, then M2 can prove 
<br />
both the science and the theology of M1. But NO lobian machine can 
<br />
prove its own theology without becoming inconsistent, they can only 
<br />
abductively infer their own theology:

<br />
0-person pov = arithmetical truth. This can be shown &quot;ineffable&quot; or non 
<br />
definable by the machine (Tarski theorem). In the arithmetical 
<br />
interpretation of Plotinus' &quot;TOE&quot;, it corresponds to the ONE. It is the 
<br />
big unameable entity at the origin of all forms of existence.

<br />
3-person pov = arithmetical provability. It is the self-referential 
<br />
godelian provability predicate. The fundamental thing here is that the 
<br />
incompleteness phenomenon splits it into two parts, each of which are 
<br />
captured by a modal logic: G and G* respectively. G captures what the 
<br />
machine can prove about herself, and G* captures in addition what is 
<br />
true about the machine but unprovable by the machine (like 
<br />
self-consistency for example). G axiomatizes the self-referentially 
<br />
correct &quot;science&quot; of the machine, and G* minus G axiomatizes the 
<br />
correct &quot;theology&quot; that the machine can infer without proving (its 
<br />
&quot;hope-space&quot; if you want).
<br />
In the arithmetical interpretation of Plotinus' &quot;TOE&quot;, it corresponds 
<br />
to the INTELLECT. Terrestrial or discursive = G, divine = G*.
<br />
Please note that G and G* capture self-referentially correct *3-person* 
<br />
statements, like someone talking about his own brain with his doctor. 
<br />
It is &quot;I&quot; with &quot;I&quot; = my 3-description of my &quot;body&quot;. It is not the &quot;I&quot; 
<br />
with &quot;I = my soul, or my experiences&quot; ...

<br />
The 1-person point of view. I identify him/it/her with the 
<br />
&quot;incorrigible knower&quot;. By Godel's second incompleteness theorem, no 
<br />
correct machine can prove its own incorrigibility. But that fact makes 
<br />
it possible to define the knower by making the explicit conjunction of 
<br />
truth and provability, for example by defining a new modal connector 
<br />
like Kp = Bp &amp; p. This is what actually Theaetetus has proposed to 
<br />
Socrates when Socrates asked him to define knowledge. Kp makes both 
<br />
truth and provability participating in the knower, like in Plotinus. In 
<br />
fact, quite amazing things appears here. First &quot;Bp &amp; p&quot; cannot be 
<br />
directly defined in the language of the lobian machine, making the 
<br />
&quot;soul&quot; or the first person unnamable, like the big ONE. Secondly the 
<br />
logic of Kp (which *is* completely *defined* in G and G*) appears to be 
<br />
a temporal logic of a self-extending self, and it can be related the 
<br />
brouwer &quot;creative subject&quot; philosophy in intuitionistic logic. This is 
<br />
confirmed also by the fact that G and G* completely agree on Kp. G* 
<br />
does not add anything: the soul of the machine is bound up to confuse 
<br />
proof and truth, the Kp logic (already known in the logician literature 
<br />
as S4Grz) does not split into two like the intellect.
<br />
In the arithmetical interpretation of Plotinus' &quot;TOE&quot;, it corresponds 
<br />
to the &quot;ALL SOUL&quot; or &quot;universal SOUL&quot;. It is a good candidate for a 
<br />
simple form of first person pov.

<br />
The 1-person plural pov. This is the consistent believer. It is defined 
<br />
by Cp = Bp &amp; ~B~p. Or equivalently Bp &amp; ~B~t.  (with t = any tautology) 
<br />
Again by incompleteness, although it is equivalent with both Bp and Bp 
<br />
&amp; p at the G* level, it obeys different logic, and here the G and G* 
<br />
difference does again split it into two. In the arithmetical 
<br />
interpretation of Plotinus' &quot;TOE&quot;, it corresponds to the &quot;INTELLIGIBLE 
<br />
MATTER&quot;. It is here that a logic of counterfactual, or a quantum logic 
<br />
appears. It is the logic of probability on observable proposition. 
<br />
Actually the quantum appears only at the G* level, and this can be used 
<br />
to show that &quot;we&quot; (the first person plural) share the quantum 
<br />
splitting: here we recover Everett. The price of that is that the 
<br />
&quot;quanta&quot; have to be just a case of sharable qualia. Note that it is the 
<br />
difference between the 1-person and the 1-plural person which prevents 
<br />
comp from solipsism. I call its modal logic Z.

<br />
The incorrigible 1-person plural pov. This one is again an &quot;intensional 
<br />
(modal) variant&quot; of G. It is defined by Op = Cp &amp; p = Bp &amp; ~B~p &amp; p. It 
<br />
is also split into two by G and G*. In the arithmetical interpretation 
<br />
of Plotinus' &quot;TOE&quot;, I would say it corresponds to the &quot;SENSIBLE 
<br />
MATTER&quot;, its G* part gives an astonishing non trivial notion of 
<br />
&quot;correct qualia&quot; (showing the existence of possible non correct qualia 
<br />
in the intelligible matter, this can be used to explain phantom limb, 
<br />
phantom body, phantom universe).

<br />
To sum up, and to relate this with RITSIAR, I would say that the 
<br />
unnamable reality (of the lobian machines PA, (resp. ZF ...))  is 
<br />
arithmetical truth, (resp. set-theoretical truth, ...) which is somehow 
<br />
beyond existence, and all form of existence are internal modalities of 
<br />
arithmetical (set theoretical, ...) truth.

<br />
Does this help a bit?

<br />
To be short I have not mentionned that the quantum appears only when I 
<br />
translate the comp hypothesis in the language of the machine. Now comp 
<br />
can be translated in G (and G*) into the formula &quot;p -&gt; Bp&quot;, so what I 
<br />
say above is true with G1 = G + &quot;p -&gt; Bp&quot;. To explain why comp is
<br />
&quot;p-&gt; Bp&quot;, we should dig deeper in recursion theory/computer science (cf 
<br />
the Wi and the Fi for those who remembers those posts). Of course you 
<br />
can also interview non computationalist machine, if you desire (good 
<br />
subject for a PhD thesis!).

<br />
Perhaps I could compare this with Spinoza Neutral Monism. The big 
<br />
0-person view (cf Nagel's view from nowhere) is truth, and all the form 
<br />
of existence (quanta, qualia, space, time, taxes, death ...) emerges 
<br />
from relatively canonical views from inside. Incompleteness makes this 
<br />
approach consistent, and comp makes it provable by any lobian machine 
<br />
M1 for any machine M2 when M1 is sufficiently stronger than M2. Then 
<br />
M1, by postulating comp, can lift abductively (and thus 
<br />
interrogatively) the M2 theology to itself.
