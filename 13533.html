<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;save&quot; the notion of consciousness, free will, responsibility, qualia,

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (first)-persons, and many notions like that.  Tthe &quot;only&quot; price: the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; notion of matter looses is fundamental character, and we have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explain matter without postulating it as usual ...). We have to come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; back (assuming comp) to Plato, or better Plotinus, Proclus, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How is assuming comp any better than believing in the personal God?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Because in general it is hard to make third person testable statements 
<br />
on personal God. Also, with comp, machines HAVE TO be &quot;theological 
<br />
machine&quot;. That is, comp does not prevent some &quot;mystical&quot; (true but 
<br />
unprovable) beliefs:  on the contrary, comp makes them obligatory (at 
<br />
least for the ideally correct machines).
<br />
<br />With comp we can argue that consciousness is already such a mystical 
<br />
state. It is a state such that  you have &quot;visions&quot; making you belief in 
<br />
&quot;a reality&quot;. Even cats can believe in invisible mouse, when hunting!
<br />
<br />The closer thing to consciousness for the lobian machine is the &quot;state 
<br />
of being consistent&quot;. With machine talking first order arithmetics, &quot;to 
<br />
be consistent&quot; can be identified (actually by 1930 Godel Completeness 
<br />
theorem) with &quot;having a unameable reality&quot; capable of satisfying your 
<br />
set of beliefs. and &quot;to be consistent&quot; belongs to machines' corona [G* 
<br />
minus G]. Indeed, by Godel second theorem, the machine statement &quot;to be 
<br />
consistent&quot; is true (as we can know for simple machine) but unprovable 
<br />
by the machine. After Godel we know that machine can understand/infer 
<br />
that any of their beliefs in a reality has to be theological, even the 
<br />
belief in a physical reality, or whatever.
<br />
<br />Few people seems to realize the immensity of impact of Godel's 
<br />
discovery (to begin by Godel himself as compared to Emil Post or Alan 
<br />
Turing, ...). Before Godel, after the work of Cantor, mathematicians 
<br />
were hoping to secure the many use of infinities in math by the 
<br />
finistic use of their names in finistic theories. After Godel, we know 
<br />
that we cannot secure the finistic realm itself and that we have to 
<br />
invoke higher infinities just to talk on those finite things. Before 
<br />
Godel we could have believe that the infinite can be secure by the 
<br />
finite. After Godel we know we have to rely on the infinites just to 
<br />
get a tiny scratch idea of what the finite things are capable of. This 
<br />
has given rise to the branch of logic known as &quot;model theory&quot;, for 
<br />
example, where infinite objects are used to give clues on finite 
<br />
theories.
<br />
<br />Note that I am not equating consciousness and consistency. But I am 
<br />
open to the idea that consciousness is related to unconscious 
<br />
(automatic, preprogrommed) self-interrogation of self-consistency. This 
<br />
makes possible to interpret Helmholtz theory of perception (as 
<br />
unconscious bet) in the lobian self-referential discourses.
<br />
<br />Because we got that &quot;mystical state&quot; at birth since most probably 
<br />
billions years, we tend to be a little blase about it, and this 
<br />
explains why we have to do some work to abstract from long-time 
<br />
prejudices, but then that is what science is all about (as Plato and 
<br />
Descartes have seen).
<br />
<br />(For the &quot;modalist&quot;, consciousness is not &quot;Dt&quot;, but &quot;Dt?&quot;. The 
<br />
interrogation mark remind that Dt belongs to G* minus G.)
<br />
<br />I have to go by now and I will try to explain soon why such an 
<br />
inference of &quot;Dt?&quot; gives some advantage relatively to some very general 
<br />
relative survival goal (mainly it gives a relative speed-up) ...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Comp seems like a lot of work.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes indeed. Two times more work than materialist are used to think. We 
<br />
have to isolate a &quot;theory of mind&quot; AND then, it remains to test the 
<br />
physical laws forced by that theory of mind, as the UDA and the 
<br />
arithmetical UDA justifies (or should justify).
<br />
<br />But the scientific attitude always asks for &quot;lot of works&quot;,as I just 
<br />
said above.
<br />
<br />C'mon Tom, we are not in a Holiday club here, are we?
<br />
<br />:)
