Eric's comments made me think about these two articles:

<br />
<br /><br />Change, time and information geometry
<br />
Authors: Ariel Caticha
<br />
<br />''Dynamics, the study of change, is normally the subject of mechanics.
<br />
Whether
<br />
the chosen mechanics is ``fundamental'' and deterministic or
<br />
``phenomenological'' and stochastic, all changes are described relative to
<br />
an external time. Here we show that once we define what we are talking
<br />
about, namely, the system, its states and a criterion to distinguish among
<br />
them, there is a single, unique, and natural dynamical law for irreversible
<br />
processes that is compatible with the principle of maximum entropy. In this
<br />
alternative dynamics changes are described relative to an internal,
<br />
``intrinsic'' time which is a derived, statistical concept defined and
<br />
measured by change itself. Time is quantified change.''
<br />
<br />And:

<br />
<br />Entropic Dynamics
<br />
Authors: Ariel Caticha
<br />
<br />''I explore the possibility that the laws of physics might be laws of
<br />
inference rather than laws of nature. What sort of dynamics can one derive
<br />
from well-established rules of inference? Specifically, I ask: Given
<br />
relevant information codified in the initial and the final states, what
<br />
trajectory is the system expected to follow? The answer follows from a
<br />
principle of inference, the principle of maximum entropy, and not from a
<br />
principle of physics. The entropic dynamics derived this way exhibits some
<br />
remarkable formal similarities with other generally covariant theories such
<br />
as general relativity.''
<br />
<br />Instead of identifying an observer moment with the exact information stored
<br />
in the ''brain'' of an observer, one could identify it with a probability
<br />
distribution over such precisely defined states. This seems more realistic
<br />
to me. No observer can be aware of all the information stored in his brain.
<br />
When I think about who I am, I am actually performing a measurement of some
<br />
average of the state my brain is in. After this measurement the probability
<br />
distribution will be updated. To apply Caticha's ideas, one has to identify
<br />
the measurements with taking averages over an ensemble of observers
<br />
described by the same probability distribution. In general this cannot be
<br />
true, but like in statistical mechanics, under certain conditions one is
<br />
allowed to replace actual averages involving only one system with averages
<br />
over a (hypothetical) ensemble.

Subject: Re: measure and observer moments
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Given temporal proximity of two states (e.g. observer-moments),
<br />
increasing difference between the states will lead to dramatically lower
<br />
measure/probability
<br />
&nbsp;for the co-occurrence as observer-moments of the same observer (or
<br />
co-occurrence in the
<br />
same universe, is that maybe equivalent?) .
<br />
<br />When I say two states S1, S4 are more different from each other whereas
<br />
states S1,S2 are less different
<br />
from each other, I mean that a complete (and yet fully abstracted i.e. fully
<br />
informationally compressed) informational
<br />
representation of the state (e.g. RS1) shares more identical (equivalent)
<br />
information with RS2 than it does with RS4.
<br />
<br />This tells us something about what time IS. It's a dimension in which more
<br />
(non-time) difference between
<br />
co-universe-inhabiting states can occur with a particular probability
<br />
(absolute measure) as  the states
<br />
get further from each other in the time of their occurrence. Things (states)
<br />
which were (nearly) the same can only
<br />
become more different from each other (or their follow-on most-similar
<br />
states can anyway) with the passage
<br />
of time (OR with lower probability in a shorter time.)
<br />
<br />Maybe?

<br />This means that the relative measure is completely fixed by the absolute
<br />
measure. Also the relative measure is no longer defined when
<br />
<br />probabilities
<br />
<br />are not conserved (e.g. when the observer may not survive an experiment
<br />
<br />as
<br />
<br />in quantum suicide). I don't see why you need a theory of consciousness.
<br />
<br />The theory of consciousness is needed because I think the conditional
<br />
probability of observer-moment A experiencing observer-moment B next
<br />
<br />should
<br />
<br />be based on something like the &quot;similarity&quot; of the two, along with the
<br />
absolute probability of B. This would provide reason to expect that my
<br />
<br />next
<br />
<br />moment will probably have most of the same memories, personality, etc. as
<br />
<br />my
<br />
<br />current one, instead of having my subjective experience flit about between
<br />
radically different observer-moments.
<br />
<br /><br />Such questions can also be addressed using only an absolute measure. So, why
<br />
doesn't my subjective experience ''flit about between  radically different
<br />
observer-moments''? Could I tell if it did? No! All I can know about are
<br />
memories stored in my brain about my ''previous'' experiences. Those
<br />
memories of ''previous'' experiences are part of the current experience. An
<br />
observer-moment thus contains other ''previous'' observer moments that are
<br />
consistent with it. Therefore all one needs to show is that the absolute
<br />
measure assigns a low probability to observer-moments that contain
<br />
inconsistent observer-moments.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />As for probabilities not being conserved, what do you mean by that? I am
<br />
assuming that the sum of all the conditional probabilities between A and
<br />
<br />all
<br />
<br />possible &quot;next&quot; observer-moments is 1, which is based on the quantum
<br />
immortality idea that my experience will never completely end, that I will
<br />
always have some kind of next experience (although there is some small
<br />
probability it will be very different from my current one).
<br />
<br /><br />I don't believe in the quantum immortality idea. In fact, this idea arises
<br />
if one assumes a fundamental conditional probability. I believe that
<br />
everything should follow from an absolute measure. From this quantity one
<br />
should derive an effective conditional probability. This probability will no
<br />
longer be well defined in some extreme cases, like in case of quantum
<br />
suicide experiments. By probabilities being conserved, I mean your condition
<br />
that ''the sum of  all the conditional probabilities between A and all
<br />
&nbsp;possible &quot;next&quot; observer-moments is 1'' should hold for the effective
<br />
conditional probability. In case of quantum suicide or amnesia (see below)
<br />
this does not hold.
<br />
<br /><br />Finally, as for your statement that &quot;the relative measure is completely
<br />
fixed by the absolute measure&quot; I think you're wrong on that, or maybe you
<br />
were misunderstanding the condition I was describing in that post.
<br />
<br /><br />I agree with you. I was wrong to say that it is completely fixed. There is
<br />
some freedom left to define it. However, in a theory in which everything
<br />
follows from the absolute measure, I would say that it can't be anything
<br />
else than P(S'|S)=P(S')/P(S)
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Imagine
<br />
<br />the multiverse contained only three distinct possible observer-moments, A,
<br />
B, and C. Let's represent the absolute probability of A as P(A), and the
<br />
conditional probability of A's next experience being B as P(B|A). In that
<br />
case, the condition I was describing would amount to the following:
<br />
<br />P(A|A)*P(A) + P(A|B)*P(B) + P(A|C)*P(C) = P(A)
<br />
P(B|A)*P(A) + P(B|B)*P(B) + P(B|C)*P(C) = P(B)
<br />
P(C|A)*P(A) + P(C|B)*P(B) + P(C|C)*P(C) = P(C)
<br />
<br />And of course, since these are supposed to be probabilities we should also
<br />
have the condition P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1, P(A|A) + P(B|A) + P(C|A) = 1 (A
<br />
must have *some* next experience with probability 1), P(A|B) + P(B|B) +
<br />
P(C|B) = 1 (same goes for B), P(A|C) + P(B|C) + P(C|C) = 1 (same goes for
<br />
<br /><br /><br />C). These last 3 conditions allow you to reduce the number of unknown
<br />
conditional probabilities (for example, P(A|A) can be replaced by (1 -
<br />
P(B|A) - P(C|A)), but you're still left with only three equations and six
<br />
distinct conditional probabilities which are unknown, so knowing the
<br />
<br />values
<br />
<br />of the absolute probabilities should not uniquely determine the
<br />
<br />conditional
<br />
<br />probabilities.
<br />
<br /><br />Agreed. The reverse is true. From the above equations, interpreting the
<br />
conditional probabilities P(i|j) as a matrix, the absolute probability is
<br />
the right eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 1.
<br />
<br /><br />Let P(S) denote the probability that an observer finds itself in state S.
<br />
Now S has to contain everything that the observer knows, including who he
<br />
is
<br />
and all previous observations he remembers making. The ''conditional''
<br />
probability that ''this'' observer will finds himself in state S' given
<br />
that
<br />
he was in state S an hour ago is simply P(S')/P(S).
<br />
<br />This won't work--plugging into the first equation above, you'd get
<br />
(P(A)/P(A)) * P(A) + (P(B)/P(A)) * P(B) + P(P(C)/P(A)) * P(C), which is
<br />
<br />not
<br />
<br />equal to P(A).
<br />
<br />You meant to say:
<br />
<br />''P(A)/P(A)) * P(A) + (P(A)/P(B)) * P(B) + P(A)/P(C) * P(C), which is not
<br />
&nbsp;equal to P(A).''
<br />
<br />This shows that in general, the conditional probability cannot be defined in
<br />
this way. In P(S')/P(S), S' should be consistent with only one S. Otherwise
<br />
you are considering the effects of amnesia. In such cases, you would expect
<br />
the probability to increase.
