</em><br />
<br />OK. In that sense we agree that the DU exist. I am glad to see that you 
<br />
are
<br />
a classical platonist. An intuitionist would'nt accept the idea that
<br />
something exist ... or not.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, in your macintosh example, the UD was itself implemented by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some other mathematical structure - your &quot;local decor&quot;.  Does that matter?
</em><br />
<br />A big part of my reasoning is that it *doesn't matter* indeed. For most
<br />
people this is a difficulty.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Actually, I would say that any mathematical structure that has real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;existance (in the strong sense) should be called &quot;physical&quot;.I do not know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of any better definition for &quot;physical existance&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />What is that strong sense of existence?  And why do you want to 
<br />
classify as physical any mathematical structures. 
<br />
If you do that (a little like Tegmark) you are obliged to explain how
<br />
we feel a difference between physicalness and mathematicalness (why is 
<br />
there math courses and physics courses) etc.
<br />
Tegmark, like Everett, *do* distinguish the first and third person, 
<br />
which helps to make sense of that idea. The physical would be
<br />
some mathematical structures sufficiently rich for having &quot;inside
<br />
point of views&quot; (through SAS point of views for exemple).
<br />
The physical point of view (pov) would correspond to these internal pov.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Nowhere did I say that _only_ a &quot;physical&quot; system could implement a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computation.  But you did bring to my attention the fact that I should make 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the definition of &quot;implementation&quot; more clear on this point.  In other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;places, I do point out that one computation can implement another.  (In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;turn, the second one might implement another, etc.; the first one will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;therefore implement all of those.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, your objection is irrelevant.  You do believe a UD implements other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computations.
</em><br />
<br />Sure. Yes. UD implements all computations, and even all implementations
<br />
of all computations.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Actuality is a first person concept.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   I have no clue as to what you mean.
</em><br />
<br />In Newtonian Physics one could imagine some third person time (objective
<br />
time), but since relativity I guess most believe that time is either
<br />
a parameter or do refer to some relative measurement done by an observer.
<br />
<br />&quot;Actuality&quot;, &quot;modern&quot;, &quot;here&quot;, &quot;now&quot;, &quot;there&quot;, &quot;elsewhere&quot;, are words 
<br />
with meaning dependent of the locutor. Indexicals, as the philosophers 
<br />
call them.
<br />
Most are true or false only from a first person point of view.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;3rd person view is everything you can communicate in a scientific manner 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;without taking into account the subjective view of a person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    If the person has some set of beliefs, they can be described as part of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the true description of the situation.  (Which you is what I thought you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;call the &quot;3rd person view&quot;.)
</em><br />
<br />Concerning *believes* the case is arguable. For *knowledge* I don't 
<br />
think you will ever succeed in describing them in some provable 
<br />
(objectively, 3-person) way.
<br />
This can be proved with very reasonable definition.
<br />
See ref by Benacerraf, or Kaplan and Montague in my thesis.
<br />
<br />(It is linked with that &quot;reconstruction of Lucas&quot; which makes difficult
<br />
for Schmidhuberians to locate an observer in *a* computational history, 
<br />
but
<br />
I think that point is obvious once you get the computational 
<br />
indeterminacy 
<br />
from the duplication thought experience).
<br />
<br />Science is (ideally) a pure 3-person discourse and will ever be. But with
<br />
definition of 1-person you can make science (i.e. 3-person discourses)
<br />
*about* the possible 1-person discourses.
<br />
I give two definitions of 1-person discourses. The first one appears
<br />
in the self duplication thought experiment, and is just &quot;personal 
<br />
memory&quot; (what is written  in *your* personal diary). The second one, 
<br />
which I use in the formal part of 
<br />
my work is the one given by Thaetetus to Socrate. Mathematically it
<br />
gives intuitionnistic logic (topos, constructive math, etc.).
<br />
The use of topos(*) by quantum cosmologist (cf Lee Smolin) is the logical
<br />
move made by those who want the other universal stories away.
<br />
It is cosmo-solipsism.
<br />
<br />Someone who would have only first person insight is a solipsist.
<br />
Someone who would have only third person insight is a zombie.
<br />
<br />If I duplicate myself succesfully in Washington and Moscow, both
<br />
Bruno1 and Bruno2 can communicates the success of the experience from
<br />
a third person point of view, but none can explain you that he feels
<br />
to be the Washingtonian (resp Moscovian) one.
<br />
<br />The difference between the first person and the third person is 
<br />
basically the same as the difference between having an headache and 
<br />
having a friend having an headhache.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From third person truth you need to bet on a theory (even as vague
</em><br />
as some &quot;habits&quot;). For first person truth you cannot bet on a theory,
<br />
it seems nature has done the bet for you. Humans are probably
<br />
animals which are learning to distinguish them.
<br />
The difference is indeed reflected in language through the distinction
<br />
between I and It/He/She.
<br />
<br />Some people says that that distinction is an illusion, OK, but 
<br />
then *I* show that Physics (F= ma, Schr. Eq.) is a by product of the
<br />
&nbsp;mathematics of that illusion. (it is a true illusion, and that
<br />
is why the word illusion is misleading).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Does &quot;merde&quot; have a special meaning, the way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;crap&quot; does?
</em><br />
<br />Some time ago &quot;merde&quot; was considered as very vulgar, but since then
<br />
it has been overthrown by &quot;shit&quot;, or worse ... &quot;Merde&quot; seems almost 
<br />
polite in comparison.
<br />
I don't know about &quot;crap&quot;. It seems to me we don't use that 
<br />
word (in Belgium).
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br /><br /><br />(*) Topos is the mathematical universe of a vast variety of 
<br />
intuitionnist/constructivist/solipsist/cosmo-solipsist.
<br />
The original use by Isham is more philosophically rigorous than
<br />
the one by Lee Smolin in his book &quot;three roads to quantum gravity&quot;.
<br />
Note that S4Grz gives rise to an arithmetical topos.
<br />
Nevertheless Lee Smolin's book (Weidenfeld and Nicolson,
<br />
London 2000) is very entertaining. And at last begin to ask 
<br />
what choose the physical law.
<br />
Toposes or topoi are mathematical first person. I am excitated
<br />
as seeing them appearing in physics. No doubt some will
<br />
believe (wrongly) that they makes the *other* universes 
<br />
dispensable.
<br />
A topos is a rich category, giving cool semantics for 
<br />
(intuitionistic) math. They have been invented/discovered
<br />
independently by Grothendieck (french) 
<br />
in the field of agebraic geometry and Lawvere (American) in
<br />
the field of the foundation of mathematics (in the middle
<br />
of last century (the 20e!)).
<br />
You can find Isham paper in the quant-ph.
