Information content of the brain
<br />
<br />Ralph Merkle, at <a href="http://www.merkle.com/cryo/techFeas.html#return5">http://www.merkle.com/cryo/techFeas.html#return5</a>, has
<br />
some estimates of the information content of the brain.  He is taking a
<br />
very conservative view and overestimating the content by looking at how
<br />
much information would be necessary to record every molecule in the brain.
<br />
He comes up with 50 bits per molecule, with 4E25 molecules in the brain
<br />
(99% of which are water).  This leads to an estimate of about 2E27 bits
<br />
to represent the entire brain.
<br />
<br />Another estimate he quotes is just for the information content of the
<br />
synapses in the cerebral cortex, which is 1E13 bits, and Merkle even
<br />
suggests that long term memories might involve only 1E9 bits.
<br />
<br />The gap between 1E13 and 2E27 (let alone 1E9) is embarrassingly large,
<br />
big enough to make it questionable whether these estimates are of any
<br />
value whatsoever.  However let us proceed and see what we can do with
<br />
these numbers.
<br />
<br /><br />Simulating a brain in isolation
<br />
<br />Suppose we want to write a program which will produce a simulation of
<br />
a typical human brain, as it experiences a life typical of those we
<br />
live today.  Let's suppose we want to simulate all its activity over a
<br />
70 year lifetime.  We don't want to simulate the rest of the universe,
<br />
we'll just simulate the brain and make it &quot;think&quot; it is interacting with
<br />
the universe.
<br />
<br />The actual brain simulation program itself will probably not be very
<br />
big compared to the larger numbers above.  It needs to simulate the
<br />
behavior of neurons, and possibly of other systems like the chemicals
<br />
which diffuse from the blood stream.  This will not be trivial, but the
<br />
chemistry involved is not all that complex.  Big programs today are a
<br />
few hundred megabytes, which would be small compared to 1E13, and the
<br />
simulator should not need to be bigger than that.  So the part of the
<br />
program that simulates brain internals is basically free.
<br />
<br />We also need to simulate the brain's input.  This is pretty hard since we
<br />
didn't want to simulate the universe that was going to give it the input.
<br />
What we need to do is to hard-wire the input which the brain will receive
<br />
over that 70 year period.  Everything the brain will see, hear, touch,
<br />
smell and taste over 70 years is going to be sitting in a table that our
<br />
program will provide.
<br />
<br />How much information is this?  How much &quot;bandwidth&quot; does the brain consume?
<br />
<br />TV is about 1E7 bits per second.  If we increase this by a factor of
<br />
10 it would roughly account for our visual input (we don't see as much
<br />
as it seems like; only a small part of our visual field is seen in high
<br />
resolution).  That gives 1E8 bits per second for vision.  Vision is the
<br />
primary sense modality for humans, but let's multiply it by a factor of
<br />
5 to account for the other senses (handwaving madly here!).  That gives
<br />
5E8 bits per second of input, over all modalities, for the human brain.
<br />
Over 70 years, which is 2E9 seconds, that gives a total of 1E18 bits
<br />
of input.
<br />
<br />This falls between the estimates above of brain information.  When we
<br />
encode this information in a table so that we can present it to our
<br />
simulated brain, we have to add it as part of the size of the input.
<br />
The result is to narrow our bracket, and put it from about 1E18 to
<br />
2E27 bits.
<br />
<br />That is the information for this method of simulating an entire human
<br />
lifetime, without trying to actually simulate the universe which the
<br />
human appears to live in.
<br />
<br /><br />Simulating a universe which evolves a brain
<br />
<br />We then ask how hard it would be to simulate a brain the old fashioned
<br />
way, by setting up a universe which uses the laws of physics that we
<br />
observe, and running it.
<br />
<br />We face a problem right at the beginning, here.  Our universe appears
<br />
to have a random component.  So we have some choices.  We can simulate
<br />
the universe as it appears, and include some mechanism in the program to
<br />
make random selections as specified by quantum mechanical measurements.
<br />
This mechanism could either be a software random number generator, or a
<br />
table of random bits which would be used to make the random choices.
<br />
Or, we could adopt a many-worlds approach, and simulate the universe
<br />
state without collapse.
<br />
<br />In any case, the physics involved is probably pretty simple.  We don't
<br />
have a full theory, but our best shots at it, the superstring and
<br />
membrane theories that try to marry QM and relativity, really aren't
<br />
very complicated.  I'm sure you could capture their essence in a few
<br />
megabytes or even kilobytes.
<br />
<br />The initial conditions, as far as we can tell, are also simple.  Matter
<br />
appears to have been quite uniformly distributed in the Big Bang.  This
<br />
bodes well for us, as it takes little information to specify a uniform
<br />
distribution, at least if we don't care about the details.
<br />
<br /><br />Simulating a random universe which has wave-function collapse
<br />
<br />However, incorporating the randomness of QM measurements introduces a
<br />
problem.  If we take the first approach, using a software random number
<br />
generator, it is unlikely that we will evolve humans, let alone humans
<br />
who observe a universe identical with ours.  With all the random events
<br />
that happened between the formation of the universe and our evolution,
<br />
the chances of repeating that exactly are virtually nil.
<br />
<br />If we used the second approach, a table of random values, we might be
<br />
able to force events to occur in such a way that humans would evolve.
<br />
But this would specifying, in this table, the outcome of every
<br />
quantum event that produces measurement-like wave function collapse.
<br />
These occur potentially billions of times per second, in billions of
<br />
places per centimeter, throughout the entire extent of the universe.
<br />
I haven't tried to work it out but if there are 1E80 particles in the
<br />
universe (as some people estimate) and the universe is 1E18 seconds old,
<br />
obviously we are talking about a very big number, much more than 1E100.
<br />
This amount of information would be overwhelmingly larger than the
<br />
stand-alone brain estimates.
<br />
<br /><br />Simulating a many-worlds universe
<br />
<br />The third approach, simulating many-worlds, has the advantage that
<br />
we don't have to put in any randomness.  Somewhere in the multiverse,
<br />
people are going to evolve.  But is that good enough?  The multiverse
<br />
is incredibly huge.  Instead of collapsing the wave function for every
<br />
atomic event, we now split it.  All those 1E100+ events are going to
<br />
result in distinct universes.
<br />
<br />Here is where Wei's point about *locating* the intelligent mind comes
<br />
into play.  In our first example, we created the mind directly as the
<br />
output of the simulation, taking approximately 1E23 bits, plus or minus
<br />
five orders of magnitude.  With the many-worlds approach, we can create
<br />
it with a very small program, probably 1E7 bits or so, but it is lost
<br />
in a maze of 1E100+ universes.  Is this method cheating?
<br />
<br /><br />Simulating a brain's entire lifetime with a counting program
<br />
<br />After all, if all we wanted to do was to create a series of mind states,
<br />
we have (upper bound) 2E27 bits of state, with the state changing about
<br />
100 times per second (faster than the shortest time intervals we can
<br />
detect), over 2E9 seconds, for a total of about 1E39 bits to just record
<br />
the brain as a series of states.  This is worse than our estimate above
<br />
where we used a program to actually simulate the brain; here we aren't
<br />
trying to simulate it, just hard-coding all the states it will go through.
<br />
<br />A trivial counting program, once it counts up to about 1E39, will produce
<br />
a number which encodes the entire 1E39 bits of a human brain's state all
<br />
through its lifetime.  And there we have it, a fully simulated brain,
<br />
70 years of human lifetime in living color, produced by a program which
<br />
is about 1E2 bits long.
<br />
<br /><br />Accounting for the costs to localize the brain
<br />
<br />We can apply Wei's approach, which is to count the size of the program
<br />
needed to locate the brain, and add it to the size of the program that
<br />
produces the output.  With the counting program, it will take 1E39 bits
<br />
to specify where in the output that brain is located.  Add that to the
<br />
1E2 bits of the counting program and the overall cost is 1E39 bits, very
<br />
high, making this program give a small contribution.
<br />
<br />In the case of many-worlds, then, the challenge is to estimate how hard
<br />
it would be to locate a human-like brain, or even more, a specific human
<br />
brain, among the 1E100+ universes it has created.
<br />
<br />To find a human brain, without asking for a specific one, should not be
<br />
that hard.  We could create a pattern or template which we would use to
<br />
look for a match.  It could perhaps be a specification for a generic
<br />
brain, perhaps a young person's brain.  The program to search through the
<br />
multiverse and look for matches to this would be easy to write.
<br />
<br />The actual information to encode the generic brain would probably be
<br />
somewhat less than the estimates above for specific human brain state.
<br />
But it's not clear how much less.  Conservativelly we could use the
<br />
same values as above, 1E13 to 2E27.  This would dominate the size of
<br />
our multiverse simulation and would be the size of program we would
<br />
need to create and locate a human mind.
<br />
<br />The main thing we have saved here is that once we have found the mind,
<br />
we don't have to simulate the universe.  We already have that simulation
<br />
running.  The only way we could find a mind is if it has evolved naturally
<br />
within the simulated universe, so if it is a typical human mind it must
<br />
have evolved on a simulated world which is the equivalent of Earth.
<br />
<br /><br />Are we in a real universe?
<br />
<br />If the estimates of mind information are towards the low end, near 1E13,
<br />
then this method uses a considerably smaller program than creating the
<br />
mind from scratch.  We save the effort needed to hard-code inputs
<br />
which mimic the effect of a universe.  Simulating the universe itself is
<br />
easier.  This makes sense, because the universe is lawful, and lawful
<br />
means predictable, which also means compressible.
<br />
<br />However, if we use the higher estimates of information in the mind, then
<br />
we have a problem.  It appears to be just as cheap to actually simulate
<br />
just the brain and provide a &quot;fake&quot; universe for it to interact with,
<br />
as it would be to provide a real universe.  The cost is dominated by the
<br />
need to simulate the brain state.
<br />
<br />I think Merkle's high estimates of brain state are intended to be
<br />
extremely conservative for his purposes, where he wants to show that
<br />
the brain could be recorded even at such a ridiculously small level of
<br />
detail.  In actuality, we could probably simulate brains at a much higher
<br />
level and still produce brain actions which are indistinguishable from
<br />
our own.  In that case, creating a real universe to live in looks like
<br />
the most economical approach.
