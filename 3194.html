<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -----Original Message-----
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From: Jesse Mazer [mailto:lasermazer.domain.name.hidden]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sent: Friday, 7 September 2001 6:39 a.m.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmm, I think we actually have a full spectrum of opinions here...Jacques
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believes only in absolute probability, Bruno believes only in conditional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilities, and I believe in both. So, of course, I agree with what Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said about the importance of conditional probabilities--what happens to me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after an operation is not a matter of definition--but I also think there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be an absolute distribution to tell me how likely it is that I will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience one type of observer-moment vs. another in the first place.
</em><br />
<br />It seems to me that &quot;the probability of me experiencing one type of OM&quot; is an incoherent notion. It *looks* as though you are saying
<br />
that you exist outside OMs in some way, when I see no reason to assume you are anything other than a series of OMs. Maybe you aren't
<br />
saying that (it also sounds as though the &quot;Bayesian argument&quot; is based on a similar (mis)conception).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't really think there's some &quot;other metaphysical realm&quot; where we get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dropped from, but I do think that, as an analogy, the spotlight one is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually so bad. After all, if you think that you just *are* your current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moment, how can you possibly become any other one? The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moment itself doesn't transform--it's just sitting there timelessly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in Platonia among all other possible observer-moments. So, it's better to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think of &quot;continuity of consciousness&quot; as a spotlight moving between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different observer-moments, with the probability of going from one to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another defined by the conditional probability distribution.
</em><br />
<br />You don't *become* another OM. That's just the fallacy that you exist outside OMs in a different disguise. There is no &quot;you&quot; to
<br />
&quot;move from one OM to the next&quot; - there is only a stack of OMs, from which the concept of &quot;you&quot; emerges as a useful abstraction. The
<br />
stack of OMs is linked together by some sort of transition rules (e.g. what we might call the &quot;laws of physics&quot; for the sake of
<br />
convenience). There must be some sort of &quot;principle of similarity&quot; which allows the feeling of continuous consciousness to arise
<br />
from the stack.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Similarly, if you just *are* your current observer-moment with probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1, nothing else can be said, so there doesn't seem to be any way to assign
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning to an absolute probability distribution on all observer-moments.
</em><br />
<br />Exactly. Hence my non-acceptance (so far) of the &quot;Bayesian argument&quot; regarding QTI.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think it makes more sense to think of this distribution as the probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that a randomly-selected spotlight will be shining on a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moment, like in the Hoyle story. If we abandon the idea of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absolute probability distribution, we have no hope of explaining why I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this particular type of observer-moment experiencing this particular type of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, and we can only explain why my future experience will have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain amount in common with my current experience (assuming that's what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the conditional probability distribution actually predicts). But plenty of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moments might find themselves experiencing universes with very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different laws of physics--why am I experiencing these laws as opposed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some other set? Without a global probability distribution this can only be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brute fact, unexplained by the TOE. Likewise, why am I experiencing this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular era of the universe's history, or this unusual spatial region
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (the surface of a planet containing complex life), or this particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organism's point of view (a human vs. some other animal)? In all of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cases I think the intuitive explanation is something like the &quot;anthropic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle&quot; or the &quot;self-sampling assumption&quot; (this term is explained on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com">http://www.anthropic-principle.com</a> by Nick Bostrom, for anyone who's not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; familiar with it), and my hope is that the global probability distribution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would incorporate a formalized version of something like this. But without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such a global probability distribution, all this stuff becomes just more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brute facts.
</em><br />
<br />Why does the fact that you are &quot;this particular type of observer-moment experiencing this particular type of universe&quot; NEED further
<br />
explanation? I mean apart from the sort of explanation we use to explain why, say, a particular rock is found in a particular
<br />
space-time location?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just because something has probability 1 from your current point of view, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't think that means it should be treated as a brute fact.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If so, all historical scientific theories would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pointless--cosmologists would be out of a job, for example.
</em><br />
<br />You are attacking a &quot;straw man&quot; here (i.e. putting words and views into the mouths of those you disagree with). Everything in the
<br />
universe is a &quot;brute fact&quot; - the universe (or multiverse) *is* in actual fact in a particular state - but that doesn't stop us
<br />
trying to explain how it came to be that way. If you *are* simply a stack of observer moments, that fact doesn't somehow invalidate
<br />
the entire scientific endeavour, it's just a fact which still has consequences and requries explanation and so on. Similarly, if the
<br />
Hoyle spotlight turns out to be fictitious (as it was intended to be, since it appeared in a novel - as was his &quot;consciousness
<br />
field&quot; which appeared in &quot;Fifth planet&quot; :-) that doesn't make the whole edifice of science collapse, no more than it collapsed when
<br />
phlogiston or the aether turned out not to exist.
