It follows from the elementary definitions...&lt;

[JM]:
<br />
Yes, I was. Not now: WHO supplied those &quot;elementary definitions&quot;?
<br />
Surely a math teacher or the ancestor of such. Not even Gauss was born with
<br />
the knowledge that 6/2=3.
<br />
*
<br />
Just as those &quot;axioms&quot; Stathis finds 'explanatory' stem from necessity to
<br />
hold a &quot;theory&quot; valid. Another view of the world would require different
<br />
&quot;axioms&quot;.

<br />
Brent wrote about the crows who &quot;counted&quot; to 5, with some uncertainty even
<br />
higher and concluded that 'numbers exist in nature' - I did not examine what
<br />
the crows think, whether it was just a waiting period until their memory
<br />
expired, and the wise experimentors assigned it to 'counting' - all in their
<br />
human logic?
<br />

<br />
BTW I have a problem with the &quot;perfect&quot; 6:
<br />
ITS DIVISORS are 1,2,3,6, the sum of which is 12, not 6 and it looks that
<br />
there is NO other perfect number in this sense either.
<br />
&nbsp;(If 1 is a divisor - meaning 1x6 = 6 then 6 is also one:  6x1 = 6). An
<br />
exclusion of '1' would give a sum of 5 - Unless you want to exclude the
<br />
'number itself' from the &quot;sum&quot; - in which case the sum of &quot;1&quot; would be zero
<br />
(excluded the 1).
<br />
NOW I was joking.
<br />
<br />John
<br />
<br />I say to my students that in case they are saying a falsity (in math),
<br />
they will get a bad or a good note, depending on the way they will
<br />
defend the proposition. If they defend it by saying &quot;because you say so
<br />
during the course&quot;, then they will get a  *very*  bad note, indeed!
<br />
Even, and I would say *especially* if it is true, that I have said that
<br />
falsity. Actually I teach like that, I make error all the time (mostly
<br />
intentionally but of course not always). It works. Students eventually
<br />
understand that they must understand math by themselves. Each year I
<br />
have student (about 20 years old) just realizing what math is all
<br />
about.
<br />
Now I know you are joking. I know that you know that six has divisors.
<br />
It follows from the elementary definitions. And I will not repeat them,
<br />
because that would be sort of an insult (of course a number is
<br />
&quot;perfect&quot; if it is equal to the sum of its proper divisors ... by
<br />
definition. Why using the word &quot;perfect&quot;? Pythagorean superstition or
<br />
folklore, but mathematicians are not sanguine about words and
<br />
representations. In the lobian interview all natural numbers are
<br />
represented by strings like 0, s(0), s(s(0)), s(s(s(0))), etc.
<br />
<br />:-)
<br />
<br />Best regards, bon week-end,
<br />
