<br />What about the situation I described before:
<br />
<br />quote--
<br />
Returning to your example, if God creates a person, call him A, and a day 
<br />
later kills him, A will be really dead (as opposed to provisionally dead) if 
<br />
there will never be any successor OM's to his last conscious moment. Now, 
<br />
suppose God kills A and then creates an exact copy of A along with his 
<br />
environment, call him B, on the other side of the planet. B has all of A's 
<br />
memories up to the moment before he was killed. This destruction/creation 
<br />
procedure is, except for the duplication of the environment, exactly how 
<br />
teleportation is supposed to work. I think most people on this list would 
<br />
agree that teleportation (if it could be made to work, which not everyone 
<br />
does agree is possible) would be a method of transportation, not execution: 
<br />
even though the original dies, the copy has all his memories and provides 
<br />
the requisite successor OM in exactly the same way as would have happened if 
<br />
the original had continued living. So in the example above, if B is an exact 
<br />
copy of A in an exact copy of A's environment, A would &quot;become&quot; B and not 
<br />
even notice that there had been any change.
<br />
<br />Now, consider the same situation with one difference. Instead of creating B 
<br />
at the instant he kills A, God creates A and B at the same time, on opposite 
<br />
sides of the planet but in exactly the same environment which will provide 
<br />
each of them with exactly the same inputs, and their minds at all time 
<br />
remain perfectly synchronised. God allows his two creatures to live for a 
<br />
day, and then instantly and painlessly kills A. In the previous example, we 
<br />
agreed that the creation of B means that A doesn't really die. Now, we have 
<br />
*exactly* the same situation when A is killed: B is there to provide the 
<br />
successor OM, and A need not even know that anything unusual had happened. 
<br />
How could the fact that B was present a day, a minute or a microsecond 
<br />
before A's death make any difference to A? All that matters is that B is in 
<br />
the correct state to provide continuity of consciousness when A is killed. 
<br />
Conversely, A and A's death cannot possibly have any direct effect on B. It 
<br />
is not as if A's soul flies around the world and takes over B; rather, it 
<br />
just so happens (because of how A and B were created) that B's mental states 
<br />
coincide with A's, or with what A's would have been if he hadn't died.
<br />
--endquote
<br />
<br />Who's measure is decreased here, A's or B's? How would any of them know 
<br />
their measure had been decreased? It seems to me that neither A nor B could 
<br />
*possibly* be aware that anything had happened at all. The only benefit of 
<br />
having multiple exact copies of yourself around would seem to be as backup 
<br />
if one is destroyed. If your measure were surreptitiously increased or 
<br />
decreased, what symptoms would you expect to experience? What about if you 
<br />
were a piece of sentient software: surely having multiple instantiations of 
<br />
the ones and zeroes could not make any difference; if it did, wouldn't that 
<br />
be a bit like expecting that your money would have greater purchasing power 
<br />
if your bank backed up their data multiple times? Or like saying that 
<br />
&quot;2+2=4&quot; would be more vividly true (or whatever it is that increasing 
<br />
measure causes to happen) if lots and lots of people held hands and did the 
<br />
calculation simultaneously?
<br />
<br />I can't be completely sure that increasing your measure would have no 
<br />
effect. Maybe there would be some sort of telepathic communication between 
<br />
the various copies, such as is said to occur between identical twins, or 
<br />
some as yet undiscovered physical phenomenon. However, there is absolutely 
<br />
no evidence at present for such a thing, and I think that until such 
<br />
evidence is found, we should only go on what we know to be true and what can 
<br />
logically be deduced from it.
<br />
