<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Their&quot; existence ? Mathematical statements needs &quot;chatty&quot; machines.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Mathematics proceded for centuries without any machines at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here you don't answer the question. In &quot;their existence&quot; you conflate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many things making your statement ambiguous.
</em><br />
<br />No, &quot;their&quot; refers to mathematical statements.
<br />
<br />&quot;The anti-Platonist (e.g. the formalist) can claim that
<br />
the truth of mathematical statments is mind-independent,
<br />
&nbsp;but also that the existence of mathematical statments is not
<br />
mind-independent&quot;
<br />
<br />. Also I was in the comp
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context, and I was just saying that the mathematical statements need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the&quot; human machine&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If AR makes no existential commitments, it cannot lead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to the existential conclusion that there is no such thing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No scientific theories can prove the non existence of *anything*.
</em><br />
<br />Of course they can, within the scientific standard
<br />
of proof. Perpetual motion machines, for instance.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have made clear comp just shows that primary matter cannot have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanatory purpose.
</em><br />
<br />If minds are made of Platonically existing comptutations
<br />
or numbers, they don't need to be made of matter as
<br />
well. In that sense matter would we without purpose.
<br />
<br />But that depends on the assumption that there is such
<br />
a thing as Platonic existence in the first place,
<br />
which needs ot be justified or at least clearly stated.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Have you read the Universal Dovetailer Argument?
</em><br />
<br />How important is the stuiff about Plotinus ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course! But that is what I am currently explaining. If you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; follow the UDA, then, even if you could not yet be completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; convinced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; by each steps, you should at least be able to figure out in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;you&quot;, here and now, in the &quot;shape&quot; of an OM, to borrow the list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; vocabulary, exist as a relative number.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I cna't be persuaded of that without first being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; persuaded that numbers exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In which sense? We have already discussed this. I am not using the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expression &quot;such number exists&quot; in a sense stronger than any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical user.
</em><br />
<br />Then you have no agument against matter.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are the one adding unnecessary magic here. I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such you believe numbers exist. Of course you don't believe in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;physical numbers&quot;, neither I do, giving that &quot;physical&quot; will already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a &quot;property&quot; defined by infinities of relations between numbers,
</em><br />
<br />If numbers don't exist in the sense that I exist,
<br />
then I cannot be a number.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are the one assuming some &quot;primary matter&quot; without much precision.
</em><br />
<br />The empirical approach does not need as much precision as
<br />
the rationalist approach.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You told me it has no property of its own, but you never did answer the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question of how could it could give rise to any property at all.
</em><br />
<br />Some properties are instantiated and others are not. What matter
<br />
lends is the instantiation itself.
<br />
<br />Matter is a bare substrate with no properties of its own. The question
<br />
may well be asked at this point: what roles does it perform ? Why not
<br />
dispense with matter and just have bundles of properties -- what does
<br />
matter add to a merely abstract set of properties? The answer is that
<br />
not all bundles of posible properties are instantiated, that they
<br />
exist.
<br />
What does it mean to say something exists ? &quot;..exists&quot; is a meaningful
<br />
predicate of concepts rather than things. The thing must exist in some
<br />
sense to be talked about. But if it existed full, a statement like
<br />
&quot;Nessie doesn't exist&quot; would be a contradiction ...it would amout to
<br />
&quot;the existing thign Nessie doesnt exist&quot;. However, if we take that the
<br />
&quot;some sense&quot; in which the subject of an &quot;...exists&quot; predicate exists is
<br />
only initially as a concept, we can then say whether or not the concept
<br />
has something to refer to. Thus &quot;Bigfoot exists&quot; would mean &quot;the
<br />
concept 'Bigfoot' has a referent&quot;.
<br />
<br />What matter adds to a bundle of properties is existence. A non-existent
<br />
bundle of properties is a mere concept, a mere possibility. Thus the
<br />
concept of matter is very much tied to the idea of contingency or
<br />
&quot;somethingism&quot; -- the idea that only certain possible things exist.
<br />
<br />The other issue matter is able to explain as a result of having no
<br />
properties of its own is the issue of change and time. For change to be
<br />
distinguishable from mere succession, it must be change in something.
<br />
It could be a contingent natural law that certain properties never
<br />
change. However, with a propertiless substrate, it becomes a logical
<br />
necessity that the substrate endures through change; since all changes
<br />
are changes in properties, a propertiless substrate cannot itself
<br />
change and must endure through change. In more detail here
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does that &quot;primary matter&quot; comes from?
</em><br />
<br />The empricial evidence indicates that there was never a time when it
<br />
didn't.
<br />
exist.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why and how would that suddenly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain qualia,
</em><br />
<br />The Hard Problems boils down to the problem of reducing qualia
<br />
to mathematical strutures. If mathematical structures  is not all there
<br />
is,
<br />
the problem can be evaded. If qualia are fundamental properties
<br />
of matter, alongside structural-mathemaitcal ones, they do
<br />
not need to be reduced.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and quanta,
</em><br />
<br />Quanta are an observed, empirical fact. Empricists (Somethingists)
<br />
accept that there are facts which cannot be explained by
<br />
apriori reasoning. There is no particular reason
<br />
why matter should not behave quantum-ly or why
<br />
it should behave classically.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  and more precisely how do you associate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness to it without introducing actual third person infinities
</em><br />
<br />Why would you think I am assuming infinities ? If you make
<br />
the assumption that everything is mathematical, and someone
<br />
claims that some things are not Turing-emulable, I suppose
<br />
that would force you to the conclusion that they
<br />
exceed they are unemulable becasue they
<br />
exceed the capacity of TMs quantitively.
<br />
<br />But if it is a brute fact that some things are fundamentally
<br />
mathematical, that is all you need to explain
<br />
why they ar nto emulabe. A mathemtical reason
<br />
is not needed, and would in fact be paradoxical.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (by UDA you can't, unless you throw up comp, that is, unless you do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introduce actual infinities in the third person description of minds).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (With comp the infinities appears or interfere with the 1-person views
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only, through local probabilities).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you really want to keep both &quot;standard comp&quot; *and* aristotelian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; materialism/naturalism, you should better find some weakness in the UD
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasoning.
</em><br />
<br />No I don't. The UDA cannot show we are products of a UD
<br />
unless it can show that the UD has the same kind of
<br />
existene we have. Computationalism could be true
<br />
in  a material universe. It could be a brute fact that matter
<br />
exists and Platonia doesn't. Or vice versa. Either way,
<br />
it would be a brute fact and not an entailment of
<br />
standard computationalism.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  There are subtler points where your criticism could be more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructive it seems to me.
</em><br />
<br />Arguments cannot lead to conclusions that are nto already implicit in
<br />
their
<br />
premisses. That is as subtle as I need to be.
