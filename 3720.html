Hello Joe,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      I have difficulty with the concept of many distinct programs, each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representing an individual conscious entity. My understanding of modern
</em><br />
physics
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that the concept of an isolated individual is essentially obsolete, in
</em><br />
that
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing can be defined without relation to everything else. As a result,
</em><br />
surely
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the underlying &quot;program&quot; for each must be similarly connected, so that in
</em><br />
fact
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an individual physical object is simply a concentration of processes
</em><br />
operating
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in one part of the program?
</em><br />
<br />Indeed. Our universe operates via simple laws, and, as a consequence, all
<br />
the complexity that it generates must be highly compressible. That implies
<br />
that everything becomes related at the macroscopic level.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;       The significance of this is that the paradox of intelligent objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't arise at all. I work on the assumption that your program is
</em><br />
synonymous
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with universal awareness (the abstract form of consciousness), and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence would be the result of local information-processing systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Partly because of the view of everything being inter-related, I'm
</em><br />
uncomfortable
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with a sharp, intelligent/non-intelligent distinction, and have no problem
</em><br />
with
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a mechanical object expressing a very low degree of &quot;intelligence&quot;.
</em><br />
Indeed,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything which responds to stimuli could be seen in this way, including a
</em><br />
rock
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; undergoing thermal expansion. However, an object can only become
</em><br />
self-aware
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once the processing centre is reasonably complex, and  based on sufficient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; local inputs to define a boundary to the region of the observer; this, I
</em><br />
guess,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be the manifestation of a closed (or at least self-referent)
</em><br />
processing
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; loop within the program.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     As I understand your view, it by-passes the paradox by introducing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrariness, and any approach of this type seems to me to result in more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problems. At what point in evolution did an organism first become
</em><br />
intelligent?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do we then assume that a qualitatively different faculty was introduced?
</em><br />
If so,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how? These sorts of questions seem to be the result of over-reductionism,
</em><br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separating gradations into artificial categories. (Of course, being a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; palaeontologist, I spend much of my time doing just that, but never mind!)
</em><br />
<br />Some interesting thoughts here. Actually I don't think we disagree at all! I
<br />
also think that one has to look at the system in question and look at the
<br />
information processing capabilities. E.g. an ants nest could be found to be
<br />
conscious...
<br />
<br />So, I am not saying that only certain programs are conscious and others not.
<br />
I am really saying that if you the universe is running (in some
<br />
approximation) a certain program in my head. That program defines me. If you
<br />
run that program on a computer, that computer would have my consciousness,
<br />
i.e. that computer would be me. Since most members of this list (except for
<br />
Russell?) believe that our universe itself a program, you could say that in
<br />
some sense it is conscious. Most of us think, however, that our universe's
<br />
program is very simple. A retarded amoeba would probably be more
<br />
intelligent.
<br />
<br />Now, one of the reason why I introduced these ''personal programs'' is that
<br />
one needs an objective way to tell who is who. I will write more about this
<br />
(in particular about how to resolve the quantum suicide problem) when I have
<br />
more time (probably in a few weeks from now).
<br />
