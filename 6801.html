</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; t2 as t1? I suggest that this is not the right way to look at it. A 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; only experiences one OM at a time, so if he has &quot;passed through&quot; t1 and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;t2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it will appear to him that he has spent just as much time in either 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interval
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (assuming t1 and t2 are the same length). The only significance of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that there are &quot;more&quot; OM's at t2 is that the person can expect a greater
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; variety of possible experiences at t2 if the OM's are all distinct.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's a good puzzle.  Some time back I expressed it as follows: suppose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the measure of the even days of my life were arranged to be twice as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;good as the measure of the odd days.  How would I notice this?  Would I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;somehow be more likely to experience an even day?  Should I arrange
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to have good things happen on even days and bad things on odd days?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't see how I would notice any difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, I lean more to a favorable answer to these questions.  In fact I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would say, yes, I should arrange to have good things happen on even days.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Even though the difference is not directly perceptible, I believe I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be making the universe a better place.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here are a chain of examples.  I won't try to offer much justification
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at each step, I am just sketching an argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;First, consider 10 people.  We can either give 9 of them a good experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and 1 of them a bad one, or 9 of them bad and 1 of them good.  It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;clear that it is better to give the 9 good and 1 bad.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, consider 2 people.  We are going to give the first a good experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and the second a bad one.  But we can make 9 copies of the first, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;9 copies of the second, as we do it.  I claim it is better to make 9
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;copies of the first, the one who is having a good experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, consider a person who goes through life but who has a problem with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;his short term memory that makes him forget what happens every day.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Fictional examples can be seen in the movies Memento and Fifty First
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dates, although I don't know how realistic they are.  Keep in mind this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is just a thought experiment and not dependent on any actual details of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;human pathology.)  We can either give him 9 days of good experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and 1 bad, or vice versa.  I claim it is better to make the 9 days be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;good experiences and 1 day bad, rather than the other way around.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And finally consider an ordinary person who remembers things from one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;day to the next.  On day 1 something good happens and on day 2 something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bad happens.  We can either make him have 9 times the measure on day 1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or on day 2.  I claim that it is better to give him 9 times the measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on day 1, when the good thing happens.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, you may be saying, where is the argument?  These are just examples
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with unsupported claims.  The point is to show that in all these examples
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the people are unaware of the changes in measure and numbers of good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and bad experiences.  But that doesn't change the fact that it is still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;better to cause more good experiences in the world than bad.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Would we say that it is OK to mistreat a person with lack of short
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;term memory just because they won't remember it?  I don't think so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It still causes genuine pain and suffering.  Giving them good experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;causes joy.  The 50 First Dates movie expresses this in a poignant and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;moving matter.  People are willing to sacrifice to bring happiness to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;someone they love who suffers such a condition.  I thought this was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an excellent movie BTW, although you have to overlook some extremely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;juvenile humor.  Memento was also interesting but much darker in tone.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is the same with all the examples.  Causing more experiences of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;joy is better than causing more experiences of sadness.  Even with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the one person who lives from day to day, it still applies.  He is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subjectively aware of his measure changing, but if he or anyone else has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objective awareness of the circumstance, the same logic that applies in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the other examples works here as well.  Give more happiness to the days
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with greater measure.  That makes the world a better place.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now for an interesting twist.  Our measure decreases steadily in life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Every day we have a certain probability of dying, and our measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;decreases by that fraction.  The reasoning in the examples above would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;imply that it is better to have happiness when our measure is high, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is when we are young.  Unhappiness in old age has less impact.  So if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you are putting off some happiness, do it today, don't procrastinate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Of course, you get much the same result in a non-multiverse model,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;where putting off a reward makes you risk dying before you get to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience it.)
</em><br />
<br />The conclusion drawn from the examples you have given is very reasonable, 
<br />
taking the point of view of a third person observer. There is nothing wrong 
<br />
with that, but what I was asking is, from a selfish first person point of 
<br />
view, can I expect to live forever, as the QTI seems to imply? One objection 
<br />
to the QTI is that most of my measure is concentrated in younger versions of 
<br />
me, so that it is extremely unlikely that a randomly chosen OM from my life 
<br />
will be, say, a million years old. But this objection is answered by your 
<br />
conclusion (and mine) that if your measure on even days of your life were 
<br />
somehow made double your measure on odd days, you would not notice any 
<br />
difference. As long as even one version of me survives in the multiverse, 
<br />
however low the measure, I am guaranteed to remain alive.
