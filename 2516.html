<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno, I am usually skipping those of your paragraphs that contain

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have no idea what that is supposed to mean.

<br />It is something the reasoning itself should clarify (hopefully).
<br />
The expression gives the idea of the counter-intuitiveness 
<br />
(and &quot;out-fashion&quot;
<br />
in the current philosophy of  mind, where  materialistic 
<br />
naturalism get the main attention today). 
<br />
<br />It is a way of not hiding we are going toward a form of idealism.
<br />
I try to explain that comp leads necessarily to some (rational)
<br />
idealism.
<br />
<br />You can also got some &quot;intuition&quot; through poetical sentences. For 
<br />
exemple: &quot;Life what is it but a dream&quot; (Lewis Carroll).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Still, I feel you do have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something nontrivial to say, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I just have not been able to figure out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what exactly it is. Maybe if I knew why &quot;I genuinely fail to understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the invariance lemma&quot; - please show me!
</em><br />
<br />Actually I guess your constructive philosophy will not help you 
<br />
to understand what I try to show. I hope I am wrong here.
<br />
<br />But even if that is true, you can 
<br />
maybe still put yourself at the place of a classical logician and accept
<br />
that with comp and some amount of classical (non constructive) logic 
<br />
I am correct. In that case, for those who believe it is necessary to 
<br />
be insane for believing in the physics/psychology reversal, my work will 
<br />
appear as an argument for your constructivisme!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But any finite future is computable by a long program as well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The problems arise with infinite futures.
</em><br />
<br />We will come back on this (in some futur). 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;No, it isn't, since &quot;generating an individual real&quot; is not equivalent to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;generating all prefixes of all reals.&quot; &quot;Generating an individual real&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;means &quot;generating all prefixes of that individual real, AND NOTHING
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ELSE&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />All right. I was using generate in a more general sense. To help us
<br />
preventing that confusion again I will say &quot;surgenerate&quot; instead.
<br />
So a program surgenerates a real if it generates all the prefix of that
<br />
real AND *SOME*THING ELSE.
<br />
I hope you agree that the DU surgenerates all the reals. I will not be
<br />
vexed if you anwer me &quot;trivial&quot;.
<br />
<br />(later it will be necessary to understand that from the first-person
<br />
point of view we cannot know if we &quot;belong&quot; to a &quot;real&quot; which would be
<br />
generated or surgenerated ...).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The best you can achieve is an algorithm that outputs at least the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computable infinite reals in the sense that it outputs their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;finite descriptions or programs.
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure I understand you here.
<br />
Are you aware that the set of descriptions of computable reals
<br />
is not closed for the diagonalisation procedure.
<br />
That is: you cannot generate all (and only)  descriptions of
<br />
computable reals. The algorithm you are mentionning does not exist.
<br />
You can only generate a superset of the set of all computable reals.
<br />
That set (of description of all computable reals) is even
<br />
constructively not *recursively enumerable* in the sense that,
<br />
if you give me an algorithm generating the (description of) 
<br />
computable real, I can transform it for building a computable 
<br />
real not being generated by your algorithm. I guess you know that.
<br />
<br />That is why most formal constructivists consider their &quot;set of
<br />
constructive reals&quot; as subset
<br />
of the Turing computable reals. For exemple you can choose the 
<br />
set of reals which are provably
<br />
computable in some formal system (like the system F by Girard,
<br />
in which you can formalize ..., well Hilbert space and probably 
<br />
the whole of the *constructive* part of Tegmark mathematical ontology!
<br />
That is very nice and big but not enough big for my purpose which
<br />
has some necessarily non constructive feature. 
<br />
About natural numbers and machines I am a classical
<br />
platonist. About real numbers I have no definite opinion.
<br />
<br />Can you imagine yourself as a Platonist for a while, if only
<br />
for the sake of the reasoning?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If it just means you don't know in advance in which possible future you'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;end up, provided there is a nontrivial distribution on the possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;futures, then this is ok (and trivial).
</em><br />
<br />Are you saying that *without* distribution I would be less ignorant?
<br />
I was just saying &quot;you don't know in advance in which possible future 
<br />
you'll
<br />
end up&quot;. Comma.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do I need any additional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;preliminaries to realize why I &quot;genuinely fail to understand your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;invariance lemma&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />Sure. The &quot;delays&quot; question for exemple. Let us follow Jesse Mazer
<br />
idea of torture. Suppose I duplicate you and reconstitute you, not
<br />
in Washington and Moscow but in some Paradise and some Hell.
<br />
Would you feel more comfortable if I tell you
<br />
I will reconstitute you in paradise tomorow and in hell only in
<br />
3001 after C. ? Is that what you would choose?
<br />
<br />An honest computationalist will never suggest
<br />
that such a delay should make yourself feeling more 
<br />
comfortable. Despite the third person local appearances.
<br />
<br />After the delays, there is the virtual/&quot;real&quot; preliminaries.
<br />
The first person cannot see the difference.
<br />
And then the &quot;more difficult&quot; arithmetical/virtual preliminaries.
<br />
First person cannot makes the differences ....
<br />
<br />Are you willing to accept that, although our brain is a
<br />
kind of pointer to our mind, our mind points only on possible
<br />
brains, a *big* collection of possible brains, possible
<br />
worlds, possible histories.
<br />
With comp you can attribute a mind to a machine, but you
<br />
cannot attribute a machine to a mind. Just a *big* fuzzy set
<br />
of possible &quot;machine&quot;.
<br />
<br />It is not a question of preliminaries, it is a question of 
<br />
a whole reasoning.
<br />
The first part of the french text is a whole reasoning  and that
<br />
reasoning  needs your 
<br />
quasi-personal implication (under the form of an imaginary 
<br />
act of faith: saying yes to the doctor!).
<br />
You can get the concreteness of the idea &quot;Dobell institute&quot; on
<br />
the net. Computationalism is more a human right than a doctrinal
<br />
truth. The implication are big in all directions.
<br />
<br />The second part is the best I have been able to do in
<br />
substituting *you* by &quot;any sound (godel-lobian) machine&quot; capable
<br />
of talking about arithmetic and descriptions of themselves.
<br />
I ask the universal machine. (And thank to Godel, Lob, Solovay
<br />
I ask its &quot;truth theory&quot; (alias the Guardian Angel) too!
<br />
<br />Listen to the machine. What a simple and naive idea, isn't it?
<br />
The guardian angel helps only for not misinterpreting the
<br />
silences of the (hopefully) consistent machine.
