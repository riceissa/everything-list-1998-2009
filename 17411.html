</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I am saying that material existence *is* contingent

<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; existence. It is not a structure of anything.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Plotinus says that too! Me too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; With church thesis this is can be made more precise in term of not-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; computable or not-provable, or some relativizations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You're still not getting it. PM isn't a non-computable number.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It isn't mathematical at all. You really do think in a box..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you believe that a deduction is not valid, you have to say where,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and why.
</em><br />
<br /><br />1. Somehting X is non-computable
<br />
2. Everything is mathematical
<br />
3. Therefore X is a non-computable number.
<br />
<br />The conclusion is valid. But (2) is a belief of yours that
<br />
I don't share. Hence *I* don't agree PM is a non-computable number
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Somehow you talk like you would be able to be *conscious* of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; existence of primitive matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Well, at least I don't talk about immaterial machines dreaming each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; In arithmetic, that happens all the time. More below.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; !!!!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In arithemetic. people write down problems on blackboards and solve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If comp is assumed, some computation correspond to dream, and their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence can be proved in arithmetic.
</em><br />
<br />Mathematics cannot prove metaphysical claims.
<br />
Backwards-E is metaphysically non-commital.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And the MGA argument shows that no machine can make the difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between &quot;real&quot;, virtual and arithmetical.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There is no immaterial existence at all, and  my agreeign to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; my brain physcially replicated doesn't prove there is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Meaning: UDA is non valid. I am still waiting your argument.
</em><br />
<br />I don't grant step 00 -- the immaterial existence of a UD
<br />
or any other mathematical structure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; You have to deny the theorem of elementary arithmetic, which are used
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; by physicists (mostly through complex or trigonometric functions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; which reintroduce the natural numbers in the continuum).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No. I don't have to deny their truth. I just have to deny that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; existence is ontological existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have no clue what you mean by &quot;ontological existence&quot;,
</em><br />
<br />It is what Platonists affirm of numbers and formalists deny
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; except
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;physical existence&quot;, but this beg the question.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you don't deny the arithmetical truth, you accept arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realism, and you cannot deny the UD, so you should be able to follow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the argument. And if you believe the conclusion is wrong, you should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say where.
</em><br />
<br />I have explained this over and over. I accept that
<br />
true backwards-E statements are true. I don't accept that backwards-E
<br />
means ontological existence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Since it [UD] does not exist, it does not contain anything.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UD exists like PI exists.
</em><br />
<br />That doesn't exist ontologically either
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The rest is taken into account in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument that I am referring to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Don't say that PI and circle does not exists. Say that PI and circles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not exist physically. It is quite different.
</em><br />
<br />Even Platonists regard them as existing non-physcially. If you don't
<br />
understand what the debate between Platonists, formalists ,
<br />
intuiotionists (etc)
<br />
is about, you need to read the literature.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That is never going to get you further than mathematical existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You still need the futher step of showing mathematical existence is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ontological RITISAR existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still don't know if by RITSIAR you mean &quot;real in the sense my first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person is real&quot; or &quot;real as my body is real&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You told me that the difference is epistemological, and I can accept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this (for a while). But that makes a huge difference in the meaning of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RITSIAR. I cannot doubt my first person, but I can doubt my body.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After UDA+MGA, my first person appears to have an infinity of bodies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (like in QM without collapse), and this makes the difference between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those two forms of RITSIAR even bigger.
</em><br />
<br />UDA proves nothing without an argument of the actual, if non-physical,
<br />
existence of numbers.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; See &quot;conscience &amp; mécanisme&quot; appendices for snapshot of a running
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; mathematical DU. It exists mathematically. But it can be implemented
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;materially&quot; , i.e. relatively to our most probable computations too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So? It hasn't been.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It has been implemented, and it has run for a week in 1991. This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anecdotical. Just to say that the UD is a concrete program.
</em><br />
<br />But it is hardly going to contain vast infinities after a week.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The way to prevent it is the same way that all sceptical hypotheses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are prevented. You just note that there is not a scrap of evidence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for them. The only upshot of scepticism is that there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; certainty, and we have to argue for the position of the greatest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; plausibility.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have better that a scrap of evidence: a deductive argument. A proof,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that COMP =&gt; physics has to emerge from numbers.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I have also evidences for comp, in the sense that the physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which emerge from numbers is a multiversial physics, and the quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality makes many people to consider that we may live in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiversial reality. And I have also more technical evidences coming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the Arithmetical UDA. That are evidence for comp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I can't be &quot;in&quot; something that has merely mathematical existence, any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; more than I can be &quot;in&quot; Nanrnia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... then CTM (comp) is false, and you should help us to find the error
</em><br />
<br />comp is false because comp=CTM+CTT+AR
<br />
CTM is not falsified.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; in UDA, instead of just denying existence for what almost everybody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accepts to exist mathematically.
</em><br />
<br />That is not true at all. Mathematicians tend to
<br />
be instinctive Platonists. One of the upshots
<br />
of that is that they don't feel the need to argue
<br />
for Platonism, which in turn means they
<br />
never formulate good argumetns for it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Arithmetical reality kicks back.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; No, it just has to be right. The fact that a simulated me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; *would8 be wrong doesn't mean the real me *is* wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; But if you are correct in your reasoning, the simulated you has to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; correct to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; False. You are treating all reasoning as being assumptionless and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; apriori. Both me's could have arguments of equal validity, but one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the argumetns could have true assumptions and the other false
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; assumptionsm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; because the truth of the assumptions (and hence the soundness of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; argument)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; depends on external factors which vary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, in this protocol, both have the same assumptions. If not, you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; begging the question.
</em><br />
<br />They have the same assumptions but &quot;where&quot; they are alters
<br />
the truth of the assumptions. Since the truth of the conclusions
<br />
depends
<br />
on the soundness of the assumptions , they do not both have to be
<br />
correct
<br />
even if they are employing the same reasoning.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The mind-body problem comes from the fact that we have not yet find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; how to attach consciousness to matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No, it comes from no being able to attach *phenomenal*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness to mathematical structures. There is no problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; attaching *cognition* to matter at all. If the matter of your brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is disrupted, so are your though processes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is *phenomenal* consciousness?
</em><br />
<br /><a href="http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.block.html">http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.block.html</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is not consciousness always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal? How do you define matter and attach cognition to it? You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are talking like if materialist did find a solution of the mind-body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem.
</em><br />
<br />You can attach cogninition to matter through computation or
<br />
some other approach like connectionism. that's the Easy Problem.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness</a>
<br />
<br />Attaching Phenomenal Consiousness to matter is the Hard Problem,
<br />
and CTM is not the tiniest bit more successful than materialism in
<br />
that
<br />
regard.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not the case.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And yes, if the matter in my brain is disrupted, so are my thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes. This is one reason to accept comp. So what?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have some colleagues who argues that MGA is not needed. They have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; read some papers on the phantom limbs, and they argue that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness (like the consciousness of a pain in the limb) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obviously non material, because it cannot be located in the limb, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot be located in the brain, nor elsewhere.
</em><br />
<br />That's a terribly bad argument. All you need for phantom limb
<br />
pain is a map of the body in the brain. There is even an anatomical
<br />
structure that does the job
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_homunculus">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_homunculus</a>
<br />
<br />And it's been know for a century!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;They find that the &quot;yes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doctor&quot; hypothesis, when well understood (yes doctor *qua computatio*)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes us immaterial at once, and that it is obvious that matter is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what needs an explanation.  I have succeeded in explaining to some of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them that such argument can't go through, on purely logical grounds,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but MGA does go through, and if you think plausible, against such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; colleagues, that consciousness is a material phenomenon, then UDA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shows you that such a material phenomenon cannot be Turing emulable.
</em><br />
<br /><br />MGA doesn't go through if mental activity is taken to supervene
<br />
on computational activity.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; It is the same reasoning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Or you have a special sense making you know that you are the &quot;real&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; one, but either that special sense is Turing emulable and your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; doppelganger inherit them, or it is not Turing emulable, and you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; better should say &quot;no&quot; to the doctor, because you would loose that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't need to strenuously argue against that there is something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; special about me that makes me un-emulable , or un-BIV-able.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I just have to note that there is no evidence for either hypothesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The burden is on the sceptic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are ton of evidences. My favorite one is that *primary* matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not even assumed in any physical text.
</em><br />
<br />Who's the physicist here?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Results 01 - 10 of about 18,800,000 for&quot; physics matte&quot;r. (0.35
<br />
seconds)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have finished to read Aristotle for the second times, and I am not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure at all that he is responsible for that notion. I think that such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a notion appeared the first time in catholic texts to prevent a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; protestant understanding of the relation between Jesus and braid.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I may begin to ask you to define what is primary matter. Your use of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it looks more and more like the use of &quot;God&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And about conceptual analysis of that notion of matter, I would like a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition of matter which does not rely on matter, like Dennett asks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for consciousness. If not, it is a sort of fake God.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To say that matter is fundamental, comma, is the same as saying that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is fundamental comma. It is the same kind of misuse of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God-like notion which explains the difficulty to keep a reasonable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific, modest and agnostic, attitude in the fundamental fields.
</em><br />
<br />And saying maths is fundamental is somehow OK?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am sorry Peter, but CTM + PM just does not work, and it is a good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; news, because if we keep CTM, we get a sort of super generalization of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Darwin idea that things evolve. Now we know, assuming comp, that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical laws have a reason, and that they evolves, in a non tempral
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or spatial way, in some arithmetico-logical space.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
