Hello.  In reply, here's some new (?) stuff that I've been thinking about,
<br />
which hopefully you find appropriate to this discussion - especially given
<br />
that there has been a previous descussion about the ultimate theory of
<br />
everthing possibly consisting of nothing more than all mathematical
<br />
constructs.
<br />
<br />So the problem is, what would 'all mathematical constructs' consist of?  I
<br />
think it would be a good idea to firsty figure out what the essential
<br />
ingredient of all mathematical constructs to date are, to whit are some of
<br />
my thoughts. 
<br />
<br />Firstly we're going to make a few simplifying assumptions, which hopefully
<br />
you wont object to too much.  They seem pretty sensible to me.  These are
<br />
that, at any given time, our mathematics in its entirety can be considered
<br />
as a language (in the formal sense) L over some finite alphabet A, and in
<br />
particular, *this language is finite*.  To clarify, an alphabet A is just
<br />
a non-empty set, and a language L over an alphabet A is simply any subset
<br />
of A^+, where A^+ denotes all formal (non-empty) sequences of elements of
<br />
A. 
<br />
<br />I'll explain why I think these assumptions are okay.  Basically, we could
<br />
let A = {0,1}, and if we assume that any mathematical text could be
<br />
translated into, say, LaTex or some other appropriate system for
<br />
representing maths, every mathematical text can be reduced to a sequence
<br />
of bits.  The language L we are refering to, then, would consist of the
<br />
languange of all text files which LaTex compiles into a piece of correct
<br />
mathematics (which has already been written, note!).
<br />
<br />Now the big question is, what's so special about this language L??  Is
<br />
*anything* special about it?  In particular, given some such finite
<br />
language L, how would we decided whether it is mathematics or not?  Do
<br />
these questions make sense??? :)
<br />
<br />I suspect that the language is to some extent unimportant.  After all, any
<br />
finite language can be recognised by a finite state automata, and who
<br />
would like to claim that mathematics is nothing but structures recognised
<br />
by FSA's?  It seems to me that the only way of reconsiling this is by
<br />
accepting that, when someone reads a mathematical text, we are performing
<br />
*computations*, and it is this additional structure, along with the
<br />
language, which is important.  This would mean that we might consider a
<br />
finite language L to be 'mathematical' if it is sufficiently
<br />
well-structured as to allow us to use it to describe abstract constructs
<br />
(ie we can 'parse' the language, and imagine that in doing so, the words
<br />
in the language each describe some structure).
<br />
<br />But, to be honest, I really don't know.  What do you lot think?
<br />
<br /><br />Chris Simmons.
<br />
Don't bother, the web page is crap ;)
