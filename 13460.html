<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideas, and we might assume that the AI would read these suggestions,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; along with many other ideas that contradict the ones offered here.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems hard to escape the conclusion that the only logical response

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is for the AI to figuratively throw up its hands and say that it is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible to know if it is conscious, because even humans cannot agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on what consciousness is.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In particular I don't think an AI could be expected to claim that it

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knows that it is conscious, that consciousness is a deep and intrinsic

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; part of itself, that whatever else it might be mistaken about it could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not be mistaken about being conscious.  I don't see any logical way it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could reach this conclusion by studying the corpus of writings on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topic.  If anyone disagrees, I'd like to hear how it could happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And the corollary to this is that perhaps humans also cannot legitimately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make such claims, since logically their position is not so different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from that of the AI.  In that case the seemingly axiomatic question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether we are conscious may after all be something that we could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mistaken about.

<br />I think that IF a computer were conscious (I don't believe it is
<br />
possible), then the way we could know it is conscious would not be by
<br />
interviewing it with questions and looking for the &quot;right&quot; answers.
<br />
We could know it is conscious if the computer, on its own, started
<br />
asking US (or other computers) questions about what it was
<br />
experiencing.  Perhaps it would saying things like, &quot;Sometimes I get
<br />
this strange and wonderful feeling that I am &quot;special&quot; in some way.  I
<br />
feel that what I am doing really is significant to the course of
<br />
history, that I am in some story.&quot;  Or perhaps, &quot;Sometimes I wish that
<br />
I could find out whether what I am doing is somehow significant, that
<br />
I am not just a duplicatable thing, and that what I am doing is not
<br />
'meaningless'.&quot;
