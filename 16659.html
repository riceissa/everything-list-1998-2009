</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A&amp;B is untrue (unless we forget about the meaning of &amp; or and . In  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any language.

<br /><br />As I said you are a beginner. And you confirm my theory that beginner  
<br />
can be  great genius! You have just discovered here the field of  
<br />
linear logic. Unfortunately the discovery has already been done by  
<br />
Jean-Yves Girard, a french logician. Your money example is often used  
<br />
by Jean-Yves Girard himself to motivate Linear logic. Actually my  
<br />
other motivation for explaining the combinators, besides to exploit  
<br />
the Curry Howard isomorphism, was to have a very finely grained notion  
<br />
of deduction so as to provide a simple introduction to linear logic.  
<br />
In linear logic the rule of deduction are such that the proposition  
<br />
&quot;A&quot; and the proposition &quot;A &amp; A&quot; are not equivalent. Intuitionistic  
<br />
logic can be regain by adding a &quot;modal&quot; operator, noted &quot;!&quot; and read  
<br />
&quot;of course A&quot;, and !A means A &amp; A &amp; A &amp; ...
<br />
<br />Now, a presentation of a logic can be long and boring, and I will not  
<br />
do it now because it is a bit out of topic. After all I was trying to  
<br />
explain to Abram why we try to avoid logic as much as possible in this  
<br />
list. But yes, in classical logic you can use the rule which says that  
<br />
if you have prove A then you can deduce A &amp; A. For example you can  
<br />
deduce, from 1+1 = 2, the proposition 1+1=2 &amp; 1+1=2. And indeed such  
<br />
rules are not among the rule of linear logic. Linear logic is a  
<br />
wonderful quickly expanding field with many applications in computer  
<br />
science (for quasi obvious reason), but also in knot theory, category  
<br />
theory etc.
<br />
<br />The fact that you invoke a &quot;counterexample&quot; shows that you have an  
<br />
idea of what (classical) logic is.
<br />
<br />But it is not a counter example, you are just pointing to the fact  
<br />
that there are many different logics, and indeed there are many  
<br />
different logics. Now, just to reason about those logics, it is nice  
<br />
to choose &quot;one&quot; logic, and the most common one is classical logic.
<br />
<br />Logician are just scientist and they give always the precise axiom and  
<br />
rule of the logic they are using or talking about. A difficulty comes  
<br />
from the fact that we can study a logic with that same logic, and this  
<br />
can easily introduce confusion of levels.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; *
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;I think you are pointing the finger on the real difficulty of logic  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for beginners....&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How else do I begin than a beginner? to learn signs without meaning,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then later on develop the rules to make a meaning? My innate common  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense refuses to learn anything without meaning. Rules, or not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules. I am just that kind of a revolutionist.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think everybody agree, but in logic the notion of meaning is also  
<br />
studied, and so you have to abstract from the intuitive meaning to  
<br />
study the mathematical meaning. Again this needs training.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Finally, (to begin with)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...&quot;study of the laws of thought, although I would add probability  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory to it ...???&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I discard probability as a count - consideration  inside a limited  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (cut) model, 'count'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - also callable: statistics, strictly limited to the given model- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; content of the counting -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with a notion (developed in same model) &quot;what, or how many the next  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simialr items MAY be&quot; - for which there is no anticipation in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stated circumstances. To anticipate a probability one needs a lot of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; additional knowledge (and its critique) and it is still applicable  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only within the said limited model-content.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Change the boundaries of the model, the content, the statistics and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability will change as well. Even the causality circumstances  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (so elusive in my views).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am afraid you are confirming my other theory according to which  
<br />
great genius can tell great stupidities (with all my respect  of  
<br />
course &lt;grin&gt;).
<br />
Come on John, there are enough real difficulties in what I try to  
<br />
convey that coming back on a critic of the notion of probability is a  
<br />
bit far stretched.  Einstein discovered the atoms with the Brownian  
<br />
motion by using Boltzmann classical physical statistics. I have heard  
<br />
that Boltzman killed himself due to the incomprehension of his  
<br />
contemporaries in front of that fundamental idea (judged obvious  
<br />
today). But today there is no more conceptual problem with most use of  
<br />
statistics 'except when used by politicians!).
<br />
Of course you are right, statistics depends on the &quot;boundaries&quot;, but  
<br />
that is exactly the reason why we need a theory of probability, to  
<br />
avoid dishonest applications, and this has been done by Kolmogorov in  
<br />
a convincing way.
<br />
here, I was just following George Boole in defining, in a very general  
<br />
way, the laws of thought by LOGIC + PROBABILITY. This is still  
<br />
defensible if we accept those words in a large open minded sense.
<br />
<br />I will have opportunities to say more when I will explain a bit more  
<br />
of the math, for UDA-step7, and a bit of AUDA,  to Kim.
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
