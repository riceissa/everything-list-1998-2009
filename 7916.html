Hi Bruno,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It is maybe time to change the name of the thread. But I'll get to 
<br />
that below.

&nbsp;...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;OK. Now I agree with Lee, and many on the FOR and the Everything lists 
<br />
that Everett (many-worlds + decoherence already) constitutes a 
<br />
&quot;solution of the measurement problem&quot;. All measurements are just 
<br />
interaction, and then all states are relative. As I said, it seems to 
<br />
me that this is even more clear in the integral formulation of QM where 
<br />
F = ma can be deduced from the &quot;sum on all histories&quot;. But this is 
<br />
going a little bit out of topics, and is not needed to understand the 
<br />
comp derivation. We can come back on this latter.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we part company. MWI (I prefer to call it Everett's 
<br />
Interpretation or EQM) is NOT a solution to the measurement
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;problem of QM but an Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics that does not 
<br />
lead to that problem! It does however have
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a tripartite problem of its own that, in my opinion, is just the 
<br />
measurement problem blown up. In any case what you say
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;afterwords does not follow (from EQM or QM). There are non-interactive 
<br />
measurements that people have been looking
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;into for a while now (Dicke, Elitzur-Vaidman, etc...). I am sure you 
<br />
guys touched on these sometime ago...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But all of this is irrelevant for my purpose at hand which is for you 
<br />
to commit to the proposition that &quot;No-YD: no Bruno&quot;!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that you are weaseling out of it but I don't quite care 
<br />
if you take refuge in another Everett World. That
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;would be a cop out and I am sure you know it. I want you and I 
<br />
digitised IN THIS WORLD! I don't care for copies!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;(skip)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; In other words: if I found a way of shooting down your theory in a &gt; 
</em><br />
way that would not obviously violate the correspondence
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; limit of QM , it would shot down! That is what I am suggesting 
</em><br />
above. &gt; But do not worry because I think you are a lot better
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; shot by QM.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To anticipate a little bit, I think this will be hard. From comp you 
<br />
can deduce quickly the qualitative &quot;many-relative state/worlds&quot; 
<br />
feature, the no-cloning theorem, the appearance of indeterminacy. I 
<br />
told you Newtonian physics (with a single universe-history) would cause 
<br />
much more problem to my approach.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't much care what you can deduce from COMP, Bruno. I care that 
<br />
COMP=YD+CT+AR and that shooting down YD would
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;shoot down COMP. You could very well deduce from COMP my non-existence 
<br />
if YD is false.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; &quot;Definition: Classical Digital mechanism, or Classical &gt; 
</em><br />
Computationalism, or just comp, is the conjunction of the following &gt; 
<br />
three sub-hypotheses:&quot;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; after which you list three items which I will not reproduce here and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will just short as 1) YD for &quot;Yes-doctor&quot;, 2) CT for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Church Thesis and 3) AR for Arithmetic Realism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; My objection is that of these three only the first can genuinely be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; called an hypothesis!
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Ouh la la. You are close to the 1004 fallacy (asking for more precise 
<br />
definition than the reasoning itself). At the start you can use the 
<br />
term &quot;axioms&quot;, &quot;postulates&quot;, &quot;theses&quot;, &quot;premises&quot;, &quot;assumptions&quot;, 
<br />
&quot;hypotheses&quot;, etc.. in a similar way.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you get my point. I am not asking for precision at all. I am 
<br />
pointing out that thesis and doctrines are not hypotheses
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;tout court. These three &quot;assumptions&quot; do not have the same epistemic 
<br />
status and it is misleading to call them the same.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't like it, than acknowledge my pragmatics: if your 
<br />
point-of-view is falsifiable it should be so without compromising 
<br />
either CT and AR which stand very well on their own as you underscore 
<br />
below:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; CT, as the name indicates, is a Thesis which is most likely 
</em><br />
unprovable &gt; but favored by overwhelming heuristic support.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only overwhelming supports: there is the deep conceptual argument 
<br />
that Kleene has discovered when he failed to refute Church's 
<br />
&quot;definition&quot; of the computable functions. The argument is the closure 
<br />
of the set of partial computable functions for the most transcendental 
<br />
mathematical operation: diagonalization. Kleene invented the vocable 
<br />
&quot;Church thesis&quot;. The first to get Church's thesis is Emil Post (in the 
<br />
early 19-twenties).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;See (perhaps later) the diagonalization posts in this list (mentionned 
<br />
in my web page).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; I know that there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; some people in the southern hemisphere who think that QComputation &gt; 
</em><br />
could produce a counterexample to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; shoot it down (and perhaps it could) but you and I agree that it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unlikely.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;OK.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreed, than . In any case one unassailable counterexample would shoot 
<br />
down CT, deep and &quot; Kleene&quot; as it is (:-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; And AR is a metaphysical position which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; happen to subscribe but which I would never fathom to try and prove 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or empirically test (nor do I have any idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; on how to do it! Do you?)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I have decided to put it explicitly, because, in front of my 
<br />
reasoning, some people cop out simply by saying &quot;Ah, but you are a 
<br />
platonist!&quot;. So I prefer to say it at once. I agree with you it is a 
<br />
sort of &quot;cop out&quot;. Now, although 99,99999999 % of the mathematician are 
<br />
platonist during the week, most like to pretends they are not (the 
<br />
week-end!).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Ditto.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
&nbsp;(skiip)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; (1) YD is obviously independent from CT and AR
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;'course.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;Good!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; (2) CT and AR stand no chance of being falsified empirically (or we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both like them that way, which is the same).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I give the opportunity to make comp false in more than one way. If you 
<br />
read the Maudlin paper, you will see that he consider the YD doctor (or 
<br />
equivalent) as tautologically true (unlike the functionnalist 
<br />
hypothesis). This is due to the fact that, unlike many older 
<br />
computationalist or mechanist, I put no bound on the low-levelness of 
<br />
the substitution level.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say yes to the doctor provided that he simulates my brain at the 
<br />
chromodynamical level, including all partiocles having interacted with 
<br />
any other particles in the past (in which case my brain is the 
<br />
&quot;physical universe&quot; itself. My brain could be a quantum computer, 
<br />
without violating comp. The no-cloning theorem does not interfere.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is actually where it gets interesting. I will have to sharpen up 
<br />
a bit of your YD but in ways that would not invalidate
<br />
&nbsp;your general use of it. More about that later.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; (3) No one that we know has been able to extract conclusions such as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yours from CT &amp; AR without YD (right)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a subtle question. The *necessity* of the reversal is hardly 
<br />
understandable without the YD assumption. But once you grasp the 
<br />
necessity of the reversal, then the very derivation of natural science 
<br />
&nbsp;from computer science does not use it at all. Indeed the cognitive 
<br />
science's &quot;grand-mother&quot; is completely substituted by the Lobian 
<br />
Machine at this stage. So, with OCCAM razor, once enough of physics is 
<br />
derived, you can eliminate the grand-mother and the whole YD 
<br />
assumption. Some mathematician asked me to put the UDA argument under 
<br />
the form: motivation&quot;, and to state that my real &quot;scientific&quot; 
<br />
hypothesis are CT and AR. I find that dishonest and misleading, 
<br />
because, without understanding the necessity of the reversal, the 
<br />
interview of the Lobian machine would resemble to nothing but a little 
<br />
piece of pure mathematics, especially given that I have until now 
<br />
extracted to few real physics to really call OCCAM. All my papers 
<br />
introduce the grandmother (and YD), and then translate the argument in 
<br />
the Lobian language.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But then if the logics of the observables that I have derived from 
<br />
comp (at the necessary place) appears to be von Neumann Quantum logics, 
<br />
I know people will eliminate the grandmother and the YD, for bad 
<br />
reasons (They want pure math, they hate cognitive science, etc.). My 
<br />
fear is that people take the epistemological elimination of the 
<br />
grand-mother (and the YD assumtion) as an ontological elimination of 
<br />
the first person, and nothing could be more wrong than that.
<br />
&nbsp;See the footnote 3. in the SANE paper, and the text
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno, you are weaseling out again, here! Let me ask you this in clear 
<br />
terms again:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you, Yes or No, derive your whole &quot;grand manege&quot; from CT and AR 
<br />
alone?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Because if it is a &quot;yes&quot; here I will give you the Oscar (and the 
<br />
Nobel) and let you go. I can than concentrate on
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;being a good machine for the rest of my existence since I don't want 
<br />
to loose my platonic allegiances or my
<br />
&nbsp;heuristic acquiescence to CT.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; would you have any objections to us concentrating, from here on, on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your &quot;YD hypothesis&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no problem with that. I am willing taking full responsability 
<br />
for the YD hypothesis, even if at some points we can forget it, as I 
<br />
explain above.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;Now we are talking (:-)!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I am saying this because I actually think that it is the real &gt; 
</em><br />
interesting and original part of your proposal
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually I agree. But the YD hypothesis with fixed (high) level of 
<br />
substitution is the everyday bread of cognitive science since Plato.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;So much the better, than! This way there is no chance that you can 
<br />
take it personally (:-)
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;(skipped)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Well, the real Doctor is Stathis Papanoiannou, in this list ;-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;Good! In that case there is a place for him a place in my story, too...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;Let me comment your last post also.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Thanks for your assent on this. I am sure that CT and AR are needed, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at some point, for your really outrageous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; conclusions. But I am sure you agree that they cannot save them if &gt; 
</em><br />
the &quot;Yes doctor&quot; presumption can be shot down by itself. Right?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I repeat because it is a difficult point. Strictly speaking I 
<br />
don't need the YD (Yes Doctor) hypothesis to get physics from comp, 
<br />
because I just interview a lobian machine on its consistent extension. 
<br />
But I need it to explain why it must be so, and make explicit the link 
<br />
with cognitive science, psychology, theology ....
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; This would save me from having to read through your Dovetail-Lob &gt; 
</em><br />
etc... argument which
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; is probably way above my head!
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Please don't feel obliged to follow the argument. Do it if you really 
<br />
want to find what is wrong in the path toward the &quot;outrageous 
<br />
conclusion&quot;. I mean that the Universal Dovetailer Argument is much more 
<br />
simple than some people imagine, although many remain unaware that the 
<br />
real difficulty is in the &quot;movie graph&quot; part. OK: cognitive science is 
<br />
not easy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the second part, the interview of the universal lobian machine, 
<br />
the difficulty resides in understanding some amount of computer 
<br />
science, logic and logics, and quantum physics.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I prefer the slow but sure path, take your time, I'm patient: you can 
<br />
ask me questions in my next life ;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; We obviously move in very different circles because I was taught by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very stubborn old strong AI types and cognoscendi
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; cognitivists and I have never heard anyone argue for something like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that YD hypothesis!
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Glad you notice. although the idea is defended and attacked since 
<br />
Plato, I am perhaps the first to tackle it in a hypothetico-deductive 
<br />
way. But then I'm lucky being born after Godel and Lob. (Which &quot;I&quot;? I 
<br />
don't know).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; But as you have conceded no one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; needs it to defend the old-fashioned materialist functionalism credo 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you (and I) do not subscribe to anyway.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;OK,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Now tell me what I didn't anticipate from YD, I'm very curious :)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And please feel free to shot down my work in any way. It is the best 
<br />
way for me to illustrate the solidity of my argumentation :)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;... and who knows ? perhaps you will find an error or some 
<br />
awkwardness. I would appreciate and acknowledge.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Bruno
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for the vote of confidence (;-) If I may add a personal note: 
<br />
Bruno, I am sure more knowledgeable people than
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;myself have pointed out that it is hard to get accross to you because 
<br />
you seem so wrapped up in your &quot;demonstration&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that you express yourself in the language you develop to devise it ! 
<br />
That is one of the reasons I would rather take you up
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;on your premise rather than having to read and judge the rest of your 
<br />
paper which I am not even confident I could. I think this is a more 
<br />
constructive use of my  time and your patience.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;What I would like to do next is the following:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;1) State the YD hypothesis in a way that is both consistent with your 
<br />
statement and useful for my purposes. I will
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;do that in a separate thread shortly. I need you to agree on that 
<br />
version, of course.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Once you agree I will tell you a little parable (allegory is more 
<br />
platonic, I guess) that illustrates the strict use of that
<br />
&nbsp;statement and the contradition that obtains from it.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;3) After that I will tell you what that contradiction may be useful in 
<br />
settling a certain dispute on the question of
<br />
&nbsp;whether QM has anything to say about consciousness or not.
<br />
<br />OK?  What do you say?
<br />
