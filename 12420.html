Le 03-janv.-07, à 04:00, Mark Peaty a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; SP: 'using the term &quot;comp&quot; as short for &quot;computationalism&quot; as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something picked up from Bruno. On the face of it, computationalism 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems quite sensible: the best theory of consciousness and the most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; promising candidate for producing artificial 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence/consciousness'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  That is what I thought 'comp' meant. My approach to this is to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adhere, as much as possible, to plain and simple English. Not being a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'mathematician' I stick with my type of sceptical method. To me this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not seem deeply problematic although is does of course limit the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scope of conversations I can participate in. As far as I can see, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno's grand scheme depends on 'assume', like the economists do. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unfortunately that which is assumed remains, I believe, unprovable.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Like any theory. By definition we cannot prove axioms in the theory, 
<br />
except trivially by one line argument: a proof that the number zero has 
<br />
no predecessor will look like &quot;see the first axiom&quot;. The axiom are just 
<br />
the minimal assumption we need to get the &quot;interesting propositions&quot;.
<br />
If I could prove the &quot;axioms&quot; from something simpler, I would take 
<br />
those simpler things as axioms.
<br />
<br />Now, many people does take as axiom the unprovable assertion that there 
<br />
is a physical universe. I don't. I am not &quot;atheist&quot; about the universe, 
<br />
but I am agnostic. I believe less in a primitive physical universe 
<br />
(especially as an explanation of physics) than in more general 
<br />
&quot;god-like&quot; or &quot;mathematical-like&quot; reality.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Furthermore there are deep, common sense, problems which undermine all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these theories of universal emulation possibilities, never mind those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; potentially lethal :-) teleporting/fax holidays and cryogenic time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shifts.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Life is risky. Planes are also potentially lethal. Going out of the 
<br />
mother's womb is actually 100% lethal. People who cryogenizes, does it 
<br />
in general at the end of their life. For a computationalist 
<br />
practioners, refusing an artificial brain when your biological ,one is 
<br />
ill, will be considered as lethal! Like today some say that refusing, 
<br />
for religious reason, a tranfer of blood, is lethal.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The biggest hurdle is the requirement for infinite computing ability.
</em><br />
<br />Only if you presuppose the need of a physical universe for the 
<br />
computations. But my point is that once you assume &quot;standard comp&quot; you 
<br />
have to drop out the idea of the *need* of a  physical universe. No 
<br />
need for high math to understand this. The UDA is enough. The 
<br />
arithmetical UDA is needed just to derive the physics from the numbers, 
<br />
not to understand we have to derive physics from the numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is simply the recognition that all measurements are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approximations so the teleporter/fax machine could only ever send an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approximate copy of me to whatever destination duty or holiday 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dreamings might lead me. Still, it is probable that I, as subjective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiencer, would not notice most anomalies, particularly if trying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to fill in the temporal gaps caused by Bruno's gratuitous delays in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reading me back out of his archive :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  This limitation hits all the 'Matrix' type scenarios as well: the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emulation system would require essentially infinite computing capacity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to reproduce any useful world that a real person inhabits. If on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other hand the Matrix is only concerned to make A world, its virtual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality inhabitants might be sustained [I am admitting this as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility] until they started engaging in real science. As I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand things the denizens of a Matrix type world would start to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find real anomalies in their 'reality' unless the matrix machine could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operate at a fineness of resolution unattainable by any experimental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; method the matrixians could devise.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually you are completely right here, and in total accordance with 
<br />
comp. This is a subtle point which I have explain to Brett Hall (on 
<br />
this list and on the for list). With comp we can measure somehow our 
<br />
degree of &quot;dreaming&quot;. See the following argument in ten steps from the 
<br />
list archive:
<br />
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg05272.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg05272.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There would be much less, or even no problem at all if they were all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believers in 'Intelligent Design' of course. [I can put that very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rudely as: the problem is not 'If our mind were simple enough to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand then we would be too dumb to understand it' but rather 'If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Intelligent Design were really true then we have been designed to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so dumb that it really doesn't matter!']
</em><br />
<br />Yeah... OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Re &quot;Platonic objects&quot; - I think this is illusory. The numbers that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people write down and think about are words in the language/s of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logico-mathematics.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But here I do disagree. Most mathematical truth, and the whole of 
<br />
arithmetical truth has nothing to do with language, nor anything to do 
<br />
with logic. You are confusing theories  (of number, say) and what the 
<br />
subject-matter of those theories. Theories are related to language and 
<br />
logic, but the object of the theories is a priori independent. This is 
<br />
clearer through some works in logic which can be use to make explicit 
<br />
some of the differences. You are implicitly defending here a 
<br />
&quot;conventionalist&quot; view of math, like many physicists (like Einstein, 
<br />
but unlike Penrose for example). I completely separate mathematical 
<br />
truth/realities and theories. A theory is like a lantern: it puts some 
<br />
light in the dark, no more.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; They do what they do because they are defined as such but they do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist apart from the systems which generate and record them - by which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mean brains, blackboards and computers, etc...
</em><br />
<br /><br />It seems you believe brains, blackbooard, computers exist per se. I 
<br />
guess in a physical universe, which you assume it exists. I respect all 
<br />
assumptions as far as people are willing to make an effort to 
<br />
understand those are assumptions. Then I give an argument showing that, 
<br />
although logically possible, a physical universe can not even been used 
<br />
to explain the (psychological) appearance of a physical universe, once 
<br />
we take comp as seriously as we can. I find even Tom Caylor &quot;good god&quot; 
<br />
less absurd than &quot;primary matter&quot; once comp is assumed, except that Tom 
<br />
sometimes take &quot;materiality&quot; for Jesus granted, when I don't take my 
<br />
own materiality for granted.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The regularities, and exciting facts people discover about them are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just that, regularities and exciting facts about languages.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Again, this is a confusion between means and objects. Language are 
<br />
useful to learn, explore, communicate about, appreciate, mathematical 
<br />
facts, but they are truly different from languages. Number Theory is 
<br />
quite different from Language Theory for example.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't mean that in any derogatory sense. We live largely BY MEANS OF 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our languages and certainly our cultural lives as human beings would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be impossible without language in the general and inclusive senses. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the universe is not made out of languages, it just exists - for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the moment at least.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Arithmetical truth is not made out of languages, even in a clearer way 
<br />
that the physical universe, which could be more near languages through 
<br />
the comp hypothesis.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  [NB: it just occurs to me that certain G/goddists will say that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe is made out of the mind of G/god/s which could perhaps be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; included as a or THE language of existence.
</em><br />
<br /><br />In that sense I already believe that the whole of biology belongs to a 
<br />
generalized language, with animals and vegetals being divine 
<br />
hypothesis...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be 'perfect' however, this would need to be allowed to have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite recursion, i.e. ''made out of(made out of(made out of(made 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out of ... -&gt; inf ... ))). As far as I can see however this would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amount to an assertion of many layered uncertainty and/or a Heraclitan 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in-falling in the direction of smallwards due to the necessity of each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; layer of divinity maintaining omniscience, omnipotence, and so for, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over and under its 'turf'. As this has the minimalist effect of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; underpinning either standard model QM, etc. or something like the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Process Physics advocated by Colin Hales and friends [which I find 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attractive], all is well with the world. :-]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But, seriously, all this stuff about 'supervening' and so forth is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all based on the Cartesian assumption that mind-stuff has no physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extension.
</em><br />
<br />Does it? How long is my qualia of &quot;understanding that joke?&quot;.
<br />
And again, you rely on the assumption that matter-stuff has a physical 
<br />
extension, which can only get a status of relative truth in the 
<br />
comp-physics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well the Inquisition is no longer the authority or power base that it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was and empirical science has moved on. I think the onus is falling 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ever more heavily on those who deny the identity of mind and brain to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain WHY they still do so.
</em><br />
<br />Because to get reasonable identity between say this precise pain and 
<br />
this precise brain you have to presuppose infinite matter and infinite 
<br />
mind, and the relation remains mysterious. But once you accept that 
<br />
mind supervenes on a finitely part of a brain, then &quot;the material part&quot; 
<br />
of the brain become &quot;metaphysically&quot; useless. I am not saying this is 
<br />
obvious, see the UDA reasoning.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The 'distinction' between 1st and 3rd person view points is simply raw 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact. Both view points have limits which can be seen to derive from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the view of reality they embody. 1st person viewpoint conflates the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience of being the embodiment of a view point with an experience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of all that is viewable,
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 3rd person viewpoint conflates objective models of things with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things themselves.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Very often (like you for arithmetical reality, if I may say), but not 
<br />
necessarily.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a sense in which these are simply manifestations of the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; raw fact of life: the model of something is not the thing, it is only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ABOUT the thing. Amen!   :-)
</em><br />
<br /><br />... and languages and theories can be used to talk about numbers and 
<br />
functions, but are not the same things, Amen  ;-)
