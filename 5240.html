Ben, we are getting somewhere.
<br />
I still see a difference between my trend to generalize concepts to the hilt
<br />
and applying them to identified processes/qualities (as: intelligent
<br />
events).
<br />
I consider determinism a &quot;result&quot; of affecting effects from parts
<br />
unidentified
<br />
I could call it an extended causality to the unlimited (vs. witin
<br />
boundaries)
<br />
impacts. Definitely not a purposeful action by determonation.
<br />
Such extension ad absurdum (?) gives the feeling of a free will. There are
<br />
elements in the &quot;causes&quot; beyond our knowledge, definitely beyond our
<br />
observation. Undiscovered may still influence.
<br />
Anticipatory can be an event if we can pinpoint the circumstances under
<br />
which it occurs (if not, not).
<br />
Your application to the physical world is not objectionable to me, just as
<br />
such:
<br />
an application of a general concept to a model. I discontinued to think as a
<br />
chemist (never really applied physicist mindwork) - a pretension I like to
<br />
say, one cannot really shed a 'brainwashed-in' philosophy of the gullible
<br />
ages when our 'intelligence' evolved. Exceptional people pretend to do so, I
<br />
don't believe it is going into the fundamental. We accept &quot;what we see&quot; and
<br />
see what we are told. The models of science, of religion, of materialism,
<br />
etc.
<br />
Using the wordage on this list, I am tempted to call math a 'universe' with
<br />
different qualities from the one we 'really' live in. Mathematicians have a
<br />
'schizophrenic existence', living with one consciousness in two universes.
<br />
(Some really don't, they take the math for real). I hope this is not
<br />
offensive.
<br />
<br />I think signs are secondary: mindwork after observation, by abstraction -
<br />
which IMO is the primary function of 'intelligence' (my definition:
<br />
elasticity
<br />
rather than plasticity of the growing brainwork). Language comes upon it,
<br />
however this is not a hierarchy: the mind applies the elements in concert
<br />
(just like a complexity &lt;G&gt;). Primary refers to the evolutiponary sequence.
<br />
<br />Thanks for your in-debth writing: I try to stay on top of it (meaning: NOT
<br />
digging into the depth, just superficially regarding the 'total'
<br />
(wholeness).
<br />
I hope it helps me escape from the restrictive details in thinking.
<br />

<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with Norman too, particularly about boundaries &amp; the &quot;snapshot
</em><br />
style.&quot; I would add that, the physical states &amp; events that can be detected
<br />
should implicitly contain the things that we fear may be &quot;reduced away.&quot;
<br />
Just because they would not be obvious when represented in physical
<br />
mathematical terms does not mean that they are not there. Here is an
<br />
example. When we discover a truth, we may well allow our behavior to depend
<br />
on it. We look in order to see, &amp; we somehow arrange it so that we **heed**
<br />
the signs. We allow logic, for instance, to be a distinct &amp; salient factor
<br />
in our behavior -- **in our cogitative behavior at least, but usually &amp;
<br />
almost inevitably much more.** And not only logic. Our behavior may arrange
<br />
to become specially dependent on the properties of the number pi, or on
<br />
statistical likelihoods apparent in information about the star Vega. We
<br />
allow &amp; support for our behavior to depend on continually renovated &amp;
<br />
occasionally redesigned structures of signs &amp;!
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  evidences conjectured, expected, grasped, remembered etc. These sort of
</em><br />
dependencies, then, characterize very particular sets of physical states &amp;
<br />
events -- those of intelligent beings. Physical states &amp; events are already
<br />
models for certain mathematical structures which we apply to understand
<br />
those physical states &amp; events. Somehow, some physical states &amp; events are
<br />
capable of representing others, sometimes many at a time with generality, &amp;
<br />
so on. Capable of representing &amp;/or interpreting &amp;/or proving or confirming
<br />
or corroborating or whatever. If mathematics itself is fecund with implicit
<br />
structures, there is no reason to think that the physical mathematical data
<br />
on physical states &amp; events are not likewise fecund with structures that
<br />
emerge, as we say, &amp; come to light at higher levels. (Or maybe I'm wrong,
<br />
I'm no physicist.)

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi all,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm trying to catch up the issues discussed, but it is becoming almost
</em><br />
impossible. That's why I'm commenting this mail almost 6 days late.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; About what you wrote Norman, I don't disagree. Physical Man is a sum of
</em><br />
physical states and events that can be detected and measured. If applied to
<br />
all Man will find out that the results will be the same. The difference
<br />
between each individual is meaningless at the atom level, quantum-state
<br />
level, etc. But when you start to logically &quot;group&quot; all of those &quot;physical
<br />
definitions&quot;, you'll start to get different results. For example, in a so
<br />
low level state you can't see the difference bewteen &quot;Thought&quot; and &quot;body&quot;.
<br />
They are all electrical manifestations. When gathering all the small
<br />
&quot;pieces&quot;, you start to have a more high level view of the individual. The
<br />
&quot;Thought&quot; and &quot;body&quot; become distinct from each other. If we try only to
<br />
explain each piece of the puzzle individually, we will have interesting
<br />
mathematical formulations and theorys, but unusefull to identify the
<br />
&quot;individual&quot; completely. When we start to &quot;build&quot; the puzzle bit by bit,
<br />
we'll find out that the relations between each!
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  piece have something more to add to the mathematical formula of &quot;life&quot;.
</em><br />
Maybe in a higher level, different &quot;blocks&quot; of the puzzle have a common
<br />
meaning for all individuals and can be used as &quot;base units&quot; to continue
<br />
building the puzzle, diminishing the level of complexity.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In one thing I agree: the start must be on the atom level, quantum-state,
</em><br />
etc. What do you all think of this approach?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Also, I'm unable to find a meaningful (to me) argument against
</em><br />
reductionism.  Why is it in trouble?  It seems to me that even a complex
<br />
human being can be defined in concept by discrete quantum states and
<br />
particles, atoms and electrical charges.  &quot;Thoughts&quot; are therefore NOT
<br />
infinite because they can be conceptually defined in terms of particles and
<br />
quantum states, and there are not an infinite number of these permutations.&lt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;My take on reductionism is the &quot;snapshot style&quot; (in maybe wider sense
</em><br />
than just visual) - considering boundaries for our observation (thinking)
<br />
and establishing a model of the 'observed' target WITHIN them. In the sense
<br />
of unlimited interconnection (and a/effecting), such view cuts off
<br />
connotations beyond said boundaries (be it Q-state, particles, cinsidered
<br />
permutations, atoms, electrical charges or whatever is one's beef). It is a
<br />
limited view (model) perfectly applicable for computations. Yet: limited.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;My trend in thoinking (in the newly (just emerging) 'wholistic'
</em><br />
complexity) is the unlimited connectivity - not that I claim to successfully
<br />
apply it. We all DO think in reductionistic ways - the only way our mind
<br />
works without implying (mystical?) infinity - so I cannot belittle your
<br />
opinion.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I wonder if Doug thinks in the same lines as I do.
