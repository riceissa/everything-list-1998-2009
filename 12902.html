<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree that positivists don't like metaphysics, and they actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; don't believe in it either.  The problem with this is that science is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; ultimately based on (and is inescapably in the context of) some kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of metaphysics, since it is in the context of the universe as a whole.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; There are some ways of sorting out metaphysics.  In fact these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; criteria are mostly the same as how we sort out science (since, again,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; science is based on metaphysics).  These are such things as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; fundamentality, generality and beauty.  However, the fact that science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; conventionally has been limited to the &quot;material&quot; (whatever that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; means!) implies that the criteria of naturality (a viscious circle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; actually!) and reproducibility (another vicious circle) that we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; in science cannot be applied to the universe as a whole or to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; metaphysics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; [Side note: But even more important is to recognize that metaphysics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; as well as science, is filtered for us: we are part of the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; and we are limited.  So this filters out almost everything.  This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; limits more than anything the amount of &quot;sense&quot; we can make out of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Everything.]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; However the criterion that you are trying to enforce, that of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; things having a cause even in the context of Everything and Everyone,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; is a positivist criteria, treating metaphysics as science.  It assumes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; that Everything has to be part of this closed system of cause and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; effect.  There are plenty of criteria to sort out Everything (as I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned above) without getting into the positivist viscious circle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The universe is not under any obligation to reveal itself to us. All we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; do is stumble around blindly gathering what data we can and make a best
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; guess as to what's going on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a metaphysical judgment.  There are those who strongly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disagree on rational grounds.
</em><br />
<br /><br />One of the problems with the verification principle of logical positivism
<br />
was that it, itself, cannot be verified by the verification principle, and
<br />
hence is subject to the charge of being part of the hated metaphysics (and,
<br />
I suppose, if it could be verified it would be subject to the charge that it
<br />
was a circular argument). But I would get around the problem by stating the
<br />
principles by which science works thus: IF you want to predict the weather,
<br />
build planes that fly, make sick people better THEN you should do such and
<br />
such. By putting it in this conditional form there is no metaphysical
<br />
component.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Science is just a systematisation of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; process, with guesses taking the form of models and theories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So science is a just systematisation of a metaphysical judgment.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; However, it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all tentative, and the scientific method itself is tentative: tomorrow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pigs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; might sprout wings and fly, even though this has never happened before.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would bet that pigs will still be land-bound tomorrow, because there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reason to think otherwise, but I have to stop short of absolute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainty. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; metaphysical position would be that flying pigs are an absurdity or an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; anathema and therefore pigs absolutely *cannot* fly. But it is arrogant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; well as wrong to create absolute certainty, absolute meaning, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absolute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; anything else by fiat, just because that's what you fancy. If there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; things we can't know with certainty or can't know at all, that may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unfortunate, but it's the way the world is.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Looking over my previous post, I cannot see why you are bringing up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absolute certainty.  Also I don't know what &quot;absolute meaning&quot; means,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless it means knowing meaning with absolute certainty in which case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't hold that view.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sorry if I have misunderstood, and if I have been unclear or tangential.
<br />
Several posts back you spoke of positivism being deficient because &quot;a closed
<br />
system which is supposedly totally explainable will always have at least one
<br />
fixed point that is unexplainable&quot;. I read into this an implication that God
<br />
would solve the problem because he could be outside the system, indeed
<br />
outside all possible systems. But this runs into two problems. The first is
<br />
that positivists are in fact very modest and make no claim to explain
<br />
everything; the very opposite, in fact. The second is that the concept of an
<br />
entity outside all possible systems, and therefore requiring no cause,
<br />
design, meaning or any of the other things allegedly necessary for the
<br />
universe and its components constitutes a restatement of the ontological
<br />
argument for the existence of God, an argument that is 900 years old and has
<br />
been rejected as invalid even by most theists.
