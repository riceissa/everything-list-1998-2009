<br />That's very interesting; I was not aware of Zuse.  Unfortunately I
<br />
don't know German so I can't read his paper.
<br />
<br />Regarding the question of the compatibility of CA models with relativity
<br />
and QM, Wolfram looks into this in some detail.  He essentially abandons
<br />
a simple CA model in favor of a more complex network of interacting
<br />
nodes, which has some features similar to the Lorentz transformation of
<br />
relativity.  Then to address the EPR style long-distance correlations of
<br />
QM, he proposes that while the network is mostly local, it has occasional
<br />
nodes which get stretched apart and are connected to distant nodes.
<br />
These are rare but allow for the type of information flow necessary to
<br />
reproduce long-distance QM correlations.  All in all it is a pretty ad
<br />
hoc and unconvincing model.
<br />
<br />I tried to read the t'Hooft paper referenced here but it was over my
<br />
head.  It also struck me though as not really addressing the discrepancy
<br />
between long-distance correlations and local CA models.  It seems very
<br />
much an open and difficult question to me to show how a local CA model
<br />
can reproduce relativity and QM.
<br />
<br />One issue which CA models tend to ignore is the MWI.  Most CA models
<br />
are built as hidden variable theories which define a single universe.
<br />
Some multiverse models have that structure as well.  But it seems to me
<br />
that this is an entirely unnecessary restriction.  If a CA can model
<br />
a universe, it can model a multiverse, and likewise with any other
<br />
computing model like TMs.
<br />
<br />The MWI is fully deterministic, which may make it a more attractive
<br />
target for modelling with a deterministic computational theory than
<br />
attempting to reproduce the statistical phenomena of QM, essentially
<br />
via hidden variables.  Any hidden variable theory, CA based or not,
<br />
has two strikes against it from the beginning due to the the many well
<br />
known difficulties of Bell inequalities and EPR correlations.
<br />
<br />Regarding entropy, it is pointed out that entropy does not grow in a
<br />
CA model.  Wolfram discusses this as well.  While entropy technically
<br />
does not grow, you can get phenomena that look very much like entropy
<br />
growth in a CA model.  Eventually you will get a Poincare recurrence
<br />
if the universe is finite.  But if you start in a sufficiently simple
<br />
state, there are many CA models which will mimic entropy growth into a
<br />
more complex state.  And this may be close enough to explain our universe.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, of course the MWI as a deterministic theory also does
<br />
not have entropy growth.  As mentioned above, computational models of
<br />
our universe might well do better to aim towards an MWI world.
<br />
<br />As far as the claim that we already know the algorithm that runs our
<br />
universe, and it is the UD: I think this is amusing but ultimately
<br />
misleading.  It's true that a dovetailer which runs all programs will
<br />
indeed run our own universe's program (assuming it has one), but I think
<br />
it is a misuse of terminology to say that the UD is the algorithm that
<br />
is running our universe.  I would reserve that phrase to refer to the
<br />
specific program that generates our universe and no others.  It will be a
<br />
tremendous accomplishment of physics and philosophy when that program is
<br />
discovered, but it is misleading to give the impression that we already
<br />
know what it is.
<br />
<br />I think a better terminology here would be something like, we don't
<br />
need to know the specific program that describes our universe in order
<br />
to imagine how to program a computer that would in fact generate our
<br />
experiences, at least in theory.  And then go on and explain about
<br />
running all programs at once, etc.
