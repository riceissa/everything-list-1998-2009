Dear Russell, you wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;This sounds like a terminological difference. To me, &quot;data&quot; refers to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mere differences. Information has meaning. Observation attaches
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meaning to data, creating informations from that data.&quot;
</em><br />
WHAT do you &quot;observe&quot; if you have to create the meaning? I find it a reverse
<br />
route, to learn the quantities (data) and then enrich them with meaning to
<br />
make it 'information'. Don't forget that there is ample information
<br />
(meanings galore) - unquantizable, where the 'bits' don't even come into the
<br />
picture. All those are &quot;its&quot; (in my nomenclature).
<br />
I wonder if I am alone with this terminology?
<br />
Far we are not: in my terminology to 'absorb' (acknowledge, imbibe) a
<br />
difference implies the meaning part as well, so the datum gets it when it
<br />
becomes information. Of course data can be non-quantitative.
<br />
*
<br />
Then you wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Again this is terminology. By &quot;timelike&quot; I was referring to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process of bringing two entities together for comparison. Nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more, not less. Perhaps &quot;pre-timelike&quot; is a more accurate term, but I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like to egg the pudding!
</em><br />
<br />You probably missed my example anticipating such reply:
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;... observation can compare e.g. overlapping pictures,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; atemporarily, in one.... &quot;&lt;&lt;
</em><br />
when WE do not &quot;bring together&quot; comparables one after the other.
<br />
I don't deny the time factor, just want to leave open the possibility of an
<br />
atemporal worldview (which is still a big problem for me, too).
<br />
*
<br />
Then again I have a reply to your:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not sure how remark to point 4 relates to this one. Does it mean you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't believe in QM? Or that QM is not universal within the &gt;plenitude?
</em><br />
(I'd agree with you there) Or that QM is an accidental &gt;feature of our
<br />
world? (I'm inclined to disagree with you here)&lt;
<br />
<br />First I find it an 'out-of-bounds' argumentative twist to change my term
<br />
&quot;human representational way of OUR world model&quot; into your
<br />
&quot;accidental feature of our world&quot;.
<br />
The linear THEORY of QM about the - originally- (nonlinear?) world of
<br />
microscopic physics is not a 'feature' of the world. I answered this
<br />
differentiation after #4 (cf: Comp-Turing), that's why I referred to it
<br />
after #5 (QM) as similarly a limited model based anthropologism. Sorry if a
<br />
critical remark on QM hit mores sensitive chords.
<br />
*
<br />
Small potato: (on the religious discussion-example)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No ideas can be proven. Surely you know that from Popper. &lt;
</em><br />
Right you are, let's change it to 'justified'/'explained'. That can be
<br />
logical, even if Sir Karl did not exclude it from existence. What I meant
<br />
is: first the believers should explain what their belief is based on, then I
<br />
can argue against it. Not in reverse (time!).
<br />
I don't start to argue against something the existence of which I don't see
<br />
justified or explained, just because the other side would like to put me
<br />
into a more vulnerable position in the argumentation.
<br />
*
<br />
To your final par:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Comp &amp; QM aren't part of the belief system here. They are interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; afterthoughts. The belief system relates to ideas about what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information means - I don't really see you disputing this, although I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do see some misunderstandings; the existence of a plenitude of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; data (which I don't see you disputing either); and the Anthropic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Principle, which you may well dispute, as its a decidedly dodgy
</em><br />
proposition.&gt;
<br />
<br />Information I coined more than 10 years ago (maybe a review is actual, one
<br />
reason why I entered this discussion: to get new input ideas) was:
<br />
Absorbed (acknowledged) difference. By any contraption capable of doing so
<br />
('meaning' implied). Any difference, from an electrical charge to an
<br />
economical controversy in S-W Asia. Now I see 'observation' as very close to
<br />
this. And: to 'experience' as well.
<br />
My plenitude is a feature in my NARRATIVE (not even a hypo-thesis)
<br />
needed for a story of Big Bangs (unlimited) to start the multiverse in a way
<br />
acceptable for human logic (- without the controversies in the physical
<br />
cosmological BB fable.) It lacks data, serves ONE purpose, I refuse to
<br />
discuss details of it, it is unobservable and unexplained.
<br />
Sorry, I did not read your paper on the AP, maybe you made some sense to it.
<br />
So far I see in it only &quot;us, god's real children as the most important
<br />
feature in the world&quot;.
<br />
Merry Xmas! (oops: it is past).
<br />
<br />John Mikes
