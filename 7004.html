<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And that, in my view, is the heart of the problem.  Rather than swallow

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hard and look at this in a non-biased fashion, you seem to be glued to the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proposition that (1) it's intractable or (2) it's not worth analyzing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because the answer is obvious.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think you misunderstood what I was arguing in my previous posts. If you 
<br />
look them over again, you'll see that I wasn't making a broad statement 
<br />
about the impossibility of estimating the probability that this event would 
<br />
have happened by chance, I was making a specific criticism of *your* method 
<br />
of doing so, where you estimate the probability of the particular &quot;gestalt&quot; 
<br />
of Szilard/lens/beryllium/uranium/bomb, rather than trying to estimate the 
<br />
probability that a story would anticipate *any* possible gestalt associated 
<br />
with the Manhattan Project. By doing this, you are incorporating hindsight 
<br />
knowledge of Heinlein's story into your choice of the &quot;target&quot; whose 
<br />
probability you want to estimate, and in general this will always lead to 
<br />
estimates of the significance of a &quot;hit&quot; which are much too high. If you 
<br />
instead asked someone with no knowledge of of Heinlein's story to come up 
<br />
with a list of as many possible words associated with the Manhattan Project 
<br />
that he could think of, then estimated the probability that a story would 
<br />
anticipate *any* combination of words on the list, then your method would 
<br />
not be vulnerable to this criticism (it might be flawed for other reasons, 
<br />
but I didn't address any of these other reasons in my previous posts).
<br />
<br />Look over the analogy I made in my last post again:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Suppose you pick 100 random words out of a
<br />
dictionary, and then notice that the list contains the words &quot;sun&quot;, &quot;also&quot;,
<br />
and &quot;rises&quot;...as it so happens, that particular 3-word &quot;gestalt&quot; is also
<br />
part of the title of a famous book, &quot;the sun also rises&quot; by Hemingway. Is
<br />
this evidence that Hemingway was able to anticipate the results of your
<br />
word-selection through ESP? Would it be fair to test for ESP by calculating
<br />
the probability that someone would title a book with the exact 3-word
<br />
gestalt &quot;sun, also, rises&quot;? No, because this would be tailoring the choice
<br />
of gestalt to Hemingway's book in order to make it seem more unlikely, in
<br />
fact there are 970,200 possible 3-word gestalts you could pick out of a list
<br />
of 100 possible words, so the probability that a book published earlier
<br />
would contain *any* of these gestalts is a lot higher than the probability
<br />
it would contain the precise gestalt &quot;sun, also, rises&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />To simplify things even further, let's say you simply make a list of ten 
<br />
random numbers from 1 to 100, and before you make the list I make the 
<br />
prediction &quot;the list will contain the numbers 23 and 89&quot;. If it turns out 
<br />
that those two numbers are indeed on your list, what is the significance of 
<br />
this result as evidence for precognition on my part? Your method would be 
<br />
like ignoring the other 8 numbers on the list and just finding the 
<br />
probability that I would hit the precise target of &quot;23, 89&quot; by chance, which 
<br />
(assuming order doesn't matter) would be only about a 1 in 5025 shot, if my 
<br />
math is right. But the probability that both the numbers I guess will be 
<br />
*somewhere* on the list of ten is significantly higher--I get that the 
<br />
probability of this would be about 1 in 121. So if this experiment is done 
<br />
in many alternate universes, then if in fact I have no precognitive 
<br />
abilities, in about 1 in 121 universes, both numbers I guess will happen to 
<br />
be on your list by luck. But then if you used the method of tailoring the 
<br />
choice of target to my guess, in each such universe you will conclude that I 
<br />
only had a 1 in 5025 chance of making that guess by chance. Clearly, then, 
<br />
you get bad conclusions if you use hindsight knowledge to tailor the choice 
<br />
of target to what you know was actually guessed in this way. But it's also 
<br />
clear that this example is sufficiently well-defined that I would have no 
<br />
general objection to estimating the probability that my &quot;hit&quot; could have 
<br />
occurred by chance, it's just that the correct answer is 1 in 121, not 1 in 
<br />
5025.
