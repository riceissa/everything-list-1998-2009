A very interesting post. David Deutsch spends some time in his book
<br />
about time travel, but this is a new slant on the subject. My personal
<br />
hunch is that your proposition 2 is the correct one, and that as you
<br />
say it conveniently answers Stephen Hawking's &quot;spaceship&quot; argument
<br />
about why time travellers are not extant now.
<br />
<br />An interesting experiment you have proposed to test which alternative
<br />
is valid. I'm not quite convinced that it is a valid test, although
<br />
I'll buy that it potentially falsifies your proposition 2 (without
<br />
saying anything at all about proposition 1). I'll need to ruminate on
<br />
this some more. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've been considering time travel in the context of quantum mechanics and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parallel universes, and have come up with some thoughts and ideas about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subject.  This might be a little off-topic, but it does have to do with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory of parallel universes, which seems to be a large part of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion on this newsgroup.  I'm interested to know what you think of my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thoughts/ideas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most scientists agree that time travel is theoretically possible.  Although 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the task seems monumentous, many scientists also agree that it will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually be possible.  Using MW theory, the paradoxes are resolved.  Here 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are some of my observations/ideas/theories behind quantum time travel.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know from some of the research I did (and some reasonable assumptions) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that travelling back in time would put you back to the branch in which you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set your &quot;time machine&quot; to travel back to, and from there you would branch 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into a universe in which you suddenly appear from the future.  From there, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability would remain as you expect it to using the SE, but since things 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are initially different in this branch (you are there), things would turn 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out differently in that universe than in one in which you didn't appear.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But how exactly is probability affected during time travel?  I assume one of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two possibilities:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.  Travelling back in time actually affects the probability of the people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from that time suddenly seeing you appear from the future.  So, if normally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the probability of you appearing would be nil, then because in the future 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you decided to travel back to that time, you actually made their probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of seeing you appear significant.  Perhaps those people actually have a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 50/50 chance of seeing you appear.  Those who end up in the universe in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which you didn't appear would eventually end up at the point in which you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decide to go back in time.  Those who end up in the universe in which you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; did appear would probably follow an entirely different path.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2.  Travelling back in time does not affect the probability of the people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from that time suddenly seeing you appear from the future.  The only way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they would see you appearing is if molecules from their universe suddenly, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by pure chance, arranged themselves to create you.  Of course, you know that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this universe was very likely to be YOUR universe, but at the same time you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know that everyone else you see in it is in a universe that they had an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absolutely nil chance of being in.  They are justified in claiming that you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearing in their universe was an absolute miracle and fluke of nature, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; while at the same time you are justified in claiming that this universe was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very likely for you, and was not a miracle or a fluke of nature at all.  In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other words, by time travelling you have managed to put yourself with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; virtual certainty into a virtually impossible universe.  If this was the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case, then for us to see beings from the future visiting us would be no more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; special, and in fact no different, than me suddenly appearing on the moon by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pure chance.  This would give an answer to Stephen Hawking's argument 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against time travel, which was that if time travel were possible, we should 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be seeing visitors from the future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If proposition #1 was true, there would have to be some sort of relationship 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the measure of a certain universe and the probability of seeing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; visitors that went back in time from that universe, otherwise we'd see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; visitors from every possible future universe that sent visitors back in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time, and we'd constantly be seeing an infinite number of visitors coming 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the future.  It is most reasonable to assume that we will see visitors 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from a likely future universe, so the relationship would probably be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; greater the measure of a future universe, the more likely we are to see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; visitors from that universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This brings me to one potential downfall of proposition #1.  Let us suppose 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this scenario: we continue through time (without any visitors from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future) and eventually achieve the ability to time travel.  We travel back 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a certain point in our past, not once, but many, many hundreds of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; millions of times.  Because travelling back in time changes the probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of what happened, then because we travelled back in time hundreds of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; millions of times, the probability that the people from that time won't see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; visitors from the future is very, very small.  The chance of not seeing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; visitors from the future becomes insignificant compared to the probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of seeing visitors from the future.  Because it is so insignificant, it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unlikely that the people will see visitors from that universe due to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship I mentioned earlier.  But if we are unlikely to see visitors 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the future, then the original universe becomes very likely again.  So, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we have a paradox.  For this reason I believe that proposition #1 is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This leaves proposition #2, which is not very attractive to people who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe we are being visited by beings from the future, or people who dream 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of one day being visited.  However, just in case I have erred in my logic of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proving proposition #1 wrong, I have come up with some interesting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibilities that proposition #1 provides, besides a paradox.  Below I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present a way in which to test, right now, whether time travel - and, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specifically, proposition #1, exists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The experiment is simple: organize an international decree that when we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discover time travel, we should travel back to this very day, month, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; year.  The hope is that when we do discover time travel, we will go back to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the year 2000 because of the decree, and show everyone in this time that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time travel is indeed possible, and hopefully even give these people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; advanced technology.  If part of the decree is that we go back many, many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times, then the chance the people from this time don't see any visitors from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the future is very small (we are pretending that the original universe is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still signinficant).  In other words, by simply issuing a decree right now, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can possibly discover whether time travel is possible, right now.  Of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course, proposition #1 would have to be correct, and even if it was, there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are plenty of reasons that our future selves wouldn't visit us.  They might 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not do it for moral or economic reasons, or they might have forgotten or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just don't care about the decree anymore.  Or, time travel might be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretically possible, but not practical in any way.  A disaster might have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even befallen our descendants, wiping them out before they could develop 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time travel.  However, all of these potential problems aside, I believe that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if proposition #1 was a possibility, then by issuing this decree we would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; siginificantly increasing the chances of seeing visitors from the future 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right now.  Of course, the sooner we do the experiment, the more likely it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that we won't see visitors from the future, because there is more time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for something to go wrong before we develop time travel technology.
