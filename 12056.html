Hi Brent,

<br />
Our present discussion with Tom and others is particularly important 
<br />
for me. I am concentrating myself on the last decisions before writing 
<br />
&quot;the english version of my thesis&quot;, probably in the form of one paper + 
<br />
one book (the difference is that the book should be an, as 
<br />
self-contained as possible, version of the paper. It is difficult 
<br />
because the intended audience is fuzzy: physicists have the right 
<br />
motivations (figure out what is reality), logicians and computer 
<br />
scientists have the right tools (diagonalizations), neoplatonist 
<br />
theologians have the right attitude, basic theory and questions, etc.

<br />
I still don't know if you have understand the full UDA reasoning, or at 
<br />
least the seven first steps, nor do I know if this would help 
<br />
concerning the &quot;vocabulary&quot; problem. I do think you have not yet 
<br />
understand the AUDA, as your recurrent remark on Gettier 
<br />
illustrates----we should perhaps harness this point in a deeper way at 
<br />
some point.
<br />
A contingent problem is that physicists, who are the best placed to 
<br />
understand my work, has been cooled down by the fact that someone as 
<br />
brilliant in math as Penrose has been able to be so wrong on Godel's 
<br />
theorem, and for many people the term &quot;Godel&quot; means &quot;risky&quot;!

<br />
Now, since I have defended my thesis, I have done two &quot;major&quot; 
<br />
discoveries (as people following the list can guess):
<br />
1) The interview of the lobian machine directly offers a purely 
<br />
arithmetical interpretation of Plotinus's theory (of mind&amp;matter).
<br />
2) The comp standard model of particles can be derived from some 
<br />
permutations group related to universal diophantine polynomial. This 
<br />
has forced me to dig far deeper in number theory, and leads, here too 
<br />
alas, toward very complex mathematical questions.

<br />
In my mind, the &quot;1)&quot; really helps, as far as we are open to 
<br />
neoplatonism. If not, it obviously favorizes rejection. The &quot;2)&quot; does 
<br />
not help at all and I don't know really what to do with that.


<br />
Le 05-déc.-06, à 20:05, Brent Meeker a écrit :


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand that you use &quot;God&quot; to refer to whatever is fundamental.


</em><br />
That is the idea, but actually I never use the term &quot;God&quot;, except for 
<br />
going quick in some answer to post which use the term. The &quot;God&quot; I 
<br />
refer to is closer to Plotinus' ONE or to the Chinese TAO, the main 
<br />
axiom is that it is the biggest unconceivable reality with the property 
<br />
that you cannot give a name to it, or if you do, you get a 
<br />
multiplication of approximations which can hide the very idea (but 
<br />
which can be rich and creative though when distinguished from It).
<br />
The arithmetical interpretation of the ONE for the &quot;theology&quot; of a 
<br />
lobian machine PA is arithmetical truth. By Tarski theorem it is 
<br />
unameable by PA, for example.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And that may well be consistent with the way Plato used it.


</em><br />
Hard question of course, but a case can be made that it would have been 
<br />
accepted by the most pythagoreans among the neoplatonist.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But even among Plato's contemporary's it was probably heard as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; referring to the Olympians.  And now, a couple of millenia later, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;theos&quot;, &quot;theism&quot;, and &quot;theology&quot; have come to refer to a single 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal God.


</em><br />
The neoplatonist have introduced it, but Plotinus ascribes it to the 
<br />
Parmenides of Plato. The Timaeus and other text by Plato and even 
<br />
Aristotle are going in that direction. Note that the neoplatonist are 
<br />
rationalist, and their use of words is very near the modern axiomatic 
<br />
like the one used in math. In some late neoplatonist works &quot;Gods&quot; can 
<br />
be translated by the concept of concept, property, or even set. But 
<br />
Plotinus endows monotheism/monism, as I think comp, by its unameable 
<br />
platonism, does too.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since the time of Plato other terms have been introduced to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguish other &quot;fundamentals&quot;, deism, pantheism, naturalism.


</em><br />
Deism, pantheism, naturalism are all &quot;theological&quot; position. This is 
<br />
perhaps why I need the term &quot;theology&quot;, in an admittedly larger sense 
<br />
than the current sense. The UD reasoning shows that the belief in 
<br />
naturalism is a theological position. It need faith in something called 
<br />
&quot;Nature&quot;, etc. I really consider scientific theology as the scientific 
<br />
approach to what science cannot prove, but still infer correctly. Of 
<br />
course I would less dare to say this without knowing about the [] and 
<br />
[]* distinction in the arithmetical hypostases (G*/G, Z1*/Z1, X1*/X1, 
<br />
etc.)



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is an entirely contingent and sad fact that theology has been more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; less stolen by the temporal authoritative power of the Roman, and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; still today many people forget that theology has been and can still 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; science, ie something than can be driven by the modesty attitude.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Would a study of the character of leprechauns be science if were 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; driven by a modesty attitude?


</em><br />
Yes. Even to conclude perhaps that there is no evidence known for 
<br />
affirming that there are leprechauns today.  A good example is the work 
<br />
of Suzanne Balckmore on parapsychology (In search of the light) where 
<br />
she demolishes one century of parapsychological evidence in London. In 
<br />
London, her colleagues were as serious as Blackmore by letting her 
<br />
defend her thesis, and by refining their approach. The scientific 
<br />
attitude has nothing to do with the chosen subject. A magician can be 
<br />
more scientific than a astrophysician. We must never judge a work from 
<br />
its domain.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The problem I have with your use of &quot;theology&quot; is that anyone hears 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it, without having heard your explanation, will almost certainly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misunderstand it.


</em><br />
OK, but the same problem occur with the enunciation of the results.  
<br />
With or without the use of the term &quot;theology&quot; I put in doubt about 
<br />
1500 years of &quot;naive materialism&quot; (no more so than QM though). It 
<br />
clarifies to admit this explicitly. My diplomatic versions of my thesis 
<br />
of the year 1970, and 1980 did not help, apparently.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are of course free to use whatever word to mean whatever you want 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - but that does not constrain me from using it in it's currently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accepted sense.

</em><br />
At least in this list we have to be sure we agree on the meaning of the 
<br />
terms, at least with respect to a thread!
<br />
(Of course here we are &quot;meta-discussing&quot; the use of a word).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And in that sense I stand by my above statement.  Can you cite a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current theologian who does not hold that God (whatever His nature) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provides the basis of all meaning?

</em><br />
Exactly like &quot;Nature&quot; for a naturalist provides the basis of all 
<br />
meaning for him/her. Exactly like &quot;Prime Matter&quot; provides all meaning 
<br />
for a materialist. Exactly like &quot;personal God&quot; provides all meaning for 
<br />
Tom.
<br />
You just give a good (in the type very large) definition of God. It is 
<br />
what provides the basis of all meaning. OK.
<br />
Then the ONE of plotinus, and arithmetical truth for PA, does provides 
<br />
the meaning indeed, for Plotinus, and for PA respectively.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am an atheist - I don't believe the &quot;theos&quot; of Chrisitianity (or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Islam, or Judaism) exists.  Failing to believe in an entity whose 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defining characteristics are inconsistent with common observation is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hardly dogmatic.


</em><br />
Of course. And if by God you mean a white male sitting on a cloud, then 
<br />
I am as atheist as you. Nor do I believe that the bread is literaly the 
<br />
Christ chair. I don't believe either in Santa Klaus.
<br />
Now, in Europa, I have never met a catholic really believing that God 
<br />
was literally bread or even literally male, etc. It is just traditional 
<br />
legends used to make up a community. Most catholic are, during the 
<br />
week, even more atheist than self-called atheist. The sunday they 
<br />
follow family traditions.
<br />
But what makes me nervous with both catholic and atheist is when they 
<br />
assert that the  existence of Nature (what is that? I am not talking 
<br />
about nature, but Nature) is a scientific fact. This is scientism, fake 
<br />
science, fake theology, fake certainty.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now all tradition have had good theologians at all time, even if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sometimes some are obliged to talk in coded way just for not finishing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on the fire.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To refuse the use of the original word &quot;theology&quot; is just a way to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; defend (purposefully or not) 1500 years of institutionalized 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; charlatanry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, it is a way to communicate clearly in current standard English.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To use it in a sense that has not been common for 1500yrs is talking 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a coded way...


</em><br />
Expert always talk in some coded way. Many current books, if only all 
<br />
those on Plotinus or neoplatonism, or on eastern religions use the term 
<br />
theology in the larger sense, and as I told you, even catholic does 
<br />
that. My favorite books on Proclus (another famous neoplatonist after 
<br />
plotinus) are book by catholics (Jean Trouillard, ...). I like very 
<br />
much the jesuit Paul Valadier.  It is a fact that as bad the catholic 
<br />
have been in the past, they have been able to convey (well mainly 
<br />
thanks to the jewish and arabic neoplatonists who remind them the 
<br />
point) the neoplatonic theories (a bit transformed). And the math 
<br />
associated with it!


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I don't know to what purpose since the Enlightenment has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eliminated the burning of heretics, at least in Belgium.


</em><br />
(no comment)
<br />
Enlightenment was 1/2 Enlightenment. The *practice* of eliminative 
<br />
materialism eliminates persons (cf Europa).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have no doubt you are correct about Plato's use of the word.  But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; words mean what people think they mean.


</em><br />
In mundane conversation only. In scientific discussion words should 
<br />
have no importance at all, except at the start by pointing on something 
<br />
sufficiently precise to be wrong so that the beginners can begin to 
<br />
correct its interpretations and develop his/her doubting abilities, and 
<br />
multiply the theories and their possible interpretations.

<br />
I have already asked for another word for &quot;theology&quot; in the list, but 
<br />
none of the propositions made did make sense as those who did propose 
<br />
them generally have agree. Brent if you have an idea ?  I am aware that 
<br />
on a subject as hot as the fundamental questions we should be careful 
<br />
with the wording, but imo it is even more important to be careful on 
<br />
clarity. I'm not sure, and I'm a bit stuck on that point for the 
<br />
moment.

<br />
Bruno
