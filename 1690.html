</em><br />
<br />I agree. We must work until we understand the roots of our
<br />
misunderstanding.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;i) COMP means that I can survive the replacement of my brain by some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Turing emulation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not really. Look at the UDA. COMP is 3 things:
<br />
<br />1) = what you are saying (survive a substitution done at 
<br />
the right digital level, which is supposed to exist)
<br />
<br />2) Church thesis (I realise Schmidhuber does not cite it
<br />
explicitely!, but the use of the compiler theorem and the use of
<br />
his &quot;great programmer&quot; would not work without it).
<br />
<br />3) Arithmetical Realism (here is Schmidhuber plenitude!!!).
<br />
Arithmetical Realism makes all steps of the UD work (Great Programmer's
<br />
work) existing independantly of me.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;ii) Schmidhuber means that all computations exist. (via UD*)
</em><br />
<br />That is equivalent to the arithmetical realism. (AR)
<br />
To be sure AR seems to say that a little more than &quot;all the
<br />
computations exists&quot;, and so, at this stage comp looks like
<br />
lying in between Tegmark and Schmidhuber. But ... see below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I could well imagine conscious entities diagonalising the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;UD* output to generate an experience which is not an explicit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computation.
</em><br />
<br />Well. This is false, and even importantly false. You point
<br />
here on my deeper motivation for Church thesis: the set of all
<br />
computable functions, and the set of all computations, i.e. UD*
<br />
is closed for diagonalisation.
<br />
This is exactly why Godel, who takes time to accept Church thesis,
<br />
called that thesis really a miracle.
<br />
This is a wonderfull feature of the set of computable functions 
<br />
because it gives us the FIRST mathematical (and until today the only)
<br />
mathematical structure which does not lead us to paradoxes when it
<br />
is conceived as a Totality, or an Everything Ontology.
<br />
That is why in some sense Schmidhuber plenitude, or my UD*, are
<br />
vastly more bigger than a priori Tegmark-like form of Platonisme.
<br />
Of course there is a price, which is the non recursive axiomatisation
<br />
of the set of all truth. But by Godel this is true even for
<br />
elementary arithmetical truth (which indeed is somewhat equivalent to
<br />
UD* although I should add some nuance here).
<br />
<br />Actually, we don't need more than arithmetical plenitude: if
<br />
we are machine, we cannot prove that there is more than machines.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the Chaitin version of Godel's theorem (also found by Post in 
</em><br />
the twinties!) a machine cannot prove that something more complex than
<br />
itself is not a machine. In my annexe on Church thesis in my thesis, I
<br />
explain that point and I explicitely show that Church thesis makes a
<br />
case for the rehabilitation of the old Pythagorism. 
<br />
<br />So remember: UD* is closed for diagonalisation. You cannot diagonalised
<br />
again UD*. Any diagonalisation on UD* create something which exists in 
<br />
UD*. It is important: without that closure I would just be mad thinking
<br />
the physical as a subspecies of the informatical.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;By me - I assume you mean COMP. Lets talk about Tegmark, and yes I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe Tegmark is referring to formal axiomatic systems (he seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;go on about them in his paper). I can see clearly that Tegmark \subset
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Schmidhuber, however it is less clear that the reverse relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;holds. If the reverse relationship did hold, then it would make little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difference, apart from the White Rabbit problem vanishing.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure I understand. (I propose we go back to tegmark later).
<br />
At this stage it is out of our basic misunderstanding, I guess.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course you can can compute the ensemble (UD*) - this follows from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Schmidhuber's Plenitude. Also (in a sense) you can compute the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wavefunction in Multiverse, which in turn defines a probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distribution. What you can't compute (or so it seems to me) is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;outcome of a projection (1st postulate of consciousness). It is this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;projection that introduces randomness, or indeterminism into the 1st
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person view of the world.
</em><br />
<br />This is another point where we disagree. And the disagreement is 
<br />
deep (but that is what makes our conversation genuine, isn'it?).
<br />
I say that the disagreement is deep because it is independant of
<br />
comp: it bears even on Everett's MWI.
<br />
In fact it seems to me that with your notion of &quot;projection&quot; you
<br />
are introducing a sort of collapse in comp!
<br />
But it is really computationnalism (in a weak sense) which has
<br />
helped Everett to prove QM does not need any collapses.
<br />
In comp, it is the same. The indeterminism is the consequence of
<br />
the way machines describe the statistics of their self-localisations
<br />
and other self-measures after the natural self-multiplication
<br />
and self-delocalisation forced by the UD.
<br />
If I duplicate you, nobody, including GOD or any quasi omniscient
<br />
being can predict what you will *feel* (1-person concept) precisely.
<br />
Like Everett, comp can predict that you will not feel the split.
