Further improvememts.
<br />
<br /><br />Proposal:
<br />
<br />The concepts of &quot;Nothing&quot; and &quot;Everything&quot; [1def]  are not antagonistic, 
<br />
but are actually synergistic and bootstrap &quot;existence&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br />Justification:
<br />
<br />AXIOMS:
<br />
<br />Referring first to [1def] through [6def]:
<br />
<br />1) A void consisting of the absence of factuals herein called the &quot;Nothing&quot; 
<br />
exists.
<br />
<br />2) A collection of all complete sets of counterfactuals herein called the 
<br />
&quot;Everything&quot; exists.
<br />
<br />3) There are no other existences at or above the level of the Everything 
<br />
and the Nothing.
<br />
<br /><br />PROPOSITIONS:
<br />
<br />Proposition 1: The Everything and the Nothing are counterfactuals.
<br />
<br />Proof: The Everything is a parsing since it is a collection of a particular 
<br />
kind of factual.  The Nothing is a parsing since it excludes all factuals 
<br />
from itself.  These two parsings effect each other to some degree.  The 
<br />
existence of the Everything would tend to put a factual in the void and 
<br />
thereby suppress the concept of the Nothing and the existence of the 
<br />
Nothing would tend to suppress the necessity for the Everything - no 
<br />
factuals equals no parsing potential.  Thus Proposition 1 is true by [3def] 
<br />
and [4def] and Axioms 1 &amp; 2.
<br />
<br />In addition to the suppression, The Everything and the Nothing also enhance 
<br />
each other to some degree as follows.
<br />
<br />Proposition 2: The Everything contains the Nothing.
<br />
<br />Proof: True by Proposition 1 and Axioms 1,  2, &amp; 3.   Axiom 3 makes the 
<br />
Everything/Nothing pair a complete set of counterfactuals.
<br />
<br />Proposition 3: The Everything contains itself:
<br />
<br />Proof: True by Proposition 1 and Axioms 2 and 3.
<br />
<br />Proposition 4: The Everything is infinitely nested with itself and the Nothing.
<br />
<br />Proof: True by Propositions 2 and 3.
<br />
<br />Interpretation: The Everything and the Nothing form a synergistic pair - 
<br />
their simultaneous existence is &quot;easier&quot; than either existence by 
<br />
itself.  Even more focused is to view the synergism as being the 
<br />
&quot;existence&quot; and Axioms 1, 2, and 3 continuously bootstrap each other to 
<br />
sustain it.
<br />
<br />The Everything/Nothing nesting is not considered as having dimensionality 
<br />
or of being in or on a dimension, but rather as an infinite entanglement of 
<br />
potential.
<br />
<br />Proposition 5: The nesting has a dynamic.
<br />
<br />Proof: A fixed parsing between the Nothing and the Everything would 
<br />
constitute the presence of an uneffected factual within the Everything 
<br />
contradicting Axiom 2.
<br />
<br />Possible interpretation:
<br />
<br />Proposition 5 can be realized if the Nothing/Everything parsing &quot;surface&quot; 
<br />
is composed of a dynamic mix of the &quot;surfaces&quot; of the counterfactuals 
<br />
constituting the Everything.  The counterfactuals on this &quot;surface&quot; are - 
<br />
while so situated - slightly less effected than when they are remote from 
<br />
this &quot;surface&quot;.   It is the patterns formed by the shifting mix of 
<br />
&quot;surface&quot; counterfactuals that are interpreted as universes.
<br />
<br />To support this interpretation the following axioms are incorporated into 
<br />
the model.
<br />
<br />Axiom 4: The members of a complete set of counterfactuals maintain the 
<br />
complete &quot;effectiveness&quot; only when uninterruptedly intertwined as in a 
<br />
foamy fractal .
<br />
<br />Axiom 5: Universes sustain themselves by finding a succeeding pattern on 
<br />
the Everything/Nothing &quot;surface&quot; that is consistent with their individual 
<br />
rules of state succession as their current pattern vanishes with the dynamic.
<br />
<br />Proposition 6: The dynamic of Proposition 5 is random.
<br />
<br />Proof: Same form of proof as for Proposition 5 but substituting &quot;A fixed 
<br />
evolution of the parsing between the Nothing and the Everything would....&quot;.
<br />
<br />Proposition 7: There is no restriction on the structure of the various 
<br />
individual universe state succession rules.
<br />
<br />Proof: Same form of proof as for Proposition 5 but substituting &quot;Any such 
<br />
restriction would....&quot;.
<br />
<br />Interpretative consequent: Some of the rules would have a &quot;Do not care&quot; 
<br />
component in terms of the selection of a succeeding pattern.  This is the 
<br />
same as the rules of these universes allowing an external random oracle 
<br />
input or true noise [7def] into the state succession process for such 
<br />
universes.
<br />
<br />Proposition 8: All universes are subject to true noise.
<br />
<br />Proof: Same form of proof as for Proposition 5 but substituting &quot;By 
<br />
Proposition 7 at least some universes are subject to true noise by their 
<br />
own internal rules.  If true noise susceptibility of universes is indeed 
<br />
restricted to &quot;some&quot; it would .....&quot;.
<br />
<br />Interpretation:  Even if their rules have no &quot;Do not care&quot; component such 
<br />
universes must nevertheless be subject to an external random oracle.
<br />
<br />There would be two general types of universes.  Type #1 have internal rules 
<br />
that do not allow true noise as they evolve and type #2 have rules that 
<br />
do.  Both are actually subject to true noise since the dynamic of the 
<br />
Everything/Nothing synergism is the apex of the overall system's 
<br />
hierarchical dynamic and dominates the internal dynamic rules of all 
<br />
interpretations within the synergism.   There is also a bidirectional flow 
<br />
between type #1 and type #2 since the right dose of true noise will switch 
<br />
the type of any universe.
<br />
<br />NOTES
<br />
<br />[1def] Everything: Intended as a maximum expression of &quot;something&quot; - see 
<br />
Axiom 2.
<br />
<br />[2def] Information: The potential to parse [herein &quot;parse&quot; is used to mean 
<br />
to divide as with a boundary].
<br />
<br />[3def] Factual: A particular parsing. [like: {red, green, blue}]
<br />
<br />[4def] Counterfactual: A factual [factual B] that to some degree effects 
<br />
the parsing of another factual [factual A] {like the red, green, blue 
<br />
combination resulting in brown}.  Note that a factual that has a 
<br />
counterfactual is itself a counterfactual.
<br />
<br />[5def] Complete set of counterfactuals: A set of counterfactuals that 
<br />
leaves no member factual uneffected in any of its aspects. {like: gray}
<br />
<br />[6def] &quot;Effect&quot;: An all inclusive range of influences between 
<br />
counterfactuals.  [One type of influence between counterfactuals would be 
<br />
where &quot;existence&quot; encompasses two logic systems such that in one the 
<br />
statement &quot;A&quot; is true and in the other the statement &quot;Not A&quot; is true.  This 
<br />
may be far narrower than the range of influences that may be necessarily 
<br />
encompassed in &quot;effect&quot; as used herein.]
<br />
<br />[7def] True Noise:  In the model, current states of universes are 
<br />
interpretations of the patterns of the counterfactuals that happen to be 
<br />
currently on the Everything/Nothing surface.  The patterns shift randomly 
<br />
and a universe has to find a new compatible pattern to survive.  A universe 
<br />
that has rules of state succession that allows for portions of the new 
<br />
pattern to be determined solely by the shifting dynamic - a &quot;Do not care&quot; 
<br />
content to the rules - rather than by the rules acting on the data of the 
<br />
current state is a universe whose succession of states is subject to the 
<br />
external random dynamic [external random oracle] to some degree.  This is 
<br />
true noise injection into that universe via its own internal rules.
