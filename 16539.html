I would like to go along with Maudlin's point emphasized in Bruno's text
<br />
below, adding that &quot;causal&quot; structure is restricted to the limited model of
<br />
which we *CAN *choose likely 'causes' within our perceived reality, while
<br />
the unlimited possibilities include wider 'intrusions' of domains 'beyond
<br />
our present epistemic cognitive inventory'. So the &quot;most likely&quot; *cause *-
<br />
although applicable to a 'physical role' (which as well is figmentous) - is
<br />
limited. In congruence - I think - with Bruno's words below.
<br />
Bruno's: &quot;...the description, although containing the genuine information is
<br />
just not a computation at all...&quot; (AMEN!)
<br />
continued, however by: &quot;...It miss the logical relation between the steps,
<br />
made possible by the universal machine...&quot;  still does not  *- DO - *
<br />
those 'steps' neither *OPERATE* the machine.
<br />
Looks like we want to 'assume' that if there is a possibility, it is also
<br />
done.
<br />
I am looking at the &quot;physical creator&quot; (haha) keeping the contraption moving
<br />
and us in it. Not to speak about 'making it'. (Deus ex machina?)
<br />
Once all is there and moving, everything is fine.
<br />
I salute the &quot;...infinitely many such relations, ...&quot; that gives me the idea
<br />
of a 'physical' supervenience in terms of a restrictive Occam, cutting off
<br />
everything that dos not fit into our goals.
<br />
<br />*&quot;States&quot;* seem to be identified by our limited views. I feel that both the
<br />
referred Maudlin-text and Jesse's comment are on the static side, as
<br />
'descriptive', while I can presume into Bruno's &quot;relations&quot; some sort of a
<br />
functional (operative) relation that would lend some dynamism (action?) into
<br />
the descriptional stagnancy. I still did not detect:  *HOW?*

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Maudlin's point is that the causal structure has no physical role, so if

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation. but the description, although containing the genuine

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on with mechanism only by associating consciousness with the logical,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immaterial, relation between the states. from inside they are infinitely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many such relations, and this means the physical has to supervene on the sum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of those relations &quot;as seen from inside&quot;. By Church thesis and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-reference logic, they have a non trivial, redundant, structure.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; located a pdf copy in a post from this list at

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  ...now that I read it I see the argument is distinct from Chalmers' &quot;Does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a Rock Implement Every Finite-State Automaton&quot;, although they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thematically similar in that they both deal with difficulties in defining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what it means for a given physical system to &quot;implement&quot; a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation. Chalmers' idea was that the idea of a rock implementing every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible computer program could be avoided if we defined an &quot;implementation&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in terms of counterfactuals, but Maudlin argues that this contradicts the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;supervenience thesis&quot; which says that &quot;the presence or absence of inert,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causally isolated objects cannot effect the presence or absence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal states associated with a system&quot;, since two systems may have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different counterfactual structures merely by virtue of an inert subsystem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in one which *would have* become active if the initial state of the system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had been slightly different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that there might be ways of defining &quot;causal structure&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which don't depend on counterfactuals, though. One idea I had is that for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any system which changes state in a lawlike way over time, all facts about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events in the system's history can be represented as a collection of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions, and then causal structure might be understood in terms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical relations between propositions, given knowledge of the laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; governing the system. As an example, if the system was a cellular automaton,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one might have a collection of propositions like &quot;cell 156 is colored black
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at time-step 36&quot;, and if you know the rules for how the cells are updated on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each time-step, then knowing some subsets of propositions would allow you to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deduce others (for example, if you have a set of propositions that tell you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the states of all the cells surrounding cell 71 at time-step 106, in most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cellular automata that would allow you to figure out the state of cell 71 at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the subsequent time-step 107). If the laws of physics in our universe are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deterministic than you should in principle be able to represent all facts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the state of the universe at all times as a giant (probably infinite)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of propositions as well, and given knowledge of the laws, knowing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain subsets of these propositions would allow you to deduce others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Causal structure&quot; could then be defined in terms of what logical relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hold between the propositions, given knowledge of the laws governing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system. Perhaps in one system you might find a set of four propositions A,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B, C, D such that if you know the system's laws, you can see that A&amp;B imply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; C, and D implies A, but no other proposition or group of propositions in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this set of four are sufficient to deduce any of the others in this set.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then in another system you might find a set of four propositions X, Y, Z and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; W such that W&amp;Z imply Y, and X implies W, but those are the only deductions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can make from within this set. In this case you can say these two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different sets of four propositions represent instantiations of the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causal structure, since if you map W to A, Z to B, Y to C, and D to X then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can see an isomorphism in the logical relations. That's obviously a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple causal structure involving only 04 events, but one might define much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more complex causal structures and then check if there was any subset of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events in a system's history that matched that structure. And the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions could be restricted to ones concerning events that actually did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occur in the system's history, with no counterfactual propositions about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what would have happened if the system's initial state had been different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thinking in this way, it's not obvious that Maudlin is right when he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumes that the original &quot;Olympia&quot; defined on p. 418-419 of the paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot be implementing a unique computation that gives rise to complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious experiences. It's true that the armature itself is not responding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in any way to the states of successive troughs it passes over, but there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an aspect of the setup that might give the system a nontrivial causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure, namely the fact that certain troughs may be connected to other by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pipes to other troughs in the sequence, so that as the armature empties or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fills one it is also emptying or filling the one it's connected to (this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; done to emulate the idea of a Turing machine's read/write head returning to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same memory address multiple times, even though Olympia's armature just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; steadily progresses down the line of troughs in sequence--troughs connected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by pipes are supposed to represent a single memory address). If we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; represented the Olympia system as a set of propositions about the state of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each trough and the position of the armature at each time-step, then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact that the armature's interaction with one trough changes the state of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another trough the armature won't visit until a later step may be enough to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give different programs markedly different causal structures, in spite of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact that the armature itself is just dumbly moving from one trough to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the next.
