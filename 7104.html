<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;torture-free minute would have 10^100 times greater absolute measure. If

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;there's 10^100 times more water in the tanks corresponding to OMs during

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;that minute, where does all this water go after the tank corresponding to

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the last OM in this minute, and where is it flowing in from to the tank 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;corresponding to the first OM in this minute?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As I understood your model, the tanks have constant volume over time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(because net inflow matches net outflow), but you never said they all had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the same volume. If they did, every OM would have the same absolute 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure, so why bother with the idea of absolute measure at all?
</em><br />
<br />No, I don't think they don't all have to have the same volume, but I thought 
<br />
you were assuming that the ASSA would force us to conclude there's a 10^100 
<br />
greater chance of finding ourselves as an OM during this minute, an idea 
<br />
that would only be true if the OMs during that minute *did* have the same 
<br />
absolute probability/water volume as OMs at other times. It's true that it's 
<br />
possible to make this example work in terms of the water model if you have 
<br />
each tank during that minute contain only 1/10^100 the amount of water 
<br />
that's in tanks before that minute, but in that case your absolute 
<br />
probability of experiencing an OM in that minute is no higher than at any 
<br />
other time. So if my interpretation of your argument is right, I think 
<br />
you're arguing against a strawman version of the ASSA here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It appears that we both believe that any individual's consciousness will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continue indefinitely, or, as you say in a later post in the current 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thread, &quot;death only exists from a third person perspective&quot;. However, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't really understand the mechanism whereby you believe this will happen. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps you could tell me where we differ:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My understanding of observer moments is that, unlike the water molecules in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your tanks, they are *always* created and destroyed. The observer's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience of continuity of consciousness over time results from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stringing together of OM's which are related in the following way: at a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;particular OM in an observer's stream of consciousness, the &quot;next moment&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or successor OM, can be any OM which identifies itself with that observer, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shares the observer's memories up to that point, and fits in as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continuation of the previous OM's thoughts. (These criteria are necessarily 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;somewhat loose, accounting for situations such as waking up with retrograde 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;amnesia after a head injury.)
</em><br />
<br />If you want to have an objective notion of continuity of consciousness and 
<br />
conditional probabilities, then it can't just be a matter of us subjectively 
<br />
evaluating how much one observer-moment's memories seem to match the 
<br />
experiences and memories of an earlier one. Instead, you'd need some sort of 
<br />
theory of consciousness to give you a well-defined, objective procedure for 
<br />
deciding this--this is what I've been calling the &quot;similarity function&quot;. If 
<br />
we assume such a thing exists, there are two ways we could think of the 
<br />
&quot;water molecules&quot;. One is to say they represent &quot;observers&quot; who persist 
<br />
indefinitely, while &quot;observer-moments&quot; just represent what these observers 
<br />
*experience* at any given moment, not what they are. These observers would 
<br />
have no qualities of their own beyond what they are experiencing at a given 
<br />
moment, a bit like the &quot;pure witnessing consciousness&quot; thought to be our 
<br />
true self in certain eastern philosophies. If this seems too close to the 
<br />
dualistic idea of a &quot;soul&quot;, another option is just to say the water 
<br />
molecules represent a convenient way to think about conditional and absolute 
<br />
probabilities in frequentist terms, since it's generally more intuitive to 
<br />
think about any kind of probability in a frequentist way (rather than, say, 
<br />
a Bayesian way or a decision-theory way). So in this case the water 
<br />
molecules would just be a sort of intuition-pump, they wouldn't have any 
<br />
deeper significance.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Death (from the first person perspective) can be defined as occuring when 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there is no successor OM, anywhere or ever. As long as there remains even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one successor OM, be it in another Galaxy, a parallel universe, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whatever, the stream of consciousness will continue indefinitely. In the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multiverse (or larger mathematical structure containing the multiverse), 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there will always be a successor OM; hence, the quantum immortality idea.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You may agree with at least some of the above, but it looks like you may 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have a problem with my 10^100 copies, which I propose are created, live for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a minute, then are destroyed. Didn't I just say death can't happen from a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first person perspective? Going by the definition of death above, if the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;copies are to really die, there would have to be no successor OM anywhere 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or ever (which in this case means the self contained model universe of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thought experiment). But clearly, there *is* a successor OM. As the end of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the minute approaches, the copies know that the torture is going to start 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;again. The fact that there is a mismatch between the number of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instantiations during the minute and after (10^100 -&gt; 10) doesn't make any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difference. This is what the purpose of the thought experiment was: to show 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the absolute measure, which is proportional to the number of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instantiations of a given OM, cannot make any first person difference.
</em><br />
<br />But again, if you assume the particular constraint on the *relationship* 
<br />
between absolute and conditional measure I suggested--the &quot;water inflow 
<br />
equals water outflow&quot; condition--then it doesn't seem possible for the 
<br />
combined absolute measure of all OMs during that minute (the total amount of 
<br />
water in all the tanks corresponding to OMs in that minute) to be larger 
<br />
than the combined absolute measure of all OMs during the minute before or 
<br />
after.
<br />
<br />Also, let me suggest another way absolute measure makes a difference from a 
<br />
first-person perspective. Even if I take QTI for granted, I still can have 
<br />
questions about what my most likely future experiences are going to be, 
<br />
since I don't know exactly how the conditional probability function works. 
<br />
In particular, I don't know if in the distant future I will still remember 
<br />
most of the details of my current life and everything beyond, so that I will 
<br />
consciously perceive myself to be 10 million years old at some point, or if 
<br />
I will experience a sort of &quot;immortality with amnesia&quot; where I will 
<br />
repeatedly perceive myself as being fairly young (I described some ways this 
<br />
could work in the last paragraph of my post at 
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m6813.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m6813.html</a> ). But now if I use the 
<br />
ASSA, assuming that my current observer-moment is randomly sampled from the 
<br />
set of all observer-moments, weighted by their absolute probability, then 
<br />
observing that my age is only 28, I should consider &quot;immortality with 
<br />
amnesia&quot; much more likely, because if it wasn't the vast majority of the 
<br />
&quot;water&quot; would be found in observer-moments which perceive themselves to be 
<br />
Very Old (say, over 1 million years old). Note that this conclusion only 
<br />
works if you assume the amount of water in each tank stays constant--if the 
<br />
amount of water in different tanks could change as some sort of cosmic time 
<br />
parameter moved forward, then it might be that young OMs would be favored by 
<br />
the ASSA at earlier values of the cosmic time parameter, while old OMs would 
<br />
be favored by the ASSA at later values of the cosmic time parameter, so I 
<br />
could no longer use the fact that I find myself to be only a few decades old 
<br />
to conclude that the conditional probabilities are unlikely to allow me to 
<br />
continually experience OMs that perceive themselves as being older and 
<br />
older.
