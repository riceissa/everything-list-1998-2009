<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I am very willing (maybe too much, that's part of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;problem) to accept a &quot;Platonic existence&quot; for *the* integers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I am far from sure however that this does not involve a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;significant amount of faith.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed. It needs an infinite act of faith. But I have no problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; with that ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Unfortunately, it seems that some people do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems, but it isn't. Well, actually I have known *one* mathematician,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (a russian logician) who indeed makes a serious try to develop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some mathematics without that infinite act of faith (I don't recall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its name for the moment). Such attempt are known as &quot;ultrafinitism&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course a lot of people (especially during the week-end) *pretend*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not doing that infinite act of faith, but do it all the time implicitly.
</em><br />
<br />This is not what I meant. I did not refer to people not willing
<br />
to accept that natural numbers exist at all but to people not
<br />
wlling to accept that natural numbers exist *by themselves*.
<br />
Rather, they want to see them either as only a production of
<br />
human (or human-like) people or only a production of a God.
<br />
And I said &quot;unfortunately&quot; because some not only do not want to
<br />
see natural numbers as existing by themselves but they do not
<br />
want the idea to be simply presented as logically possible and
<br />
even see/designate evil in people working at popularizing it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You know an ultrafinitist cannot assert that he is an &quot;ultrafinitist&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without going beyong ultrafinitism. So perhaps only animals do not do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that infinite act of faith, but IMO, most mammals does it in a sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; passive and implicit way. If you pretend to understand a statement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                  N   =    {1, 2, 3 ...},  or  N =  {l, ll, lll, llll,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lllll, llllll, lllllll, ...},
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then you do it. Words like &quot;never&quot;, &quot;always&quot;, &quot;more&quot;, &quot;until&quot;, &quot;while&quot;, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have intuitive meaning relying on it. I have worked  with highly mentally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disabled people, and only with a few of them I have concluded that there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was perhaps some evidence in their *non grasping* of the &quot;simple&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; potential infinite. All finitist and all intuitionnist accept it. Second order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic and any piece of mathematics rely on it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some people would like to doubt it but I think they confuse Arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Realism with some substancialist view of number which of course I reject.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I reject substancialism even in physics, actually I showed it logically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incompatible with the comp hyp).
</em><br />
<br />I would not say &quot;infinite act of faith&quot; but rather &quot;act of faith
<br />
in infinity&quot;. I don't know the work of the mathematician you think
<br />
of neither of any other such kind of work but I flatly consider
<br />
that we only manipulate infinity formally within obviously finite
<br />
formalisms. I am not sure that it is necessary that any infinite
<br />
exists (let's say by itself in some platonic sense) for that
<br />
everything that we are talking abour within this kind of finite
<br />
formalism makes sense (and exists in some platonic sense).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fearing the death in the long run (as opposed of fearing some near catastroph)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also rely on that faith in the infinite, at least implicitly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some people believe that human are religious because they fear death, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is the reverse which seems to me much more plausible: it is because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are religious (i.e. we believe in some infinite) that we are fearing death.
</em><br />
<br />I do not share all of Dawkins' views (especially from the social
<br />
point of view) but I have a Dawkins' view of religion. I would
<br />
say that human are religious simply because this induces among
<br />
themselves a behavior that increases their fitness (at the level
<br />
of communities). The corresponding set of memes interact in various
<br />
ways with other aspects like fear of death in complex networks
<br />
from which it might be vain to try to isolate simple one-way causal
<br />
relations.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I am not sure how much I share that faith. As I mentionned,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I am willing to but since I could not find some ground to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;support that willingness, I might be a bit agnostic too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No problem. The point is that it is a nice and deep hypothesis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which makes comp fun and extremely powerful. It is definitely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; among my working hypotheses.
</em><br />
<br />I think I can consider both this one and some alternatives
<br />
(not simulatneously, of course). However I do not find the
<br />
alternatives very fecund currently (and I am even more
<br />
agnostic about them).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Why there is no FAQ? Because we are still discussing the meaning of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; a lot of terms ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I saw some posts on tentative glossaries of acronyms. Maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;before complex terms, we should focus on &quot;basic&quot; ones like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;universe&quot;. I would not be upset to encounter definitions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;for several possible senses of that word.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think the word &quot;universe&quot; is a basic term. It is a sort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of deity for atheist.
</em><br />
<br />I guess this would be called &quot;pantheism&quot; (the difference might
<br />
lie in the level of worship involved rather than in the level
<br />
of faith).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; All my work can be seen as an attempt to mak
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it more palatable in the comp frame.
</em><br />
<br />I think we can only produce tautologies, were they formulated
<br />
in a mathematical way or not. This certainly does not mean that
<br />
these tautologies are vain or meaningless. Rather, their interest
<br />
might come from the &quot;level of resonance&quot; they induce within the
<br />
various people who devise or consider them. This might even be
<br />
the case for any concept and we might actually have no other
<br />
way to communicate anything. The global level of resonance of
<br />
&quot;the universe&quot; here appears quite low...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tegmark, imo, goes in the right direction, but seems unaware
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the difficulties mathematicians discovered when just trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; define the or even a &quot;mathematical universe&quot;.  Of course tremendous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; progress has been made (in set theory, in category theory) giving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tools to provide some *approximation*, but the big mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole seems really inaccessible. With comp it can be shown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (first person) inaccessible, even unnameable ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bon week-end,
</em><br />
<br />A toi aussi.
<br />
<br />Georges.
