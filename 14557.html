Youness,
<br />
<br />hmmm.... I am not sure .... Perhaps a duality, or a Galois connection 
<br />
of some sort. I'm afraid that an *equivalence* would show up only in 
<br />
the case where &quot;I&quot; am the &quot;world&quot; or comp is false or in the case where 
<br />
the comp level of substitution is infinitely low, roughly speaking.
<br />
In that case ASSA and RSSA are plausibly equivalent, and the indexical 
<br />
comp (what I am used to call comp and which asserts that &quot;I&quot; am a 
<br />
machine) is then plausibly equivalent with Schmiduhuberian form of comp 
<br />
(the universe is a machine).
<br />
<br />About Bostrom's unification/duplication, I think that from the first 
<br />
person point of view we can have unification when the two identical 
<br />
brains are running identically during a period of time dT, although 
<br />
duplication---during that very period of time dT--- has still to be 
<br />
considered when some histories, going through the identical states 
<br />
during dT,  differentiate later. This is what I like to sum up by
<br />
<br />Y = II,
<br />
<br />which means that a differentation/bifurcation change the measure on 
<br />
states in the &quot;logical past&quot;, a little like if the &quot;first amoeba&quot; did 
<br />
get a high measure in the past thanks to her many descendants today. 
<br />
This entails a form of anthropic teleology about which I lack the tools 
<br />
for making things more precise.
<br />
<br />I think you could make your point clearer by trying to be more precise 
<br />
on what you consider to be a world and a (first person) observer moment 
<br />
perhaps. Modal logic could help you here I guess.

<br />
<br />By this contribution to the Everything list I want to argue that there
<br />
is a fundamental equivalence between the first person and the third
<br />
person viewpoint: Under few assumptions I show that it doesn't matter
<br />
for our reasoning whether we understand the Everything ensemble as the
<br />
ensemble of all worlds (a third person viewpoint) or as the ensemble
<br />
of all observer moments (a first person viewpoint). I think that this
<br />
result is even more substantial than the assumptions from which it can
<br />
be deduced. Thus, I further suggest to reverse my argument considering
<br />
the last statement as a principle, the equivalence principle.
<br />
<br />Let me first present and explain the two viewpoints:
<br />
<br />1. The ensemble of worlds
<br />
<br />This approach starts from the ontological basis of all worlds (or
<br />
descriptions thereof). I am not precise to what exactly I refer by
<br />
saying &quot;worlds&quot; and &quot;descriptions&quot; for I don't want to lose wider
<br />
applicability of my arguments by restricting myself to specific
<br />
theories of the Everything ensemble. But admittedly, I mainly think of
<br />
theories similar to Russell's ideas. However, the crucial property of
<br />
theories starting from the ensemble of worlds consists in their third
<br />
person viewpoint. The ontological basis does not explicitly refer to
<br />
observers nor to observer moments. Observers are regarded as being
<br />
self-aware substructures of the worlds they inhabit.
<br />
<br />Coming from the sciences, this approach is very natural. In the
<br />
sciences, we are used to the idea of a physical reality independent of
<br />
us humans. We are studying phenomena happening in our universe. Thus,
<br />
when we invent a theory of the Everything ensemble, we are naturally
<br />
driven to the idea that not only our universe, but a multiverse
<br />
consisting of all possible worlds exists. We already know how
<br />
observers come into the scene: As an emergent property, a huge number
<br />
of the fundamental building blocks can constitute an observer. In
<br />
order to understand this, one has to introduce a semantic language
<br />
which describes the emergent phenomenon. The description of the world
<br />
itself is expressed in the syntactic language (I adopt Russell's
<br />
nomenclature). The link between between these two languages is some
<br />
kind of neurological theory explaining how the states of the
<br />
fundamental building blocks (more precise: the description of the
<br />
world) lead to mental states (or the emergence of an observer).
<br />
Though, finding such a neurological theory is a very difficult task.
<br />
In this world, we are facing the so-called hard problem of
<br />
consciousness. And even if neurologists, psychologists and
<br />
philosophers will finally succeed to find an adequate theory in this
<br />
world, it is not clear whether we can apply the theory to other
<br />
worlds.
<br />
<br />So, to conclude, this approach has the great advantage of being very
<br />
close to the structure of the physical worlds. The explanation of
<br />
observers and observer moments seems to be possible, but surely is
<br />
very complicated and difficult.
<br />
<br />2. The ensemble of observer moments
<br />
<br />When I first thought of the Everything ensemble, I did not come from
<br />
the sciences, but from philosophy. I judged that the concept of
<br />
absolute &quot;existence&quot; was a dubious extension of the concepts of
<br />
subjective accessibility and perceptibility. So, it was natural for me
<br />
to start from the ensemble of observer moments, a first person
<br />
viewpoint. The class of all observer moments constitutes the
<br />
ontological basis of this second approach. Later, I realized that the
<br />
theory of the Everything ensemble could be used to draw conclusions
<br />
about the physical world. But this seemed to be unfeasible starting
<br />
from observer moments: the relatively simple laws of nature that we
<br />
find in our universe are obscured by the complex properties of our
<br />
senses. Starting from observer moments seemed to be a complication.
<br />
Consequently, I switched viewpoints and studied the ensemble of
<br />
worlds. I always hoped that both approaches would finally turn out to
<br />
be equivalent.
<br />
<br />Even in principle, it is very difficult to think of &quot;worlds&quot; when
<br />
starting from observer moments only. This task is similar to
<br />
understanding observer moments when starting from the descriptions of
<br />
worlds. Starting from worlds, we must identify the observer moments as
<br />
substructres. Starting from observer moments, we must somehow extract
<br />
information that allows us to meaningfully talk about a world. From
<br />
the sciences, we know how difficult this is because there we try to
<br />
find a description of our world given our observer moments. We see how
<br />
complementary the two approaches are: The first approach needed some
<br />
kind of neurological theory to explain the appearance of observer
<br />
moments within a world, the second approach needs some kind of
<br />
physical theory to explain the appearance of a world when first
<br />
studying observer moments. The two approaches are another
<br />
manifestation of the deep connection between laws of physics and
<br />
properties of an observer.
<br />
<br />The assumptions
<br />
<br />My first assumption is related to our reasoning. The equivalence of
<br />
the two approaches does not mean that they are identical. I will say
<br />
that they have identical implications for our reasoning. To clarify
<br />
this, I must first explain how we shall reason. Here, I take the ASSA
<br />
(maybe we can check during the discussion whether or not my argument
<br />
generalizes to other versions of the self-sampling assumption):
<br />
<br />'Each observer moment should reason as if it were randomly selected
<br />
from the class of all observer moments.'
<br />
<br />The second assumption is more subtle. Suppose we take the first
<br />
approach, with all worlds as ontological basis. We explain observer
<br />
moments with the help of some neurological theories. At first, it is
<br />
not clear whether we can find every possible observer moment under
<br />
these emergent observer moments. The assumption is that we can. Every
<br />
possible observer moment is realized in at least one world.
<br />
<br />Perhaps, some of you remember that I wrote about this topic September
<br />
last year. At that time, I came to the conclusions that the
<br />
equivalence did not exist. But yesterday, I read Bostrom's paper that
<br />
is currently analyzed on this list (&quot;Quantity of experience: brain-
<br />
duplication and degrees of consciousness&quot;) and I understood that
<br />
September last year I took for granted what Bostrom calls
<br />
&quot;Duplication&quot;. His arguments in favor of Duplication didn't convince
<br />
me, quite the opposite happened: I have adopted the other position,
<br />
&quot;Unification&quot;.
<br />
<br />The question Bostrom raises is the following: &quot;Suppose two brains are
<br />
in the same conscious state. Are there two minds [Duplication], two
<br />
streams of conscious experience? Or only one [Unification]?&quot;
<br />
<br />This may seem to be a matter of definition. But let us return to the
<br />
ASSA: Which measure should be assigned to each observer moment? Given
<br />
Unification it is natural to assign a uniform measure: no observer
<br />
moment is more likely to be selected than any other. Given Duplication
<br />
it is natural to assign a measure to each observer moment proportional
<br />
to the number of its occurences in the Everything ensemble.
<br />
<br />I assume a uniform measure. Surely, we can soften this assumption.
<br />
Nonetheless, it is decisive that the measure does not fundamentally
<br />
depend on the worlds but can also be deduced when taking the class of
<br />
observer moments as ontological basis. This is why I think that the
<br />
RSSA does not do any worse than the ASSA.
<br />
<br />The equivalence principle
<br />
<br />'Our reasoning does not depend on whether the ensemble of worlds or
<br />
the ensemble of observer moments is considered fundamental.'
<br />
<br />I assumed that our reasoning should follow from the ASSA (or any other
<br />
version of the SSA compatible with my argument). Due to Unification,
<br />
we cannot detect any difference between the two different approaches:
<br />
The measure for each observer moment is the same.
<br />
<br />The equivalence principle is a fundamental expression of what Russell
<br />
so eloquently explained in his book: &quot;Not only is our psyche emergent
<br />
from the eletrical and chemical goings on in our brain, but the laws
<br />
governing that chemico-electrical behaviour in turn depend on our
<br />
psyche.&quot;
<br />
<br />I speculate that both approaches to the Everything ensemble, the
<br />
ensemble of worlds and the ensemble of observer moments, are two
<br />
different windows to the same theory.
