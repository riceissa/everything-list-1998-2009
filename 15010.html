<br />
Admittedly a bit off-topic but hey - there are some great minds on  
<br />
this list and it could give birth to something relevant. There! ;-D
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Why do we have emotions? Aren't simple, value-conferring feelings good  
<br />
enough or something? Emotions cause a host of extraordinary, beautiful  
<br />
and wondrous things to happen in life as well as all sorts of  
<br />
nonsensical and disastrous issues in the world.
<br />
<br />We should definitely study this a bit more carefully n'est-ce pas?
<br />
<br />A worm probably doesn't have emotions but we might just allow that it  
<br />
has feelings. There is much evidence to support this, apparently.
<br />
<br />Do we have emotions because we are noble, sensitive, artistic,  
<br />
expressive, complex, huge-brained, warm-blooded etc. highly-evolved  
<br />
creatures (intrinsic feature)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />or
<br />
<br /><br />because having emotions has Darwinian survival value? (extrinsic  
<br />
feature)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />I favour the second view (whilst acknowledging that the first has many  
<br />
elements of truth to it as well)
<br />
<br /><br />THE EVIDENCE
<br />
<br /><br />Emotions change the appearance of an organism in the sight of another  
<br />
organism and are therefore slightly unusual to witness
<br />
<br />Do I need to illustrate that? No, great- so we'll skip to the next  
<br />
part then.
<br />
<br />No - just one clean one:
<br />
<br />Maybe think of the way you or I may view the face of Sarah Palin with  
<br />
mild feelings of amusement at her stereotypical look. Now imagine the  
<br />
violently emotional, brain-boiling, artery-bursting hatred and rage  
<br />
she inspires in most feminists
<br />
<br /><br /><br />THE CON
<br />
<br /><br />A person having an emotion even at the periphery of your field of view  
<br />
is virtually impossible not to look at directly if only for an instant  
<br />
to verify
<br />
<br />This can can be exploited to advantage
<br />
<br />As Edward de Bono points out near the start of his recent book &quot;Six  
<br />
Information Frames&quot;, the mind is instantly drawn to the unusual
<br />
<br />This is not a strength of the mind but a weakness of the mind. This is  
<br />
because the person having the emotion could quite easily be faking it  
<br />
to manipulate us
<br />
<br />&quot;You were really moaning away there darling, I'm glad I excite you. Do  
<br />
any of the others?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No. Only you do that to me, honey. See you this time next week?&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />sort of thing
<br />
<br /><br />So here is the Darwinian survival value part...the human mind -  
<br />
knowing intuitively it's own Achilles Heel - has conspired to  
<br />
manipulate itself to it's own mutual advantage
<br />
<br />As a schizophrenic might say &quot;I'm never lonely. I've always got each  
<br />
other&quot;
<br />
<br />This is kind of how everybody - as Woody Allen puts it - &quot;sells  
<br />
everyone to everyone else.&quot;
<br />
<br />Emotions are therefore a signalling device to a 3rd party - we say we  
<br />
'have' emotions; in fact we 'give' emotions
<br />
<br />If we forget for a moment the wonderful and vast internal experience  
<br />
of emotions, that vast symphonic chorus of chemicals zapping about in  
<br />
our brains when we are well above the baseline mood-wise and for  
<br />
whatever reason - could even be drugs...
<br />
<br /><br /><br />like
<br />
<br /><br />Tchaikowsky's 6th Symphony 1st movement where he claimed to want the  
<br />
audience to feel graphically through his music, the sheer unutterable  
<br />
anxiety and guilt and shame and despair and agony of his existence  
<br />
(trying to be vaguely gay as a public figure in Tsarist Russia....Oh  
<br />
boy I can hear that music right now in my head - it's like a freakin  
<br />
drug. If you want to experience true black dog depression for a good  
<br />
twenty minutes or so, have a listen. It's a virtual reality experience  
<br />
of what it is like to have bipolar disorder.)
<br />
<br /><br />So
<br />
<br /><br />Let's forget momentarily that so well-known aspect of emotions (Aspect  
<br />
One)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Let's hold in our minds the notion that emotions did not arise in this  
<br />
way. The Pleasure and Pain qualia are merely a bonus. Simple feelings  
<br />
are good enough to supply the mind with the information it needs to  
<br />
sort out values and predict futures and survive its collision with  
<br />
reality
<br />
<br />We only ever needed emotions in the past to avoid being eaten by a  
<br />
Sabre-toothed cat like in some freakin silly Roland Emmerich movie
<br />
<br />This is Aspect Two of emotions
<br />
<br />Emotions are there to cause ACTION at critical moments. All the right  
<br />
chemicals start whizzing about in microseconds and we survive the  
<br />
attack by acting in a survival mode
<br />
<br />Like
<br />
<br /><br />Woody Allen again - &quot;I was like, I was like so scared to death, the,  
<br />
the adrenalin was, was like, squirting outta my EARS!&quot; (Love and Death  
<br />
- still his best flick)
<br />
<br /><br />But that is not enough - humans don't just want to 'break even' -  
<br />
humans want to 'do better than average'
<br />
<br />Don't they? If not - what's a brain for? (Here's the 'relevant' bit,  
<br />
then)
<br />
<br />That is the undeniable goal of the human race. To become better than  
<br />
what it is somehow. It's a stage-act we have been rehearsing sinse  
<br />
Adam's Balls Dropped. (Era ABD)
<br />
<br />Emotions in this sense are just like everything else about us - we  
<br />
only have them because some accidental miscopying of DNA resulted in a  
<br />
useful adaptation
<br />
<br />The survival value lies precisely in that emotions are a speechless  
<br />
organism's only way of getting another speechless organism to help it  
<br />
survive somehow
<br />
<br />like Bonobos flashing there bums at each other to get a sex coupling  
<br />
going as a reward for something altruistic done by another (could even  
<br />
be a gay coupling with Bonobos, apparently. They don't care. Sex is  
<br />
usually a REWARD for something done on one's behalf. Makes sense to  
<br />
Bonobos, why not Catholics?
<br />
<br />like
<br />
<br />scatch my back and I'll...yeah
<br />
<br /><br />So,
<br />
<br /><br />There's no point in ever being swayed by the emotional impact of  
<br />
anything because it's a kind of a con. Wagner was the master of that.  
<br />
Emotions inflate the importance of everything, often to a fictional  
<br />
extent. Think of the music Wagner wrote for Wotan's Farewell (to his  
<br />
daughter Brunnhilde) in The Ring. It's music that makes your heart  
<br />
soar to the ceiling and then explode like a shower of crimson fireworks
<br />
<br />But it's only this old twit of a god performing an honour &quot;virtual  
<br />
killing&quot; of his own favourite offspring because of some ridiculous  
<br />
case of family honour besmirched
<br />
<br />YET
<br />
<br /><br />Wagner makes us feel like some COSMIC TRAGEDY is unfolding under our  
<br />
very noses and here is the moment when his love LET HER GO -  
<br />
crescendo, crescendo and then the adrenalin starts squirting from our  
<br />
ears
<br />
<br />This is of course a bit simplistic but I'm trying to make the  
<br />
necessary point about emotions that, like anything else, there should  
<br />
be no special pleading for them; &quot;Because you happen to have this  
<br />
overwhelming feeling of self-righteous urgency and dire necessity in  
<br />
connection with something right now does not of itself necessarily  
<br />
implicate me in your issue&quot; (Office wall sign)
<br />
<br /><br />Life of course would be dull without emotions because they communicate  
<br />
value to us - well understood point. Things with high value will  
<br />
provoke strong emotions
<br />
<br /><br />Like Wagner's and Stravinsky's music
<br />
<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest value emotions have for us lies in our being able  
<br />
to continuing playing this archaic game of exploitation-by-emotional- 
<br />
blackmail-of-ourselves for a living
<br />
<br /><br />As Dawkins points out, we should probably strive to escape from  
<br />
Darwinian evolution because, like our thinking system, it's a kluge  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kludge">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kludge</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Kim Jones
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Nørretranders' Law of Symmetrical Relief
<br />
<br />If you find that most other people, upon closer inspection, seem to be  
<br />
somewhat comical or ludicrous, it is highly probable that most other  
<br />
people find that you are in fact comical or ludicrous as well. So you  
<br />
don't have to hide it, they already know.
