<br />MP:  Your second may  shoot me if I waffle..
<br />
<br />DN:  No, he'll just tickle you until you become more coherent ;)
<br />
<br />MP:  The main reason for the word 'challenge' above is
<br />
due to the way you were using the word 'sensing' for physical
<br />
and chemical interactions.
<br />
<br />DN:  Yes, it's difficult to find terms that don't mislead somebody by
<br />
unintended implication.  Let's say that I believe it helps to reduce
<br />
&quot;physical and chemical interactions&quot; to the logic of 'self-relativity'.
<br />
Why?  Because when we conceptually isolate 'entities' like molecules, atoms,
<br />
or even quarks or super-strings, the semantics we employ implicitly depend
<br />
on this 'primitive' logical concept.  A simple notion that embodies this is
<br />
a 'modulated continuum': continuum, because it must be seamless and
<br />
symmetrical ( i.e. no 'voids'); modulated, because nonetheless this symmetry
<br />
must somehow be 'broken'.  If such 'broken seamlessness' has a flavour of
<br />
paradox, there's something 'strangely' unavoidable in that. But ISTM that
<br />
most aspects of our ontology can be intuited by building on (something like)
<br />
the self-participation of such a modulated continuum.
<br />
<br />For me, the natural term for this participatory, self-directed,
<br />
symmetry-breaking is 'self-relativity'.  The cool thing about this, is that
<br />
narratives rooted in such participatory self-relation lend themselves quite
<br />
interchangeably to 0, 1, or 3-person points-of-view.  IOW, whether you want
<br />
to narrate in terms of (physical) 'action', or (personal) 'sensing', or even
<br />
(mathematical) 'operations', all can be intuited as built on self-relation.
<br />
And the distinctive differences between such narratives are then reciprocal
<br />
perspectives on that self-relativity.  This is why I used the term
<br />
'sense-action' as a 'bridge' between the 'physical' and 'personal'
<br />
reciprocals of self-relation. The empirical 'laws' we extract from the
<br />
consistent features of these relations can in turn be intuited as inheriting
<br />
from the self-directedness of the original symmetry-breaking: this too, will
<br />
have 0, 1, and 3-person reciprocity.
<br />
<br />MP:  OK, my 'the brain makes muscles move' is basically a
<br />
bulwark against 'panpsychism' or any other forms of
<br />
mystery-making. The term I like is 'identity theory' but like
<br />
most labels it usually seems to provoke unproductive
<br />
digressions.
<br />
<br />DN:  Now does it seem possible to you that your notion of 'identity' could
<br />
be accomplished via 'sense-action' reciprocity?  IOW, that 'mind' and
<br />
'brain' are reciprocal perspectives on the same structure of
<br />
self-relations?  Panpsychism?  Well, brain's perspective is 'psych'; psych's
<br />
perspective is 'brain'. The 'pan' then depends on how you localise 'psych',
<br />
and that is a horse of a very different colour.  ISTM, very briefly, that
<br />
'psych', in the operational sense of a highly-specific set of
<br />
biospherically-evolved mechanisms for dealing with the environment, is
<br />
anything but 'pan'.  How and 'where' does it then arise?  Well, we know from
<br />
this list alone that theories abound, but nobody knows.  This of course
<br />
won't restrain my speculations!
<br />
<br />My take would be along the lines that the brain 'hosts' (deliberate
<br />
ambiguity) 'transduction' that 'renders' information spectrally on a set of
<br />
virtual 'surfaces'.  Metaphorically it's a bit like the telly, (very)
<br />
loosely, in that the transducer's job is to turn 'signal' into 'message'.
<br />
But of course there's no-one watching: the 'surfaces' *are* our 'personal
<br />
worlds'.  Such surfaces are the 'medium' of the 1-personal, and the
<br />
'messages' it mediates are '3-personal' (always remembering that the medium
<br />
*is* the message).  Also - crucially - the 'surfaces' are *interactive*:
<br />
messages self-relate, recombine, get re-transduced, and signal flows back
<br />
into the environment.
<br />
<br />Now, how the 'transduction-signal' relationship emerges out of computation,
<br />
EM, chemistry, Bose-Einstein condensate, or GOK* what, I dunno.  But if we
<br />
contemplate this participatively from a self-relating perspective, then we
<br />
can narrate the story from either 'action' or 'sense' perspectives
<br />
interchangeably.  IOW, things happen in (something like) the 'action'
<br />
narrative, participatively it feels (something like) the 'sense' narrative,
<br />
and its 'intentionality' is (something like) self-directedness.  And all of
<br />
this depends ultimately on self-relativity.
<br />
<br />(* A nurse I used to know told me that doctors would cryptically mark the
<br />
notes of the most intractable diagnoses: GOK - &quot;God Only Knows&quot;)
<br />
<br />MP:  That is to say, all our knowledge _of_
<br />
the world is embodied in qualia which are _about_ the world.
<br />
They are our brains' method of accounting for things. Naive
<br />
realism is how we are when we 'mistake' qualia for the world
<br />
they represent.
<br />
<br />DN:  OK, if one's self-relating emerges 1-personally as spectrally-rendered
<br />
'surfaces', does this carry for you any taste, sniff, glimmer, rustle, or
<br />
tingle of 'qualia'?  Of course, there's nothing 'external' to compare to the
<br />
1-personal, even though 'spectra' does carry an implication of relative
<br />
modality, range and scale at the 3-personal 'message-level'.  And we can
<br />
exchange 'signal' with others to correlate aspects of our 1-personal
<br />
worlds.  But we can find no 'absolute' sense in which it's 'like anything'
<br />
to be 1-personal, even for the 1-person.  It's non-pareil.  But, perhaps,
<br />
the sort of non-pareil that just might emerge from participating in
<br />
exquisite complexities of self-relativity.
<br />
<br />MP:  So is the fact that, even if the world 'behind' the appearances is not
<br />
actually the world _of_ the appearances, many millions of years worth of
<br />
natural selection pretty much guarantees that for all normal purposes what
<br />
we see perceive is a very good accounting of what is there.
<br />
<br />DN:  Yes, I would say that the world 'behind' the appearances is a
<br />
strangely-complex structure 'built' from a network of self-relations,
<br />
narrated 0-personally; and the world_of_the appearances is that aspect
<br />
narrated by a 3-personal message-layer mediated at 1-personal surfaces.
<br />
Globally we can intuit these as different 'takes' on self-relativity, and I
<br />
guess together you could say they render a reasonable account, taking into
<br />
account the limitations of the accountants!
<br />
<br />MP:  I am not sure if my formulation actually ties in with Colin
<br />
Hales's schema, but it agrees on many key points.
<br />
<br />DN:  We should put this to the test.
<br />
<br />MP:  There is at least one behaviourist out there who cannot cope with the
<br />
fact that his
<br />
theories have no way of describing WHERE part of the officers' world - which
<br />
is clearly visible - actually IS.
<br />
<br />DN:  This IMO is what happens when one gets stuck in one narrative to the
<br />
exclusion of the others.  You lose 'reciprocal perspective'.  Consequently
<br />
you can't avoid backing blindly into 'looking glassing': i.e. &quot;using a term
<br />
in such a way that whatever one means by it, it excludes what the term
<br />
means&quot;.  IMO, such an individual will just 'looking-glass' you to
<br />
distraction.
<br />
<br />MP:  I have a descriptive scheme outlined on some of the pages of my little
<br />
website which deals with it quite succinctly, but that is  another story.
<br />
<br />DN:  I will peruse.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; world is initially 'bootstrapped' out of the environment, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; incrementally comes to incorporate communally-established recognition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and explanatory consistencies that can also be extrapolated to a embrace

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP2: Yes! Well put.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; MP:  This can be summarised as 'The mind is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what the brain does', at least insofar as 'consciousness' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; concerned, and the brain does it all in order to make the body's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; muscles move in the right way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; DN:  I would say that 'minds' and 'brains' are - in some as yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not-fully-explicated way - parallel accounts of a seamless causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; network embracing individuals and their environment.  Depending on how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this is schematised, it may or may not be possible to fully correlate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; top-down-personal and bottom-up-physical accounts.  Nonetheless, ISTM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; more natural to ascribe intentionality to the individual in terms of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; environment, rather than 'the brain getting the body's muscles to move'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; - i.e. &quot;I move my hand&quot; runs in parallel with a physical account
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; involving the biology and physics of brain and body, but both ultimately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; supervene on a common 'primitive' explanatory base.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP2: OK, my 'the brain makes muscles move' is basically a

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would use 'connection' with effects: action and reaction which

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; include attraction and repulsion. So I would say effects' rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than aff'ect [ie stress is on first syllable] but here, as with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything to do with affect and emotion, common English usage
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not helpful [similarly to the way 'love' in English
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; translations of the New Testament is used to translate at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; four more precise words of the original Greek].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; NB: I don't use the word 'supervene'. To me it always gives the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impression that something like a coat of paint is being referred

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; MP:  The answer is that the brain is structured so that behaviours -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; potentially a million or more human behaviours of all sorts - can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *stored* within the brain. This storage, using the word in a wide sense,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is actually changes to the fine structures within the brain [synapses,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dendrite location, tags on DNA, etc] which result in [relatively]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; discrete, repeatable patterns of neuronal network activity occurring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which function as sequences of muscle activation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ...........&lt;snip&gt;.........
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Behaviours, once learned, become habitual i.e. they are evoked by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; appropriate circumstances and proceed in the manner learned unless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; varied by on-going review and adjustment. Where the habitual behavioural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; response is completely appropriate, we are barely conscious of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; activity; we only pay attention to novelties and challenges - be they in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the distant environment, our close surroundings, or internal to our own

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; DN:  Your account reads quite cogently, and we may well agree to discuss
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the issues in this way, but crucially ISTM that our accounts are always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; oriented towards particular explanatory outcomes - which is why one size
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; doesn't fit all.  So let's see if this shoe fits............

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP2: Well, as someone for whom 'standard' means if the collar

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fits then the cuffs button round my finger tips ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one size will never 'fit all' but diversity is good in company
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with toleration and healthy scepticism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am always keen to point out that we humans are always beset
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with a paradox, which _can_ be seen as a kind of duality. What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it amounts to is that we live in a real world, but we live by

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means of a description. That is to say, all our knowledge _of_

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; little less fractiously on this list.   For what it's worth, I probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; wouldn't expend much more effort on someone with so entrenched a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP2: Yes, I believe that person's approach to communication has

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in fact wasted all manner of good opportunities to sort out the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agreements and congruence between behavioural analysis so-called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the descriptions arising from other methods of study. I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to formulate a summary of how I see behavioural analysis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descriptions fitting in with 'representational' descriptions of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; response to the external environment.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain activity which become surrogates for the original stimuli.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This works in several different ways and in different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directions. For example the behaviour of others becomes part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the structure of one's world. An example of this would be where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a military organisation the complete obedience of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subordinates becomes an integral feature of an officer's world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Raw behaviourist language cannot easily and effectively describe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all that is going on because in effect the officers' environment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is made up of subordinates' behaviours. There is at least one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviourist out there who cannot cope with the fact that his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories have no way of describing WHERE part of the officers'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world - which is clearly visible - actually IS. I have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descriptive scheme outlined on some of the pages of my little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; website which deals with it quite succinctly, but that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another story.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Best of luck

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     David,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     We have reached some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     understanding in the 'asifism' thread, and I would summarise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     that, tilted towards the context of this line of this thread,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     more or less as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     follows.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Existence -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     *       The irreducible primitive is existence per se;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     *       that we can know about this implies differentiation in and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     that which exists;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     *       that we can recognise both invariance and changes and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     participate in what goes on implies _connection_.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     I am sure there must be mathematical/logical formalism which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     could render that with exquisite clarity, but I don't know how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     to do it. Plain-English is what I have to settle for [and aspire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     to :-]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     There are a couple of issues that won't go away though: our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     experience is always paradoxical, and we will always have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     struggle to communicate about it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Paradox or illusion -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     I think people use the word 'illusion' about our subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     experience of being here now because they don't want to see it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     as paradoxical. However AFAICS, the recursive self-referencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     entailed in being aware of being here now guarantees that what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     we are aware of at any given moment, i.e. what we can attend to,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     can never be the totality of what is going on in our brains. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     terms of mind, some of it - indeed probably the majority - is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     unconscious. We normally are not aware of this. [Duh, that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     what unconscious means Mark!] But sometimes we can become aware
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     [acutely!]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     of having _just been_ operating unconsciously and this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     salutary, once the sickening embarrassment subsides anyway :-0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     For those of us who have become familiar with this issue it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     no hardship but there are many who resist the idea. The least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     mortifying example that is _easy to see in oneself_ is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     happens when we look for something and then find it: before we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     find it the thing is 'not there' for us, except that we might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     believe that it is really. Then we find it; the thing just pops
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     into view! As mundane as mould on cheese, but bloody marvellous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     as soon as you start thinking about how it all works!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     But I have to *challenge you to clarify* whether what I write
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     next really ties in completely with what you are thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     I'll try it in point form for brevity's sake.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Behaviour and consciousness -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     *       Consciousness is something we know personally, and through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     discussion with others we come to believe that their experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     is very similar.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     *       Good scientific evidence and moderately sceptical common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     tell us is this experience is _intimately and exclusively_ bound
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     up with the activity of our brains. Ie the experience - the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     conscious awareness of the moment as well as the simultaneous or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     preliminary non-conscious activity - is basically what the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     does, give or take a whole range of hormonal controls of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     rest of the organism. This can be summarised as 'The mind is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     what the brain does', at least insofar as 'consciousness' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     concerned, and the brain does it all in order to make the body's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     muscles move in the right way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     *       People's misunderstanding about how we are conscious seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     centre around how mere meat could 'have' this experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     *       The answer is that the brain is structured so that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     - potentially a million or more human behaviours of all sorts -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     can be *stored* within the brain. This storage, using the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     in a wide sense, is actually changes to the fine structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     within the brain [synapses, dendrite location, tags on DNA, etc]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     which result in [relatively] discrete, repeatable patterns of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     neuronal network activity occurring which function as sequences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     of muscle activation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     *       For practical purposes behaviours usually involve muscles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     moving body parts appropriately. [If muscles don't move, nobody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     else can be sure if anything is going on]. However, within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     human brain, learning also entails the formation of neuronal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     network activity patterns which become surrogates for or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     alternatives to overtly visible behaviours. Likewise the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     completely internal detection of such surrogate activities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     becomes a kind of surrogate for perception of one's own overt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     behaviours or for perception of external world activities which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     would result from one's own actions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     *       Useful and effective response and adaptation to the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     requires the review of appropriateness of one's overt behaviour
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     and to be able to adjust or completely change one's behaviours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     both at very short notice and over arbitrarily long periods
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     depending on the duration of the effects of one's actions. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     entails responding to one's own behaviours over whatever time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     scale is necessary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     *       Behaviours, once learned, become habitual i.e. they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evoked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     by appropriate circumstances and proceed in the manner learned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     unless varied by on-going review and adjustment. Where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     habitual behavioural response is completely appropriate, we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     barely conscious of the activity; we only pay attention to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     novelties and challenges - be they in the distant environment,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     our close surroundings, or internal to our own bodies and minds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Who? -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     *       The concept of responding to one's own responses being the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     basis of consciousness causes some to complain that this implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     some kind of infinite regress of observers. What actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     happens is that internal brain behaviours [discrete network
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     activations] occur as surrogates for all the relevant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     environmental features of interest, including one's own body and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     the storyline we are following. Where surrogates for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     environmental features are linked in with surrogates for 'self'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     [body and storyline] and with network activations that stand for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     relationships between those features of environment and self,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     THAT, moment by moment, is something which exists. So there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     'something it is LIKE something to be' and that is what it is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     The registration of novelty and the responses to it, reviewed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     ceaseless recursive cycles, gives us the basis of subjective time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     I have put this description in terms of 'behaviours' because I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     am practising how to deal with the jibes and stonewalling of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     someone who countenance only 'behavioural analysis'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     descriptions. I am happier recognising that most internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     behaviours can be called 'representations' - it is much more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     succinct.
