Stephen,
<br />
<br />Am I correct that you're essentially saying that our universe is
<br />
algorithmically incompressible? If so I would agree and, interestingly, so
<br />
does my friend Jim in a parallel thread I sparked from this very thread on
<br />
the infophysics list a week or so back; thought I'd post it because he
<br />
represents the &quot;hard&quot; info physical view on this subject much  better than I
<br />
could:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From: &quot;Jim Whitescarver&quot; &lt;jim.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
Subject: Re: [InfoPhysics] Fw: Is the universe computable
<br />
<br />In so far as the universe is logical it can be modeled as a logical
<br />
information system.  The information nature of the quantum makes such a
<br />
model convenient.  It seems surprising how closely nature obeys logic
<br />
granting validity to science.
<br />
If we suppose that it is indeed logical and has no other constraints
<br />
outside that logic, we then find it is an incompressible computation, that
<br />
cannot be represented with fewer states.  The universe is computably as it
<br />
is a computer, but only a computer larger than the universe itself could
<br />
model it.  In this sense, the universe is not technically computable in
<br />
practical terms.
<br />
Intractability, however, is not exclusive of there existing good
<br />
solutions.  Unknowability is inherent in complex systems and we can
<br />
capitalize on the the uniformity of the unknowable in the world of the
<br />
known.
<br />
Consider a pure entropy source, e.g. a stationary uncharged black hole.
<br />
It effective eats all the information that falls in irretrievably
<br />
randomizing it into the distant future.  It is not that systems falling in
<br />
stop behaving determistically, it is that we no longer care what their
<br />
state is effectively randomized and outside our window of observation.
<br />
Nothing in our world covaries with what happens inside the black hole but
<br />
we know that there would be correlations due to the determinism that
<br />
exists independently on the inside and the outside.
<br />
I am not saying we can compute all of this.  What happens at any point is
<br />
the result of the entire universe acting at that point at this instant.
<br />
Clearly this is not knowable.  Causes are clearly not locally
<br />
deterministic.
<br />
But we can represent the black hole as a single integer, its mass in Plank
<br />
action equivalents.  From this all it's relevant properties to our
<br />
perspective are known in spite of however complex it is internally.
<br />
All participants, modeled as information systems, are entropy sources like
<br />
black holes, but we get samplings of their internal state suggesting a
<br />
finite state nature and deterministic behavior.  The distinction is
<br />
whether we can determine what that deterministic systems is or not.  We
<br />
cannot without communicating with all the participants and that is not
<br />
always possible.
<br />
But given a set of perspectives, there is no limit to how closely we can
<br />
model them.  Where no model works randomness may be substituted and often
<br />
we will get good, if not perfect, results.
<br />
Even legacy quantum mechanics, misguidedly based on randomness, yields
<br />
deterministic results for quantum interactions shown accurate to many
<br />
dozens of decimal places.  This suggests that simple deterministic models
<br />
will most likely be found.
<br />
