Le 03-janv.-07, à 16:36, Stathis Papaioannou wrote (in more than one  
<br />
posts) :
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maudlin starts off with the assumption that a recording being  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious is obviously absurd, hence the need for the conscious  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine to handle counterfactuals. If it were not for this assumption  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then there would not have been much point to the rest of the paper.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, Putnam and Chalmers also think that the idea of any physical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system implementing any computation is absurd. I am not sure of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mallah's position (he seems to have disappeared from the list after I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; joined), but Hal Finney seemed to give some credence to the idea, and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outside the list Hans Moravec and Greg Egan seem also to at least  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entertain the possibility that it is true. I would be interested if  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyone is aware of any other references.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hans Moravec has defended in this list indeed the idea that even a  
<br />
teddy bear is conscious. You could perhaps search in the archive my  
<br />
reply to him. I will try to sum up what I think about this, but other  
<br />
things need to be clarified, perhaps.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Although you have clearly stated that the two ideas - consciousness  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervening on all physical processes and consciousness supervening on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no physical process - are completely different I think they are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related in that in both cases matter is irrelevant to consciousness,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<br /><br />If consciousness supervenes on all physical processes a case can be  
<br />
made that matter could be relevant for consciousness. (I see Peter  
<br />
Jones makes a similar remark).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... and we may as well say that what is important is computation as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonic object, not its accidental correlation with (putative) real  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world processes.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That's the point indeed. A consequence. Not something I assume. You put  
<br />
it right below.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; They are also closely related in that the main argument against them  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is &quot;that's absurd&quot;. A second argument against them is also the same:  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the difficulty explaining why we don't suddenly find ourselves in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;white rabbit&quot; universes.
</em><br />
<br /><br />My point was to show that comp transforms partially  the &quot;mind-body  
<br />
relation&quot; problem into an explanation of why such white rabbits are  
<br />
rare. The non triviality of the mathematics of computers gives more  
<br />
than a hint: in acomp (arithmetical translation of the UDA) we can  
<br />
already show how a &quot;quantum like quantization&quot; occurs for the  
<br />
observations having &quot;probability one&quot;.  I will insist on this later  
<br />
perhaps. I must find a way to explain more the math without frightening  
<br />
the inumerates :)
<br />
(Academically it has been the inverse: I had to motivate the mind-body  
<br />
problem to mathematicians who are known to be generally allergic to  
<br />
anything just looking like metaphysics. This has been far more  
<br />
difficult!).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Throwing out comp throws out physical supervenience as well, so it can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eliminate the problem. Keeping comp and throwing out physical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenience is the tricky thing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't see why throwing comp throws out physical supervenience. On the  
<br />
contrary, if my reasoning is correct, throwing comp is even the only  
<br />
way to keep a physical supervenience, for example by asking for a non  
<br />
computational physical process (like Penrose BTW but for very different  
<br />
reasons).
<br />
Keeping comp we just have to throw out physical supervenience. It can  
<br />
look tricky because, we are used to associate a particular mind/person  
<br />
with (what we see as) a particular body. My opinion is that this is  
<br />
just an aristotelian prejudice. Technically there is a priori no  
<br />
problem (except the mathematical rarity of the white rabbit) given that  
<br />
a computational supervenience thesis remain available. Consciousness is  
<br />
associated with the infinity of equivalent (non distinguishable)  
<br />
mathematical-computations. Time and space appears then to be internal  
<br />
relatively stable constructions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wonder if we are talking about the same thing, because it doesn't  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem to me that an empirical proof is needed to show that any physical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process could be seen as implementing any computation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is not obvious at all. You need both empiry + a physical theory  
<br />
about that empiry, just to say that there is a physical process  
<br />
implementing if only one computation (to say nothing about all  
<br />
computations).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, it is no problem if the physical process under  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consideration lacks a sufficient number of distinct states, because  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the one state can be reused to perform as many computations in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parallel as you want, in the same way as a certain value in a given  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer processor register will be the same in the course of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; countless possible computations.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But the state of the universal machine doing the computation will be  
<br />
different. If the computer comes back to an earlier state it will loop,  
<br />
and as such it will lose its universality. A state makes sense only  
<br />
relatively to a universal machine (&quot;material&quot; or arithmetical say)  
<br />
getting through that state.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course this is completely useless as far as practical computation  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; goes because to keep track of random 1's and 0's which, looked at the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right way, are implementing a word processing program, you need to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; write the program and implement it on a conventional computer to keep  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; track of everything. It is like saying that a page covered in ink  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contains any given text: true in a trivial sense, useless as far as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; helping you write a letter goes. However, what if computation can give  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rise to consciousness?
</em><br />
<br /><br />A computation is not just a collection of states. It is better  
<br />
described as an ordering of discrete states relatively to a (universal)  
<br />
machine computing producing those states. The &quot;produce&quot; here does not  
<br />
to have to be a temporal or material processes, but can be described in  
<br />
term of atemporal arithmetical relations. That is why we can expect non  
<br />
trivial probabilities for going to one state to another.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This would be like saying, what if a particular page of text were  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious? You would still need to remove all the unnecessary ink in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order to read and perhaps interact with the text, but if you just left  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it alone it would still be conscious, dreaming away on the black page.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, but in that sense, assuming also a very speculative sort of  
<br />
physical infinity, all computations will be there in a trivial sense:  
<br />
all pieces of that paper contains not only UD* but the whole of  
<br />
platonia (a non comp object). Without that infinity speculation I could  
<br />
argue that most physical theories today will justify that among the UD  
<br />
accessible states only a finite numbers of them will be accessed. That  
<br />
is literaly nothing compared to what the whole of UD* needed for both  
<br />
consciousness and then physical laws (assuming comp).
<br />
Perhaps you believe in physical real number (almost all real number  
<br />
contains arithmetical truth coded in a non readable way). If physically  
<br />
real numbers exist (why not, they don't really exist in loop gravity,  
<br />
but they do exist in string theories), then any analog (non static)  
<br />
machine embed arithmetical truth (much more than all computations) in  
<br />
all of its activity. But now, it can be shown that such machine are not  
<br />
turing universal: there are many problem that such machine cannot even  
<br />
address. This is not an obvious result. Tarski showed it by proving  
<br />
that the first order theories of the reals can be made complete and  
<br />
decidable (and are thus logically poorer than Peano Arithmetic).
<br />
This can also be explained in term of Polynomial Equations with integer  
<br />
coefficient. That is, equation like the following:
<br />
<br />3xyzt + 24yx^3 -7x^45 - 4u - 12 = 0
<br />
<br />If the variables or unknown x, y, z, t u belong to the reals, it can be  
<br />
shown (by Sturm + Tarski) that there is an algorithm capable of finding  
<br />
the solutions; but if you ask that the variables are natural number or  
<br />
integers then there is no such algorithm. If this seems weird just  
<br />
think about Fermat which is trivial on the reals and very difficult  
<br />
with the natural numbers (but recently solved by Wiles &amp; Co.).
<br />
<br />If you want, the problem with the &quot;black pages&quot; is that there is no way  
<br />
(or all ways!) to distinguish (internally or externally) the difference  
<br />
between an &quot;incarnation/implementation&quot; of the number 1 and the number
<br />
<br />1,  
<br />
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 
<br />
0000000000 ... 000100000....
<br />
<br />This changes once you add the sinus function. Trigonometric or periodic  
<br />
functions are a way to reintroduce the natural numbers in the frame of  
<br />
the reals (by sinus(2PIx) = 0 for example). But to show that the black  
<br />
page implements the sinus in a genuine computational (even in not  
<br />
external user friendly way) is again not obvious and presuppose many  
<br />
physical things. We can come back on this later perhaps.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One argument against this idea is that it is not enough to leave the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation (or the text) hidden in randomness, because it is only  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through interaction with the environment that consciousness manifests  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and only conventional brains and computers can interact with the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment. But this excludes the possibility that the conscious  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entity is dreaming or interacting with a virtual reality, isolated  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the substrate of its implementation due to the impenetrable  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; randomness.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; SP: 'using the term &quot;comp&quot; as short for &quot;computationalism&quot; as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; picked up from Bruno. On the face of it, computationalism seems  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; sensible: the best theory of consciousness and the most promising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; candidate for producing artificial intelligence/consciousness'
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What Bruno calls comp isn't standard computaitonalism, it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; an element of Platonism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Standard computationalism involves the idea that consciousness can be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; captured by a computer program running on a computer. Bruno keeps the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first part but challenges the second, suggesting that the idea of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical process in the computer actually causing the conscious  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience is flawed, as per Maudlin's paper. Thus he does not begin  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the idea that conscious computations exist as Platonic objects  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (although I think he did suspect this all along) but ends with it as a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusion from examining the claims of standard computationalism.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Always risky to summarise someone else's ideas when they're watching,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but perhaps Bruno could comment if I have it wrong.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No you are right. By comp I really mean &quot;standard computationalism&quot;. It  
<br />
is equivalent with the &quot;saying yes to the doctor who proposes some  
<br />
artificial digital (generalized(*)) brain substitution for some level  
<br />
of description&quot;. To make the &quot;digital&quot; condition transparent and  
<br />
machine or formalism independent, I put Church thesis in &quot;comp&quot;. Then  
<br />
the arithmetical realism (platonism) is just the acceptance of the  
<br />
excluded middle principle (A or ~A) for the arithmetical propositions A  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(actually I need only the Sigma1 one, those with shape A = ExP(x) with  
<br />
P decidable).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the platonism of the usual working classical mathematician.
<br />
So comp is really &quot;standard computationalism&quot;,  probably made a little  
<br />
more precise than usual. The idea that Matter (primary matter) has no  
<br />
role at all in science and consciousness is just an (admittedly non  
<br />
obvious) consequence of standard comp (cf. UDA). Of course I did  
<br />
suspect this all along. I am also glad with it in the sense than  
<br />
physicist does not presuppose primary matter except in a meta-heuristic  
<br />
way when they want to explain their subject matter without digging too  
<br />
much in the theoretical interpretation problems. But most physicist  
<br />
does use, without any problem of conscience, the excluded middle  
<br />
principle on arithmetical propositions. In acomp (arithmetical version  
<br />
of comp where it is explained &quot;how&quot; to derive the physical laws from  
<br />
the number theoretical truth) I don't even need any &quot;ontological&quot;  
<br />
platonism: I interview at the start machine who &quot;believes&quot; (= prove  
<br />
here) the excluded middle principle, that is I am using a more  
<br />
epistemological weaker form of &quot;platonism&quot;. But for the UDA (which  
<br />
explains *why* we have to derive the physics from the number) you have  
<br />
to accept that for all natural number i and n, either Fi(n) is defined  
<br />
or Fi(n) is not defined. The UD itself would have no sense in the  
<br />
contrary case. Fi = the ith one-variable program in an universal  
<br />
enumeration of all partial computable function (cf Church thesis).
<br />
<br />(*) The concept of generalized brain (the portion of whatever is needed  
<br />
to be Turing emulated so that my consciousness is locally recreated) is  
<br />
necessary to prevent the Colin Hales (but see also Johnson Laird in the  
<br />
literature) move consisting in saying that &quot;the environment&quot; plays a  
<br />
role in my consciousness: if that is the case put the environment in  
<br />
the brain (by definition). If the environment is both needed and not  
<br />
turing emulable then comp is just *already* false.
