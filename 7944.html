<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [GK] 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I would like to leave copies out of the YD because I think those &gt; 
</em><br />
would actually invalidate the premise. If you ran into 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; a copy of yourself in the street you may suspect that something is &gt; 
</em><br />
amiss in your world! 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM] 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;OK if it is a temporary interdiction. The YD will entail that we are 
<br />
duplicable in a weak sense (which does not contravene the no-cloning 
<br />
theorem (but here I anticipate the reasoning)). 
<br />
&nbsp;You pretend YD is false, show the proof. 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;By now you should have understood that I will not be taunted, so no 
<br />
use in trying. I do not pretend anything. What I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;have told you and maintain is that I can sketch an argument that shows 
<br />
that your YD is incompatible with QM being the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;correct physics of the world and I will do so as soon as you admit 
<br />
that this will invalidate ALL your thesis (not just the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;part of it you feel like conceding). This was my proposal all along 
<br />
and I have not changed it. So there is no point in
<br />
&nbsp;challenging me in these terms. I made clear already.
<br />
<br />&nbsp; 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [GK] 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; What I propose to do is to show you that your premise, YD, is false. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That allows me to dismiss anything you say based 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; on that premise. 
</em><br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course. But of course, everything I say from CT and AR alone will 
<br />
survive. I hope you see this clearly. 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you claim that you derive the whole of physics (including QM) from 
<br />
CT and AR alone there is no point in my showing you that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;physics invalidates YD! Is there? You would know that already, or you 
<br />
could derive it independently! Whether I am right or
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;wrong would be completely indiferent to you. Why would you even 
<br />
consider my argument?
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; That is actually not general at all but extremely specific. From 
</em><br />
here &gt; on I will make no comment on 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; any sentence you preface with &quot;But from COMP (or YD) I can prove &gt; 
</em><br />
that...&quot; . Nothing personal, please understand. 
<br />
&nbsp;   
<br />
&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. Except that in a second round (the &quot;interview&quot; of the lobian 
<br />
machine) I translate &quot;comp&quot; in arithmetic, and I extract *a* physics 
<br />
&nbsp;from that COMP. To understand that translation YD is very useful, but 
<br />
no more. Then if the physics that is extracted from the arithmetical 
<br />
COMP corresponds to the empirical physics, your proof of the falsity of 
<br />
the YD would show that a falsity has helped in discovering the origin 
<br />
of the physical laws. Funny but not entirely impossible. Except that, 
<br />
without wanting to discourage you in advance, it is very hard for me to 
<br />
believe you have find a proof or an argument showing comp is wrong. But 
<br />
that makes me just more curious. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK] 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;OK. Let me ask you this than and maybe help you avoid any more painful 
<br />
contortions: can you even imagine a situation in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;which you could be proven wrong? (Please remember how many times you 
<br />
have underscored that COMP is verifiable!)
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;(skipped)
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;I take it like that. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;You are telling me you are platonist the week and not platonist the 
<br />
week-end? 
<br />
&nbsp;Or &quot;ditto&quot; means you agree with *me*, I guess. 
<br />
&nbsp;[GK] 
<br />
&nbsp;I agree with you but I am a platonist 24/7 (=full-time)!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [GK] 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; In that case enjoy the prize! If you derived the laws of physics 
</em><br />
from &gt; CT and AR alone you surely deserve the recognition you 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; will enjoy because that is a remarkable accomplishment! &gt; 
</em><br />
Congratulations! 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a derivation of a physics from CT and AR. Just to 
<br />
understand *that* intuitively you need YD. I have done two things the 
<br />
universal dovetailer argument (UDA) which shows that YD + CT + AR 
<br />
entails that physics emerges necessary from a web of machine dreams 
<br />
(say, dream being entirely defined in term of computer science or 
<br />
number theory). 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But then in the second part, called sometime the arithmetical 
<br />
universal dovetailer argument (AUDA), or more simply the &quot;interview of 
<br />
the lobian machine&quot;, I translate (UDA) in arithmetic (because comp 
<br />
makes it possible and necessary). YD disappears or is translated in 
<br />
arithmetic (by Godel-like devices). The derivation of physics is purely 
<br />
mathematical of course, I am not a magician extracting the galaxies 
<br />
from someone saying &quot;yes&quot; to a doctor. 
<br />
&nbsp;It looks like it disappoints you, but there is two parts in my work: 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;UDA: an argument that YD + CT + AR implies physics is necessarily a 
<br />
branch of computer science. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;AUDA: a translation of the argument in arithmetic, with the (modest) 
<br />
result that the logic of the observable proposition is given by the 
<br />
composition of three mathematical transformations operating on a 
<br />
&quot;well-known&quot; modal logic (G). And it already looks enough like some 
<br />
quantum logics to encourage further research. Alas the math are not 
<br />
easy and not well known. 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This hardly sounds like a derivation to me. But if your first 
<br />
statement above (UDA) is correct I deduce that if one of its premises is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;false that physics may not necessarily be a branch of computer 
<br />
science. How else can I read it?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Say &quot;Yes&quot;, doctor!
<br />
<br />&nbsp; 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; I feel like saying: my work here is done! 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM] 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is done. Yes of course.And if YD is false (which I doubt), UDA 
<br />
will be dead, ok, but it will make the AUDA much more enigmatic! 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid &quot;enigmatic&quot; is not good enough for me! How about: 
<br />
&quot;heuristically unlikely&quot;, &quot;possibly wrong&quot;, &quot;in need of further  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;scrutiny&quot; ? If physics is not a necessary consequence of computer 
<br />
science how would
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Without even trying I have let you relinquish one of your 
</em><br />
hypothesis! 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;It looks your goal is shooting me completely: the UDA and AUDA! 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have absolutely no worry about YD, but it is a logical fact you ask 
<br />
me to make clear: even if that were true (that YD is false), that would 
<br />
kill one halve only, the one some people ask me sometimes to drop out, 
<br />
but I prefer to keep it for preventing positivistic interpretation of 
<br />
machine's discourses. 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [GK] 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Well, YD is so secondary to your purposes, why do you care? 
</em><br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because many people take YD for granted, already. Because it makes the 
<br />
comp-physics obligatory making the whole of comp testable. YD is 
<br />
secondary for the extraction of physics, but it is necessary for having 
<br />
an understanding why it is a derivation of physics. I am anormaly 
<br />
patient, you could understand this by reading the UDA, and the 
<br />
beginning of the AUDA. 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno, I would say you are also anormaly resistant to any 
<br />
consideration of the possibility that you may be wrong! And than
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;you go and call me arrogant! I, on the other hand, am very willing to 
<br />
admit my argument may be wrong. Why can't you?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; I am almost sure you would approve my version but I am not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; putting it down until you give me a good reason to do it!!! 
</em><br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that would kill the first half of my PhD thesis and makes the 
<br />
second part enigmatic. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But many in this list find YD plausible and if you can show it false, 
<br />
please do it. 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I am sorry, Bruno, but I see no glory in disappointing a few 
</em><br />
computer &gt; scientists(and their grand-mothers) 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;Only? 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; since, you and I agree that their physics stinks! You are the one &gt; 
</em><br />
that claims to derive the true physics 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming comp in UDA, and assuming COMP (as I wrote it sometimes) for 
<br />
the translation of comp in the language of a lobian machine 
<br />
(arithmetic, if you want). The result of the transformation is just a 
<br />
purely mathematical formula (sorry!). 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; so you are the one I would like to shoot down! If you really only 
</em><br />
need &gt; CT and AR I really have no other choice but to worship at your 
<br />
altar &gt; (;-) since I really don't want to have to go through your proof 
<br />
and I &gt; am no match for CT or AR. It is a pity because it is a cute 
<br />
little &gt; argument I have up my sleeve .... 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My senses detect some arrogance here. Do you mean you would not give 
<br />
the argument once you realize that strictly speaking it could only 
<br />
wound my work without killing it completely? You could have first take 
<br />
a look at the table of content. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Either you give the argument in the next post, or I will give you the 
<br />
everything-list-prize of arrogance Godfray. 
<br />
&nbsp;

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I can't help notice that I am the one who has been found guilty 
<br />
of name calling! I have so particular stake in dismissing your work but 
<br />
I sense, instead, a certain lack of consistency between the admirable 
<br />
principles of scientific skepticism that you
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;claim to profess and your reticence in admiting that they may apply to 
<br />
your work. That is not very becoming in a logician (;-)
<br />
&nbsp;and that is what I am aiming at!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Also, I have not given up on you yet!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Best regards,
