Tell me again where I am going wrong.  Consider each of these examples:
<br />
<br />117. q
<br />
...
<br />
191. Bp
<br />
...
<br />
207. p -&gt; q
<br />
<br />Now, we will say that the machines &quot;believes&quot; something if it is one of
<br />
its theorems, right?  So we can say that the machine &quot;believes q&quot;, it
<br />
&quot;believes Bp&quot;, and it &quot;believes p-&gt;q&quot;, right?  We could equivalently say
<br />
it &quot;believes q is true&quot;, etc., but that is redundant.  If it writes x
<br />
down as a theorem, we will say it believes x, which is shorthand for
<br />
saying that it believes x is true.  The &quot;is true&quot; part has no real
<br />
meaning and does not seem helpful.
<br />
<br />We also have this shorthand Bx to mean &quot;the machine believes x&quot;.  So we
<br />
(not the machine, but us, you and I!) can also write, Bq, BBp and B(p-&gt;q),
<br />
and all of these are true statements, right?
<br />
<br />The problem arises when we start to use this same letter B in the
<br />
machine's theorems.  It is easy to slide back and forth between the
<br />
machine's B and our B.  But there is no a priori reason to assume that
<br />
they are the same.  That is something that has to be justified.
<br />
<br />Focus on 207. p-&gt;q for a moment.  We know that, according to the machine's
<br />
rules, this theorem means that if it ever writes down p as a theorem,
<br />
it will write down q.  Therefore it is true that Bp-&gt;Bq.  This is simply
<br />
another way of saying the same thing!  Bp means that p is a theorem,
<br />
by definition of the letter B, in the real world.  And similarly Bq
<br />
means that q is a theorem.  Given that p-&gt;q is a theorem, then if p is
<br />
a theorem, so is q.  Therefore it is true that B(p-&gt;q) -&gt; (Bp -&gt; Bq).
<br />
This is not a theorem of the machine, it is a truth in the real world.
<br />
<br />What I want to say is that 207. p-&gt;q &quot;means&quot; Bp -&gt; Bq.  It means that if
<br />
the machine ever derives p, it will derive q.  This is a true statement
<br />
about the operations of the machine.  It is not a theorem of the machine.
<br />
<br />When we talk about what something &quot;means&quot;, I think it has to be what it
<br />
means to us, not what it means to the machine.  When the machine writes
<br />
117.q, it doesn't mean anything to the machine.  To us it means that the
<br />
machine believes q, or that the machine believes q is true.
<br />
<br />Given this approach, I am very hesistant to say that 191. Bp means that
<br />
the machine believes that it believes p.  I have no problem saying that it
<br />
means that the machine believes Bp.  But to say that the machine &quot;believes
<br />
that it believes p&quot; uses the word &quot;believes&quot; in two very different and
<br />
confusing ways.  The first &quot;believes&quot; is just a statement about what the
<br />
machine has derived as a theorem.  We choose to say that the machine's
<br />
theorems are what it &quot;believes&quot;.  I am OK with that.  But the second
<br />
&quot;believes&quot; refers to the letter B, which we are arbitrarily choosing to
<br />
identify with this word &quot;belief&quot;.
<br />
<br />To the machine, B is just a letter.  I still say that I need to know what
<br />
the rules are that the machine will apply to that letter.  I see that I
<br />
was wrong to think that p -&gt; Bp was a rule the machine would have if it
<br />
were &quot;normal&quot;.  You said that for a normal machine, if it ever proved p,
<br />
it would also prove Bp.  Okay, but how could it possibly do this without
<br />
ANY rules to deal with the letter B?
<br />
<br />Normality is not something one can just assert about a machine.  You would
<br />
need to give it a rule for dealing with the letter B, then you could prove
<br />
(not the machine proving, you would prove it) that if the machine ever
<br />
derived p, its rules for dealing with the letter B would then cause it
<br />
to derive Bp.  In this way you would show that the machine was normal.
<br />
<br />My axiom, which I should have written as, &quot;0a. for all x, x-&gt;Bx&quot;, would
<br />
in fact be sufficient to show that a machine which had that axiom would
<br />
be normal.  A machine which had this rule for dealing with the letter
<br />
B would be normal, because any time it derived p, it could immediately
<br />
derive Bp using this axiom.
<br />
<br />However, this machine may be too powerful.  Although it is normal, it
<br />
is much more.
<br />
<br />So my question to you is, what is an example of an axiom for dealing
<br />
with the letter B that would make a machine be &quot;just&quot; normal, but no more?
<br />
