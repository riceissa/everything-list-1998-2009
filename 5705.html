We discussed Afshar's experiment before.  Kathryn Cramer, the blogger,
<br />
is John Cramer's daughter.  John Cramer invented the Transactional
<br />
Interpretation of QM, similar in flavor to Bohm's pilot wave theory,
<br />
and his daughter is pushing Afshar's results as being best understood
<br />
in the context of the TI.  Actually she goes further and claims that
<br />
Afshar falsifies both the Many-World and the Copenhagen Interpretations.
<br />
<br />The CI is not falsifiable IMO because it is too vague and amounts
<br />
to little more than a policy of not asking embarrassing questions.
<br />
Physicists can get their work done and leave philosophizing to others.
<br />
<br />The problem the Transactional Intepretation has with the MWI is that
<br />
worlds in the MWI never fully disengage.  There is always an exponentially
<br />
decreasing connection between them.  This means that the quantum formalism
<br />
would reflect the actions of intelligent beings in shadow worlds who are
<br />
different from ourselves, if we calculated to enough precision.
<br />
<br />This is true even in the TI or in Bohm's theory.  Those theories may
<br />
deny the reality of other worlds, but in principle they have to take
<br />
into consideration what would be happening there in order to make
<br />
their calculations.  This is obvious in a double slit experiment,
<br />
but the phenomenon never goes away completely, no matter how far we go
<br />
towards decoherence.
<br />
<br />Let Schrodinger's cat become alive or dead, but suppose there is some
<br />
super-advanced technology that can reverse the process of death at the
<br />
quantum level, undo the decoherence and restore a coherent state.  Now,
<br />
even the TI has to take into consideration the actions of those in the
<br />
other world who performed that technological miracle.
<br />
<br />This may seem too far-fetched even to consider, but we are taking tiny
<br />
steps today in this direction, pushing farther into the decoherence
<br />
frontier.  So far everything suggests that QM holds up, meaning that
<br />
interference is still detectable with proper experimental setup even
<br />
after substantial amounts of decoherence.  All the MWI says is that this
<br />
effect, which is exactly what is predicted by standard QM, will persist
<br />
even as decoherence advances so far that we can no longer measure the
<br />
interference.
<br />
<br />Either an interpretation has to accept the reality of parallel worlds,
<br />
making it a version of the MWI; or predict that this effect will no longer
<br />
occur, which will violate QM; or deny that the people in the shadow worlds
<br />
are real, even though the ripples of their actions affect our own world;
<br />
or it has to stick its head in the sand and deny that it matters since
<br />
we can't detect those ripples anyway today, and probably will never be
<br />
able to do so.  I'd be curious to know which choice the Transactional
<br />
Interpretation makes.
