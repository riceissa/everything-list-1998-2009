</em><br />
<br /><br />But why and how should the vibration of atoms in a rock be mappable  
<br />
onto any computations?
<br />
Accepting QM I can see one quantum computation: the simulation of the  
<br />
rock.
<br />
Computation are global things. It is not the union of a lot of tiny  
<br />
computations, it is the union of those tiny computations + the  
<br />
universal state which unite them. (and then from inside the problem is  
<br />
that there are an infinity of them).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is, you can't say that the rock
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implements one computation but not another.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think it implements any computations. I could accept some tiny  
<br />
apparition of tiny pieces of of tiny automata, but nothing big or  
<br />
sophisticated. Some very special crystals perhaps, no doubt, but those  
<br />
are, then, computer.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the rock is a massively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parallel computer implementing every computation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No, a finite rock goes in cycle and does not makes any long  
<br />
computation, still less the deep one. It does at most some  
<br />
computational noise. Computation, like brain are relatively rare in  
<br />
the universe. If Hubble detect a computation somewhere, iy will be  
<br />
taken as an argument for the presence of intelligent beings there. But  
<br />
it hasn't.
<br />
The genome of a bacteria implements very simple form of computations.  
<br />
There are IF ... THEN... ELSE, loops, and conditionnal (by regulatory  
<br />
gene). But it took billions of year to &quot;nature&quot; to make them appear.
<br />
Just show me the computation of factorial(24) in a rock. No one has  
<br />
shown that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Furthermore, any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subset (in time and space) of the rock is a massively parallel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer implementing any computation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is probably true for something like the border of the Mandelbrot  
<br />
set. But there is no concrete mandelbrot set in nature.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; At the limit, a minimal subset
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the rock, such as a quark existing for one Planck interval,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implements every computation.
</em><br />
<br />Hard for me to think you are serious here. A case can be made that the  
<br />
quantum vacuum is Turing universal, but this makes him doing  
<br />
&quot;sophisticated&quot; computation relatively to us, only ... in the quantum  
<br />
white rabbit universes.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And why not go one step further and say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that nothingness implements every computation?
</em><br />
<br /><br />If you stay with a physical realm, you will get only physical  
<br />
nothingness, which even in classical physics is not nothingness.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you arrive at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusion, computation exists independently of physical activity.
</em><br />
<br />That would please me, but I don't see at all the logic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Few
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people seem satisfied with this conclusion, so they try to argue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either that computationalism is false
</em><br />
<br /><br />A lot of people try to argue that computationalism is false, and  
<br />
usually the argument can be shown directly non valid; Searles for  
<br />
example mixes levels of description (as Dennett and Hofstadter show  
<br />
very well in Mind'sI).
<br />
Other have better argument, like Maudlin, but this shows only that  
<br />
comp is not compatible with linking computation with the running of  
<br />
one universal machine, or worse with the only physical one. It is more  
<br />
interesting because it shows the real difficulty of the mind-body  
<br />
problem once we take comp seriously.
<br />
But remember Jacques Mallah. He shows that there is an implementation  
<br />
problem (with physicalism). Along those line a physicalist could  
<br />
affirm that even a running computer does not run a &quot;mathematical  
<br />
computation&quot;. Unfortunately for Mallah, such a problem dissolves when  
<br />
you understand that the physical world is not a primitive reality, but  
<br />
something which emerge from the logical relations among numbers.  
<br />
Indeed, through the &quot;eyes&quot; of the universal machines/numbers.  
<br />
Arithmetical reality or alike are the only realms where computations  
<br />
exists and are well defined.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or else that computationalism is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true and dependent on physical activity
</em><br />
<br />Which is false by UDA+MGA.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and therefore that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument is invalid.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is weird.
<br />
<br />I think that you believe that a rock implements computations, because  
<br />
you believe a computation can be decomposed in tiny computations, but  
<br />
this is not true, you need much more. You need a universal machine  
<br />
which links and complexify the states in a precise way.
<br />
Some alive beings do some computations (like some flowers compute tiny  
<br />
part of the Fibonacci function). But again, this is sophisticated and  
<br />
took time to appear. Waves do analog computations, hardly universal  
<br />
digital one, or only when put in some very special condition.  
<br />
Interesting and rich computations are relatively rare and exceptional  
<br />
until they self-multiplied, like amoebas.
<br />
<br />Nor do I believe the filmed movie graph do any computation, it &quot;read&quot;  
<br />
a description of one, but does not link them logically in real time.
<br />
Today, genetical systems, brains, and computer (human or engineered)  
<br />
do &quot;concrete&quot; computations.
<br />
<br />The mathematical Universal Dovetailer, the splashed universal Turing  
<br />
Machine, the rational Mandelbrot set, or any creative sets in the  
<br />
sense of Emil Post, does all computations. Really all, with Church  
<br />
thesis. This is a theorem in math. The rock? Show me just the 30 first  
<br />
steps of a computation of square-root(2).
<br />
Robinson Arithmetic, Peano Arithmetic, Zermelo Fraenkel Set theory and  
<br />
many theories compute, notably, all computations, through the  
<br />
enumeration of the proof of all the True Sigma_1 arithmetical  
<br />
sentences, but they do much more, they reason and prove more complex  
<br />
propositions about them (Lobian Machine).
<br />
<br />But again, even if rocks implements computations, this changes nothing  
<br />
to the reversal reasoning. IF rocks implements all computations, it  
<br />
means the Universal measure is a tiny epsilon more complex to compute,  
<br />
given that the measure is put on all possible computations. It means  
<br />
we have to take into account all digital rock's state accessed by the  
<br />
universal dovetailer.
