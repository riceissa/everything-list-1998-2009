<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is another way of explaining this situation. When there are multiple

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parallel copies of you, you have no way of knowing which copy you are, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; although you definitely are one of the copies during any given moment, with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no telepathic links with the others or anything like that. If a proportion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the copies are painlessly killed, you notice nothing, because your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successor OM will be provided by one of the copies still going (after all, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is what happens in the case of teleportation). Similarly, if the number 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of copies increases, you notice nothing, because during any given moment you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are definitely only one of the copies, even if you don't know which one. 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, if your quantum coin flip causes 90% of the copies to have bad 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences, you *will* notice something: given that it is impossible to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know which particular copy you are at any moment, or which you will be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next moment, then there is a 90% chance that you will be one of those who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has the bad experience. Similarly, if you multiply the number of copies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tenfold, and give all the &quot;new&quot; copies bad experiences, then even though the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;old&quot; copies are left alone, you will still have a 90% chance of a bad 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience, because it is impossible to know which copy will provide your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next OM.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure I fully understand what you are saying, but it sounds like
<br />
you agree at least to some extent that &quot;copies count&quot;.  The number of
<br />
copies, even running in perfect synchrony, will affect the measure of
<br />
what that observer experiences, or as you would say, his subjective
<br />
probability.
<br />
<br />So let me go back to Bruno's thought experiment and see if I understand
<br />
you.  You will walk into a Star Trek transporter and be vaporized and
<br />
beamed to two places, Washington and Moscow, where you will have two
<br />
(independent) copies wake up.  Actually they are uploads and running on
<br />
computers, but that doesn't matter (we'll assume).  Bruno suggests that
<br />
you would have a 50-50 expectation of waking up in Washington or Moscow,
<br />
and I think you agree.
<br />
<br />But suppose it turns out that the Moscow computer is a parallel
<br />
processor which, for safety, runs two copies of your program in perfect
<br />
synchrony, in case one crashes.  Two synchronized copies in Moscow,
<br />
one in Washington.
<br />
<br />Would you say in this case that you have a 2/3 expectation of waking up
<br />
in Moscow?
<br />
<br />And to put it more sharply, suppose instead that in Washington you will
<br />
have 10 copies waking up, all independent and going on and living their
<br />
lives (to the extent that uploads can do so), sharing only the memory
<br />
of the moment you walked into the transporter.  And in Moscow you will
<br />
have only one instance, but it will be run on a super-parallel computer
<br />
with 100 computing elements, all running that one copy in parallel and
<br />
synchronized.
<br />
<br />So you have 10 independent copies in Washingon, and 100 copies that
<br />
are all kept in synchrony in Moscow.  What do you expect then?  A 90%
<br />
chance of waking up in Washington, because 9/10 of the versions of you
<br />
will be there?  Or a 90% chance of waking up in Moscow, because 9/10 of
<br />
the copies of you will be there?
<br />
<br />I think, based on what you wrote above, you will expect Moscow, and that
<br />
&quot;copies count&quot; in this case.
<br />
<br />If you agree that copies count when it comes to spatial location, I
<br />
wonder if you might reconsider whether they could count when it comes
<br />
to temporal location.  I still don't have a good understanding of this
<br />
situation either, it is counter-intuitive, but if you accept that the
<br />
number of copies, or as I would say, measure, does make a difference,
<br />
then it seems like it should apply to changes in time as well as space.
