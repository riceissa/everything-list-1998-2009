Brent, you already talked once as if I was using the word &quot;theology&quot; in 
<br />
some personal sense, and I already give you the source of my 
<br />
definition. I am using the word theology in the sense of the one who 
<br />
invented the world, and as it has been used during more than one 
<br />
millenium: Plato. The definition is in &quot;the laws&quot;. Plato defined it by 
<br />
the science, that is what reason can say about, the Gods and the God 
<br />
and more generally any attempt toward fundamental matter.
<br />
It is an entirely contingent and sad fact that theology has been more 
<br />
or less stolen by the temporal authoritative power of the Roman, and 
<br />
that still today many people forget that theology has been and can 
<br />
still be a science, ie something than can be driven by the modesty 
<br />
attitude. The reason is that the Church and their objective allied,  
<br />
the atheists which are as dogmatic as the leaders of institutionalized 
<br />
churches, know that such reasoning on such fundamental matters, is 
<br />
always threatening their temporal power.
<br />
Now all tradition have had good theologians at all time, even if 
<br />
sometimes some are obliged to talk in coded way just for not finishing 
<br />
on the fire.
<br />
To refuse the use of the original word &quot;theology&quot; is just a way to 
<br />
defend (purposefully or not) 1500 years of institutionalized 
<br />
charlatanry.
<br />
Scientist who says today that the mind body is a false problem are just 
<br />
playing that game, and today, atheism is much more an aid to &quot;fake 
<br />
religion&quot; than even moderate christian theology (which indeed borrowed 
<br />
many things in science from the greeks).

<br />
You can search for many informations and references on the web which 
<br />
will confirm what I say by Googelling, for example,  on the word &quot;plato 
<br />
theology&quot;.
<br />
Just one second goggeling: from 
<br />
<a href="http://mb-soft.com/believe/txn/theology.htm">http://mb-soft.com/believe/txn/theology.htm</a>:



<br />
&quot; The term theology is a compound of the Greek words theos (&quot;god&quot;) and 
<br />
logos (&quot;word,&quot; &quot;discourse,&quot; &quot;thought,&quot; &quot;reason&quot;). Theology may 
<br />
therefore be defined as reasoned discourse about God. In a strict sense 
<br />
theology considers only the existence and nature of divine being. In 
<br />
its wider and more usual sense, however, it may encompass the full 
<br />
range of the divine's relationships to the world and to humanity as 
<br />
well as the full variety of human responses to the divine. Although 
<br />
used more commonly of Western religions, the term may be applied to the 
<br />
systematic study and presentation of any religion.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to use the term was apparently the Greek philosopher Plato, 
<br />
for whom theology meant a rational conception of the divine as opposed 
<br />
to poetic myths about the gods. The subsequent Greek tradition of 
<br />
rational theology survived well into Christian times, and aspects of it 
<br />
have been influential in shaping various Jewish, Christian, and Islamic 
<br />
theologies.&quot;



<br />
Bruno
