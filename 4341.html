<br /><br />RSA Broken By The Russians?
<br />
<br />Kolmogorov Cryptography System Possibly Cracked
<br />
1 Apr 1994
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOSCOW (AP) -- At a press conference held minutes ago in a crowded 
<br />
hall,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russian mathematicians announced that a breakthrough had been made
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nearly a decade ago in the arcane branch of mathematics known as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;cryptography,&quot; the science of making messages that are unreadable to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonid Vladwylski, Director of the prestigious Moscow Academy of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sciences, called the press conference yesterday, after rumors began
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circulating that noted Russian-American reporter John Markoff was in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russia to interview academicians at the previously secret city of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soviet cryptographers, Kryptogorodok.  The existence of 
<br />
Kryptogorodok,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sister city to Akademogorodok, Magnetogorsk, and to the rocket cities
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Kazhakstan, had been shrouded in secrecy since its establishment 
<br />
in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1954 by Chief of Secret Police L. Beria.  Its first scientific
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;director, A. Kolmogorov, developed in 1960 what is called in the West
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;public key cryptography.&quot;  The existence of Kryptogorodok was 
<br />
unknown
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the West until 1991, when Stephen Wolfram disclosed its existence.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American cryptographers initially scoffed at the rumors that the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russians had developed public-key cryptography as early as 1960, some
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 years prior to the first American discovery.  After interviews 
<br />
last
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year at Kryptogorodok, noted American cryptographers Professor D.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denning and D. Bowdark admitted that it did seem to be confirmed.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Denning was quoted at the time saying that she did not 
<br />
think
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this meant the Russians could actually break the Kolmogorov system,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known in the West as RSA, because she had spent more than a full 
<br />
weekend
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trying to do this and had not succeeded.  &quot;Believe me, RSA is still
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unbreakable,&quot; she said in her evaluation report.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russia's top mathematicians set out to break Kolmogorov's new coding
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system.  This required them to determine that &quot;P = NP&quot; (see 
<br />
accompanying
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;article).  Details are to be published next month in the journal
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Doklady.Krypto,&quot; but a few details are emerging.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kolmogorov system is broken by computing the prime numbers which
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;form what is called the modulus.  This is done by randomly guessing 
<br />
the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constituent primes and then detonating all of the stockpiled nuclear
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weapons in the former Soviet Union for each &quot;wrong guess.&quot;  In the 
<br />
Many
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, invented in 1949 by Lev
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landau (and later, independently by Everett and Wheeler in the U.S.),
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all possible outcomes of a quantum experiment are realized.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Academician Leonid Vladwylski explained, &quot;In all the universes in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which we guessed the wrong factors, we were destroyed completely.  
<br />
But
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since we are obviously here, talking to you at this press 
<br />
conference, in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this universe we have an unbroken record of successfully factoring 
<br />
even
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the largest of imaginable numbers.  Since we are so optimistic about
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this method, we say the computation runs in 'Nondeterministic 
<br />
Pollyanna
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time.'  Allow me to demonstrate...&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Press Conference will be continued if the experiment is a success.]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOSCOW (AP), ITAR-Tass, 1 April 1994
<br />
<br /><br />Appendix
<br />
--------
<br />
First, it was Stephen Wolfram's actual suggestion, a couple of years ago
<br />
after the USSR imploded, that we try to recruit mathematicians and
<br />
programmers from what he surmised must exist: a secret city of Soviet
<br />
cryptographers.  It probably exists.  We did it at Los Alamos, they did 
<br />
it
<br />
with their rocket scientists and others (Akademogorodok exists), so why 
<br />
not
<br />
put their version of NSA a bit off the beaten track?  Note that our own 
<br />
NSA
<br />
is within a stone's throw of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.  I 
<br />
wouldn't
<br />
be surprised to learn that their experts were ensconced somewhere in the
<br />
Urals.
<br />
<br />I tried to acknowledge Steve with my comments.  By the way, so far as I
<br />
know, no word has come out on whether he was right in this speculation.
<br />
(Maybe some of the Russians he does in fact have working at Wolfram are
<br />
these folks?  Naw...)
<br />
<br />Second, Kolmogorov did basic work on information theory, probability, 
<br />
and
<br />
statistics.  One has to assume he had ties to the Soviet cryptography
<br />
effort (about which little has been written about, so far).  If anyone 
<br />
in
<br />
Russia could have seen public key methods coming, he is a candidate.  No
<br />
evidence that he or any other Russian did, though.
<br />
<br />Third, my references to Denning and Sternlight were perhaps not 
<br />
riotously
<br />
funny (though I didn't aim for a riotously funny tone).  Especially in
<br />
light of David Sternlight's excellent follow-up here... never let it be
<br />
said that David lacks a sense of humor.  The Denning reference was to 
<br />
her
<br />
own comments about spending a weekend or so trying (and failing, not
<br />
surprisingly) to crack the Skipjack algorithm.  (Real ciphers often take
<br />
years to break, as with the knapsack algorithm, recent crunching of DES,
<br />
etc.).
<br />
<br />Fourth, the &quot;Many Worlds&quot; interpretation of quantum mechanics does 
<br />
exist,
<br />
and leads to approaches such as I described.  It's also a hypothetical 
<br />
way
<br />
to ensure one's wealth: simply bet everything you own at 1000-to-1 odds 
<br />
and
<br />
then commit suicide in all universes in which you lose.  Not very
<br />
convincing, I agree.  Hans Moravec writes about this in his &quot;Mind
<br />
Children,&quot; 1987.
<br />
<br />Finally, I used the headers and format of a real article in the ClariNet
<br />
system, then made modifications.  Given that the Supreme Court has 
<br />
recently
<br />
ruled in favor of &quot;fair use&quot; for satire, I hope my version of &quot;2 Live 
<br />
Crew
<br />
meets RSA&quot; does not get my sued.  (I could just kill myself in all
<br />
realities in which Brad sues me.)
