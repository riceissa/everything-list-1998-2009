This post is my answer to Jacques Mallah. I have send it yesterday 
<br />
(saturday) to Jacques only, but that was due to an error of manipulation.
<br />
(apology to jacques).
<br />
<br />But I realise also that my answer (last paragraph) is most probably
<br />
false. I think Christopher Maloney is plausibly right concerning the 
<br />
matter.
<br />
<br />My 'real' opinion is that such probability computations (which I do 
<br />
not use in UDA!) are so
<br />
much conceptually difficult that it is necessary to approach the whole
<br />
problem through some conceptual tools (like Goedel's arithmetisation
<br />
and modal logics, for exemple).
<br />
<br />I nevertheless send you my whole answer, but please keep in mind this
<br />
proviso.
<br />
<br />Note also the link between the SSA (ASSA, or RSSA) and the need to better
<br />
defined or represent notion like worlds, observer-moment, memories, etc.
<br />
<br />Here is my not quite good answer to Jacques Mallah:
<br />
<br /><br />=========================================================
<br />
Jacques M. Mallah wrote:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;	Actually that doesn't matter.  For me a physical system is just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical structure which &quot;exists&quot;.  So let all computations, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;example, exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	But for me the term &quot;implementation&quot; has a special definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which I am still trying to formulate precisely, due to the implementation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problem, so I'm still not sure how you distinguish between a computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and an implementation of a computation.
</em><br />
<br />Fair enough. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;	Well, first there is the question of what you mean by a 1st person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;expectation and by &quot;yourself&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />1st person expectation = expectation by an agent of his own
<br />
personal subjective experience.
<br />
Exemple: - a child who expect a nightmare.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- a computationalist practioner who expect to be somewhere
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after a self-duplication.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- a dog who expect his &quot;master&quot; giving him a bone.
<br />
<br />&quot;myself&quot; : well, for a rough third person description, look at my
<br />
signature. For a first person description I'm afraid the best
<br />
approximation is you (from your first person point of view).
<br />
<br />In fine, I modelise the first person by the knower, and I
<br />
modelise knowledge by the modal system S4 and S4Grz.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no 1 of the 10 copies which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;linked more than the others to the original copy.  So depending on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;definition I would either say that you are only at Brussels, or that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are at all three places.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	But for practical purposes (such as, if you knew only German,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;deciding which language to learn before being scanned, English or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Russian), I would of course say that, after the reconstitution, your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;effective probability of seeing Moscow is 90%, so Russian is more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;likely&quot; to come in handy.
</em><br />
<br />Nice.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If you say that your expectation to find yourself at Maoscow is bigger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; than the one to find yourself at Washington, then, by definition, I will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; say that you link the measure with the number of (actual, here) running
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	OK, not just link it, but say it is directly proportional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(but see above).  But my point is that if you do that you reject the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;RSSA.  For example, suppose that a year later (on 1/1/2001), the copies at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Moscow are destroyed except for one, while at Washington 8 new copies of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the version of you that has been there are made.  During 2000, what is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;effective probability that you would be at Moscow?  It is 90%; next year,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it is 10%.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	But according to the RSSA that would not be the case.  If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are 90% likely to be in Moscow in 2000, each type of version of you could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only &quot;flow into&quot; its own continuation, so the eff. pr. of being at Moscow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;woulkd remain at 90% for 2001.  (Chris Maloney would claim that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;eff. pr. of being at Moscow would be 10% for both years).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	The ASSA, on the other hand, is naturally compatible with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simple rule that the effective probability is proportional to the number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of copies.  So do you, in fact, agree with that rule?
</em><br />
<br />With RSSA? Yes. And you are correct, the &quot;naive&quot; probability remains 90%.
<br />
Even without immortality. With mortality the probability at Brussels that 
<br />
I will die at Moscow in 2001 is 9/10 * 8/10. The multiplication of the
<br />
Washingtonian will not change the fact that I have had a bigger probabilty
<br />
to appear in Moscow. There will be a bigger set of Moscovian experiences
<br />
(including the fear to die with a chance of 8/10). The multiplication of 
<br />
the one in Washington will not consolate those in Moscow.
<br />
With immortality it is even simpler, except that for a real computation
<br />
you should take into account the way you kill the Moscovians and you
<br />
must bet on the level of substitution.
<br />
<br />Look at this: suppose you are annihilated at Brussels again.
<br />
And again reconstituted at M and W. Suppose now that at W, after 
<br />
one day, you are 
<br />
simply duplicate in you-W1 and you-W2, the day after, you-W2 is killed
<br />
and *at the same time* you-W1 is duplicated again, and the day after,
<br />
same scenario, all this lasting one year. 
<br />
<br />With ASSA you could say that at Brussels there is a bigger chance
<br />
to find yourself in W, because during all the year there is always two
<br />
examplars of you in Washington and only one at Moscow.
<br />
<br />With RSSA there is 1/2 chance for W and M. But for the one in Washington
<br />
there is 1/2^365 to remain alive (supposing mortality) or healthy 
<br />
(supposing
<br />
immortality) after one year. 
<br />
<br />OK? Are we agreeing (at least) on the meaning of ASSA and RSSA ?
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br />PS I am wrong, wrong, wrong !  Isn't it ? What do you think ?
<br />
<br />The problem is that an observer-moment is really defined (with comp)
<br />
with the set of maximal consistent continuations going through that
<br />
moment, and we don't know really how these sets are structured. This
<br />
is our very much discussed measure problem.
