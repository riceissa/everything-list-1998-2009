<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more easily understood analogy for what happens in the multiverse/plenitude.
</em><br />
<br />I don't agree, and in fact I think the use of copies as an analog for
<br />
what happens in the multiverse is fundamentally misleading.  If it were
<br />
not, you could create the same thought experiments just by talking about
<br />
flipping coins and such.
<br />
<br />What is the analog, in the multiverse, of pushing a button to make a copy?
<br />
When faced with the chance of torture, you are going to push a button
<br />
to make a copy.  What does that correspond to in the multiverse?
<br />
<br />The closest I can suggest is flipping a coin such that you don't get
<br />
tortured if it comes up heads.  Well, that destroys the whole point of
<br />
the thought experiment, doesn't it?  Of course you'll flip the coin.
<br />
Anyone would.
<br />
<br />Pushing a button to make a copy is completely different.  That's why we
<br />
have so much disagreement about what to do in that case, while there
<br />
would be no disagreement about what to do if you could flip a coin to
<br />
avoid being tortured.  That in itself should be a give-away that the
<br />
situations are not as analogous as some are suggesting.
<br />
<br />I would suggest going back over these thought experiments and substitute
<br />
flipping coins for making copies, and see if the paradoxes don't go away.
<br />
<br />I believe that many of the paradoxes in the copy experiments are because
<br />
people do not grasp the full meaning of what copying implies.  They are
<br />
thinking very much in the lines Stathis suggests, that it is a variant on
<br />
flipping a coin.  But it's not.  Copying is fundamentally different from
<br />
flipping a coin, because copying increases measure while coin flipping
<br />
does not.
<br />
<br />Measure is crucially important in multiverse models because it is the only
<br />
foundation for whatever predictive or explanatory ability they possess.
<br />
Choosing to overlook measure differences in analyzing thought experiments
<br />
inevitably leads to error.  Treating copying like coin flipping is just
<br />
such an error.  If you would instead think through the full implications
<br />
of copying you would see that it is completely different from flipping
<br />
a coin.  The increase of measure that occurs in copying manifests in the
<br />
world in tangible and obvious ways.  Its phenomenological consequences are
<br />
no less important.  These considerations must be included when analyzing
<br />
thought experiments involving copies, otherwise you are led into paradox
<br />
and confusion.
