<br />Future uncertainty is familiar to us, but one of the things that the
<br />
many universe model introduces is past uncertainty.  There is a sense
<br />
in which the past is not unique and determined.  My mental state is
<br />
consistent with many macroscopically distinct pasts.
<br />
<br />My brain and my mind hold only a certain amount of information.
<br />
Vastly more information than that has existed in my past light cone, the
<br />
history of the universe which has led up to me.  My brain is therefore
<br />
very probably consistent with a great many past histories, each of which
<br />
will lead to a brain, a mind and a mental state which is indistinguishable
<br />
from that which I am now experiencing.  From my first-person perspective,
<br />
the past is indeterminate in much the same way as the future is, although
<br />
to a lesser degree.
<br />
<br />And I think it is likely that some of these histories may be
<br />
macroscopically distinct to a dramatic degree.  It's even possible that
<br />
there could be Earths with different sets of inhabitants, different
<br />
cities, different historical events and I could be existing in many of
<br />
these Earths with exactly the same mental state I experience today.
<br />
<br />Who is the head of the Chamber of Commerce of Gary, Indiana?
<br />
It's possible that this question is actually indeterminate for me,
<br />
that I may in a sense span universes where this has different answers.
<br />
Of course I could do some research and find the answer, and then my
<br />
mental states would diverge in a process somewhat analogous to the
<br />
splitting of the MWI.  But until then, from my first person perspective,
<br />
there is no unique answer.
<br />
<br />Generally, when I learn information, my possible worlds diverge, and
<br />
when I forget information, my possible worlds merge.  Life seems to be a
<br />
matter of forgetting almost as fast as we learn, so the set of possible
<br />
worlds would have a very dynamic structure of different streams constantly
<br />
diverging and merging.
