You guys are too fast for me! Let me try to answer to earlier messages.
<br />
<br />Hal:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One is what I mentioned earlier, that a trivial program which enumerates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and executes (in dovetailing, interleaved form) all possible programs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will create every mind in every possible situation.  This is a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; short program and hence is the most likely universe for us to live in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can try to say that this program doesn't count because it creates more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than one universe, 
</em><br />
<br />Exactly.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but as I suggested earlier this requires an objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formulation.  
</em><br />
<br />There is one.  The info content of a computable object such as a
<br />
particular universe is the size of the shortest program that computes
<br />
it and nothing else.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which programs count and which ones don't?  
</em><br />
<br />Those that compute your universe AND NOTHING ELSE.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How can we know whether a program creates a single universe or more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than one?  We need something more in the theory to solve this problem.
</em><br />
<br />No, everything is already in place.  It's basic ingredients of Kolmogorov
<br />
complexity theory.  Of course there are many UTMs whose output can be
<br />
interpreted as several different universes. E.g., the infinite computation
<br />
of Pi produces all beginnings of all universes as a side-product, because
<br />
every bitstring occurs somewhere in Pi's dyadic expansion.  This doesn't
<br />
mean much though, because the interpreter that singles out any a single
<br />
universe (and represents it as, say, a movie) requires additional
<br />
information that may not be neglected.  For example, the interpreter
<br />
may identify n bits of universe U somewhere in the output. But this will
<br />
cost additional bits beyond those in the original Pi-computing algorithm.
<br />
<br />To avoid such issues, bitstrings are represented by themselves; we do
<br />
not have to worry about additional interpreter algorithms - they are
<br />
already implicit in the original list of all possible programs.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Another problem is that the Kolmogorov measure is defined only up to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an additive constant.  Given a specific, large, program which runs on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universal TM &quot;T&quot;, we can construct a different UTM T' on which that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;program is very small.  (In essence we hard-wire the program into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;T' definition.)  This means that I can create a UTM where a magical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;flying-rabbit universe is more probable than the one we live in.
</em><br />
<br />Sure, you can build a UTM with millions of states (as opposed to the 10
<br />
states or so necessary for the smallest UTMs) to encode flying rabbits.
<br />
Even on the flying rabbit machine, however, the shortest algorithms
<br />
of almost all possible universes will have almost the same size as the
<br />
corresponding algorithms on any other UTM. That's what the invariance
<br />
theorem is about: you can create a few exceptions to the rule, but you
<br />
cannot bend the rule.
<br />
<br /><br />Chris:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;....But my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;argument still stands that the UTM is a very specific (sequence-based) way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of mapping from one n-tuple (ordered list) to another (m-tuple; m&gt;&gt;n), and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so could not be considered to provide a reliable universal measure this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way.)
</em><br />
<br />The point is that each UTM can simulate any other device for describing
<br />
universes with constant costs independent of the size of the universes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see this as a hole at all.  Maybe I'm missing something, but I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought the whole point of postulating a universal dovetailer was that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it creates &quot;everything&quot; from zero information (or as near as dammit).
</em><br />
<br />But if you want to make predictions about the future of particular
<br />
universes that's not enough. Bayes' rule for making predictions requires
<br />
a prior on particular universes.  &quot;Prior&quot; always means &quot;prior for Bayes&quot;.
<br />
You have observed the past of a given universe, what's the probability
<br />
distribution on the possible futures?
<br />
<br />P(past + future | past) = 
<br />
P(past | past + future) * P(past + future) / P (past) 
<br />
<br />The first factor is 1. P(past) is a normalizing constant. The entire thing
<br />
is proportional to P(past + future). That's where you need the prior. The
<br />
universal prior prefers complete universes &quot;past+future&quot; whose shortest
<br />
algorithms are short.  Since the shortest algorithm describing the past
<br />
of our own particular universe seems pretty short I can write in the 1997
<br />
paper: &quot;...there will be less than maximal randomness in our future, and
<br />
more than vanishing predictability.  We may hope that our universe will
<br />
remain regular, as opposed to drifting off into irregularity.&quot;
<br />
<br />Note that the anthropic principle by itself is not enough to make such
<br />
predictions.  There are many complex universes that start like ours and
<br />
then become very irregular. But U predicts ours won't. And every new
<br />
day brings a new confirmation.
<br />
<br />All of this is essentially just the old theory of inductive inference
<br />
applied to the possible universes.  I cannot really see major
<br />
conceptual problems here.
