<br />If we on this list believe that everything (or at least everything
<br />
with a self consistent definition) exists, then we must also believe
<br />
that all possible gods exist.  Be they artificial intelligences that
<br />
occur in the universal dovetailer with access to unbounded computing
<br />
power and memory, an evolved species who reaches an omega point or
<br />
technological singularity, or anything else you might imagine.  What
<br />
can we say about the personalities, behaviors and abilities of these
<br />
gods?
<br />
<br />It is said that when intelligent people disagree, it is often due to a
<br />
difference in available data.  Assuming these gods all possess
<br />
superior intellects, then they should all come to the same conclusion
<br />
when presented with the same data.  Mathematics, containing universal
<br />
truths and accessible regardless of the physical universe or
<br />
environment one finds his or her self in, might serve as a platform
<br />
for all gods to reach identical conclusions regarding everything.
<br />
<br />Perhaps they would also conclude or even prove the existence of all
<br />
else as we on the everything list believe.  If it is possible, I would
<br />
expect those gods would develop a model for consciousness, which would
<br />
likely lead to the idea that other self-aware structures in math
<br />
exist, and perceive.  Though no god would have the power to eliminate
<br />
what inevitably exists in math (thus explaining the problem of evil),
<br />
they would still be able to run simulations of their own over which
<br />
they may exercise full control.  Perhaps the gods explore reality and
<br />
the limits of consciousness by instantiating universes and the
<br />
observers they contain, but for the god to really 'know' what it is
<br />
like to be someone else, that persons memories and experiences must
<br />
somehow be merged into the mind of that god, not simply simulated
<br />
(Like Mary the color scientist).
<br />
<br />Thus whatever gods are simulating this universe (and inevitably some
<br />
explanations for our universe include a higher level simulation) then
<br />
we might be able to conclude some beliefs or properties of that god if
<br />
we assume that whatever truth we may find, the mind of God has already
<br />
come upon.
<br />
<br />This is just one narrow definition of god as a creator, yet there are
<br />
certainly others.  A monotheistic God might have to be equivalent to
<br />
the everything, as it would be the only object for which there are no
<br />
others, and would be the ultimate source of the existence of all else
<br />
including the 'lesser gods' discussed above.  We could also choose to
<br />
define God as the collection of all first person experiences, meaning
<br />
each of us is a small part of God.  Interestingly you can somewhat map
<br />
these different god definitions to the trinity from Christianity.
