<br />As Bertrand Russel said... something like... &quot;everyone quotes the
<br />
solipsism argument, but nobody actually believes it&quot;.
<br />
<br />None of a), b), c) matters. It's a completely specious misdirection
<br />
premised on the existence of an objective view which does not actually
<br />
exist. Discipline blindness at work again.
<br />
<br />That objective view is a mutually calibrated fictional device that enables
<br />
multiple consciousnesses to cooperate to construct depictions of
<br />
regularity that _any_ consciousness of the same type will be able to use
<br />
to predict the contents of consciousness (how something appears).
<br />
<br />There are 2 sorts of truth here:
<br />
<br />a) The belief in a fictional 'objective view'. This is a view that is
<br />
never had by anyone.
<br />
b) The reality of a subjective view. This is a view I know I have. The
<br />
invisibility of it to any other person is simply a situational
<br />
invisibility. I get it because I am me.
<br />
<br />This reality (b) is far more cogent than the objective view (a). At lease
<br />
ONE person really gets (b). NOBODY gets to see (a).... scientists simply
<br />
all get to act as if they did. Works great! But that's it.
<br />
<br />The solipsism argument contributes a sytemic delusion about the nature of
<br />
evidence and we don't need it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I assume that you are conscious but I don't know this
</em><br />
<br />This assumes that &quot;knowing&quot; another person is conscious purely involves
<br />
the use of phenomenal contents! The existence of any phenomenal contents
<br />
at all proves that something generates them. Process X makes them in your
<br />
head. Then you look (phenomenal contents) at the same process X in another
<br />
head....then is it more or less reasonable to
<br />
<br />(a) posit the lack of existence of phenomenal contents in the other head
<br />
is logically impossible or at least extremely unlikely given that every
<br />
other indication is in support of the hypothesis that the other person has
<br />
phenomenal content.
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />(b) posit that I can never 'know' because I can't 'see' what the other guy
<br />
sees and then use that as an excuse to deny all scientific considerations
<br />
of underlying causal mechanism?...which in effect declares the study of
<br />
consciousness as 'unscientific' because you can't 'see it', when in fact
<br />
all scientific 'objects' are never actually 'seen' (within an objective
<br />
view) at all.
<br />
<br />We scientists are not being consistent.
<br />
<br />The existence of phenomenality at all in your own head is the start,
<br />
middle and end of the story of knowing _anything_. A belief in an
<br />
non-existent objective view changes nothing of this circumstance and
<br />
should never be used to assert a belief about the nature and scope of
<br />
scientific evidence.... Believe in OBJECTIVITY... that is a real
<br />
behaviour.
<br />
<br />Do you see how this mess works? We're using a non-existent view to define
<br />
what a view is!
<br />
<br />Everyone blurts out the same set of tired old delusions. When you analyse
<br />
them they're a specious cultural mirage.
