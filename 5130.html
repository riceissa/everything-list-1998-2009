Norman and Bruno:  I myself am not defending a dualist position (body + 
<br />
soul, mind, whatever).  I am prepared to say the body is the only substance 
<br />
that exists.  That does not mean its behavior is explainable in terms of 
<br />
physics alone.
<br />
<br />Yes, I would say that whenever we think anything, our brains are doing 
<br />
something.  It may just be though -- and i think it is -- that our brains 
<br />
give us the capacity to engage in linguistic behavior that is itself 
<br />
non-physical.  Whether an idea is logical or illogical, whether it is 
<br />
relevant or off the point, whether or not an essay is disorganized -- these 
<br />
are not physical properties.  I  cannot even fathom what it would mean to 
<br />
say there is a physical state that is the irrelevance of a point.
<br />
*end quote*
<br />
<br />I don't see how anyone could seriously suggest that a physical description 
<br />
of the brain is the &quot;same thing&quot; as the subjective experience arising from 
<br />
that brain state, and I don't think that denying this alone makes one a 
<br />
dualist. My idea of a dualist is someone who claims that there is a 
<br />
mystical, non-physical something-or-other, distinct from the brain although 
<br />
perhaps residing in it, which is responsible for some or all our (more 
<br />
noble, usually) thoughts and feelings. This (implicit) belief appears to be 
<br />
surprisingly widespread among laypeople, as I have occasion to discover in 
<br />
my work talking to patients with severe psychotic illnesses, such as 
<br />
schizophrenia. They refuse to take medication because, they argue, how can 
<br />
chemical changes in the brain possibly have any bearing on their thoughts 
<br />
and feelings? &quot;I now know it was silly to believe that my family had been 
<br />
replaced by aliens, doctor, because I have thought about it rationally - not 
<br />
because of the medication they gave me in hospital. If the chemical 
<br />
imbalance in my brain comes back, as you say, it won't make me believe those 
<br />
things again because I know they aren't true. And anyway, if I did believe 
<br />
something weird, I wouldn't stop believing it just because of some 
<br />
medication&quot;. So they stop treatment, and are soon back in hospital with 
<br />
exactly the same symptoms. I have sometimes wondered whether pre-existing 
<br />
familiarity with the mind/body debate would make any difference to a 
<br />
patient's prognosis: there's a novel use for philosophy!
