<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I should first mention that I did not anticipate the conclusion that

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I reached when I did that analysis.  I did not expect to conclude that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; teleportation like this would probably not work (speaking figurately).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This was not the starting point of the analysis, but the conclusion.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but every theoretical scientist hopes ultimately to be vindicated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the experimentalists. I'm now not sure what you mean by the second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sentence in the above quote. What would you expect to find if (classical,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; destructive) teleportation of a subject in Brussels to Moscow and/or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Washington were attempted?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the third party perspective, I'd expect that we'd start with a
</em><br />
person in Brussels, and end up with people in Moscow and Washington who
<br />
each have the memories and personality of the person who is no longer
<br />
in Brussels.  The population of Earth would have increased by one.
<br />
I imagine that this is unproblematic and is simply a restatement of the
<br />
stipulated conditions of the experiment.
<br />
<br />The more interesting question to ask is whether I would submit to
<br />
this, and if so, what would I expect?  Note that this is not subject
<br />
to experimental verification.  When we have described the third party
<br />
situation, we have already said everything that experimentalists could
<br />
verify.  When those two people wake up in Moscow and Washington there
<br />
is no conceivable experiment by which we can judge whether the person
<br />
in Brussels has in some sense survived, or perhaps has done even better
<br />
than surviving.  It's not even clear what these questions mean.
<br />
<br />It was my attempt to formalize these questions which led to my analysis.
<br />
Perhaps it is best if I go back to the more formal statement of the
<br />
results, and say that the contribution of this universe to the measure
<br />
of a person who experiences surviving the teleportation and wakes up in
<br />
W or M is much less than the contribution to the measure of a person who
<br />
walks into the machine in Brussels and never experiences anything else.
<br />
At a minimum, this would make me hesitant to use the machine.
<br />
<br />Now, other philosophical considerations might still convince me to use the
<br />
machine; but it would be more like the two copies are my heirs, people
<br />
who will live on after I am gone and help to put my plans into action.
<br />
People sometimes sacrifice themselves for their children, and the argument
<br />
would be even stronger here since these are far more similar to me than
<br />
biological relations.  So even if I don't personally expect to survive
<br />
the transition I might still decide to use the machine.
