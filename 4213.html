<br />
One more point with regard to Wolfram and our list's theme.  I think
<br />
that implicit in his conception of the underlying rules of the universe
<br />
you have to assume some kind of all-universe model.  The reason is that
<br />
he does not expect our universe's program to be particularly special
<br />
or unique.  He thinks it will be relatively short, but given the kind
<br />
of computational structures that might be the basis for the universe,
<br />
the program is expected to be basically random.
<br />
<br />Every computational system has a certain percentage of its programs that
<br />
can produce interesting-looking structure, and the expectation is that
<br />
the same thing will hold for whatever computational model turns out to
<br />
most simply express the universe's program.  Whatever our program is, it
<br />
will turn out to be one of the ones that produces structure.  But these
<br />
are almost certainly a tiny percentage of the whole, based on Wolfram's
<br />
results.  And the specifics of which ones will produce structure are
<br />
very difficult to define.  Making a tiny change in a program will often
<br />
produce a completely different output, at least with the computational
<br />
systems Wolfram investigates.  The ones which produce structure are
<br />
scattered very randomly throughout the space of all possible programs.
<br />
<br />For example, among the nearest-neighbor, 2-state, 1-dimensional CAs that
<br />
Wolfram uses as his simple exemplars, there are 256 possible different
<br />
programs, which Wolfram numbers from 0 to 255.  As it turns out, only one
<br />
of them, program number 110, produces a certain kind of complex structure
<br />
that has particle-like behavior with very complex kinds of interactions.
<br />
Of all of them, this is the one which at least superficially would be
<br />
the most likely to be able to evolve life (although it's almost certainly
<br />
too simple to actually do so).
<br />
<br />But let's suppose that we learned that we lived in a universe based on
<br />
rule 110.  Why would that be?  Why, of all the 256 possible programs,
<br />
would only rule 110 exist?  Well, there are two plausible answers.
<br />
One is that someone selected rule 110, but that raises all kinds
<br />
of insurmountable problems of its own.  The other is that all of the
<br />
programs were instantiated, and then of course we turned out to live in
<br />
rule 110 because it was the only one that could sustain life.
<br />
<br />So Wolfram's approach leads very naturally to the assumption that all
<br />
possible programs are being run.  If it does turn out that our universe's
<br />
program is relatively simple but still densely packed and &quot;random&quot; among
<br />
a vast space of comparable programs, most of which would produce sterile
<br />
universes, then I think we would be forced to seriously consider that
<br />
all of the other programs were being run, too.
<br />
<br />My one concern is that if Wolfram is right and our universe is a random
<br />
program from some set, and if there are much more than on the order
<br />
of 100 bits in the program, we will never be able to find the right
<br />
program.  If the nature of the program space is similar to what Wolfram's
<br />
explorations suggest, that most of the space is unstructured and there
<br />
is no way to identify the likely fruitful programs, there will be no
<br />
way for us to know if we are on the right track or not.  We won't have
<br />
the hope of finding a program that &quot;almost works&quot; and then successively
<br />
refining it to get closer and closer, because the true program will be
<br />
completely different from an almost-true program.
<br />
<br />The situation will be something like the search for a cryptographic key,
<br />
where you can't really hope to get closer and closer until you get it.
<br />
You're stabbing totally in the dark until you fall upon the right one.
<br />
And if the search space is too large, you will never find the answer.
<br />
