</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the basis of everything is a Person, then this can make my above
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement make sense.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yes. As I said. Although perhaps from different motivation or reason.
<br />
But as you know the platonist (who believes in A V ~A) universal (who  
<br />
believes in all true Sigma_1 sentences) Lobian (who knows that)  
<br />
machine has three &quot;unique&quot; Gods available for her.
<br />
<br />- The ONE, Plato's notion of Truth, which has to be searched for, and  
<br />
which can hardly be said to be a &quot;person&quot;, at least a priori. For each  
<br />
machine such a &quot;truth&quot; is unnameable or non definable by the machine.
<br />
<br />- The INTELLIGIBLE, which splits into two (its terrestrial part,  
<br />
described respectively by G and its &quot;divine&quot; part described by G* , at  
<br />
the level of propositional logic). The terrestrial part is a sort of  
<br />
cold, objective, scientific, person. The divine part, is not so easily  
<br />
amenable to personhood. The universal machine and Plotinus agree that  
<br />
this is a difficult question!  Aristotle is very ambiguous here, imo.
<br />
<br />- The SOUL, or universal self or universal mind. It is the knower, the  
<br />
unnameable self,  (the one described by the logic S4Grz). This one is  
<br />
the closer to the notion of &quot;God as a person&quot;. Perhaps even the  
<br />
*unique* person (yet an open problem here). But it is closer to the  
<br />
eastern notion of God, than to the western notion. it is the one you  
<br />
can recognize within. The one about which Alan Watts talked about in  
<br />
most of its book, including &quot;Beyond Theology&quot;, &quot;The Book&quot;, &quot;Joyous  
<br />
Cosmology&quot;, for examples. He is the subject of first person immortality.
<br />
<br />They are dream technics which can help you to &quot;remember&quot;, by,  
<br />
curiously enough perhaps, forgetting everything else.
<br />
And there are plants which can accelerate the process (like Alan watts  
<br />
explained in &quot;Joyous cosmology&quot;). This leads to a Botanical form of  
<br />
entheogenic computationalism, where you say &quot;yes to the doctor-plant!&quot;  
<br />
Entheogen: means &quot;reveals the God within&quot;.
<br />
Actually, those who find Plotinus' way of talking a bit laborious or  
<br />
those who dislike his vocabulary, can read as well the trip reports of  
<br />
entheogenic experiences. This is especially clear with the trips made  
<br />
under Salvia Divinorum. See for example:
<br />
<a href="http://www.sagewisdom.org/experiences.html">http://www.sagewisdom.org/experiences.html</a>
<br />
Personally I have used mainly cafeine, (and sometimes other stuff) for  
<br />
helping to generate realistic-enough dream's state, when it does not  
<br />
prevent sleep altogether (!). See my chapter on Dreams in &quot;Conscience  
<br />
et Mécanisme&quot;: &quot;Le cerveau, le rêve et la réalité&quot;  if you want more  
<br />
on dreams as a mean to get &quot;altered state of consciousness&quot; for the  
<br />
purpose of illustrating the UD proof. Cafeine does not help for  
<br />
getting the amnesia, alas, but the amnesia  can be prepared by some  
<br />
yoga or meditation exercises. A minimal understanding of the notion of  
<br />
dream is of course an important prerequisite to get the sixth step of  
<br />
the UDA.
<br />
I don't recommand you to try Salvia Divinorum though, but if you do,  
<br />
verify it is legal in your country. It is illegal in Australia,  
<br />
Belgium, South Korea and in some US states.
<br />
In case you do, follow the user's manual:  The User's Guide in PDF  
<br />
format.  I could come back on this one day.
<br />
Of course the UDA pill is enough to get the things &quot;scientifically&quot;,  
<br />
that is in the modest (based on sharable theory) and communicable  
<br />
(polite) manner. But some experience with consciousness could help a  
<br />
lot, I guess.
<br />
Or (re)read directly Plato and Plotinus, or perhaps any &quot;mystic&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can we really have a scientific understanding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a person?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />It depends what you mean by &quot;scientific understanding&quot;. We never  
<br />
understand our theories, that is why we invent them. Scientific  
<br />
understanding is always reduction of set of beliefs into other set of  
<br />
beliefs. We understand only &quot;trivially&quot; the initial chosen beliefs.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This would by definition be one person having a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific understanding of their relationship to another person.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I think you are confusing two levels. We can build a theory (and  
<br />
indeed all comp theories are necessary like that) where we can, after  
<br />
choosing some axiomatic for the notion of person, explain why we  
<br />
cannot understand scientifically (by third person verifiable facts)  
<br />
the notion of person (first person).
<br />
Mechanism cannot put the &quot;mystery&quot; under the rug, it can only help us  
<br />
to contemplate it by eliminating the pseudo-mysterious marmelade, like  
<br />
Matter, Universe and other fairy tales.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, I think that this is a downfall of many relationships among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persons.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />It is what eliminative materialism leads to. At least this is in  
<br />
contradiction with Mechanism. (BTW I say Mechanism instead of  
<br />
Computationalism, just to recall we should not attach ourselves to  
<br />
words. By Mechanism, in our list context, I mean Digital Mechanism, or  
<br />
comp, like Judson Webb, or like in: Conscience et Mécanisme).  
<br />
&quot;Mechanism&quot; is also shorter, and I'm tired saying &quot;comp&quot; all the times.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The scientific understanding requires repeatability.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I don't think so. Evolution and history are not repeatable, yet can be  
<br />
approached with the scientific (modest) attitude. Remember that  
<br />
science, in which I include theology, is mainly essentially &quot;just&quot;  
<br />
that: modesty and doubts. It *has* to be such if Mechanism is correct.  
<br />
That is what my work is all about.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; goal of modern science (which is what we mean by science) is control,
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />That is engineering, or more general form of constructive science.  
<br />
Real science, I mean knowledge driven inquiry, is more on the side of  
<br />
&quot;let it go&quot;. If you try to control what is fundamental, you make it  
<br />
running away. With platonist third person science, the more you know,  
<br />
the bigger your own ignorance appears to be. Alan watts, again,  
<br />
describes very well all this in &quot;The wisdom of insecurity&quot;. That is  
<br />
why I called sometimes the second incompleteness modal formula: &quot;Dt -&gt;  
<br />
~BDt&quot;,  the &quot;Lao-Tseu, Watts, Valadier formula. It is a deep law of  
<br />
contrariety about fundamental things, like consistency, reality,  
<br />
control, security, etc. Valadier is a french Jesuit, who wrote  
<br />
impressive theologial book on that idea with respect to moral.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which requires repeatability.  Love (the mysterious force of good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship between persons) does not &quot;work&quot; within a scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; framework.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Hmmm... Perhaps in the current materialist and reductionist conception  
<br />
of &quot;science&quot;. I invite you to read Plotinus' treatise 50 on Love.
<br />
There is also an interesting thesis by Agnès Pigier (published by  
<br />
VRIN, Paris 2002): &quot;Plotin, une métaphysique de l'amour, l'amour comme  
<br />
structure du monde intelligible&quot;. For Plotinus: Love (amour) comes  
<br />
from the meeting between &quot;logos&quot; and &quot;indeterminacy&quot;.
<br />
Please, remember that mechanism and materialism are metaphysically,  
<br />
epistemologically, or even &quot;common-sensical&quot; incompatible (cf UDA).  
<br />
OK? This seems not yet well known. Ask question on UDA if residual  
<br />
doubts persist on this. I know how this can be counter-intuitive in  
<br />
the naturalistic aristotelian framework, but yet the UD Argument does  
<br />
not leave much choice here.
<br />
