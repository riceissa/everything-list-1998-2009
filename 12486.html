SP: 'Is there anything about how you are feeling to day that makes you 
<br />
sure that aliens didn't come during the night and replace your body with 
<br />
an exact copy? Because that is basically what happens naturally anyway, 
<br />
although it isn't aliens and it takes months rather than overnight: 
<br />
almost every atom in your body is replaced with another atom, put in 
<br />
roughly the same place. If the discarded atoms were kept rather than 
<br />
sloughed off, exhaled etc. you would see that your identical twin of a 
<br />
few months ago had died and no-one even noticed, because it happened 
<br />
gradually. Other than in the speed and scheduling of your death, how 
<br />
does destructive teleportation differ from normal life?'
<br />
<br />MP:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* I know, which here means 'believe with confidence', that aliens
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;didn't come because everything feels, looks, smells, etc, as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;normal. I am a creature of habit just like you and there is no
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evidence of radical differences anywhere that I can notice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* I quibble about whether atoms are replaced within DNA except as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;part of the normal processes of replication and repair. That
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aside, it is not the atoms per se which gives my identity but
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their incorporation into molecular structures, and the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incorporation of all these molecular structures holonistically
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into cells, organs, and all the rest. Our bodies are held against
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collapse smallwards by the robust durability of genetic structures
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which embody all the patterns needed to sustain our biological
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integrity against the entropy within the flow of energy and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resources through our ecological niches. Mental integrity is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintained in analogous manner by means of the robust durability
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of meme structures embodied in neural networks and whatever
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emergent super-neural structures they entail.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Destructive teleportation differs from normal life in that it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entails the [as yet unlawful] killing of a person whose body is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dismembered  in a very high resolution process during the course
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a magical ceremony, after which there soon arrives postcards
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and news from a person in a faraway place claiming to be the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deceased and wanting access to his/her money box. The police and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other authorities in that far away place, when asked and paid,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will provide evidence that the healthy body of the person who
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned up there during a magical ceremony matches the fingerprint,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DNA and polygraph signatures of the deceased. They will also
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;report that she/he is suffering from culture shock, but otherwise
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seems OK. All of these facts point to our day to day experience of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;survival being very much a social and cultural construct in which
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we believe, no more and no less.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* It therefore seems apparent that problems and conundrums raised by
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the destructive teleporter/biofax machines are based understood by
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recognising that our experience of being here now and seeming to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be the same person from day to day, indeed from moment to moment,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is what it is like to be a description of a person, although I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would say that the qualia aspect is actually what it is like to be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the updating of the description. It was ever thus.
<br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  *   Assuming that it is in principle feasible to 'copy' a person and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; either store the data obtained without deterioration or transmit the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; data without noticeable loss, then when that data is used to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reconstitute a medically and legally acceptable facsimile, the new 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; copy is NOT the original it is his/her identical twin brother or sister.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  *   In this scenario, if the original which is copied ceases to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exist at the place of copying, he/she has died. If the copying took 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; place without destruction of the original then he/she is [ceteris 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; paribus] the same person and unchanged. The legal status of the new 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; twin will be the subject of common or statute law provoked by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; invention of the new technology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  *   In a discussion with one of my son's friends just now we agreed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that the 'Star Trek' version of the teleporter is a rather odd beasty 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in which not just the information/data concerning the structure and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dynamics of a crew member's body was sent to a destination but the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; actual atoms of the body were sent also. This might seem like a tidy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sort of solution to someone who didn't want to think too deeply about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it, but the sending of the original's atoms would add an enormous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; overhead to the system, firstly the amount of energy required to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; accelerate all the particles to something close to the speed of light 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would be enormous, and secondly it would not change anything 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; significant because it is not the fact of it being those particular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; atoms which is important  but which kind of atoms and exactly where 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; should they be. So when 'Scotty' or whoever beams them up, they die 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on the planet's surface and their identical twins are created in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; spaceship.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  *   This whole scenario actually works to support the contention of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Steven Lehar that the identity of a thing includes its location and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that this fact is a reflection of how our brains work in creating the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; phenomenal reality of our experience [see
