Jesus said: &quot;I and the Father are one&quot; (Jn.10:30), therefore, is not
<br />
Jesus the same, or, &quot;co-equal&quot; in status with his Father?
<br />
Answer No.1
<br />
In Greek, `heis' means `one' numerically (masc.)
<br />
`hen' means `one' in unity or essence (neut.)
<br />
Here the word used by John is `hen' and not `heis'. The marginal notes
<br />
in New American Standard Bible (NASB) reads; one - (Lit.neuter) a
<br />
unity, or, one essence.
<br />
If one wishes to argue that the word `hen' supports their claim for
<br />
Jesus being &quot;co-equal&quot; in status with his Father, please invite his/
<br />
her attention to the following verse:
<br />
<br />Jesus said: &quot;And the glory which Thou hast given me, I have given
<br />
to them (disciples); that they may be one, just as we are one.&quot; (John
<br />
17:22).
<br />
If he/she was to consider/regard/believe the Father and Jesus Christ
<br />
to be &quot;one&quot; meaning &quot;co-equal&quot; in status on the basis of John 10:30,
<br />
then that person should also be prepared to consider/regard/believe
<br />
&quot;them&quot; - the disciples of Jesus, to be &quot;co-equal&quot; in status with the
<br />
Father and Jesus (&quot;just as we are one&quot;) in John 17:22. I have yet to
<br />
find a person that would be prepared to make the disciples (students)
<br />
&quot;co-equal&quot; in status with the Father or Jesus.
<br />
<br />The unity and accord was of the authorized divine message that
<br />
originated from the Father, received by Jesus and finally passed on to
<br />
the disciples. Jesus admitted having accomplished the work which the
<br />
Father had given him to do. (Jn.17:4)
<br />
<br />Hot Tip (precise and pertinent)
<br />
Jesus said: &quot;I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than
<br />
I.&quot; (Jn.14:28). This verse unequivocally refutes the claim by any one
<br />
for Jesus being &quot;co-equal&quot; in status with his Father.
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Question No.2
<br />
Jesus said: &quot;I am the way, ...no one comes to the Father, but through
<br />
me.&quot; (Jn.14:6), therefore, is not the Salvation through Jesus, ALONE?
<br />
Answer No.2
<br />
Before Jesus spoke these words, he said; &quot;In my Father's house are
<br />
many mansions (dwelling places); if it were not so, I would have told
<br />
you; for I go to prepare a mansion (a dwelling place) for you.&quot; (John
<br />
14:2). The above explicit statement confirms that Jesus was going to
<br />
prepare &quot;a&quot; mansion and not &quot;all&quot; the mansions in &quot;my Father's house&quot;.
<br />
Obviously, the prophets that came before him and the one to come
<br />
after, were to prepare the other mansions for their respective
<br />
followers. The prophet that came after Jesus had evidently shown the
<br />
current &quot;way&quot; to a modern mansion in the kingdom of heaven.
<br />
Besides; the verse clearly states; Jesus was the &quot;WAY&quot; to a mansion.
<br />
It is a folly to believe that Jesus (or any prophet) was the
<br />
&quot;DESTINATION&quot;.
<br />
<br />Jesus said; &quot;I am the door&quot; to find the pasture. (Jn.10:9).
<br />
A sheep that walks through the &quot;door&quot; will find the pasture.
<br />
A sheep that circles around the &quot;door&quot; will never find the pasture.
<br />
One who crosses over the &quot;way&quot; will reach the mansion. Anyone that
<br />
stops on the &quot;way&quot; and believes the &quot;way&quot; to be the end of his/her
<br />
journey, will be out in the open without any shelter and a roof.
<br />
Hot Tip (precise and pertinent)
<br />
Jesus said; &quot;Not every one that says to me; `Lord, Lord,' will enter
<br />
the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of my Father, who is
<br />
in heaven.&quot; (Mt.7:21).

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Believing in Divine Destiny is one of the pillars of faith, and, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; accordance with this belief, everything in the universe is determined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; by God, the All-Mighty. While there are countless absolute evidences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of Destiny, it may be sufficient to make some introductory remarks to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; demonstrate how important a place this pillar of faith has for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; whole of creation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The Qur'an specifically explains that everything is predetermined, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then recorded after its coming into existence, as indicated in many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; verses like,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Nor anything green or withered except it is all in a Manifest Book.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This Quranic statement is confirmed by the universe, this macro-Qur'an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the Divine Power, through its creational and operational signs like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; order, harmony, balance, forming and shaping, adornment and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distinguishing. All seeds, fruit stones, measured proportions and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; forms demonstrate that everything is pre-determined before its earthly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; existence. Each seed or fruit stone has a protective case formed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the factory of Kaf Nun[*], into which the Divine Destiny has in-built
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the life-story of a tree or plant. The Divine Power employs the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; particles according to the measure established by Divine Destiny so as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to cause the particular stone to grow miraculously into the particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; tree. This means that the future life-history of that tree is as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; though written in its seed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; While there is variety between individuals and between species, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; basic materials from which these plants and animals are formed are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; identical. The plants and animals that grow from the same constituent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; basic elements display, amid abundant diversity, such harmony and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; proportion that man cannot help but conclude that each of them has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; been individually given its particular form and measure. It is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Divine Power which gives to each its particular form according to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; measure established for it by Divine Destiny. For example, consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; how vast and innumerable a mass of inanimate particles shift, cohere,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; separate so that this seed grows into this tree or that drop of semen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; grows into that animal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Since there are the manifestations of Divine Destiny to this extent in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; visible material things, for certain, the forms with which things are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; clothed with the passing of time and the states they acquire through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; their motions are also dependent on the ordering of Divine Destiny.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Indeed, a single seed displays Destiny in two ways, one by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; demonstrating the Manifest Book (Kitabun Mubin) which is but another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; title for Divine Will and God's creational and operational laws of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universe; the other is by displaying the Manifest Record (Imamun
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Mubin), another title for Divine Knowledge and Command. If we regard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; these two as different manifestations of Divine Destiny, the former
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can be understood and referred to as 'Destiny Actual' and the latter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as 'Destiny For-mal or Theoretical'. The future full-grown form of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; tree can be understood as its Destiny Actual, whilst Destiny Formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; refers to all the stages together through which the tree has to pass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in its life, and comprehends the entire history of its life. Such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; manifestations of the Divine Destiny, so easily observed in a life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; such as that of a tree, are illustrative of how everything has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; pre-determined in a Record before its worldly existence. On the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hand, all the fruits and seeds which are signs of the Manifest Book
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (Kitabun Mubin) and the Manifest Record (Imamun Mubin), together with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all human memories which indicate the Preserved Tablet (Lawhun
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Mahfuz), prove that, as everything has been pre-recorded, its life-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; history is also recorded. The life-history of every tree, for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is recorded in each of its fruits, which is the outcome of its entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; life. The life-history of man including events occurring in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; external world is likewise recorded in his memory. Thus, the Divine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Power registers a man's deeds with the Pen of Destiny by lodging it in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; his memory so that he will be able to remember them on the Day of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Reckoning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Man should also be assured that in this world of transience and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; upheavals there are numerous 'mirrors' pertaining to eternity in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the All-Powerful and Wise One depicts and makes permanent the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; identities of mortals. There are also many tablets upon which the All-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Knowing Preserver writes down the meanings of transient beings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In short: While plants, which are the simplest and lowest level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; life, are completely de-pendent upon Divine Destiny, it is also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; evident that the life of man, which is the highest level, has also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; been minutely determined by that Destiny. Just as drops of rain are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; indicative of a cloud, and trickles of water disclose a spring, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; receipts and vouchers suggest the existence of a ledger, so fruits,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sperms, seeds, and forms are indicators of the Manifest Book and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Manifest Record.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The expression Manifest Book symbolizes the Destiny Actual, which is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; title for Divine Will and God's creational and operational laws of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universe and the physical order displayed by living creatures. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Manifest Record means the Preserved Tablet which is the book of Divine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Knowledge and symbolizes the Destiny Formal or Theoretical determining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the immaterial order and the life of the universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; To conclude: We witness that particles are in continuous movement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; during the formation of a living creature and travel to their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; destinations by complicated routes and remain there. Their movement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; results in many benefits, uses, and instances of wisdom. Evidently, an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; apparent measure is appointed for each thing by Divine Destiny. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this is so, it is also observable that even the immaterial states of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; living beings result in certain fruits. Thus, Divine Power is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; agent, and Divine Destiny is the pattern. Divine Power writes the book
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the meanings on that pattern. We see that every movement a creature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; makes in the course of its existence, and all the stages through which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it passes, are pre-determined by Divine Destiny and its whole life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; forms a harmonious unity.
</em><br />
