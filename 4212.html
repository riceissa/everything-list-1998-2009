<br />
I think there are a couple of things about Wolfram's book which aren't
<br />
well understood.
<br />
<br />Most importantly, he is not specifically commited to cellular automata.
<br />
He does focus on them, especially 1-dimensional, 2-state CAs, as a
<br />
particularly simple model of computation, which also has the property
<br />
that a relatively high percentage of randomly chosen programs produce
<br />
apparent complexity.  But he explores a number of other computational
<br />
systems, including higher dimensional and higher state CAs; mobile CAs;
<br />
Turing machines; substitution systems; sequential substitution systems;
<br />
tag systems; cyclic tag systems; register machines; symbolic systems;
<br />
arithmetic; recursive sequences; iterated maps; continuous (non-quantized)
<br />
CAs; partial differential equations; network systems; multiway systems;
<br />
constraint satisfaction systems; and higher dimension versions of many
<br />
of these.
<br />
<br />The lesson he draws is that generally, the same kinds of patterns
<br />
are seen in virtually all of these ways of expressing computation.
<br />
You see simple, constant outputs; simple repetition; chaotic patterns;
<br />
and occasionally, the mysterious &quot;structure&quot; on the edge of chaos, which
<br />
often shows tantalizing particle-like phenomena and other interesting
<br />
analogs to real-world phenomena.
<br />
<br />Where he does fall back on CAs, I don't think his point is so much
<br />
that the phenomena are based precisely on CAs, but that random, simple
<br />
algorithms when implemented in CAs often produce very similar patterns to
<br />
what we see in the real world.  And that this is probably not coincidence.
<br />
It suggests that these kinds of patterns could be considered attractors
<br />
in pattern space.  They are easier to produce than other patterns that
<br />
might seem superficially similar.  Their algorithm complexity is lower.
<br />
And this insight might inform our efforts to understand the true nature
<br />
of the phenomena which create these patterns.
<br />
<br />Where Wolfram turns to physics, his speciality, he explicitly departs
<br />
the CA model as he tries to sketch a possible mathematical basis for
<br />
the universe that is consistent with the paradoxical phenomena of QM and
<br />
relativity.  He uses network systems, hypothetical sub-quantum &quot;nodes&quot;
<br />
which are connected to one another and whose connections might change
<br />
under simple rules.  This is not completely original; I think Wheeler
<br />
and others pursued ideas similar to this back in the 70s.  Wolfram takes
<br />
it a little farther in showing how you could get some relativity-style
<br />
phenomena, but it's a very bare beginning effort.
<br />
<br />My main point is that characterizing Wolfram as saying that the universe
<br />
is a CA, or biological patterns or fluid turbulence or any other phenomena
<br />
are caused by CAs, is not correct.  He is not saying these phenomena are
<br />
caused by CAs, he is saying that extremely simple CA programs produce
<br />
similar phenomena, suggesting that such phenomena emerge spontaneously
<br />
from computational systems.
<br />
<br />As for the universe, I think his point is that the grand, mathematical
<br />
elegance of string theory and similar methods is the wrong approach.
<br />
These beautiful mathematical models are too rigid and brittle to describe
<br />
a universe like ours.  The universe is more likely to be built out of
<br />
a messy, random and simple little program that just happens to create
<br />
patterns that have the properties necessary for life to evolve.
<br />
<br />In the context of our list, this can be thought of as a philosophical
<br />
bias towards Schmidhuber and away from Tegmark.  In Tegmark's model,
<br />
string theory is relatively near the origin of the tree of mathematical
<br />
structure; it is simple.  If it produced enough particles and interactions
<br />
of the right kinds to allow for life, it would be an excellent candidate
<br />
for the place where we live.  But in Schmidhuber's model, it's just as
<br />
likely that some random hodgepodge of a program a few thousand bits in
<br />
length will &quot;just happen&quot; to produce a very robust, dynamic and varied
<br />
universe with all kinds of structure at different size scales.  Such a
<br />
universe is an inherently friendly home for life as there are so many
<br />
possible niches for it to grow.
<br />
<br />Of course, at this point we are in no position to decide between these
<br />
two philosophies.  Wolfram's book is ultimatly a call to our intuition,
<br />
an appeal for equal time to be given to Schmidhuber-ish approaches
<br />
based on random programs, as for the traditional Tegmarkian mathematical
<br />
modelling which is done in physics.  I think there is something to be
<br />
said for this shift in perspective, and I hope that at least a small
<br />
minority of researchers will attempt to move Wolfram's program forward.
