<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Great number of interesting and deep posts. I will try to comment some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now (actually I will answer only Chris), and  others later.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For exemple SLP and Hans' discussion on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is very interesting but bears on difficult questions that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I want not to dwelve into now if only because I want to think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a little more ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For a little &quot;quasi-objective&quot; theory of consciousness, look at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my (godelian) chapter 5.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Christopher Maloney (about my post to &quot;Romanos Avaqian&quot;):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Bruno, when I read your posts, I feel small!  Thanks for this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;you have swelled my reading list yet more.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't intend to make you feeling small and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am sorry if I have donne so :-(
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I feel that Romanos Avaqian's question is a very fundamental one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fair enough, Romanos' question &quot;can the subject become an object for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; himself?&quot; gives me an opportunity to give, not *my* answer but the answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any one will get from an interview of a  self-referentially correct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modulo the  &quot;theetetic definition of knowledge&quot;. (An *avant gout* of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chapter 5,  which is self-implying independant).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The anwer is no. No subject can recognize itself as an object.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure what you mean by this exactly, but I suspect that I
<br />
disagree with it.  Let me reproduce here what I recently wrote in
<br />
a reply to GSLevy:
<br />
<br />For any intelligent, information processing system, &quot;thinking about
<br />
something&quot; involves making internal models of some (perhaps external)
<br />
apparition.  The models are necessarily elided, or simplified.  
<br />
While it might be possible for an AI to know, in principle, all
<br />
of its own internal workings down to the lowest level, 
<br />
it would nevertheless be impossible for it to be able to &quot;simulate 
<br />
itself&quot;. Using a simple von Neumann description, a perfect fidelity 
<br />
self-simulation would involve emulating its own program, _and 
<br />
duplicating all of its internal data_.  The latter is obviously 
<br />
impossible.
<br />
<br />So when we're thinking about ourselves, we're just manipulating and 
<br />
mangling a model, the same as any other model of any external object
<br />
like a cat or a poem.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I should mention you can get the same answer &quot;in a self-implying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way&quot;, by using a thought experiment in which you imply yourself both in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person (subject) view and in third person view like your own duplication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought experiment (see your URL) which shows, among other things, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplicated people cannot recognize themselves in their respective doubles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (doppelgangers).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A machine can only BET that &quot;itself&quot; is an object from another machine's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (first person) point of view. Like a patient relatively to his surgeon,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalist (practionners) in front of his classical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teletransportation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine.
</em><br />
<br />I lost you here.  What do you mean that &quot;a machine can only _bet_ that
<br />
&quot;itself&quot; is an object from another machine's perspective&quot;?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This reflection is also linked to Lucas-Penrose misuse of Godel's theorem,
</em><br />
<br />This actually sheds some light on your thinking to me.  I agree that
<br />
Penrose has gotten all screwed up in applying Goedel's Incompleteness
<br />
theorem to consciousness.  This is another example (I think you all
<br />
remember a prior one for me on this list) where I encounter an otherwise 
<br />
intelligent person holding onto a concept that is utterly ridiculous.
<br />
<br />So let me see if I'm understanding this correctly.  Penrose says that
<br />
consciousness cannot be the result of computational processes because
<br />
there will always be true statements which a computational process
<br />
would find undecidable (Goedel statements for that process).  But
<br />
humans,
<br />
on the other hand, would be able to &quot;see&quot; the truth of Goedel-esque
<br />
propositions because of our amazing, non-computational intuition.  But
<br />
the counter to this argument is that:  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. if a particular human's consciousness is the result of a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computable process, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. there will be Goedel statements for that particular human, but
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. they will be of such a complexity that the human would not 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possibly be able to decide the truth or falsity without the aid
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a computer, which,  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. changes the computable process into a human+computer system,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. rendering the original statement decidable in the new system.
<br />
<br />When you say that this is related to the topic above, I think you 
<br />
must be talking about the inability of any machine to fully model
<br />
itself.  Is this right?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Benacerraf wonderfull and super-important paper (although wrong from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very beginning to the very end as Benacerraf himself recognizes): 'God,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the devil and Godel', the monist 51, 9-32, 1967.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Concerning my swelling of your reading list. I'm afraid it's only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a beginning. The mind-body problem and the everything stuff belongs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a new (not yet named) field which is at the intersection of all fields
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; !
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Christopher Maloney (to Steve Price) :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Ugh, I don't even want to *talk* about zombies.  I find the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;concept patently absurd, and in a way, ethically repugnant.  By
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that I mean that it seems to me awfully grandiose and anthro-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;centric to even presume that some other creature that exhibits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;all the traits of consciousness and thoughtfulness, could some-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;how not be conscious or thoughtful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have the same ethical aversion of the zombie notion, Chris, but ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But sometimes for logical purpose it is useful to go beyond your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feelings. As a matter of fact the notion of zombie IS very useful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in philosophy of mind, ... if only to address the &quot;consciousness&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem. I agree with Steve Price's anwer to your post here.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I replied to him offline.  We have to choose our battles,
<br />
nicht wahr?  I was just stating an opinion, and I was not trying
<br />
to be scientific one way or the other.  It's my perogative to opt
<br />
out of a debate whenever I want.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For exemple, some philosopher of mind take the zombie as an absurd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept (like you and me, indeed), SO if someone argue that a theory X
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads to the existence of zombie, she gives a kind of reductio ad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absurdum against the theory X.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As an illustration I think zombies are unavoidable for those who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defends the De Broglie-Bohm interpretation of QM. (Hint: AI and quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computing, you can help yourself with Deutsch's argument that MWI is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experimentally testable, you can find it at the Michael Clive Price FAQ
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  <a href="http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#detect">http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#detect</a>).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact those &quot;De Broglie-Bohm&quot; zombies are even incorporeal !
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They are not made with particules !
</em><br />
<br /><br />Okay, let me again try to see if I understand where you're coming
<br />
from.  This is related to your crackpot proof that &quot;not comp&quot; or
<br />
&quot;not phys-sup&quot;, correct?  You accept comp, which means that you
<br />
reject phys-sup, and De Broglie-Bohm QM, with &quot;hidden variables&quot;,
<br />
implies phys-sup?  And that would be because a hidden variables
<br />
version of QM would be deterministic, with just one &quot;branch&quot;, and
<br />
would not produce consciousness, because it does not implement
<br />
counterfactuals?
<br />
<br />If I'm on the right track here, then I'm afraid I'm diverging from
<br />
you on the phys-sup issue.  I've been thinking quite a bit about
<br />
Hal's excellent summary of the Maudlin paper.  I haven't gotten my
<br />
butt down to the library yet, but I will.  I think there's a
<br />
hole in this line of reasoning, but I can't put my finger on it
<br />
precisely yet.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nevertheless most of them acts like us, including long talk on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness and bodies, they makes love and children, and all this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without consciousness and without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bodies. And all these uncorporeal bodies and unconscious talks interfere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with our real quasi-newtonian-like unique universe, full of particules !
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Surely you were joking mister Bohm !
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is indeed my dislike of the idea of zombie which makes me sceptical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about any no-wave-packet-reduction-but-single-world interpretation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of either QM or COMP. Bohm's theory is a kind of cosmic solipsism and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;zombie&quot; are useful for making that statement clear.
</em><br />
<br />But I don't see how phys-sup implies zombies.  People who adhere to
<br />
phys-sup, I would suspect, don't think that it produces zombies.
<br />
That's just your conclusion.  And how do you justify it, from first
<br />
principles?  Even if I accept your crackpot proof (just kidding about
<br />
that, of course) why shouldn't I accept phys-sup instead of comp?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Finally, thanks for all these book recommendations.  I will 
<br />
definitely pursue this line of research.  Hell, I'm a programmer,
<br />
one would think I ought to know something about the science of
<br />
computability.  I am anxious to look over the Raymond Smullyan
<br />
books.  I know him from two short essays of his that appeared
<br />
in &quot;The Mind's I&quot;, both of which were excellent.  His writing
<br />
is lucid and imaginitive.  Very reminiscent of Jorge Luis Borges.
<br />
(Any Borges fans here?)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are a lot of excellent introductory book. You force me to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  difficult choices.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess that the best book on logic and computability, including
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the modal use in godelian provability, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Boolos G. S. and Jeffrey R. C., COMPUTABILITY AND LOGIC, 1989 (3d
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; edition),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cambridge University Press.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A classical very nice and little introduction to theoretical computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  science is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; N. J. CUTLAND, Computability, an introduction to recursive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function theory, Cambridge University Press, 1980 (repr. 1983).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A very good introductory text to mathematical Logic + Computability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is also:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MENDELSON Elliott, Introduction to Mathematical Logic, 3d ed. 1987,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wadsworth &amp; Brooks Inc..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But relatively to this list (and my thesis!), I think Boolos &amp; Jeffrey is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the best you can find.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I urge everyone interested in my chapter 5 to read Smullyan penguin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; book &quot;Forever Undecided&quot;. It is one of the best simple introduction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to &quot;self-referentially correct&quot; reasoners.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess people in this list will also appreciate a lot his &quot;the tao is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; silent&quot;  and &quot;5000 B. C&quot;. In this last book he uses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;dream&quot; concept to illustrate a relativistic approach to many-reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and immortality. It is better than Platon !
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I discover this recently. More on Smullyan later. (Without Doubt).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW, people, do you know the book by Jozef Gruska on Quantum Computing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find it very good ! Even on the philosophical level !
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Quantum Computing, McGraw-Hill, 1999).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my next post I will answer/comment to Jacques M Mallah, Devin Harris,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hal Finney,  and Wei Dai ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
