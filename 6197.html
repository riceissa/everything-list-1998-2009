<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is more or less the point I was trying to make: philosophical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion leads to &quot;a troubling entaglement that seems to lead to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contradictions&quot;. I return to what I called a definition but I should 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably have called a description of the basic phenomenon we are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussing:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A decision I make is &quot;free&quot; when I feel that I could have decided otherwise.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this OK as a starting point, before we start analysing what it all means, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and regardless of what the ultimate conclusion is going to be? I'm not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying anything controversial yet; I'm simply describing under what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circumstances I get this &quot;free will&quot; feeling, whatever that is.
</em><br />
<br />It's probably OK, but it seems a little ambiguous.  Do you mean that you
<br />
&quot;feel&quot; this in a naive way, before giving it any philosophical thought?
<br />
Or do you mean that you still feel this after considering, for example,
<br />
that you live in a deterministic and/or random universe?
<br />
<br />And worse, that if you live in a multiverse, then your choice in fact was
<br />
no choice at all and was rather the subjective experience of a splitting
<br />
of the multiverse into two parts, one part where you made one choice and
<br />
one part where you made the other?  Would you still feel that you could
<br />
have decided otherwise if this was your mental model of the universe?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, a philosopher comes along and tells me that in fact, I am mistaken. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could not actually have decided otherwise, because my brain was following a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; script predetermined by the laws of physics. Or, just as bad, I could have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;decided&quot; otherwise, but it would have been due to random events in my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain, and thus it have no more been my &quot;decision&quot; than if I had been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enslaved to the outcome of a coin toss.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First, I might point out that the philosopher is putting words in my mouth. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I never claimed that my cerebral decision-making processes were not random 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or not deterministic. All I claimed was that I get the free will feeling 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when I *feel* I could have decided otherwise. I may not know much about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics or philosophy, but I certainly know how I feel! If I learn that my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain is actually based on an old poker machine, that is interesting, but I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still feel the way I feel.
</em><br />
<br />Doesn't this require a degree of cognitive inconsistency or dissonance,
<br />
in which you must separate your knowledge of the nature of reality from
<br />
your instinctive feelings about your behavior?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand, I might aknowledge that my feeling of freedom is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually consistent with the particular interpretation of the term &quot;freedom&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the philosopher is trying to foist on me. In other words, if &quot;freedom&quot; means 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;not bound by determinism or randomness&quot;, then I could not possibly be free, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply because there is no third alternative to determinism or randomness! 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this case, I would have to admit that my &quot;free will&quot; feeling is something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quite peculiar, with no correlate in the real world. Fine: let's say this is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what it is. My subjective experience of free will remains unchanged, my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour remains unchanged, and my attitude towards other people (also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exercising this strange, non-free, non-random, non-deterministic free will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing) remains unchanged.
</em><br />
<br />I guess I'm having trouble understanding this subjective experience
<br />
of free will.  It seems to require a somewhat sophisticated degree of
<br />
self-modelling and self-understanding, in order to model the concept
<br />
that your mind could have behaved differently and made a different
<br />
choice.  Yet it is blind to other physical realities.  Aren't you just
<br />
lying to yourself?  Or do you really have this &quot;feeling&quot; as a direct,
<br />
pre-rational self-perception, like the experience of redness or of pain?
<br />
I'm not sure I have any such feeling, but perhaps I have internalized
<br />
the philosophical arguments so much that they have contaminated this
<br />
&quot;pure&quot; self-perception that you describe.
<br />
