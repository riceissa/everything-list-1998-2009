<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The 'great programmer' could have the intelligence and consciousness of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amoeba. And why bother talking about him if he's not needed - Ockam would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not approve.
</em><br />
<br />Ah, getting rigorous, eh?  That's okay, I don't mind.
<br />
<br />I have no problem with the notion of there being no &quot;THE&quot; great programmer.
<br />
This is one of the points Jürgen makes in his paper, that there isn't just
<br />
one;  any of us can imagine numerous ways of enumerating all possible finite
<br />
programs, and can also imagine a variety of abstract computational systems
<br />
to &quot;run&quot; such programs on, so we can all be the same &quot;great programmer&quot;,
<br />
potentially at least.  (One could argue that if we only imagine programs
<br />
that we will never possess hardware capable of running, we shouldn't be
<br />
labeled &quot;programmers&quot;, but let's not get personal.)
<br />
<br />Of course, we don't really have to refer to such ideas as &quot;great
<br />
programmer&quot;, but nonetheless, if you accept Jürgen's starting assumptions
<br />
and his arguments, his paper concludes that such programmers exist, so is it
<br />
really necessary that we avoid talking about them?  After all, the paper is
<br />
about Life, the Universe, and EVERYTHING.
<br />
<br />We have all seen examples of papers (or letters or statements to the lay
<br />
press or whatever) that refer to The Great Programmer or to God or some such
<br />
concept, written by serious people who are perfectly aware that such
<br />
concepts may be unnecessary to the essential ideas in the work, and who are
<br />
quite possibly atheists anyway.  There are lots of reasons why people do
<br />
this.  Probably some people do it because a work that refers to universes
<br />
that don't require a God will immediately turn off certain readers who might
<br />
have something to gain from reading such a work (a defensive strategy).
<br />
Perhaps some people do it because they have deeply held beliefs of their
<br />
own, and are as yet uncertain how these beliefs tie in with the results of
<br />
their research.  I think some people do it because anthropomorphizing can
<br />
make a paper less abstract and impersonal, and more accessible to a wider
<br />
audience.  And for many, I think it's just an In Joke.  (Why Jürgen did it,
<br />
I cannot say, I don't know what he believes.)
<br />
<br />When I read such things, I take it as an In Joke, and enjoy the humor.  I
<br />
have no difficulty mentally stripping the anthropomorphization out, to get
<br />
at the meat of the paper.  Some people may not find such humor to their
<br />
taste, and they are welcome to write with utter rigor (somebody's got to do
<br />
it).  But I think it's important that somebody writes with humor too.
<br />
<br />One thing I have noticed lately is that a number of rather high concepts are
<br />
starting to get exposure in non-specialist publications (and on the Web.)
<br />
More and more, the educated lay public is being exposed to things like
<br />
Many-Worlds and Fisher information and all manner of bizarre quantum
<br />
mechanical stuff.  Some of these ideas don't fit well with many traditional
<br />
beliefs, so there is a frightening aspect to all this.  The fact that nobody
<br />
can really prove much of anything (&quot;these are all just 'theories'&quot;) is
<br />
comforting to some, but the more serious people get about Theories of
<br />
Everything and such, the more important it becomes that people hang on to
<br />
their sense of humor.  So Jürgen did provide a service by writing his paper
<br />
that way, in some sense.  But whether people anthropomorphize or not doesn't
<br />
necessarily affect the underlying ideas in their work, and I don't mind
<br />
either way.
<br />
<br />Personally, I enjoyed Jürgen's paper immensely.  Whether it has anything to
<br />
do with the world we actually live in, I cannot say, but to this casual
<br />
observer it vaguely looks like it (or something like it) might be another
<br />
elegant, simple, parsimonious piece of that big Puzzle we're all wondering
<br />
about.  As to whether Ockham would approve, I have no idea, I suspect he
<br />
might be as confused as I am.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The great program (Juergen, please correct me) looks something like LET
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A=A+1 GOTO START.  Any ideas on how a program runs when you don't have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flow of time, but a static block universe?
</em><br />
<br />If there is no flow of time, then there's no present tense, and phrases like
<br />
&quot;how a program runs&quot; have no meaning to me...  ;-&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Subject:	RE: delayed reply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; While it's true that you don't NEED infinite chains of Great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Programmers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; they happen anyway.  Since all possible worlds exist, then all possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; programmers exist, and all possible (finite) programs will eventually be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; written by them given sufficient time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And they don't necessarily have to be great programmers.  Obviously, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; vast majority of the infinite collection of programs that are written
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; these infinite worlds will be buggy, ill-behaved, or even ill advised,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; resulting in many worlds containing no self-aware-substructures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at all, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; perhaps even lawyers and politicians.  But an infinite number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of them will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; give rise to things like chocolate and love, and even more programmers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; capable of great programs.  (Actually, I just thought of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Great Program,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but alas the margins of this message are too small to contain it.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course, even the greatest of these great programs may not be fully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; appreciated by their authors, who generally only have time to observe a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; small portion of their output bitstrings.  How many times throughout the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; multiverse has a careless slip of the hand sent a blast of particularly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; strong caffeinated beverage (or a particularly hot cup of tea) cascading
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; into the mechanism, prematurely terminating one of the greatest of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Programs?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Fortunately for us, there are lots of worlds where the program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; aborted.  For any given Great Program, there ought to be a very large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of worlds wherein that particular program is written, and in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some of them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that program may have the opportunity to run long enough to give rise to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; beautifully complex worlds, which give rise to even more programmers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; writing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; more programs that define even more worlds, and on and on, until someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; writes that original program again.  And of course it doesn't stop there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (and it definitely doesn't start there either).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So for any given world, there are a large number of programmers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; collection of worlds who can justifiably take credit for writing it, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; also no credit at all, since there is also a large collection of worlds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; containing mindless automatons busily enumerating all possible programs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Seems to me there may be somewhere in all this a proof of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; non-existence of God, depending on which God Model one subscribes to (if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any).  Perhaps a proof of the existence of the immortal soul can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; glimpsed.  Of course, all this is impossible.  But then, I long ago
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reconciled myself to the notion of living in a world of measure zero.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Gotta go, the water is boiling and my teacup awaits.
