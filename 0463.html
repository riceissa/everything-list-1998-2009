<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;...In all your thought experiment you seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;assume that it is possible to reproduce *exactly* the behaviour of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;physical system (the brain) with some detailed computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[Bruno]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is indeed my working hypothesis. To be precise I suppose there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;level of description of myself such that I survive through a digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;substitution made at that level. I don't care if the level corresponds to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the quantum state of the entire cosmos or just the local concentration of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;neurone's neurotransmettor ...
</em><br />
<br />...
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Indeed, but this is true even for an appendicite operation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I mean that, BY DEFINITION, if COMP is correct, and if the level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;substitution is correct then I will come back from the hospital with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same feeling of someone coming back after a succesfull operation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course it is an event in my life, and my life will diverge from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible life I would have had having not go to the hospital.
</em><br />
<br />I think my concerns start right there. What's the meaning of &quot;I survived
<br />
through a digital substitution?&quot; As you said yourself, the question of
<br />
identity is subjective. It works well in our world because we have no way
<br />
to do this kind of operation. As you say yourself, it would be impossible
<br />
to decide whether the survival is true or not if such substitutions would
<br />
be feasible.
<br />
<br />I'll try to put it in other words. Suppose that the progress of technique
<br />
has made this kind of operation feasible. Now assume that you are a judge
<br />
and that somebody complains after such an operation, because he thinks that
<br />
the substitution has been missed. Could you give an objective criterium to
<br />
decide if this complaint is founded? Sure not. This man would probably have
<br />
changed compared to before his operation, but it can be attributed to
<br />
normal psychological consequences of what happened. The surgeon (computer
<br />
scientist ?) could argue he had well done the job, but this cannot be
<br />
proved. Note that it is impossible that the patient feel different : he
<br />
can't remember his former state, so he has no way to test if he has
<br />
&quot;really&quot; changed. His complaint could only be founded by qualitative,
<br />
exterior measurements maybe from his relatives, who have their own
<br />
subjectivity.  So what to decide? (I guess that if such operation became
<br />
feasible, there would be indeed a lot of such trials, especially in US!)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;I try here to precize the nature of the differences between our points of
<br />
view. You seem to admit that this property (COMP) could be true without
<br />
being provable, like some mathematical propositions. What I think (that's
<br />
probably why you describe me as a physicalist!) is that assertions about
<br />
the real world (including, but not only, comp!) are neither provable, nor
<br />
true in a mathematical sense. They are all approximations applied to human
<br />
categories, that do not describe &quot;exactly&quot; the reality. So in fact (I guess
<br />
that I am just telling what Kant said two centuries ago, although my
<br />
philosophical formation is rather limited!)) any &quot;ontological&quot; or
<br />
&quot;metaphysical&quot; theory (like that of big programmer!) is useless.
<br />
Propositions about the world are worthwhile (and for me deserve the world
<br />
&quot;explanation&quot;) only if they relate together some apparent features of the
<br />
world with sufficient accuracy and predictive power. We are free to define
<br />
our categories accordingly. I do not take the Universe for granted. I think
<br />
our discourse about the world is subjective and that any proposition about
<br />
its real nature (I put in this category God, the Big programmer or N !) is
<br />
desperately devoid of usefulness, because not testable and not falsifiable.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;So for me &quot;COMP&quot; is neither true not false : you have to better define its
<br />
operational sense to see &quot;how far&quot; it is true. I recognize that your
<br />
reasoning is true if you admit that something like COMP can be (really)
<br />
true.
<br />
<br />However I do not know any example where ontological reflexions have allowed
<br />
to make anything real. Furthermore we may have different &quot;epistemological&quot;
<br />
points of view.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;For example a very important step would be to succeed in building
<br />
&quot;thinking machines&quot;, say like Turing, machines which you could discuss
<br />
with. I think this step is feasible. What I think is that they will never
<br />
be used to &quot;replace&quot; somebody, first because it is tremendously more
<br />
complicated to duplicate (and as I tried to convince you, impossible to
<br />
duplicate *exactly*) a highly organized system that to let a simple one
<br />
self-organize (what nature has made for all of us), and second because it
<br />
will raise so difficult questions about identity that we would promptly
<br />
abandon this way! So most probably such machines would be like a new,
<br />
artificial (living??) species with its own individuals, all different from
<br />
each others (because I think that consciousness can exist only with a
<br />
personal history) and of course from us. This is hopefully a testable
<br />
prediction!
<br />
<br />In all case I am very happy to have this kind of discussion with you; even
<br />
if I don't share all you premises, it helps me a lot to clarify these
<br />
issues, including my own positions!
<br />
Cheers
<br />
<br />Gilles
