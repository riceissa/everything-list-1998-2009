Wei Dai's first paradox was as follows:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; At time 0 the experiment starts. At time 1 a coin is flipped and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result observed by the experimenter. At time 2 a second coin is flipped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the result observed by the experimenter. At time 3 the experimenter is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplicated if and only if both coins show heads. Now suppose the coins are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fair so that the experimenter would predict at time 0 that at time 1 he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will observe heads with probability 1/2. Applying Tegmark's method, he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would also predict that at time 3 he will observe two heads with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability 2/5. But suppose he has already observed heads at time 1, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he would predict that with probability 2/3 he will observe another head at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time 3. So he is left with the following beliefs at time 0:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. At time 1 I will observe heads with probability 1/2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. If I observe heads at time 1, I will observe another head at time 3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with probability 2/3.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. I will observe two heads at time 3 with probability 2/5.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But these three statements contradict each other since 1 and 2 together
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3a. I will observe two heads at time 3 with probability 1/3.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know what to make of this... anyone have any ideas?
</em><br />
<br />Here are some comments:
<br />
1.
<br />
I think premiss 1is false. In order to see this, we have to consider 
<br />
observer-moments, rather than persons. Let's assume the world is 
<br />
empty except for the things refered to in the paradox. Then, finding 
<br />
that your present observer-moment is at time 0 gives you reason 
<br />
(because of Bayes' theorem) to prefer a hypothesis according to which 
<br />
a larger fraction of all observer-moments are at time 0 to a 
<br />
hypothesis according to which a smaller fraction of all 
<br />
observer-moments are at that time. In the present example, that means 
<br />
that finding yourself at t=0, you should conclude that the chance 
<br />
that both coins will land heads is less than 1/4. This also means 
<br />
that the chance of the first coin landing heads is less than 1/2.
<br />
<br />If the world cointains a lot of other observes (outsiders), then the 
<br />
very fact that your present observer-moment is in this experiment in 
<br />
the first place indicates that the experiment contains many 
<br />
observer-moments, i.e. that the chance of both coins landing heads is 
<br />
greater than 1/4. If you then in addition find that your present 
<br />
obserever-moment is at time 0, then that gives you reason (as 
<br />
explained above) to adjust your probability estimate of getting two 
<br />
heads downwards again. (As the number of outsiders (observer-moments 
<br />
outside the experiment) goes to infinity, I think you will end up 
<br />
with a probability asymptotically approaching the one you have 
<br />
assumed.
<br />
<br />2.
<br />
Your paradox can be simplified to only one coin toss.
<br />
<br />3.
<br />
If all branches exist (if there is one real world in which the coins 
<br />
both land heads, and other real worlds in which they land the other 
<br />
ways) then I might say the following: If I find myself at time 1 and 
<br />
observing tails, there is a greater than zero chance that I will find 
<br />
myself later at time 3 observing two heads! For there will be future 
<br />
observer-moments observing two heads and other future 
<br />
observer-moments observing at least one tail, and there doesn't seem 
<br />
to be any fact of the matter as to which one of these 
<br />
observer-moments is &quot;really&quot; the future me. I think this might be the 
<br />
solution to the paradox. It is, metaphorically speaking, possible for 
<br />
&quot;me&quot; to jump from one branch to another, since there is no fact of 
<br />
the matter as to which which of the several future me:s I should say 
<br />
is the true continuation of my present me.
<br />
<br />(If only one branch exists, then I would reject premiss 3.)
