Hi James,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But surely, then, Bruno, you also wonder about the issue of whether we will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ever experience death.
</em><br />
<br />Well ... I do thing that nobody experience (absolute, first  person) 
<br />
death. Because either we survive clinical (3d person) death, in which 
<br />
case we do not experience death, or we don't survive clinical death, in 
<br />
which case we do not experience death because to make an experience you 
<br />
must survive it ! (Disappointing answer I guess, it doesn't depend on MWI 
<br />
or Mechanism). Topologically, time-life is open, we cannot experience the 
<br />
border of life.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I reiterate what I discussed with Max above: no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;matter how 'dirty the tunnel', there will always be subsequent branches in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which your brain regenerates fully. Can you shed any light on this issue?
</em><br />
<br />OK James, I can try. As Hal Finney put it, it is a question of 
<br />
(conditionnal) measure. Suppose you jump out of the window which is just 
<br />
5 meter high. In that case, the probability you will survive is rather 
<br />
high. The probability you will be wounded will be rather high too. 
<br />
Nevertheless, the probability you will recover is not very high. I mean 
<br />
it is just a classical probability.
<br />
The problem with the &quot;dirty tunnel&quot; is the fact that you survive in bad 
<br />
shape. And once you have survived, probabilities are classical. And, 
<br />
although you are right in saying that there will be subsequent branching 
<br />
in which you will recover fully, you cannot take that into account 
<br />
because your expectation for that personnal recovering  is very low.
<br />
... Unless you reiterate the quantum suicide. But here, the problem is 
<br />
that you are taking the risk to find yourself in a so bad shape that you 
<br />
will not be able to reiterate the suicide. In that case, you will be 
<br />
stuck (for example  paralysed) in a universe, perhaps for a very long 
<br />
time.
<br />
For the long run you are surely (with Mechanism or with MWI) making a 
<br />
point.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Another point - committing suicide is always going to be against your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;genetic program as your genes act as if they wanted their structure to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appear in as many universes as possible.  Form their point of view it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;better to have you arbitrarily unhappy but existing than to have you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;decompose.
</em><br />
<br />I think it is plausible that in most futurs the genes will lose the 
<br />
battle against other form of memes. We can hope that earth will at least 
<br />
be used as a kind of carbon-life and genes museum. But most practical 
<br />
computationnalist will explore the multiverse by exchanging their 
<br />
expensive carbon based body for radio-waves and silicon hardware. From 
<br />
OUR point of view it is better to be happy without genes than unhappy 
<br />
with genes ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno, please e-mail your PhD thesis ASAP! I am due to start a PhD in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophy of quantum physics next year - developing the idea that in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;block universe everything possible exists, so mechanism is one valid way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;looking at things but not the only - and would be very interested to see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what you have written.
</em><br />
<br />I am indeed convinced that mechanism is not the only way to look at 
<br />
things. The beauty of mechanism is that with mechanism, it is even 
<br />
necessarily so. I mean mechanism entails the consistency of 
<br />
non-mechanism. A little like the fact that consistency of arithmetic 
<br />
entails the consistency of the non consistency of arithmetic ( a form of 
<br />
second Godel's theorem).
<br />
<br />I have put the thesis on my web page. You can load it at
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/marchal">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/marchal</a>
<br />
<br />The file is pdf. I am not sure all figures will be nicely printed. The 
<br />
web pages has been created yesterday.
<br />
Sorry but I have been obliged to write the thesis in french (with the 
<br />
&quot;loi Toubon&quot;).
<br />
The thesis (a new version of it) will be published by Grasset in France.
<br />
English papers will be available on my page ASAP.
<br />
Thanks for your interest.
<br />
<br />Bruno
