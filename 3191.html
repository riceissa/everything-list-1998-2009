<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;On the other hand I can't see how FIN is supposed to work, either. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*think* the argument runs something like this...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Even if you have just had, say, an atom bomb dropped on you, there's still 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;SOME outcomes of the schrodinger wave equation which just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happen to lead to you suriviving the explosion. Although these are VERY 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unlikely - less likely than, say, my computer turning into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bowl of petunias - they do exist, and (given the MWI) they occur somewhere 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the multiverse. For some reason I can't work out, all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the copies who are killed by the bomb don't count. Only the very very very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(etc) small proportion who miraculously survive do, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these are the only ones you personally experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is that a reasonable description of FIN? Ignoring statistical arguments, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what is wrong with it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Charles
</em><br />
<br />What does FIN stand for, anyway? Is it just another version of the quantum 
<br />
theory of immortality? Anyway, the idea behind the QTI is not just that we 
<br />
arbitrarily decide copies who die &quot;don't count,&quot; rather it has to do with 
<br />
some supplemental assumptions about the &quot;laws&quot; governing first-person 
<br />
experience, namely:
<br />
<br />1. Continuity of consciousness is real (see my recent post on this)
<br />
<br />2. Continuity of consciousness does not depend on spatial or temporal 
<br />
continuity, only on some kind of &quot;pattern continuity&quot; between different 
<br />
observer moments.
<br />
<br />I won't try to explain #1 any more for now, but I'll try explaining #2 
<br />
(Bruno Marchal is much better at this sort of thing). Basically, you want to 
<br />
imagine something like a star trek transporter, which disassembles me at one 
<br />
location and reassembles me at another. Will this mean that the original 
<br />
version of me &quot;died&quot; and that a doppelganger with false memories was created 
<br />
in his place? If computationalism/functionalism is true, it would seem the 
<br />
answer is no--who &quot;I&quot; am is a function of my pattern, not the particular 
<br />
particles I'm made of, so as long as the pattern is preserved my continuity 
<br />
of consciousness will be too (and after all, the molecules of my body all 
<br />
end up being totally replaced by new ones every few years anyway). But if 
<br />
this is true, the spatial/temporal separation of the two transporter 
<br />
chambers shouldn't matter--the imaging chamber could be on 21st century 
<br />
earth and the replication chamber in the Andromeda Galaxy in the year 5000, 
<br />
and I would still have a continuous experience of stepping into the imaging 
<br />
chamber and instantaneously finding myself in the replication chamber, 
<br />
wherever/whenever that may be.
<br />
<br />A naturally corrolary of this is that my stream of consciousness can be 
<br />
&quot;split&quot;--if there are two replication chambers which create copies of me 
<br />
just as I was when I stepped into the imaging chamber, then &quot;I&quot; before the 
<br />
experiment could experience becoming either of the two copies. All other 
<br />
things being equal, it seems reasonable to assume the chances of 
<br />
experiencing becoming one copy vs. the other are 50/50. But now suppose we 
<br />
do a similar duplication experiment, except we forget to plug in the second 
<br />
replication chamber, so only one &quot;copy&quot; is created. Should I assume that I 
<br />
have a 50% chance of becoming the real copy and a 50% chance of &quot;finding 
<br />
myself&quot; in an empty chamber, and thus being &quot;dead?&quot; That doesn't seem to 
<br />
make sense--after all, a duplication experiment where one chamber fails to 
<br />
create a copy is just like a standard Star-Trek-style transporter, and I 
<br />
assume that in that case I have a 100% chance of finding myself as the 
<br />
single &quot;copy.&quot; But it's easy to imagine extending this--suppose instead of 
<br />
failing to replicate anything, the second chamber replicates a copy of my 
<br />
body with the brain totally scrambled, so that the body dies pretty rapidly. 
<br />
Do I have a 50% chance of dying in this experiment because I become the copy 
<br />
with the scrambled brain? If only &quot;pattern continuity&quot; is important, the 
<br />
fact that this copy has a body which resembles mine shouldn't matter, its 
<br />
brain-pattern doesn't resemble mine in any way so there's no reason I should 
<br />
become that copy.
<br />
<br />It's not too hard to see how all this would be analogous to what would be 
<br />
happening all the time in a MWI-style multiverse. Why should I &quot;become&quot; 
<br />
those copies of me who experience death in various possible histories? There 
<br />
shouldn't be any more danger of that than there is of me suddenly &quot;becoming&quot; 
<br />
the dead body of a complete stranger, or of finding myself in a universe 
<br />
where I was never born in the first place and being &quot;dead&quot; for that reason. 
<br />
So, that's the basic argument for &quot;quantum immortality.&quot; The catch is in 
<br />
defining exactly what &quot;pattern continuity&quot; here means--what if a copy is 
<br />
replicated that's basically the same as me but with a few neurons scrambled, 
<br />
for example? Something like that happens every time I have a new experience, 
<br />
so it shouldn't make too much of a difference. But it's possible to imagine 
<br />
a continuum of cases where the pattern is more and more altered, until 
<br />
eventually the guy who comes out the other side is a totally different 
<br />
person from me, so presumably I don't have a significant chance of 
<br />
&quot;becoming&quot; him (although the probability of this might not be zero, either). 
<br />
I think questions like these show the need for some kind of &quot;theory of 
<br />
consciousness&quot; to quantify this stuff and give a specific conditional 
<br />
probability distribution for transitions from one observer-moment to 
<br />
another. I am sure others on this list would have very different opinions 
<br />
about what these thought-experiments show, though--some, like Jaques Mallah, 
<br />
might consider them a reductio ad absurdum of the whole concept of 
<br />
&quot;continuity of consciousness.&quot;
<br />
