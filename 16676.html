</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmm ... It is more a degree of self-reflexivity, or a degree of  
<br />
introspective ability. RA, although universal (in the Church Turing  
<br />
thesis sense) is a *very* weak theorem prover. RA is quite limited in  
<br />
its introspection abilities. I am open to the idea that RA could be  
<br />
conscious, but the interview does not lead to a theory of consciousness.
<br />
It is not a lobian machine like PA (= RA + induction). Lobianity  
<br />
begins with weaker theory than PA though, somewhere between RA and PA,  
<br />
and Lobianity is persistant, it concerns all sound extensions of PA,  
<br />
even hyperturing extension actually.
<br />
<br />Also, I don't think I have a theory. I work in a very old theory:  
<br />
mechanism. It is not mine, and I use it because it makes possible to  
<br />
use computer science to prove things. Enough things to show mechanism  
<br />
empirically refutable.
<br />
For AUDA you need to accept the Theatetical approach to knowledge, all  
<br />
right.
<br />
<br />I recall that in Smullyan &quot;Forever Undecided&quot;, which introduces to the  
<br />
logic of self-reference G, a nice hierarchy of reasoners is displayed  
<br />
up to the Lobian machine.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  To
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider another view, for example, John McCarthy thinks there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; degrees of consciousness marked by having narratives created and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remembered and meta-narratives.  Either of these ideas is definite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough that they could actually be implemented (in contrast to many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical ideas about consciousness).
</em><br />
<br />It is not bad. PA has the meta-narrative ability, and RA lacks it. You  
<br />
can see this in that way.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have some reservation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about your idea because I know many people that I think are conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but who couldn't prove even the simplest theorem in PA.
</em><br />
<br />Because they lack the familiarity with the notations, or they have  
<br />
some math trauma, or because they are impatient or not interested. But  
<br />
all human beings, if you motivate them and give them time, can prove  
<br />
all theorems of PA, and, more importantly believe the truth of those  
<br />
theorems.
<br />
<br />I have to add this last close, because even RA can prove all theorems  
<br />
of PA, given that RA is turing universal. But RA, without becoming PA,  
<br />
cannot really understand the proofs, like the guy in the chinese room  
<br />
can talk chinese, yet cannot understand its talk. It is the place  
<br />
where people easily make a confusion of level similar to Searle  
<br />
confusion (described by Dennett and Hofstadter). I can simulate  
<br />
Einstein's brain, but this does not make me Einstein. On the contrary  
<br />
this makes possible to discuss with Einstein. It is in that sense that  
<br />
RA can simulate PA without becoming PA. Likewise, all theories can  
<br />
simulate all effective theories. PA is probably still very simple  
<br />
compared to any human, except highly mentally disabled person or  
<br />
person in comatose state of course.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are we to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suppose they just have a qualitatively different kind of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness?
</em><br />
<br />I don't think so, but in the entheogen forums people can discuss at  
<br />
infinitum if under such or such plants people experience a  
<br />
qualitatively different kind of consciousness. Given the hardness to  
<br />
just discuss on consciousness you can understand that this is a bit of  
<br />
a premature question.
<br />
<br />Many estimate that to be conscious is always to be conscious of some  
<br />
qualia. In that case I could argue that even &quot;me today&quot; has already a  
<br />
qualitatively different kind of consciousness compared with &quot;me  
<br />
yesterday&quot;.  Now, my opinion (which plays no role in the UDA- 
<br />
reasoning) is that consciousness can be qualia independent, and is  
<br />
something qualitatively stable, as opposed to the content of  
<br />
consciousness, which can vary a lot.
<br />
<br />Now, if you compare RA (non lobian) and PA (lobian), then it is far  
<br />
more possible that they have a different kind of consciousness, and  
<br />
even lives in a different kind of physics, as a consequence. RA could  
<br />
be closer to a &quot;universal consciousness notion&quot;. It would mean that PA  
<br />
could already be under some illusions ...
<br />
I don't know. Real hard questions here.
