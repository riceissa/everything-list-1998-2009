<br /><br />All what I say is that IF we assume the Comp Hypothesis then there is

no choice in the matter.
<br />
I have already done the Herculean effort under the UDA. I don't think 
<br />
there is problem with that. Even in this list, if you look carefully, 
<br />
critics always converge toward a critics of COMP, not of the reasoning. 
<br />
I would say in the average 50% of those who really doesn't like the 
<br />
idea of the reversal Physics/psycho-bio-theo-logy-number-theory will 
<br />
criticize the &quot;yes&quot; doctor or the Arithmetical realism (until they see 
<br />
what I mean by it). I have never met a critics of Church thesis, except 
<br />
the physicalist reinterpretation done by David Deutsch (which does not 
<br />
work).
<br />
<br />Let me quote Danny who send this message sometime ago, + an answer I 
<br />
wrote at that time but never send, and which can give clue why the 
<br />
reversal will ndeed take time to be swallowed. In one word: it is just 
<br />
that theology is a taboo field since the Roman made theology reserved 
<br />
for political purposes. Dogmatic Materialist and Atheist has always 
<br />
benefit of this by an apparent reaction which really goes in the same 
<br />
Aristotelian direction.

<br />An old attempt toward an answer:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
Let us go back at the eve of humanity ...
<br />
<br />Since humans are humans, mainly two very opposite ways to handle 
<br />
fundamental questions has been developed. Note that ten thousand 
<br />
intermediate positions between those two ways exists.
<br />
<br />Those two ways are:
<br />
<br />1) Close your eyes, and think.
<br />
2) Open your eyes, and think.
<br />
<br />We could call the first way the mystical way, and the second the 
<br />
empirical way. Unfortunately today we are living with some prejudices, 
<br />
and many &quot;scientist&quot; would say that the mystical way are unscientific 
<br />
and that only the empirical way would be scientific.
<br />
Personally I doubt very much that such a separation should be done 
<br />
there. Empirist can be as irrational as some mystics can be. And 
<br />
history tells us that mysticism can lead to rationalism. Indeed,  in 
<br />
our civilization mystical rationalism has lead to about one millenium 
<br />
of *rational* mysticism or rational theology from Pythagoras to 
<br />
Proclus: it can be called &quot;platonism&quot;. The main gift of that rational 
<br />
mysticism (platonism) has been the *science* of mathematics (as opposed 
<br />
as its art and technic which Pythagoras knew by its many travels in the 
<br />
east and south).
<br />
Today &quot;1)&quot; is close to the theoretical minded mind, and &quot;2)&quot; is close 
<br />
to the experimentalist minded mind, and I don't think it would be an 
<br />
exaggeration to say everybody believes science has developed through a 
<br />
perpetuating back and forth between both theories and experimentations.
<br />
And a darwinist could add that we have now empirical reasons to believe 
<br />
that such a back and forth between theory/representation and 
<br />
experiment/practice has begun well before humanity. Our evolved genome 
<br />
and brain is already reflecting the presence of build-in &quot;theories&quot; 
<br />
(innate ideas) an trials.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, although locally &quot;1)&quot; and &quot;2)&quot; are both necessary for 
<br />
surviving, it seems to me that at a deeper level, with respect to the 
<br />
fundamental inquiries, the difference between &quot;1)&quot; and &quot;2)&quot; cannot been 
<br />
neglected. The difference culminated through the work of Plato and 
<br />
Aristotle with their very different conceptions of reality.
<br />
<br />For Plato (and many eastern researchers) , grosso modo, reality should 
<br />
explain what we see without taking it for granted. In particular matter 
<br />
and nature are considered as the border, or the shadow, of a deeper 
<br />
reality, which we can guess by math and reason. This lead to a 
<br />
counter-intuitive notion of reality generally conceived as being out of 
<br />
time and space.
<br />
For Aristotle, what we see and measure is part of reality, if not the 
<br />
whole of the &quot;scientific&quot; reality. This leads to the (successful) 
<br />
*intuitive* idea of natural reality and its separation from metaphysics 
<br />
and theology. The popular success can be explained by the fact that 
<br />
such a notion of reality does not hurt common sense (the cat already 
<br />
believes in the reality of the mouse), but also by the fact that such a 
<br />
notion of reality will make it possible to separate theology (in the 
<br />
one millenium greek sense;  the Greeks were just searching *everything* 
<br />
theory avant-la-lettre) and natural science (information compressing of 
<br />
taxonomical observation). The separation between theology and science 
<br />
will be successful because it will make it possible to fuse religion 
<br />
and state, making religion open to irrationality, arbitrariness, well 
<br />
making it a powerful popular opium.
<br />
<br />Aristotle was the most brilliant pupil of Plato. I like to consider him 
<br />
as the first serious scientist, and I am afraid, perhaps the last one 
<br />
too, except for a bunch of neoplatonists. Unlike Plato, all his 
<br />
theories are rather clearly refutable, and actually most of his 
<br />
&quot;physics&quot; (science of nature) has been refuted (from Galileo to Kochen 
<br />
and Specker (imo)). Everybody accepts the fact that Aristotle dynamics 
<br />
has been refuted by Galileo (even by a thought experiment although some 
<br />
philosopher of sciences disagrees on that special point). Alas if you 
<br />
dare to give the shadow of the impression that you think that his 
<br />
theology can be refuted you get problem with both the Christians (only 
<br />
the dogmatic kind to be sure) and still more problems with the atheists 
<br />
(which are all, as far as I know, more catholic in spirit than the 
<br />
Pope). And this despite the existence of the neoplatonist who will 
<br />
clearly show that Aristotle's theology cannot be maintained for reason 
<br />
of internal inconsistencies (see Plotinus Ennead V-6 for example).
<br />
But the fact that Aristotle theology has been refuted just shows how 
<br />
far Aristotle has been able to be enough clear and precise in a domain 
<br />
which will be made non refutable by the Roman Church, notably through 
<br />
the idea of revelation, sacred text, etc. This has lead, through the 
<br />
addition of proselytism,  to &quot;modern&quot; eliminative materialism, (a very 
<br />
old idea thus) and even, arguably, to the elimination of persons and 
<br />
ideas (look at history).
<br />
