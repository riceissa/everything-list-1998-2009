<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [BM]: I told you my relief, but I begin to doubt !

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    What do you mean by that?
</em><br />
<br /><br />...that I was beginning to ask myself if you were not a sort of fanatics,
<br />
yourself. Your recent answer reassures me a little bit.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I did mention that they were also &quot;advocates of suicide&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But you know that in our discussion a term like &quot;suicide&quot; is
<br />
not well defined. Personaly I have nothing against suicide (in the
<br />
usual folk meaning) with
<br />
the fundamental proviso that the one who does it does not
<br />
wound other people, physically or morally.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno, you have an amazing ability to misunderstand what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I say.  I used 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to think that the problem was that many of the posts on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this list concern 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;arcane philosophical and technical points, so that misunderstanding was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understandable.  By now I know better.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    I could say &quot;Coke is better than Pepsi&quot;, and you would interpret that to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mean that I don't know they are both colas.  Further, you would believe that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the only way to illustrate the relationship between the two drinks is by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;analogy to G and G*.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I never pretend it was the only way.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The sound machine is maximaly humble, she is agnostic on both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;her own consistency and her own inconsistency.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Does that imply it is agnostic on any question?
</em><br />
<br /><br />No. The sound machine will be agnostic only on proposition
<br />
beginning by a diamond, like consistency &lt;&gt;t, or on some false
<br />
but irrefutable proposition like inconsistency (-&lt;&gt;t or []f).
<br />
The machine will not be agnostic on any provable arithmetical
<br />
proposition.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;One of these days, I'll 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have to check out what kind of analogy you are making between Godel's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theorem and belief systems.  Right now I doubt there's much to it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is not an analogy. It is provable that all self-referentially
<br />
correct machine able to prove enough classical theorems of arithmetic
<br />
&quot;obeys&quot; to G and G*. 
<br />
Actually it can be proved that G and G* are still sound (but not
<br />
complete) for much more general sort of (non-machine) entity.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A couple more points.  When I say &quot;X is true&quot; you can assume 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I mean &quot;I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe X is very likely to be true, so my Bayesian probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of (not X) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is so low it is best to neglect it.&quot;  If I say for example &quot;This is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a chair&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that is what I mean.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks for being precise. This explains probably why there is
<br />
so much misunderstanding between us. I believe in arithmetical
<br />
truth. In theoretical discussion when I say &quot;X is true&quot; I
<br />
mean it is the case that X.
<br />
In *that* frame I isolate a notion of probability in some
<br />
indirect way (translating the UDA in arithmetic).
<br />
Probability is primary for you, only secondary for me.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also, if humans have properties that are not shared by your &quot;consistent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machine&quot; model, then it is not the humans' fault.  It is not their job to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;describe your model.  It means your model is faulty.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If humans are machine-emulable and if (or when) humans are
<br />
self-referentially correct, then they obeys to G/G*.
<br />
Of course the consistent machine can become inconsistent. This
<br />
is indeed a consequence of G: &lt;&gt;t -&gt; &lt;&gt;[]f. Weird but true,
<br />
and provable by the machine!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even if I'm not sure of X, I might still want you to believe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;X.
</em><br />
<br /><br />In actual decision process. I can understand. In a theoretical
<br />
approach I am less sure. Well I'm sure of the contrary.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    It's going to be a war between ordinary people vs. evil. 
</em><br />
<br />I hope so.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Personally I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;am not too concerned right now with the philosophical differences among the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ordinary people, be they religious or  intelligent.  This will be serious, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fear.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It must be serious. Note that our enemies made a so big
<br />
sign of disrespect to the other (us) that no countries can really
<br />
protect them without destroying their soul eventually.
<br />
The key weapons here will be patience and imagination. 
<br />
By killing purposely so much innocent civilians, out of any
<br />
military target, the terrorists made a very bad publicity for 
<br />
terrorism. They succeed only in reuniting the world against them.
<br />
I hope Algerians, Israelians, and all countries so badly attacked
<br />
by terrorists will benefit of the revelation that terrorism is
<br />
essentially self-defeating. Not defensible.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    I'm an atheist, and have no doubts of any significance about it.  I do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe that other people should be atheists too, and that on the whole 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;religion is an evil.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't believe at all religious questioning is an evil. I do
<br />
believe that religious institutionalisation can fall in evil trap.
<br />
I do believe in something you loose when you give it a name, or
<br />
when images are taken too much seriously. I like Alan Watts when
<br />
he says a priest should be able to do a wink.
<br />
Now you know I think &quot;atheism&quot; is a religion. 
<br />
And the problem with atheist is that they are not aware that
<br />
atheism is a religion, so they have a tendancy toward a much
<br />
subtil proselitysm I just cannot accept. This tendency is sometimes
<br />
linked to the confusion between agnosticism and atheism.
<br />
You can disbelieve in the God(s) of such or such group of people.
<br />
But you cannot necessarily disbelieve in something nobody
<br />
can define.  
<br />
Now, computer science and mathematical logic shows that
<br />
a lot of non definable things, unnameable things, etc. 
<br />
can clearly exists.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of the major religions I would say that Islam and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Christianity are the worst, but the main factor is how seriously the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believers take it and how radical they are in interpretation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is here that you reassure me a little.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But again, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for now I am putting disagreements among non-evil people on the back burner.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is wise, indeed.
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
