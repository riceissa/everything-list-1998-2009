<br /><br /><br />Perhaps because most people believe that the Pythagorean view
<br />
has been refuted.
<br />
<br />Just consider the &quot;little Pythagorean view&quot; according to which
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Every length can be measured by integers or ratio of integers
<br />
<br />This has been refuted by the Pythagorean themselves when they
<br />
discovered that the square root of 2 *is* not given by any ratio of integers.
<br />
It is the discovery of the irrational numbers, a long time ago.
<br />
<br />Now Pythagore could have &quot;corrected&quot; his doctrine with:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Every length can be measured by integers, ratio of integers or
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radical of integers.
<br />
<br />But this would have been refuted by Abel's discovery in 1824 that polynomial
<br />
with degree greater than 4 can have solutions which cannot be described in
<br />
term of ratio and radicals.
<br />
<br />Now Pythagore could have corrected his doctrine again with
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Every length can be measured by polynomial's zeros.
<br />
<br />But then Pythagore would have been refuted by the discovery of the non
<br />
algebraic numbers: the transcendant numbers like euler e, and PI.
<br />
<br />Perhaps at this stage Pythagore would begin to think his Pythagorean view
<br />
could may be not work.
<br />
And then he would have been destroyed by Cantor's discovery, who showed
<br />
with his famous diagonalization, that the set of reals (the lengths) is not 
<br />
enumerable.
<br />
<br />But then Pythagore would perhaps have postulated the comp hypothesis,
<br />
thinking that *algorithmic* real , which should be obviously
<br />
enumerable, exist and are easily defined.
<br />
<br />Alas,  the more subtle Post-Turing-Markov-Church-Kleene-Godel
<br />
diagonalisation makes the algorithmic real not *algorithmically* enumerable.
<br />
<br /><br />Surely at this stage Pythagore should abandon the Pythagorean view. Isn't it?
<br />
<br /><br />NOT AT ALL.  With *Church thesis* you can still say:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Every length can be measured by a FORTRAN program.
<br />
<br />Only you have a price to pay:
<br />
<br />FORTRAN programs will measure *much more* than &quot;length&quot;, and an
<br />
enumeration of the algorithmic reals, will enumerate the reals +
<br />
other objects, and no theories at all will give you an algorithmic way to
<br />
distinguish the reals from the other objects. That is, the price is
<br />
incompleteness, randomness, unpredictability, etc.
<br />
(Click on the diagonalisation posts in my URL where I explain this,
<br />
with the notion of function (from N to N) in place of the reals).
<br />
<br />But that is nice (for a realist platonic), and this shows that
<br />
Church thesis not only rehabilitates the little Pythagorean view (in term
<br />
of length), but makes consistent the large Pythagorean view
<br />
according to which:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-everything emerges from the integers and their
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relations.
<br />
<br />And my PhD result shows that, with the comp hyp, the appearance of
<br />
physics *should* emerge in the average memory of the consistent
<br />
anticipating universal machine/program/number. And then I derived a
<br />
theorem prover for the logic of the physical propositions from that, but
<br />
for reason of inefficacy  of that theorem prover I can still not decide if
<br />
it gives really a quantum logic, or which one ...
<br />
Other weakness, I have neither a semantics nor an axiomatic for that
<br />
quantum logic, only a theorem prover, and a naive semantics in term
<br />
of maximal consistent computational histories.
<br />
<br />I have written 2/3 of a paper which summarize the proof and I intend
<br />
to submit it to some international journal (once finished ...).
<br />
<br />Sure, there exists other reasons to believe the Pythagorean view
<br />
is coming back, like more direct astonishing relations between
<br />
number theory and theoretical physics. Look at
