<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; can be  made that matter could be relevant for consciousness. (I see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Peter  Jones makes a similar remark).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Stathis: Except that you could say the same for the Maudlin example, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in which it is shown that conscious can differ in two objects which do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not differ in physical activity: it does not strictly show that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physical activity (or more generally, matter) is unnecessary, just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that the usual definition of supervenience does not apply.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, I guess that by &quot;usual supervenience&quot; you mean &quot;physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenience&quot;. Both Maudlin and the movie graph show that the comp hyp 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is incompatible with usual (physical) supervenience. We both show (~ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp OR ~ physical supervenience). This is equivalent with (comp -&gt; ~ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical supervenience) or with (physical supervenience -&gt; ~ comp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I take comp, and I prove more (the UDA + Movie graph) gives more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information than just the movie graph or Maudlin, and  the acomp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shows more and less. More in the sense that it gives the precise logic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of comp-physical proposition; less because without much remaining work 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it gives only that. But the puzzle pieces fit enough together to expect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some quantum computing provable to appear in the neighborhood of any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lobian machines.
</em><br />
<br />The usual definition of supervenience is that if A properties supervene on B 
<br />
properties, the A properties cannot differ without the B properties also differing. 
<br />
So if it can be shown that the one instant of B properties (the one physical state) 
<br />
can be associated with more than one instant of A properties (two or more distinct
<br />
conscious states), then this wrecks the physical supervenience thesis. However, it 
<br />
does not strictly show that *no* physical state at all is required for consciousness 
<br />
to occur; I agree that this is a neater and more elegant conclusion but it doesn't follow. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You take comp and supervenience as two separate theories, but I would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bet that most computationalists take them as a package deal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course. But they are wrong. That package deal is made of sand. That 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is my point. Comp and physical supervenience is a bit little &quot;molecular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biology&quot; + vitalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The point of the UDA in 8 steps (that is UDA including the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; movie-graph/maudlin point) is really that nobody can be serious by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; keeping both comp and physical supervenience. But physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenience is obviously an invention of materialist (monist or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dualist).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we keep comp you can easily understand that we have to go back on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational supervenience, and then we have to explain the origin of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physical laws from that.
</em><br />
<br />I agree. I was just pointing out that computationalists are generally fond of 
<br />
computers, and their raison d'etre would be challenged if the computers were 
<br />
shown to be unnecessary.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I wonder if we are talking about the same thing, because it doesn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; seem to me that an empirical proof is needed to show that any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; physical  &gt; process could be seen as implementing any computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; This is not obvious at all. You need both empiry + a physical theory  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; about that empiry, just to say that there is a physical process  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; implementing if only one computation (to say nothing about all  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; computations).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; All you need is one physical process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is enough for my point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If consciousness is in no way dependent on the details of this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physical process, then the actual physics is irrelevant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What does that means?  If physical supervenience is correct 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness has to be described by a non turing emulable *physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process* whatever details are needed or not, a part of it have to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; include an infinity of details (or it will be computationalist).
</em><br />
<br />But physical supervenience isn't correct if comp [i.e. comp excluding the 
<br />
physical supervenience part] is correct, as we are both arguing. This means 
<br />
that consciousness is not dependent on any particular physical properties. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Do you see how, aside from one small detail, this is equivalent to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; saying that consciousness is not dependent on any physical process at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see this (but I see that this is going in the direction I argue 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it should go).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It doesn't matter if the machine loops, because the one physical state 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can map to many different computational states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can only *imagine* this, and this only together with some physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption. Remember that one of my goal is to explain what a &quot;physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state&quot; can possibly be. As you know I do not assume physics. I do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume any physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Semantics is arbitrary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmm... here I see what you mean, but I disagree. You consider some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical state (a fuzzy thing imo) and then *you* consider all the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; semantics, which *you* interpret as any or many computational states. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps we should go back on the basic assumption.
</em><br />
<br />Indeed, I provide the semantics, in language as in computer science. A string 
<br />
of characters has no meaning unless an observer gives it meaning. However, 
<br />
what of the special case where a computation is conscious, providing its own 
<br />
observer even if all inputs/outputs are destroyed and there is no-one left who 
<br />
is able to understand the details of its design?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But if you consider a physical computer the actual states 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; corresponding to the steps of the computation can be arbitrary. They 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; will be ordered in a certain consistent way, so we can utilise the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; machine, but that is just a practical requirement. The natural number 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 3 does not have to be written as &quot;3&quot; nor even as &quot;III&quot;; it could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; written as &quot;II&quot; on a Wednesday, &quot;IIII&quot; if the moon is full and &quot;I&quot; the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rest of the time. This has no effect on the platonic object 3, but it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; does affect our ability to communicate and do arithmetic unless we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; keep track of the notation. Similarly with a computation, we need to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be aware of the meaning of the states on a physical computer in order 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to use it, but our awareness of the computer semantics does not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;create&quot; the computation or imbue it with consciousness (if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computations can be conscious) any more than our awareness of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mathematical notation creates the number 3.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The computational states just need to be *relatively* coherent. I have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no idea what you mean by a &quot;physical computer&quot; for the reason that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; term &quot;physical&quot; denotes different things relatively to the assumption 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we do.
</em><br />
<br />By a physical world I mean just what appears to me to be a physical world. 
<br />
This is a starting point, even if you later conclude beginning with this and 
<br />
some other observations that there is no separate physical reality.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Why can't the black page contain everything that can possibly be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; written, i.e. it can be a superposition of an infinite number of pages 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with an infinite amount of ink?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You mean a quantum superposition? (then with comp such a superposition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really describes an infinity of immaterial computational histories in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which each page contains a finite amount of ink. Well it is rather 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar with the quantum mechanical superposition).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only sense in which (both with quantum field theory AND with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp-physics) I can accept an infinite information on a black page is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related to renormalization problem, spurious infinite energies ....
</em><br />
<br />You're being too clever for me. I simply meant that a page on which a 
<br />
large number of people had written (perhaps a digital page with digital 
<br />
ink, so that it doesn't get saturated) would appear black. Once it is black, 
<br />
more writing would not change its appearance, so a page with a million 
<br />
superimposed English texts would look the same as a page with every 
<br />
possible text in every possible language all superimposed.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then why to assume a physical world with all those infinities when 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp forces us to deal with already enough infinities?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You loss me I'm afraid. Are you trying to save both comp AND the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical supervenience?
</em><br />
<br />No: one or other is flawed. But the evidence suggests that it is still possible 
<br />
that *some* physical reality is needed for consciousness to occur, given 
<br />
comp, even though the supervenience relationship does not apply. This is 
<br />
a kludge; better to say either that consciousness is dependent on matter in 
<br />
some well-behaved way like every other physical phenomenon, or completely 
<br />
independent of matter - but I can't quite see how to do this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;We have not yet derive the whole of physics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from comp, but we can already expect the &quot;mind-matter&quot; mapping to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something quite complex. For me it is obvious that to a mind state 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there will be an infinity of &quot;computational states and histories&quot; going 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through that mind state. The reverse is harder because we are unable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (assuming comp) to singularize a &quot;comp-physical states&quot;. Physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states *are* already first person plural (inter-subjective) appearances 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerging from the gluing and overlapping of infinities of computations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and thus immaterial(*)). Unless I am wrong, standard computationalism 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is flawed, like both the monist and dualist doctrine of materialism are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flawed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would be wrong to say that comp makes materialism refutated, but for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a similar reason that it is wrong to say that bilogy has proves that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vitalism is refutated. But biology has made vitalism 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation-useless, and computationalism makes materialism explantion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; useless too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course it remains the possibility that comp is incorrect. If comp is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true, we have to live with that possibility forever.
</em><br />
<br />OK, I agre with that.
