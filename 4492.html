<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       p as a new axiom to the theory or to the machine roots belief.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So &lt;&gt;p is &quot;it is not provable that not p&quot;? This is a double negative
<br />
implying that your logic follows the law of the excluded middle. That is ok,
<br />
but I was hoping that you would see that as being a logicwise subset of
<br />
Intuitionistic logic, ala Topos and Heyting Algebras...
<br />
<br /><br />snip
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  I take &quot;consistent&quot; means that given some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;formal model, whose exact definition must be given somehow ...

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proving elementary arithmetical theorems.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Umm, what are the bounds of this &quot;extension&quot; of classical logic. Any
<br />
possibility of getting into contectual or modal aspects, such as []p iff
<br />
some x implies p, where x is some context that may vanish in some limit. An
<br />
example of this is found in solutions of the &quot;grue&quot; paradox.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />snip
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     We may note that &quot;machines&quot; are usually defined by some set of
</em><br />
functions
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;N -&gt; N, where N are the Natural numbers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM: Read my to diagonalisation post for making this precise. I would say
</em><br />
that
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; controlable machine, constructive reals, and total computable function
</em><br />
(where
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; total means defined on all N, can be, in our context, identified. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such a set is not *recursively* (mechanically) enumerable!!!!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All &quot;my&quot; enterprise, and actually Church thesis, are made consistent by
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact that the set of total computable function is a necessarily fuzzy set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; include in the set of all computable functions.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are avoiding my question! How is this &quot;fuzzyness&quot; defined? Is it
<br />
some analogy to the boundary of a recursively enumerable set or is it some
<br />
membership function that can range over [0,1] or some thing else?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I am very skeptical that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;(countable) set of numbers alone is sufficient in itself to cover the
</em><br />
range
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of all possible systems in Nature (the Totality of possible existential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;expressions, including all mathematics). Given this caveat, is this
</em><br />
within
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;your notion of a definition of these words?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please read carefully the diagonalisation post. Church thesis is really
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;schroedinger equation&quot; of comp. I mean a highly non trivial statement in
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamentals of mathematics. It is the roots of the incompleteness
</em><br />
phenomenon.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Before Church thesis you could have believed that &quot;to be a machine&quot; is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simplifying assumption. After Church thesis we know that machines,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines in particular&quot; have unbounded complexity. Universal machines are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mostly lucky unpredictable being.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the link to the diagonalization post? It is true that I have a
<br />
&quot;problem&quot; with the Church thesis, but it is that it seems to be myopic and
<br />
limited. I see no analogy between the Church thesis and SWE other than a
<br />
mapping function &quot;-&gt;&quot; such that Church thesis is about N -&gt; N and SWE can be
<br />
considered to be about C -&gt; C, but it is obvious that N \subset C and not
<br />
the otherway around.
<br />
<br />snip
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     What I am trying to argue is that we can not abondon eiter sup-phys
</em><br />
nor
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;comp except in the very very special case where the distinguishability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;between the two vanishes, e.g. a neutal monism that obtains in the
</em><br />
infinite
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;limit of all possible existential (or ontological) expressions and,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;additionally, we must not be so cavalier in our postulations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     As I have tried to argue before, the notion that the mind is UTM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;emulable is not a proven fact and at this point should be considered to
</em><br />
be
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;merely a conjecture.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It cannot be taken as a conjecture. It is an hypothesis which has the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; curious feature that if you add it as an axioms it becomes false!
</em><br />
<br /><br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what bothers me about it, it is like the Createan what is honest
<br />
so long as he never speaks a word and yet you do not seem to allow for a
<br />
resolution of the Liar paradox other that demanding silence, ala Russell's
<br />
solution. I hope some day soon we can explore the notion of non well founded
<br />
sets that Peter Wegner proposed as a means to generalize the notion of
<br />
computation.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (This is a known feature of modal logics or intensional mathematics).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So &quot;the notion that the mind is [consistently] UTM emulable&quot; is not only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not a proven fact, but it will never be a proven fact, even in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seemingly trivial sense as being provable in a theory which take it as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axioms. I use modal logic because it is so easy to be wrong in intensional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (modal) context.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish that you would be more specific on this &quot;modal logic&quot; other than
<br />
references to books that are impossible for me to buy. :-(
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The thought experiement using classical cloning and or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;teleporting of minds has several assumptions that are contrary to known
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;physical facts, such as the imposibility of simulataneously measuring the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;position and momenta of all the required atoms of a brain such that a UTM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;could be defined that would emulate its behaviour. This, in itself, leads
</em><br />
me
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;to reject the entire notion of &quot;brain cloning&quot; and any idea that depends
</em><br />
on
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;it as simple idealistic. It is as fantastic as a pink unicorn. I see not
</em><br />
way
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;in which the classical teleportation is possible in the &quot;real world&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I use brain cloning (and the neuro hypothesis) to make my argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simpler. Then I explicitely eliminate that hypothesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The elimination is based on the fact that the UD will generate all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your digital quantum state.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it a &quot;fact&quot; that the UD will generate all &quot;your digital quantum
<br />
state&quot;? Since when is a quantum state reducible to a finite &quot;digital&quot;
<br />
sequence? Did you forget about Kochen-Specker already? You wrote that you
<br />
read the Calude, Svozil et al papers and yet do not seem to understand the
<br />
very simple notion that they prove: there does not exist a Binary or Boolean
<br />
valuation for a quamtum sustem whose Hilbert space is greater than 2
<br />
dimensional.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could see that one could argue for finite approximations and propose
<br />
some kind of &quot;superselection&quot; rules that limit the linear superposition of
<br />
QM states but all of the models that I have seen that did this failed
<br />
miserably.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can postulate that you are not a quantum digital machine, for example
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you are some analogical quantum machine capable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of handling in finite time infinite precision. But in that case you are no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more in the context of the comp hypothesis. I have no problem with that.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am trying not to postulate anything, especially &quot; analogical quantum
<br />
machine capable of handling in finite time infinite precision&quot;! The closest
<br />
that I have read about are Malament-Hogarth Machines...   It seems that you
<br />
misunderstand the notion of Qunatum computation in general ... :-(
<br />
<br /><br />snip
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Umm, this confuses me! How can we think of UD as &quot;generating&quot; all of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;physicality via computational simulations but yet seems to require the
</em><br />
prior
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;existence of the reals (numbers), oracles, etc. This looks like a
</em><br />
&quot;chicken
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;and the egg&quot; problem!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You always seem to forget that I don't postulate any form of physicality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For me term like &quot;matter&quot; or &quot;universe&quot; are like the term &quot;phlogistic&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;God&quot;. That is very, very, very, ..., very vague term which confuses us on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental questions. Those term have local use but we will not progress
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if we reify them and take their referent for granted. It would be like to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finally criticize a molecular biologist because he has not yet explain the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vital principle.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree, you do not postulate any for of &quot;physicality&quot;, but that is not
<br />
the point that I am trying to make. Appeals to Platonia are just as &quot;vague&quot;
<br />
as &quot;phlogistic&quot; and thus I fail to understand your critisism. Notions such
<br />
as &quot;position&quot;, &quot;momentum&quot;, &quot;spin&quot;, on the other hand, are not vague at all!
<br />
<br /><br />snip
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Again, you can not do this &quot;postulating&quot; and make ontological
</em><br />
claims.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;This is not like Euclid's postulation of points! But furthermore, why do
</em><br />
you
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;not postulate more than just N-&gt; N and arithmatic operations? It seems to
</em><br />
me
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that Goedel's incompleteness theorems necessitate and infinite nesting of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;metatheories to span the universe of mathematics such that a Totality of
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;mathemacial universe&quot; is not even enumerable!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are right. But Godel's theorems are provable by the machines, and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the reason why I don't need to postulate explicitily those tranfinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; progressions. Numbers in numberland also dream about infinite nestings of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metatheories. There is a sort of SKOLEM paradox here. I postulate just the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningfulness of the standard model of &quot;Peano Arithmetics&quot; (let us say),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and then I show that this countable model, seen from inside (1-view), is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bigger than what any machines can ever imagine, and is highly structured
</em><br />
too.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That 1-bigness will provide jobs for mathematical psychologists, for ...
</em><br />
ever.
<br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, We are back to the question of &quot;what is a machine&quot;! Please
<br />
explain what a &quot;machine&quot; is! I am looking for  a direct definition, not a
<br />
vague reference!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  What is COMP other than N -&gt; N functions? COuld you explain to us how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;you can generate SWE using only N -&gt; N functions, or, equivalently, how
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;embed complex valued functions in N?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please, comp is PI (Personal Implication: you say &quot;yes doctor&quot; for his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                      proposition of a artificial brain)
</em><br />
<br /><br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is pure conjecture. Allow me to be agnostic on this. We need to get
<br />
a &quot;machine&quot; (whatever that is!) to pass the Turing test and then, maybe, I
<br />
will say &quot;yes doctor&quot;!

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;                  TC (Church Thesis, see what I say above on it)

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                  RA (the believe that arithmetical truth is atemporal,

<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no problem with the &quot;truth&quot; of mathematical objects being

atemporal, aspatial, etc. What I have a problem with is the idea that
<br />
mathematics is anything more than a &quot;zero information set&quot; unless there
<br />
exists, just as must ontologically and the &quot;truthfullness&quot;, at least the
<br />
&quot;posibility&quot; of some form of &quot;implementation&quot; of each and every mathematical
<br />
function. Greg Egan has expressed this idea well in several of his
<br />
stories...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Real numbers enters the show in two different ways: as constructive real,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which can be identified with total computable function from N to N, and as

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being generated in the limit by the UD. This include the non

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructive reals.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Complex, quaternion, octonions, should be explained by Z1* (and *that* is

a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The manual containing an enumeration of all of the brain states of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Einstein is impossible by the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Only if you postulate that einstein brain is an infinite *analogical*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum computing machine.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not at all. I am merely being consistent with the basic mathematics of
<br />
canonically conjugate operator spaces. YOu do not seem to understand this
<br />
basic aspect of the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;SPK:
<br />
...
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;something amiss with the &quot;Emperor's New Clothes&quot; but not much. ;-) The
</em><br />
key
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that strong AI and COMP believers in general seems to neglect the fine
</em><br />
point
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that 1-person expereice is not 3-person observable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But that was what I said in my last post to Colin Hales. Remember? I even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have compared the first person to the vampire! It is the most striking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feature of the first person: it is not a 3-machine!
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I missed that post. Could you link it for us? And, what the heck is a
<br />
&quot;3-machine&quot;????
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Just because for some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;finite testing there could be no difference between a Machine's behavior
</em><br />
and
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;a &quot;human&quot; does NOT necessitate that they have equivalent 1-person
</em><br />
content.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM: Sure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     As a matter of fact, I have no way to prove that you are not a
</em><br />
machine
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;and you can not prove that this post is not just the output of a random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;letter generator. All we have is likelyhoods and assumptions. ;-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sure.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, then how can you avoid my conclusion?! If I can prove nothing
<br />
except, maybe, &quot;cognito  ...&quot; ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;SPK: I fail to see how notions such as &quot;time&quot;, &quot; casuality&quot; and &quot;1-person
</em><br />
/
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;3-person distinctions are shown to be necessary by your model. My point
</em><br />
is
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that if our 1-person experience of a world is nothing more that a string
</em><br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;symbols existing a priori in Platonia,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it is not! A first person is a person with her feelings, pains, hopes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; joys, headache, and many personal memories. Nothing else. Certainly not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a 3-string, not a 3-bunch of 3-particles, not a 3-machine, neither a
</em><br />
3-brain.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The magic of comp, is that you can 3-study the 1-person discourse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The 1-person are much more than the arithmetical platonia, even if that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much more is just platonia seen from inside.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes no sense to me, I am sorry. :-(
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;why do we have enless debates about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the notion of a &quot;flow of consciousness&quot;? It can not be &quot;explained&quot; away
</em><br />
as
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;just an illusion or &quot;intensional stance&quot;. Immaterial strings might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;capable of encoding each other as subsets but unless we have some means
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;explain how Nature solves mathematical problems that are both intractible
</em><br />
by
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;finite TMs and require that we include the means of explaining concurrent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;computations, e.g. we have to explain, at least, the appearence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;interactions between a plurality of systems not just a single
</em><br />
computational
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM: That's exactly what I begin to do in my thesis.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to reading more of it!

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Let us continue our explorations of ideas and I hope to explain to
</em><br />
you
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;how I am neither a PHYSICAList nor a COMPutationalist. I have a thought
</em><br />
that
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;might show how there might be a flaw in your reasoning and it is that
</em><br />
just
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;because UTMs are independent of any particular physical implementation
</em><br />
does
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;not obtain that UTMs do not require, at least, some approximate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;implementation in physicality. Numbers are meaningless if there does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;exist some 1-person notion of &quot;numberness&quot;. Like the number three is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;meaningless symbol, at best, if there is not some set of objects that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;associable with &quot;threeness&quot;. More on this in the next post. ;-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure there is any problem between us. You don't like very much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neither comp, nor what I derive from it. People who postulates comp and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who does not like the consequence are more troubled, like most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; monist materialist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have skip the &quot;Finkelstein part of the post&quot; because I prefer to reread
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; him before). I am a little less finitist than Finkelstein, I think).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Apology also for having (non purposefully) attribute some of my prose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to you ;-).

<br />&nbsp;[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that Finkelstein is too finitistic, but that's ok. ;-)
