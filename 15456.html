MGA 3
<br />
<br />It is the last MGA !
<br />
<br />I realize MGA is complete, as I thought it was, but I was doubting  
<br />
this recently. We don't need to refer to Maudlin, and MGA 4 is not  
<br />
necessary.
<br />
Maudlin 1989 is an independent argument of the 1988 Toulouse argument  
<br />
(which I present here).
<br />
Note that Maudlin's very interesting &quot;Olympization technic&quot;  can be  
<br />
used to defeat a wrong form of MGA 3, that is, a wrong argument for  
<br />
the assertion that  the movie cannot be conscious. (the argument that  
<br />
the movie lacks the counterfactual). Below are hopefully correct (if  
<br />
not very simple) argument. ( I use Maudlin sometimes when people gives  
<br />
this non correct form of MGA 3, and this is probably what makes me  
<br />
think Maudlin has to be used, at some point).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />MGA 1 shows that Lucky Alice is conscious, and MGA 2 shows that the  
<br />
&quot;luckiness&quot; feature of the MGA 1 experiment was a red herring. We can  
<br />
construct, from MEC+COMP, an home made lucky rays generator, and use  
<br />
it at will. If we accept both digital mechanism, in particular  
<br />
Dennet's principle that neurons have no intelligence, still less  
<br />
prescience, and this  *together with* the supervenience principle; we  
<br />
have to accept that Alice conscious dream experience supervenes on the  
<br />
projection of her brain activity movie.
<br />
<br />Let us show now that Alice consciousness *cannot* supervene on that  
<br />
*physical* movie projection.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I propose two (deductive) arguments.
<br />
<br />1)
<br />
<br />Mechanism implies the following tautological functionalist principle:  
<br />
if, for some range of activity, a system does what it is supposed to  
<br />
do, and this before and after a change is made in its constitution,  
<br />
then the change does not change what the system is supposed to do, for  
<br />
that range of activity.
<br />
Example:
<br />
- A car is supposed to broken but only if the driver is faster than 90  
<br />
miles/h. Pepe Pepito NEVER drives faster than 80 miles/h. Then the car  
<br />
is supposed to do what she is supposed to do, with respect of its  
<br />
range of activity defined by Pepe Pepito.
<br />
- Claude bought a 1000 thousand processors computer. One day he  
<br />
realized that he used only 990 processors, for his type of activity,  
<br />
so he decided to get rid of those 10 useless processors. And indeed  
<br />
the machine will satisfy Claude ever.
<br />
<br />- Alice has (again) a math exam. Theoreticians have correctly predict  
<br />
that in this special circumstance, she will never use neurons X, Y and  
<br />
Z.  Now Alice go (again, again) to this exam in the same condition,  
<br />
but with the neurons X, Y, Z removed. Again, not only will she behaved  
<br />
like if she succeed her exam, but her consciousness, with both MEC  
<br />
*and* MAT still continue.
<br />
The idea is that if something is not useful, for an active process to  
<br />
go on, for some range of activity, then you can remove it, for that  
<br />
range of activity.
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />Now, consider the projection of the movie of the activity of Alice's  
<br />
brain, &quot;the movie graph&quot;.
<br />
Is it necessary that someone look at that movie? Certainly not. No  
<br />
more than it is needed that someone is look at your reconstitution in  
<br />
Moscow for you to be conscious in Moscow after a teleportation. All  
<br />
right? (with MEC assumed of course).
<br />
Is it necessary to have a screen? Well, the range of activity here is  
<br />
just one dynamical description of one computation. Suppose we make a  
<br />
hole in the screen. What goes in and out of that hole is exactly the  
<br />
same, with the hole and without the hole. For that unique activity,  
<br />
the hole in the screen is functionally equivalent to the subgraph  
<br />
which the hole removed. Clearly we can make a hole as large as the  
<br />
screen, so no need for a screen.
<br />
But this reasoning goes through if we make the hole in the film  
<br />
itself. Reconsider the image on the screen: with a hole in the film  
<br />
itself, you get a &quot;hole&quot; in the movie, but everything which enters and  
<br />
go out of the hole remains the same, for that (unique) range of  
<br />
activity.  The &quot;hole&quot; has trivially the same functionality than the  
<br />
subgraph functionality whose special behavior was described by the  
<br />
film. And this is true for any subparts, so we can remove the entire  
<br />
film itself.
<br />
<br />Does Alice's dream supervene (in real time and space) on the  
<br />
projection of the empty movie?
<br />
<br />Remark.
<br />
1° Of course, this argument can be sum up by saying that the movie  
<br />
lacks causality between its parts so that it cannot really be said  
<br />
that it computes any thing, at least physically. The movie is just an  
<br />
ordered record of computational states. This is neither a physical  
<br />
computation, nor an (immaterial) computation where the steps follows  
<br />
relatively to some universal machine. It is just a description of a  
<br />
computation, already existing in the Universal Deployment.
<br />
2° Note this: If we take into consideration the relative destiny of  
<br />
Alice, and supposing one day her brain broke down completely, she has  
<br />
more chance to survive through &quot;holes in the screen&quot; than to the  
<br />
&quot;holes in the film&quot;. The film contains the relevant information to  
<br />
reconstitute Alice from her brain description, contained on this high  
<br />
resolution film. Keeping comp, and abandoning the physical  
<br />
supervenience thesis, means that we do no more associate  
<br />
consciousness, neither on the movie, NOR on the brain special activity  
<br />
in a computation, but to the computation itself directly. A brain, and  
<br />
even a film,  will &quot;only&quot; be a way to make bigger the probability
<br />
for a consciousness to manifest itself relatively to a &quot;probable&quot;  
<br />
universal computational history.
<br />
Strictly speaking, running the movie dimimish Alice chance to have her  
<br />
conscious experience (life) continue, at least relatively to you,  
<br />
because of the many scratches the projector makes on the pellicle,  
<br />
which remove relevant information for a safe reconstitution later  
<br />
(again relatively to you).
<br />
<br /><br />2)
<br />
<br />I give now what is perhaps a simpler argument
<br />
<br />A projection of a movie is a relative phenomenon. On the planet 247a,  
<br />
nearby in the galaxy, they don't have screen. The film pellicle is as  
<br />
big as a screen, and they make the film passing behind a stroboscope  
<br />
at the right frequency in front of the public. But on planet 247b,  
<br />
movies are only for travellers! They dress their film, as big as those  
<br />
on planet 247a, in their countries all along their train rails with a  
<br />
lamp besides each frames, which is nice because from the train,  
<br />
through its speed, you get the usual 24 frames per second. But we  
<br />
already accepted that such movie does not need to be observed, the  
<br />
train can be empty of people. Well the train does not play any role,  
<br />
and what remains is the static film with a lamp behind each frame. Are  
<br />
the lamps really necessaries? Of course not, all right? So now we are  
<br />
obliged to accept that the consciousness of Alice during the  
<br />
projection of the movie supervenes of something completely inert in  
<br />
time and space. This contradicts the *physical*  supervenience thesis.
<br />
<br /><br />Exercises.
<br />
<br />a) Someone could propose an alternate argument that a movie does not  
<br />
compute (and so consciousness does supervene on it) by alluding to the  
<br />
lack of causality in the movie:  the movie does not handle the  
<br />
counterfactual existing implicitly in computations (physical or not).   
<br />
Use Maudlin's Olympization technic to refute that argument.
<br />
<br />b) Make fun by using a non dreaming Alice. Shows that the movie (film  
<br />
or screen) graph border is needed to get the accidental zombies (the  
<br />
puppet).
<br />
<br />And then the &quot;important&quot; exercise (the original goal).
<br />
<br />c) Eliminate the hypothesis &quot;there is a concrete deployment&quot; in the  
<br />
seventh step of the UDA. Use UDA(1...7) to define properly the  
<br />
computationalist supervenience thesis. Hint: reread the remarks above.
<br />
<br />Have a good day.
