<br />
Hi!
<br />
<br />I'd like to revive an old thread, that has been bothering me a lot 
<br />
lately.  I hope you'll all agree that it's a fascinating puzzle.
<br />
Wei Dai posed this way back, in February of last year:
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/index.html?mID=38">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/index.html?mID=38</a>.
<br />
I've read the entire thread, and I don't think the question was
<br />
ever resolved.  Wei, Nick Bostrom, and Hal Finney were the main
<br />
contributors.
<br />
<br />I'll present the problem similar to the way it came to be described 
<br />
toward the end of the thread:  spoze that a person (whom we'll call 
<br />
Jane) agrees to an experiment.  At time t0 she's sitting there.  
<br />
Just before time t1, a coin is flipped.  If the coin lands tails,
<br />
then nothing special will happen.  But if the coin lands heads, then
<br />
just before time t2, Jane will be duplicated.  We want to know, from
<br />
Jane's subjective perspective, what are the odds that she will see
<br />
heads?  To make it very clear, here is a graphical representation:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t0      |
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t1   T / \ H
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/   \
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t2   /   / \
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|   |  \
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t3   Y   R   B
<br />
<br />One addition to the setup that came at the end of the thread is that
<br />
just prior to time t3, Jane(s) is/are shown a colored card.  The
<br />
experimenter knows ahead of time that if the coin lands tails, he
<br />
will show Jane a yellow card.  If the coin lands heads, he will show
<br />
Jane1 a red card and Jane2 a blue card.  The reason for doing this is
<br />
so that we can say with certainty that at time t3, Jane1 and Jane2 
<br />
are different people.  Now, Jane is not told which card she will see,
<br />
but she knows she will be shown one of those three cards.  From her
<br />
perspective, which color she is shown should be entirely random.
<br />
<br />Wei's initial point was that this poses a problem for Tegmark's 
<br />
approach to determining subjective probabilities:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... for any mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive set of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probabilities Bi, the probability of an event A is given by 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(A) = Sum-over-i( P(A|Bi) P(Bi) )
<br />
<br />Now let's consider Jane's thought processes at time t0.  She wants
<br />
to know the probability that she'll see heads.  Let's assume for
<br />
now that she wants to calculate the probability at time t3 that
<br />
she will have seen heads.  From her perspective, the color
<br />
of the card she sees is random, so P(Y) = P(R) = P(B) = 1/3.
<br />
Furthermore, she knows that of the three possible outcomes for her,
<br />
represented by the three cards, only one will have seen the coin
<br />
land tails.  That is (again, from her perspective) given that she
<br />
has seen a yellow card, the odds that she will have seen heads is
<br />
2/3.  So we get
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(H,t3) = P(H|Y)P(Y) + P(H|R)P(R) + P(H|B)P(B) = 2/3.
<br />
<br />So she believes, at time t0, that at time t3 the odds are 2/3 that
<br />
she will have seen heads.  This is also the result one gets from
<br />
the &quot;strong self-sampling assumption&quot; (SSSA) (Wei, please correct me
<br />
if this is wrong).
<br />
<br />But there's an alternative way of computing this probability.  She
<br />
believes that at time t1, the odds are 1/2 that she'll have seen
<br />
heads.  She also knows that if, at time t1, she saw heads, then the
<br />
odds will be 1 that at all later times, she'll continue to remember
<br />
seeing heads.  Likewise, if she saw tails at time t1, she'll 
<br />
continue to remember seeing tails.  So
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(H,t3) = P(H,t1) = 1/2.
<br />
<br />So which is correct?  I know which solution I prefer, but I'd like
<br />
to get some feedback first.
<br />
<br />Note that one need not bring MWI into this at all.  The only big
<br />
assumption is the existence of a copy machine.  Instead of MWI, one
<br />
can think of the identical experiment being carried out on an
<br />
ensemble of, say, 100 hapless souls Albert, Bernard, Caroline, etc.
<br />
At time t1, some number close to 50 will have seen heads.  At time
<br />
t2, there will be 150 people, 100 of whom remember seeing heads,
<br />
and 50 of whom remember seeing tails.  From a bird perspective,
<br />
if you picked any person at random from this group, the chance that
<br />
they'll have seen heads is 2/3.
<br />
