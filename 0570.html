Hi Jacques, 
<br />
I was refering to a problem posed by ids.domain.name.hidden (Iain Stewart):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let box one contain m pounds and box two 2m pounds, where m is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any real positive number. You may choose a box look at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amount of money inside and decide either to keep this amount or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the other box's amount. (For this exercise you may think of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cheques with real numbers on it and a special bank account where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can  actually bank any real number of pounds.)
</em><br />
<br />This is a well know problem in probabilities. I am not sure if the solution 
<br />
which I propose here is also known: The expected value for the money in the 
<br />
box can be calculated as the &quot;average&quot; between (1/2)m and 2m. If the average 
<br />
is taken as an arithmetic average we get 1.25m which implies that we should 
<br />
switch our choice. This obviously does not make sense.  However, if the 
<br />
&quot;average&quot; is taken as a geometrical average (equivalently, an arithmetic 
<br />
average along a logarithmic scale) then we get sqrt(2m x 0.5m) = m which 
<br />
implies that switching results in exactly the same expected value as not 
<br />
switching, which makes sense.
<br />
Another way to state the same thing is in terms of logarithms:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;Expected Value = (1/2) (Log(m/2) + Log(2m))  = 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;(1/2) (Log(m) - Log2 + Log(m) + Log2)  = Log(m)
</em><br />
<br />Another way to state the same thing is that the distribution is such that 
<br />
there are as many number greater than m as smaller than m. (m is smack in the 
<br />
middle of the scale, and a sufficient reason for this to occur is that the 
<br />
scale must be logarithmic). I'll leave it to the mathematicians to explain 
<br />
how there can be &quot;more&quot;  or &quot;less&quot; real numbers in a given interval depending 
<br />
on the scale used. This certainly goes against the concept of transfinite 
<br />
numbers the way they are understood now. 
<br />
<br />As to the relationship with MWI I would like to recall the proposal I made a 
<br />
few months ago about extending the Cosmological Principle to the MW. I'll 
<br />
provide some background first by recalling that the conventional Cosmological 
<br />
Principle, assumes that in the large scale, the properties of the Universe 
<br />
are identical everywhere, and that no matter &quot;where&quot; we are, the universe 
<br />
looks approximately the same in every direction. (This principle has been 
<br />
extended by Bondi and Gold in the Steady State Theory: The Universe looks the 
<br />
same no matter &quot;when&quot; we look at it. Recent advances in cosmology have shown 
<br />
that the Universe actually does not look the same in every direction and at 
<br />
any time. A reason for these variations is that these variations are 
<br />
&quot;fact-like&quot;  and the size of the sample or field of view that we are 
<br />
observing is not large enough. 
<br />
So I propose to make the size of the field of view as large as the MW. The 
<br />
Cosmological Principle thus extended, then state that the MW looks identical 
<br />
from any point in the MW. Rephrasing this in terms of probabilities of life 
<br />
and death: From the PERSPECTIVE OF THE OBSERVER The probability of continued 
<br />
life for a 25 year old OBSERVER is identical to the probability of continued 
<br />
life for of a 100 year old very sick OBSERVER. 
<br />
<br />Going back to the independence of scale concept discussed in terms of picking 
<br />
the right scale for the Bayesian probability problem. It appears that the 
<br />
expected values for continued life for the young and old man are identical 
<br />
just like the expected value for the money in the boxes. I don't know how far 
<br />
this analogy can be carried. However, the point is that the frame of 
<br />
reference must be selected from the point of view of the OBSERVER.  The MW 
<br />
will then appear to be identical on the &quot;&quot;large scale.&quot;&quot; (This is an 
<br />
understatement? :-))
<br />
<br />Cheers! Don't worry about the path not taken. You took it. 
<br />
<br />George
