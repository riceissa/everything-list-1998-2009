Hi Brian,
<br />
<br />Le 10-avr.-08, à 04:35, Brian Tenneson a écrit :
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's not a new idea, no. However, I find the classical logic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restriction to make set theories with a universal set as unnatural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (e.g., some automatically sacrifice choice) as one that uses FL might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem to others.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Although I feel certainly being a platonist with respect to the  
<br />
arithmetical reality and machines, I am not sure about sets. The notion  
<br />
of set is far too rich.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mainly want to know if Russel type paradoxes are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely universal,
</em><br />
<br />It is hard for me to figure out what you mean here. In both NF, or in  
<br />
computability theory you can give meaning to V is-in V. In Quine New  
<br />
Foundation you have model with V-is-in V, but nobody knows if NF is  
<br />
consistent. In computability V is-in V (for example the universal  
<br />
dovetailer does run the universal dovetailer), and this does not lead  
<br />
to paradoxes or contradictions but only to infinities or non stopping  
<br />
machines.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; which would be interesting, in all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generalizations of classical logic or even logics without excluded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; middle.  W/o Em, I think no paradoxes are even paradoxes, though.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Boring w/o Em?)
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not as interesting when one changes logic, maybe to some.  But to me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changing the logic, it's like non Euclidean geometry.  Why assume (not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you, but the mathematical masses) that non-classical logic need be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uninteresting?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I wrote in some paper that the beauty of classical logic is that it  
<br />
forces us to see the beauty of non-classical logics.
<br />
Classical logic is the simpler and common way to describe what is a  
<br />
non-classical logic. Like common sense is the best tool to go beyond  
<br />
common sense.
<br />
You will not find a fuzzy book on fuzzy logic, with fuzzy theorems and  
<br />
fuzzy price.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It seems to have been quite opposed until recently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (ie, basically less than a century).
</em><br />
<br />Even that could be a matter of debate, but ok: formal non classical  
<br />
logic is a recent development. Yet there is a sense to say that very  
<br />
old mathematics and engineering were primarily intuitionistic.  
<br />
Classical logic could be attributed to the greeks. The main power of  
<br />
classical logic is that it allows the possibility of having partial  
<br />
information, and allowing ignorance. It makes possible the theological  
<br />
reasoning.
<br />
I guess you know Garden's proof of the existence of irrational numbers  
<br />
x y such that x^y is rational. It illustrates how simple and powerful  
<br />
and tolerant classical logic can be. But Garden's proof can be replaced  
<br />
by a constructive proof. Yet this one is hard and can be communicated  
<br />
only to expert in number theory. Then, in theoretical computer science,  
<br />
and even more in theoretical artificial intelligence, most proofs are  
<br />
*necessarily* not constructive. Those vast landscape are threw away, or  
<br />
made less accessible when you weaken the logic.
<br />
Also, most weakened logics can get some sense by having epistemical  
<br />
interpretations in classical logic. It is one of the main use of  
<br />
(classical) modal logic.
<br />
In my (humble) opinion: believing that a non-classical logic can be  
<br />
&quot;fundamental&quot; or absolute is the same as Berkeley, Wittgenstein,  or  
<br />
Brouwer's type of mistake: mainly to confuse the unknown reality with  
<br />
one of its many mode of apprehension. Like in &quot;esse est percipi&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have been mainly working on different approaches recently.  Now I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to stay in classical logic and challenge your valid objections
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to Tegmark-like mathematizations of physics, based on Russell-style
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lines of thought.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The idea is that a non-well founded set theory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where a set could easily be an element of itself, is all I really need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to resolve (seemingly?) the objections.
</em><br />
<br />With the comp assumption we do not need more that the fact that some  
<br />
number n belongs to the domain of the nth partial functions (n is-in  
<br />
W_n, or f_n(n) converges). Now I have no conceptual objection against  
<br />
non-well founded set theories.
<br />
Hmmm .... except that I don't really believe in sets, ...
<br />
<br />It is ok if you like sets. I am personally problem driven, and try to  
<br />
avoid discussion on theories. They are like people who discuss days  
<br />
after days about which programming language is the better and who never  
<br />
programs, or like people who discuss about which car they like the most  
<br />
and never drive.
<br />
A theory is just a source of light to see in the dark 'reality', and  
<br />
should not be confused with the &quot;reality&quot; itself. Except in  
<br />
metamathematics were the (formal or mechanical) theories are the object  
<br />
under study. (yes theories and machine also belong to &quot;reality&quot;). In  
<br />
that case, they are all interesting a priori. For me, axiomatic set  
<br />
theories are just good examples of very strong lobian machine, capable  
<br />
of knowing the whole of the &quot;theology&quot; of much simpler lobian machine  
<br />
like Peano arithmetic. (Lobian machine are, roughly speaking, universal  
<br />
machine capable of knowing that they are universal; they obey Lob's  
<br />
theorem (a generalisation of Godel's theorem). Such machine knows that  
<br />
thay are terribly ignorant: Lob's theorem is a self-modesty result.
<br />
<br />I love machine for their unbounded imagination ...
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hi Brian,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Your idea of a universal set, in case it works, would indeed meet one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the objection I often raised against Tegmark-like approaches,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that the whole of mathematical reality cannot be defined as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical object. Of course this is debatable, and a case can been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; made that such a universal set can exist (see the Forster reference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; below).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Nevertheless I have no clues why do you want such an universal set to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be fuzzy, except perhaps by the analogy which can exist between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; empirical multiverse and some sort of fuzzy physical universe. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; problem with fuzzy set is that there are many approaches, and they do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not seem to converge on some standard apprehension. Perhaps you know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; better. Have you written a longer text?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now, once you assume the computationalist hypothesis in the cognitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; science (NOT in the physical science!) and once you are aware of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mind-body problem (or the first person/third person relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; problem) then you will be confronted with my other objections to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Tegmark, mainly the fact that the mind-body problem is still somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; put under the rug. I suggest you read my texts (url below, or see the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Archive of this list) for appreciating that a universal structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; definitely cannot exist. Like in Plotinus or Cantor the big whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cannot be made first order citizen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Of  course with comp (actually with only Church's Thesis) we do have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some &quot;universal structure&quot; like the universal *machine* or the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal dovetailer, and those are embedded in the structure they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; deploy. That is why comp works. But of course a universal machine does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not describe a universal set in your sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; For the existence of a universal set in the context of Quine New
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Foundation set theory (NF) I suggest you consult the book by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; T. E. FORSTER, Set Theory with a Universal Set. Oxford Science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Publications, 1992. Oxford.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Le 23-mars-08, à 05:46, Brian Tenneson a écrit :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I would tend to think that most mathematicians and even more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; physicists and even more engineers and even more laymen would say  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 'just' is a huge, huge understatement.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; However, from the perspective of Non-Classical logic (be it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; paraconsistent or fuzzy), that sentence was perfectly formulated, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; my humble opinion, and that article was not written with all forms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; non-classical logic in mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; What I need to show is that the answer is different or the same in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; MV-Algebras.  My guess is looking at just [0,1], as proofs done in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; [0,1] can sometimes be carried over to all MV-algebras using Chang's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; theorems, mentioned above, which connect just [0,1] to all of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; types of fuzzy logics, would be a big step towards settling my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; investigation for all MV-algebras.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words, I want to investigate Russell's &quot;paradox&quot; for as many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; types of logic that already have been developed, to determine how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;true&quot; Russell's &quot;paradox&quot; is for any logic that is not binary logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know, it could be false in +all+ logics that could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; reasonably called logics or, more interestingly to me, true in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; but not all.  Then, in that event, the investigation would be to find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; out in which logics Russell's Theorem (ie, no universal set exists in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that logic-set-theory combo) is true and in which is false.  Then I'd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; like to know why Russell's Theorem is true sometimes and why not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; sometimes.  Or why it's always true.  Why being the main question for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; me.  I think the physicist would mainly be interested in whether any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; universal (fuzzy) sets can consistently exist, and the logician more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; interested in why it exists.  However, why it exists is, I think,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting to the philosopher in that it is like asking &quot;why does  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; universe exist&quot; assuming the MUH and that any universal sets can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; consistently exist.
