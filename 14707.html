I find that words and their meaning can have magical properties, despite
<br />
this discussion not seeming to me to have bearing on my article; perhaps a
<br />
new thread on semantics can be started?  It matters not to me.
<br />
<br />For example, if I say all that is is all that is, then I am not really
<br />
saying much.  On the other hand, if I say that all that is is the universe
<br />
generated by a universal set then at least that has some content as
<br />
evaluatable as true, false, neither, or neither of what's prior to this
<br />
truth value, or neither of what's prior to this truth value, or neither of
<br />
what's prior to this truth value, or neither of what's prior to this truth
<br />
value, or neither of what's prior to this truth value, or neither of what's
<br />
prior to this truth value, or neither of what's prior to this truth value,
<br />
or neither of what's prior to this truth value, or neither of what's prior
<br />

<br />
value, or neither of what's prior to this truth value, or neither of what's
