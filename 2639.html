<br />I am happy you see that COMP implies Indeterminacy + MW.

reduced to extracting the physical laws for the measure

shape of QM. And it shows that COMP entails SE is SE is correct.
<br />
<br />And Church thesis entails constraints which made that measure

isolation possible. (Even by pure self-observation or by interviewing
<br />
the self-observing universal machine).

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have  reached almost the same conclusion, that our consciousness come 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an ensemble of more or less identical &quot;points&quot; or states in the plenitude 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;thickness&quot; of this ensemble is a measure of  the Heisenberg 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uncertainty. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difference is that you call them &quot;computation.&quot; I view them more as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instantaneous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;static entities which are logically connected to each other. Maybe we could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;resolve this issue by saying that I focus on the points of the graph and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you, on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the links :-)
</em><br />
<br />I also use the COMP hypothesis which help by giving both TEs, and
<br />
precise mathematical theories. It is frequent that focusing on point
<br />
and focusing on links are related by dualities. With the Z logics the
<br />
links are really topological. I think I have shown a way to derive
<br />
the thickness from the turing-tropic views.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [BM] Locally a brain/body/universe only makes it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; possible for a person (the one conscious) to accelerate himself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relatively to its most probable possible extensions. Note that this gives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a role to consciousness : self-speeding up abilities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And this is linked to another result by Godel. If you add an undecidable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; true statement to the theory (in which that sentence is undecidable), not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; only an infinity of new formula become decidable, but an infinity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; provable formula get shorter proofs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You are accelerating too fast for me... I don't understand this at all.
</em><br />
<br />You just need some knowledge in mathematical logics. I will think for
<br />
a good book. (Godel speed-up paper is in the Davis 65).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Merging is allowed through amnesia. In some sense personal memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; help you to stay into no merging histories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I smell a whiff of third person thinking. I'll say something,  then I'll 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;retract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it because I just don't have the words to say it straight. An observer in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;who has a  &quot;false&quot; memory (of something that did not happen in world A),  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the same mental state as an observer in world B who has a true memory ( of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something that happended in world B). The two observers are in exactly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;identical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;states, even though their &quot;shared histories&quot; are different. 
</em><br />
<br />OK...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The point is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their mental states are the same, they have the same consciousness,  they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;really the same observer and they are really in the same world.
</em><br />
<br />The observer defines the worlds in which they live. The expression &quot;an
<br />
observer is or belongs in a universe&quot; is not well defined with comp.
<br />
if the false memory has a bad influence relatively to a non negligeable
<br />
set of consistent continuation for an observer, then and only then that 
<br />
&quot;false memory&quot; has a (relative) meaning and *is* indeed relatively
<br />
false.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now I can retract what I said. There is no world A and B and there is no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shared
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;history. The important thing is only the current state of the observer(s). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;extensions to the observer are fuzzy.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But they are relatively real and why not consider them 
<br />
important too especially when one want understand the 
<br />
laws of physics from them.
<br />
The set of consistent extensions is perhaps fuzzy, but they are 
<br />
mathematically well defined (with some assumptions).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Precisely. With respect to us!. We are the machine....it's a vicious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;circle...we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are self emergent...Not only is our world anthropically defined, but we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ourselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also are....
</em><br />
<br />Turing-tropic instead. That the simple shift I do. There is a nice
<br />
mathematical way to interview the self introspecting honest machine.
<br />
(BTW and by Solovay there are *two* nice utterly non trivial ways).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your use of the words &quot;shared histories&quot; partially seem to carry some old
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fashioned baggage from the days when time was thought to be linear. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yet you do accept the concept of bifurcation and merging...
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't understand. The guys after the self-duplication in W M share their
<br />
life stories until the duplication. I talk of sharing because of 
<br />
bifurcation,
<br />
and merging.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Can conventional mechanics support consciousness spliting and merging? I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think so.
</em><br />
<br />That would just mean conventional mechanics is incompatible with comp.
<br />
That is quite possible. QM *is* compatible with comp, perhaps even
<br />
a consequence.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The point is that merging seems to be possible but splitting is difficult. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could have splitting of consciousness, if, instead of considering 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a single point represented by definite states, you are willing to consider 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a fuzzy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;region comprised of a multitude of points.
</em><br />
<br />This is exactly what happen with comp. Consciousness is represented by
<br />
the set of all consistent extensions. That gives, it seems, the right
<br />
&quot;fuzzy region&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This type of consciousness fuzzy region)  would make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indeterminacy MANDATORY! In practice the existence of this fuzzy region is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hinted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at by Planck's constant.
</em><br />
<br />Why mandatory? Not planck constant but the existence of planck
<br />
constant is related with the fact that comp entails that if we look
<br />
below our level of substitution we can get information from the
<br />
proximate &quot;parallel&quot; computational histories.
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
<br />
<br />PS I get the following &quot;Re: Transporter Paradox&quot;. It seems 
<br />
at first sight you just
<br />
affirm comp is false there. 
<br />
<br />for exemple you wrote:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the transporter was perfect, then,  obviously,  the copies would have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perfect. This means they would have to include all their extensions which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;includes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;clothing, close environments and far environments. To be rigorous, let's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;say that all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the environment withing a light cone of the observer is reproduced by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;transporter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such that no information can possibly be lost.
</em><br />
<br />This just mean you put the level very low. But comp just say that 
<br />
there is a level such that a perfect transporter exists in principle.
<br />
The UD will patiently
<br />
get it and simulate you (infinitely often) + all the infinitely 
<br />
many variations ...
<br />
To make comp false there would be no level at all!
<br />
<br />The rest of your post is incorrect. Either comp is right and then
<br />
the UD will emulate all correct &quot;transporter&quot; or comp is false and
<br />
then what I say does not follow ... so &quot;easily&quot; indeed!.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno's assumption that indeterminacy can be deduced from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;COMP is faulty.
</em><br />
<br />You change your mind but I don't see why. I guess you belief
<br />
(momentarily I hope) that I pretend comp true. I never do that.
<br />
I just pretend that if comp is true *then* physics is eventually
<br />
a branch of machine's theology, biology, psychology (choose your word).
<br />
Once comp is true the DU duplicates exactly infinitely often
<br />
and with the invariance lemma your anticipation (including f=ma)
<br />
are determind by the topological structure of that set of
<br />
consistent continuations.
