Maudlin's point is that the causal structure has no physical role, so  
<br />
if you maintain the association of consciousness with the causal,  
<br />
actually computational structure, you have to abandon the physical  
<br />
supervenience. Or you reintroduce some magic, like if neurons have  
<br />
some knowledge of the absence of some other neurons, to which they are  
<br />
not related, during some computations.
<br />
But read the movie graph which shows the same thing without going  
<br />
through the question of the counterfactuals. If you believe that  
<br />
consciousness supervene on the physical implementation, or even just  
<br />
one universal machine computation, then you will associate  
<br />
consciousness to a description of that computation. but the  
<br />
description, although containing the genuine information is just not a  
<br />
computation at all. It miss the logical relation between the steps,  
<br />
made possible by the universal machine. So you can keep on with  
<br />
mechanism only by associating consciousness with the logical,  
<br />
immaterial, relation between the states. from inside they are  
<br />
infinitely many such relations, and this means the physical has to  
<br />
supervene on the sum of those relations &quot;as seen from inside&quot;. By  
<br />
Church thesis and self-reference logic, they have a non trivial,  
<br />
redundant, structure.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, I hadn't been able to find Maudlin's paper online, but I finally  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; located a pdf copy in a post from this list at <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg07657.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg07657.html</a>

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  ...now that I read it I see the argument is distinct from Chalmers'  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Does a Rock Implement Every Finite-State Automaton&quot;, although they  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are thematically similar in that they both deal with difficulties in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defining what it means for a given physical system to &quot;implement&quot; a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given computation. Chalmers' idea was that the idea of a rock  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implementing every possible computer program could be avoided if we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined an &quot;implementation&quot; in terms of counterfactuals, but Maudlin  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argues that this contradicts the &quot;supervenience thesis&quot; which says  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that &quot;the presence or absence of inert, causally isolated objects  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot effect the presence or absence of phenomenal states  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; associated with a system&quot;, since two systems may have different  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterfactual structures merely by virtue of an inert subsystem in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one which *would have* become active if the initial state of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system had been slightly different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that there might be ways of defining &quot;causal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure&quot; which don't depend on counterfactuals, though. One idea I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had is that for any system which changes state in a lawlike way over  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time, all facts about events in the system's history can be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; represented as a collection of propositions, and then causal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure might be understood in terms of logical relations between  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions, given knowledge of the laws governing the system. As  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an example, if the system was a cellular automaton, one might have a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collection of propositions like &quot;cell 156 is colored black at time- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step 36&quot;, and if you know the rules for how the cells are updated on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each time-step, then knowing some subsets of propositions would  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allow you to deduce others (for example, if you have a set of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions that tell you the states of all the cells surrounding  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cell 71 at time-step 106, in most cellular automata that would allow  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you to figure out the state of cell 71 at the subsequent time-step  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 107). If the laws of physics in our universe are deterministic than  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you should in principle be able to represent all facts about the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state of the universe at all times as a giant (probably infinite)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of propositions as well, and given knowledge of the laws,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowing certain subsets of these propositions would allow you to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deduce others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Causal structure&quot; could then be defined in terms of what logical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relations hold between the propositions, given knowledge of the laws  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; governing the system. Perhaps in one system you might find a set of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; four propositions A, B, C, D such that if you know the system's  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws, you can see that A&amp;B imply C, and D implies A, but no other  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposition or group of propositions in this set of four are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sufficient to deduce any of the others in this set. Then in another  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system you might find a set of four propositions X, Y, Z and W such  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that W&amp;Z imply Y, and X implies W, but those are the only deductions  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can make from within this set. In this case you can say these  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two different sets of four propositions represent instantiations of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same causal structure, since if you map W to A, Z to B, Y to C,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and D to X then you can see an isomorphism in the logical relations.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's obviously a very simple causal structure involving only 04  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events, but one might define much more complex causal structures and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then check if there was any subset of events in a system's history  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that matched that structure. And the propositions could be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restricted to ones concerning events that actually did occur in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system's history, with no counterfactual propositions about what  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have happened if the system's initial state had been different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thinking in this way, it's not obvious that Maudlin is right when he  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumes that the original &quot;Olympia&quot; defined on p. 418-419 of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paper cannot be implementing a unique computation that gives rise to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complex conscious experiences. It's true that the armature itself is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not responding in any way to the states of successive troughs it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; passes over, but there is an aspect of the setup that might give the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system a nontrivial causal structure, namely the fact that certain  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; troughs may be connected to other by pipes to other troughs in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequence, so that as the armature empties or fills one it is also  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emptying or filling the one it's connected to (this is done to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emulate the idea of a Turing machine's read/write head returning to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same memory address multiple times, even though Olympia's  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; armature just steadily progresses down the line of troughs in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequence--troughs connected by pipes are supposed to represent a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single memory address). If we represented the Olympia system as a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of propositions about the state of each trough and the position  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the armature at each time-step, then the fact that the armature's  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interaction with one trough changes the state of another trough the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; armature won't visit until a later step may be enough to give  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different programs markedly different causal structures, in spite of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact that the armature itself is just dumbly moving from one  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trough to the next.
