Hi Barry,
<br />
<br /><br />Le 18-déc.-07, à 18:52, Barry Brent a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno--
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ahh, my amateur status is nakedly exposed. I'm going to expose my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confusion even further now.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is the courageous attitude of the authentic scientists.
<br />
I like &quot;amateur&quot; because they have less prejudices, they have inner
<br />
motivations, and rarely follow authoritative arguments.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Never heard of a universal language.  I thought I was familiar with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Church's thesis, but apparently no.
</em><br />
<br /><br />As I said a while ago, coming back from an international meeting on
<br />
computability (in Siena, where my Plotinus' paper has been accepted), I
<br />
got the feeling that few people really grasp Church Thesis, including 
<br />
some
<br />
&quot;experts&quot;.
<br />
My &quot;Brussels thesis&quot; has been criticized  for being too much pedagogical
<br />
on Church thesis, but each time people try to debunk my work, soon
<br />
enough I realize they have a problem with Godel or Church, never (yet) 
<br />
with
<br />
my contribution.
<br />
The worst is that most people *feel* at ease with CT but apparently are 
<br />
not.
<br />
I take as an honor to explain this too you, I *do* appreciate your work 
<br />
in
<br />
Number Theory, as far as I understand it. Possible links could emerge.
<br />
(You make me discover also the nice paper on &quot;prime percolation&quot; by 
<br />
Vardi:
<br />
I love percolation. Not just because I am an amateur of good coffe, but 
<br />
because
<br />
exact percolation problem have led to the Temperley Lieb 
<br />
algebra/category; which
<br />
makes links between knot theory, combinators/lambda-calculus, quantum
<br />
computations, and eventually number theory, if not the number 24 
<br />
itself).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I thought it was the claim that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two or three or four concepts (including recursive function and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable function) were extensionally equivalent.  I have heard of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the lambda calculus, but I don't know what it is, or what its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connection is with Church's thesis.  I have a rough guess, based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what you're saying.  I'm surprised.  I imagine that the claim of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of a universal language must be made in the context of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory of languages?  Never heard of that theory.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This happens because the expression &quot;theory of languages&quot; is used in
<br />
the context of &quot;non universal languages&quot;, like in the Chomsky hierarchy 
<br />
of
<br />
languages for example. Universal languages and machines appears in
<br />
what is called &quot;computability theory&quot; or &quot;recursion theory&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, if I  imagine such a theory, it must involve both syntax and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; semantics, yes?  Semantics connects a language to a world, right?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (The experts are cringing, I'm sure....)  Can one language encompass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all possible worlds?  Can't we imagine worlds, the structures of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which are so dissonant, that their languages could never be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistently subsumed under some single larger (&quot;universal&quot;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language?  (More cringing, no doubt....)  Or, is it that when we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restrict the worlds in question to some suitable realm--say, numbers--
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all these things work out?  (Cringes redoubled!)  I can imagine other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ways out.  Maybe we're concerned with just one world, suitably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described.  Maybe structural inconsistencies of possible worlds are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no more an impediment to being expressible in one language than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical inconsistencies?  (But how do we know?)
</em><br />
<br /><br />We have to distinguish logic and computability. In logic we will have
<br />
language in which sentences are to be interpreted in some world/model.
<br />
But in computability we can go very far by just interpreting them in 
<br />
some
<br />
procedural way. The expressions in computer language are really basic
<br />
instruction like in the coffee-bar machine. Eventually we can describe 
<br />
them
<br />
all in term of NAND gates, delay and electrical current.
<br />
A computing language is then universal if all computable functions 
<br />
(from N
<br />
to N, or from finite things coded in N to finite things coded in N) can 
<br />
be
<br />
computed by following a finite set of instructions in the language.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What about cardinality? From your remarks, I imagine that the number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of elementary symbols in any language, including the universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language, is supposed to be finite,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; so that the set of algorithms is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; countable?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. And so are the computable functions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If there are lots of worlds and languages, I wonder how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people make that work.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Because all the languages or machines which have been
<br />
invented for computing (computable) functions from N to N, have
<br />
been shown equivalent, and that the closure of the set of computable
<br />
functions by those machines, for the (transcendental) diagonalization
<br />
procedure, give a powerful argument that those language/machine
<br />
are universal.
<br />
Careful: they are universal with respect to the class of computable
<br />
functions. They are not universal with respect to the propositions they
<br />
can express or prove. A universal language/machine is not a theory.
<br />
Most universal language don't even have a way to assert propositions,
<br />
just some sort of commands (cf the coffee-bar instructions as example).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is such a language going to be adequate for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expressing propositions about all possible worlds?  How do we know?
</em><br />
<br /><br />In computing, well ... like in Number theory, there is only one &quot;world&quot;,
<br />
the world of natural numbers. But universal language just describes
<br />
functions from N to N. Propositions will occur when we will introduce
<br />
basic beliefs in the machine. Such beliefs will NEVER be universal.
<br />
Universality is a computability notion. By Godel, no theories can be
<br />
universal with respect of provability.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My poor excuse is, I've only been on this list a little while, and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made my (sketchy) acquaintance with these ideas a very long time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ago.  Sorry if I'm way off topic.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think you are quite in the topic. To explain a bit of my
<br />
work (and related TOE things) I have to provide some
<br />
help for people to distinguish clearly many things which are quite 
<br />
different
<br />
but which are also deeply related. It is the relation in between those
<br />
notions which are important. They are often confused.
<br />
Those notions are (forgetting the most important one &quot;truth&quot;):
<br />
<br />- Computability (the only one which has a possible notion of 
<br />
universality)
<br />
- Provability (which *can* be universal with respect to computability,
<br />
but which is never universal with respect to provability of 
<br />
propositions).
<br />
This will be illustrated with the notion of &quot;lobian machine&quot;.
<br />
- Knowability (which can be proved equivalent extensionally with
<br />
provability, but will appears to have quite different intensional 
<br />
logics)
<br />
- Observability (the same remark applies).
<br />
- Sensibility
<br />
Etc.
<br />
<br />More later ... I will come back on the &quot;key post&quot; asap.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tell me to go look it up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhere, or stop wasting time, if you want to...
</em><br />
<br />Actually I'm afraid your are just motivating me for trying to be 
<br />
clearer and
<br />
simpler. You are the one helping here, but feel free to organize your
<br />
computability-time as
<br />
you have to.
<br />
<br /><br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
