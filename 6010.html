Hi Jesse:
<br />
<br />At 03:31 AM 12/18/2004, you wrote:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think it would be simpler if you responded directly to quotes from my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;previous post, rather than just making general statements about issues 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;raised in that post. For example, here you continue to *assert* that there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is something inherently time-based about logical statements, but you don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in any way explain what is wrong with my counterargument from that post:
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was still having reading difficulties with my new lenses so this was 
<br />
easier for me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;'The laws of logic need not be thought of as rules of &quot;discovery&quot;, they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can be thought of purely as expressing
</em><br />
<br />&quot;Expressing&quot; seems to be a time dependent process.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  static relationships between static truths, relationships that would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist regardless of whether anyone contemplated or &quot;discovered&quot; them.
</em><br />
<br />As are my kernels of information.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;For example, in every world where X and Y are simultaneously true, it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also true that X is true, even if no one notices this.'
</em><br />
<br />Sure,  That is a kernel.  Observation does not make a kernel a kernel.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Likewise, you didn't address my point that &quot;I can't think of any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;historical examples of new mathematical/scientific/philosophical ideas 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that require you to already  believe their premises in order to justify 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these premises&quot;,
</em><br />
<br />I believe Bruno said that some information systems included a set of 
<br />
beliefs.  As I recall the &quot;premises&quot; are these beliefs.  Justification 
<br />
comes from emotions [based on other beliefs] surrounding the resulting 
<br />
system such as simplicity, elegance of apparent explanation etc.   So it 
<br />
seems to me that justification is part of belief.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;and you didn't address my question about whether you think there could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a world/kernel where a vehicle simultaneously
</em><br />
<br />Again time inserts itself as the notion of &quot;simultaneously&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;had different numbers of wheels,
</em><br />
<br />If the world was a CA and half the applicable cells were in a two wheel 
<br />
state and half in a three wheel state what would that be?
<br />
<br />What would be the concept of number in such a place?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  or my question about whether, when you make statements about your theory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a whole like &quot;the information re the Nothing is in the All so they are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinitely nested&quot; you are assuming that the negation of these statements 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (in this case, 'the information re the Nothing is not in the All so they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are not infinitely nested') is false.
</em><br />
<br />See below
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Should we have the hubris to impose this somewhat questioned concept on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;all other universes?  In my view the states of all universes preexist in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the All [as some of the kernels] and &quot;Physical Reality&quot; washes over them 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in some sequentially inconsistent way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So do believe the statement &quot;the states of all universes don't preexist in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the All, and 'Physical Reality' does not wash over them in any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sequentially inconsistent way&quot; would be false? If so, it seems that you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;yourself have the &quot;hubris&quot; to apply the logical law of noncontradiction to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;statements about reality as a whole.
</em><br />
<br />I am just try to think of the simplest system that contains no information 
<br />
and yet has a dynamic that could support what might be the universe some 
<br />
may believe they inhabit.
<br />
<br />But then is there really a process like &quot;think&quot;?
<br />
<br />The All as I defined it [my current proposed belief] contains a kernel for 
<br />
the Nothing as well as a kernel for the All thus the nesting.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From the inside perspective we are forced to be in, all we have to justify 
<br />
such a belief system is our own beliefs re efficiency, beauty, etc. etc. so 
<br />
our beliefs justify our beliefs.  Is this not self referential?  I do not 
<br />
intend to impose that on the system as a whole.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I do not agree with your &quot;rather&quot; based cancelation of the residual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;information issue since I see it as an unnecessary complication of my own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;method.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;rather based cancellation.&quot; If you're 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;talking about my point that every statement could be simultaneously true 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and false if you throw out the laws of logic, obviously *I* don't believe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this is a good way to solve the &quot;residual information issue&quot;, since I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think it's nonsensical to allow logical contradictions. But since you seem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to be saying the laws of logic aren't absolute, I was just pointing out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that you would have no basis for denying that statements about reality can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be simultaneously true and false. If you say that it is an &quot;unnecessary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complication&quot; to allow statements about reality as a whole to be both true 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and false, then you are in effect saying it would be an unnecessary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complication to claim that the laws of logic don't apply to reality as a whole!
</em><br />
<br />I just believe in my own sense of neatness.  You gave two apparently 
<br />
contradictory statements which when put in the same pot seem to sum to what 
<br />
I propose for the whole system absent the &quot;rather&quot;.  I wish to avoid 
<br />
including our &quot;laws of logic&quot; as a necessary component of a kernel.
<br />
<br />Further a kernel contains information but the whole system does not so how 
<br />
does logic apply to the whole system in the first place.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Can a kernel of information be self inconsistent?  From Bruno's last post 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I think it is possible to impose this idea on the All.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't think Bruno's last post was really implying that &quot;everything&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be inconsistent, I thought his point was more that you can't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consider things like the collection of all possible sets to itself be a &quot;set&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;My current view is that each state of that dynamic has to be completely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;independent of the current state.
</em><br />
<br />My point is that it is more pleasing to think of the dynamic as being 
<br />
inconsistent [each state has no cause effect link of any sort to any other 
<br />
state] if there are other components of the All that are inconsistent.  But 
<br />
these are not really the same thing and I begin to think the latter is a 
<br />
side bar issue.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Does that mean you say the statement &quot;each state of the dynamic is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;completely dependent on the current state&quot; is false?
</em><br />
<br />I believe we should avoid applying logic to a zero internal information 
<br />
entity such as the All.  I believe this causes problems.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The way I describe this is to say that the dynamic is inconsistent.   It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;helps this idea if there are kernels that are pairwise inconsistent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't understand what this means--can you give a concrete example of two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;kernels that are pairwise inconsistent?
</em><br />
<br />Give this a try: One in which &quot;planets&quot; are naturally solid spheres and one 
<br />
in which &quot;planets&quot; are naturally Dyson spheres.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I think that is straight forward enough.   If there are kernels that are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;self inconsistent then all the better.  Why should they be selected out?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then why did you earlier say &quot;I am not ready to include a two wheeled 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tricycle that is simultaneously a one, three, or four wheeled tricycle&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />I opened this thread to test my beliefs.  This one seems to be in flux.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;As to does mathematics contain information, mathematics has the potential 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to erect boundaries so by my definition it is information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But doesn't *any* statement you make about reality as a whole, like &quot;each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state of that dynamic has to be completely independent of the current 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state&quot;, erect a &quot;boundary&quot; between itself and its negation, in this case 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;each state of the dynamic is completely dependent on the current state&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />I distinguish between actual boundaries and the potential to erect 
<br />
one.  The All is full of boundaries between kernels but has no potential to 
<br />
erect more.  In your &quot;dependent&quot; case one has to manage the dependency 
<br />
rules - a necessary potential to erect boundaries.
<br />
