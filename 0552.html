&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is from an email sent by Don Page, which he gave me
<br />
permission to post to this list.  He realizes that quantum immortality is
<br />
wrong, and that finding oneself to be old or to have survived suicide 
<br />
attempts would *not* be evidence for the MWI any more than for a one world
<br />
interpretation, due to the low measure.  I don't think he ever believed in
<br />
'quantum immortality' per se, but didn't fully think it through when he
<br />
wrote the original paper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope some people can learn from his objectivity and integrity in
<br />
admitting he made a mistake, and follow his example in dismissing 'quantum
<br />
immortality'.

<br />
<br />Dear Jacques,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your message.  Jerry Finkelstein had asked me how the  
<br />
evidence of one's living to 2100 would be any diferent from the evidence of  
<br />
getting any other low-measure result, which would occur in MWI.  (I suppose the  
<br />
only difference I see is that one would not be alive to be aware of the  
<br />
contrary evidence in other worlds.)  But this got me to realize that although  
<br />
the maverick worlds in which one would live to 2100 certainly exist in the MWI,  
<br />
they would have so low a measure that one experiencing it would be experiencing  
<br />
a very low typicality observation, which if one counts the typicality as the  
<br />
likelihood, as I argue one should do in my Sensible Quantum Mechanics papers,  
<br />
would be evidence agains the MWI just as strong as against the single-history  
<br />
version.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I agree with your criticism.  I had been waitng to change the paper  
<br />
until I got the referee's report back, but then today I got a message saying it  
<br />
was too long to be sent out to referees, so I shortened it and also replaced it  
<br />
at LANL, as you saw from my previous message.  (I also thanked you for  
<br />
discussions.)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On your last comment, about the anthropic principle, I agree that many  
<br />
have been saying that one should weight by the number of observers (and I cite  
<br />
several of them in my paper).  But I have not seen anywhere published the  
<br />
simple observation that one does not get this in single-history QM for choosing  
<br />
between different possible histories.  (Of course it does work for different  
<br />
parts of one history, and I alluded to that in my discussion of the paper of  
<br />
Martel, Shapiro, and Weinberg.)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was interesting that you referred to Smolin on the anthropic  
<br />
principle.  He attacked it on page 205 of his book under the assumption that it  
<br />
would produce the least amount of life possible, which is what one would get  
<br />
from a single-history theory in which one just takes the conditional  
<br />
probability that life exists, without any further weighting by the amount of  
<br />
life or consciousness.  I'll attach a message I sent to him shortly after  
<br />
writing my paper.  He gave only a very short response that did not address the  
<br />
issues I raised, which may or may not indicate that he did not violently  
<br />
disagree with what I had written.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks again for your comments.  I'm not sure when I'll have time to  
<br />
answer your objections to the combining religion with the MWI, and I'm afraid  
<br />
I've forgotten what the objections were (except for a vague memeory that it had  
<br />
something to do with the problem of evil, which certainly is a problem with  
<br />
almost any worldview but hasn't been taken as fatal by most adherents of  
<br />
religion).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best wishes,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don
<br />
