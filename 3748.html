<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The intriguing suggestion of Tegmark (1996) that the universe---contrary

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to all our experiences and expectations---contains only a small amount of

</em><br />
<br />I wasn't too impressed by this paper.  I'm surprised it is getting
<br />
published.
<br />
<br />One thing to note is that the paper of Tegmark's which is getting
<br />
criticized is not the one we usually comment on, which proposes
<br />
that all mathematical structures exist and some contain conscious
<br />
beings.  Instead it is another paper which adopts the Many Worlds
<br />
Interpretation (MWI) and argues that the universe is consistent with a
<br />
cosmological model where the Big Bang was in an extremely simple state.
<br />
Then quantum fluctuations, which can be thought of as a consequence of
<br />
the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, will become naturally amplified
<br />
through gravitational instability and decohere, producing separate
<br />
MWI branches of the universe.  The result is that an extremely simple
<br />
initial state can separate into a multitude of complicated branches,
<br />
each of which has its own intricate, detailed history.
<br />
<br />To digress, the MWI model of the universe is in contrast to others which
<br />
we have considered here, such as Schmidhuber's recent paper in which he
<br />
supposes that there must exist an underlying random number generator in
<br />
order to produce the vast amount of quantum information which seemingly
<br />
appears throughout space and time.  It seems curious to me when people
<br />
propose to accept that all universes exist but not that our own universe
<br />
is a many-worlds version of QM.
<br />
<br />In criticizing Tegmark, Circovic is really criticizing the MWI.
<br />
Most of his points are against that model rather than Tegmark's specific
<br />
application.  I think Tegmark's paper is really a very straightforward
<br />
application of the MWI and does not add too much new, other than the
<br />
recognition that the MWI does simplify the cosmological problem.
<br />
<br />The main technical point Circovic raises is the problem of black hole
<br />
evaporation, which appears to destroy information.  One of the basic
<br />
principles of QM is that time evolution is unitary, which is equivalent
<br />
in the MWI model to conservation of information.  Black hole evaporation,
<br />
to the limited degree it is understood today, appears to be non-unitary.
<br />
This would be inconsistent with the MWI and hence with Tegmark's proposal.
<br />
<br />However it is also inconsistent with other QM interpretations as well!
<br />
Black hole evaporation is an unsolved problem in QM and will require a
<br />
full theory of quantum gravity to be resolved.  Until that time it is
<br />
hardly fair to point to the problems that this phenomenon raises with
<br />
the MWI without mentioning that it also causes problems with other views.
<br />
<br />Circovic also raises some philosophical arguments, such as the proposed
<br />
experiments to test the MWI.  He refers to that paper by Plaga that
<br />
would supposedly allow inter-world communication, but I am convinced
<br />
that that is impossible.  Then there is the old proposal by Deutsch for
<br />
an intelligent, world-spanning conscious quantum computer, but IMO even
<br />
that will not resolve the question.  Either it will be impossible to
<br />
construct the required system, or if it is successful, then everyone
<br />
will agree that the outcome is what the MWI predicts while denying
<br />
the reality of other worlds.  All Deutsch is really doing is putting a
<br />
system into a superposition, and we do that all the time.  The system is
<br />
supposedly conscious, but it's a highly artificial system and is taking on
<br />
attributes which ordinary conscious brains cannot, so skeptics of the MWI
<br />
have many opportunities to distinguish this artificial state from a true
<br />
demonstration of the existence of parallel worlds.  Quantum computers
<br />
by themselves won't convince people and putting a supposed AI program
<br />
on one won't make any difference.
<br />
<br />Overall I think Circovic is aiming at the wrong target.  Most of his
<br />
arguments are directed against the MWI rather than Tegmark's paper.
<br />
If he presented them in that form I think they would be more appropriate
<br />
for publication in an appropriate journal.
