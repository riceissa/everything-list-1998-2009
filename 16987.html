<br />
Brent,
<br />
<br />So my first draft addressed many of the points you made, but it that
<br />
email got too big and sprawling I thought.
<br />
<br />So I've focused on what seems to me like the key passage from your
<br />
post.  If you think there was some other point that I should have
<br />
addressed, let me know.
<br />
<br />So, key passage:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do these mathematical objects &quot;really&quot; exist?  I'd say they have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logico-mathematical existence, not the same existence as tables and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chairs, or quarks and electrons.
</em><br />
<br />So which kind of existence do you believe is more fundamental?  Which
<br />
is primary?  Logico-mathematical existence, or quark existence?  Or
<br />
are they separate but equal kinds of existence?
<br />
<br />In what way, exactly, does logico-mathematical existence differ from
<br />
quark existence?  Is logico-mathematical existence a lesser kind of
<br />
existence?  Is logico-mathematical existence derivative of and
<br />
dependant on quark existence?
<br />
<br />Further, do tables and chairs even have the same kind of existence as
<br />
quarks and electrons?  A table is something that we perceive visually,
<br />
but we intellectually take &quot;tables&quot; to be ultimately and fully
<br />
reducible to &quot;quarks and electrons&quot;.   So chairs and quarks certainly
<br />
exist at different levels.  Quarks would seem to be more fundamental
<br />
than chairs.  But obviously we don't actually perceive quarks or
<br />
electrons...instead we infer their existence from our actual
<br />
perceptions of various types of experimental equipment and from there
<br />
associate them back with tables.
<br />
<br />As for our experience of logico-mathematical objects, we certainly can
<br />
translate them into more &quot;chair-like&quot; perceptions by visualization via
<br />
computer programs, right?  This would put them very much on similar
<br />
footing with our experience of quarks and electrons at least, which we
<br />
also only visualize via computer reconstructions.
<br />
<br />And, presumably it is possible for a human with exceptional
<br />
visualization abilities to experience logico mathematical objects in a
<br />
way that is even more &quot;chair-like&quot; than that.  For instance, there are
<br />
people with Synesthesia (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia</a>),
<br />
for whom some letters or numbers are perceived as inherently colored,
<br />
or for whom numbers, months of the year, and/or days of the week
<br />
elicit precise locations in space (for example, 1980 may be &quot;farther
<br />
away&quot; than 1990).
<br />
<br />But what if this type of synesthesia had some use that strongly aided
<br />
in human survival and reproduction?  Then (speaking in materialist
<br />
terms) as we evolved synesthesia would have become a standard feature
<br />
for humans and would now be considered just part of our normal sensory
<br />
apparatus.  We would be able to &quot;sense&quot; numbers in a way similar to
<br />
how we sense chairs.  In this case we would almost certainly consider
<br />
numbers to be unquestionably objectively real and existing.  Though
<br />
maybe we would ponder their peculiar qualities, in the same way we now
<br />
puzzle over the strangeness of quantum mechanics.
<br />
<br />A further example:
<br />
<br />&quot;Autistic savant Daniel Tammet shot to fame when he set a European
<br />
record for the number of digits of pi he recited from memory (22,514).
<br />
&nbsp;For afters, he learned Icelandic in a week. But unlike many savants,
<br />
he's able to tell us how he does it.
<br />
<br />Q.  But how do you visualise a number? In the same way that I
<br />
visualise a giraffe?
<br />
<br />A.  Every number has a texture. If it is a &quot;lumpy&quot; number, then
<br />
immediately my mind will relate it to other numbers which are lumpy -
<br />
the lumpiness will tell me there is a relationship, there is a common
<br />
divisor, or a pattern between the digits.
<br />
<br />Q. Can you give an example of a &quot;lumpy&quot; number?
<br />
<br />A.  For me, the ideal lumpy number is 37. It's like porridge. So 111,
<br />
a very pretty number, which is 03 times 37, is lumpy but it is also
<br />
round. It takes on the properties of both 37 and 3, which is round.
<br />
It's an intuitive and visual way of doing maths and thinking about
<br />
numbers.  For me, the ideal lumpy number is 37. It's like porridge.&quot;
<br />
<br />I think we can say (again, speaking in materialist/physicalist terms)
<br />
that it's purely an accident of evolution that numbers don't seem as
<br />
intuitively real to us as chairs, or colors, or love, or free will
<br />
(ha!).
<br />
<br />Speaking in platonist terms, it's an accident of our particular
<br />
mental/symbolic structure that numbers don't seem as intuitively real
<br />
to us as chairs, or colors, or love, or free will (ha!).
<br />
<br />Speaking in computationalist terms, it's an accident of our
<br />
causal/representational/algorithmic structure that numbers don't seem
<br />
as intuitively real to us as chairs, or colors, or love, or free will
<br />
(ha!).
<br />
<br />But, no matter what terms you use, it's conceivable, and we have
<br />
significant evidence that points to the possibility, that our
<br />
conscious perceptions could be modified in a way such that numbers and
<br />
other abstractions would seem much more substantial and real than they
<br />
do currently, even as substantial and real as chairs and tables.  And
<br />
this wouldn't require any change in what actually exists or &quot;how&quot;
<br />
these things exists (logico-mathematical or otherwise).
<br />
<br />So based on all of the above, returning to your original statement:
<br />
<br />&quot;I'd say they have logico-mathematical existence, not the same
<br />
existence as tables and chairs, or quarks and electrons.&quot;
<br />
<br />I would say that most people PERCEIVE logico-mathematical objects
<br />
differently than they perceive tables and chairs, or quarks and
<br />
electrons.  But this doesn't tell us anything about whether these
<br />
things really have different kinds of existence.  That we perceive
<br />
them differently is just an accident of fate.
