Hi Godfrey,
<br />
<br />Le 17-août-05, à 19:20, kurtleegod.domain.name.hidden a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Not really, as far as you agree that classical physics can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extracted from quantum physics. My favorite unrigorous way: Feynman 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integral (see my paper:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/CC&amp;Q.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/CC&amp;Q.pdf</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a little summary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I did not say, nor do I believe, that one can extract the &quot;classical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world&quot; from QM, as I pointed out to Lee,
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. Now I agree with Lee, and many on the FOR and the Everything lists 
<br />
that Everett (many-worlds + decoherence already) constitutes a 
<br />
&quot;solution of the measurement problem&quot;. All measurements are just 
<br />
interaction, and then all states are relative. As I said, it seems to 
<br />
me that this is even more clear in the integral formulation of QM where 
<br />
F = ma can be deduced from the &quot;sum on all histories&quot;. But this is 
<br />
going a little bit out of topics, and is not needed to understand the 
<br />
comp derivation. We can come back on this latter.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but one can surely object to a &quot;third party&quot; theory from the fact that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it does not reproduce a classical world any better than quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanics. This is a complicated issue because:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (a) Classical physics does not explain the &quot;classical world&quot; either 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as it cannot account for the stability of matter, for instance,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which only QM explains.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (b) Quantum mechanics predicts some entirely macroscopic phenomena 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we do observe as part of the &quot;classical world&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  i.e. superfluidity of He, superconductivity, stability of the vaccuum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc...
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In other words: if I found a way of shooting down your theory in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way that would not obviously violate the correspondence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  limit of QM , it would shot down! That is what I am suggesting above. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But do not worry because I think you are a lot better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shot by QM.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />To anticipate a little bit, I think this will be hard. From comp you 
<br />
can deduce quickly the qualitative &quot;many-relative state/worlds&quot; 
<br />
feature, the no-cloning theorem, the appearance of indeterminacy. I 
<br />
told you Newtonian physics (with a single universe-history) would cause 
<br />
much more problem to my approach.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now my logistic COMPlaints about your COMP:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I have searched through your web site to see whether I could find a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; full statement of your hypothesis since you were not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  kind enough to reproduce it in the previous exchange. I don't read 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; French that well and your English paper is somewhat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sketchy on this, so I can only refer to what you state in the page :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.htm">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.htm</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  where I found what looks like a definition. My first objection is to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the following sentence:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  &quot;Definition: Classical Digital mechanism, or Classical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computationalism, or just comp, is the conjunction of the following 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; three sub-hypotheses:&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  after which you list three items which I will not reproduce here and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will just short as 1) YD for &quot;Yes-doctor&quot;, 2) CT for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Church Thesis and 3) AR for Arithmetic Realism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  My objection is that of these three only the first can genuinely be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; called an hypothesis!
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Ouh la la. You are close to the 1004 fallacy (asking for more precise 
<br />
definition than the reasoning itself). At the start you can use the 
<br />
term &quot;axioms&quot;, &quot;postulates&quot;, &quot;theses&quot;, &quot;premises&quot;, &quot;assumptions&quot;, 
<br />
&quot;hypotheses&quot;, etc.. in a similar way.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; CT, as the name indicates, is a Thesis which is most likely unprovable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but favored by overwhelming heuristic support.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not only overwhelming supports: there is the deep conceptual argument 
<br />
that Kleene has discovered when he failed to refute Church's 
<br />
&quot;definition&quot; of the computable functions. The argument is the closure 
<br />
of the set of partial computable functions for the most transcendental 
<br />
mathematical operation: diagonalization. Kleene invented the vocable 
<br />
&quot;Church thesis&quot;. The first to get Church's thesis is Emil Post (in the 
<br />
early 19-twenties).
<br />
<br />See (perhaps later) the diagonalization posts in this list (mentionned 
<br />
in my web page).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I know that there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  some people in the southern hemisphere who think that QComputation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could produce a counterexample to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  shoot it down (and perhaps it could) but you and I agree that it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unlikely.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And AR is a metaphysical position which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  happen to subscribe but which I would never fathom to try and prove 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or empirically test (nor do I have any idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on how to do it! Do you?)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, I have decided to put it explicitly, because, in front of my 
<br />
reasoning, some people cop out simply by saying &quot;Ah, but you are a 
<br />
platonist!&quot;. So I prefer to say it at once. I agree with you it is a 
<br />
sort of &quot;cop out&quot;. Now, although 99,99999999 % of the mathematician are 
<br />
platonist during the week, most like to pretends they are not (the 
<br />
week-end!).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Now I suppose that you need for these three things to be true for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rest of your argument to go. But I find that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  it is extremely unfair to force your most excellent hypothesis YD to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to stand in company of the other two to assert
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its merits!!! In other words as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1) YD is obviously independent from CT and AR
</em><br />
<br /><br />'course.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (2) CT and AR stand no chance of being falsified empirically (or we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both like them that way, which is the same).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I give the opportunity to make comp false in more than one way. If you 
<br />
read the Maudlin paper, you will see that he consider the YD doctor (or 
<br />
equivalent) as tautologically true (unlike the functionnalist 
<br />
hypothesis). This is due to the fact that, unlike many older 
<br />
computationalist or mechanist, I put no bound on the low-levelness of 
<br />
the substitution level.
<br />
I can say yes to the doctor provided that he simulates my brain at the 
<br />
chromodynamical level, including all partiocles having interacted with 
<br />
any other particles in the past (in which case my brain is the 
<br />
&quot;physical universe&quot; itself. My brain could be a quantum computer, 
<br />
without violating comp. The no-cloning theorem does not interfere.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (3) No one that we know has been able to extract conclusions such as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yours from CT &amp; AR without YD (right)
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is a subtle question. The *necessity* of the reversal is hardly 
<br />
understandable without the YD assumption. But once you grasp the 
<br />
necessity of the reversal, then the very derivation of natural science 
<br />
from computer science does not use it at all. Indeed the cognitive 
<br />
science's &quot;grand-mother&quot; is completely substituted by the Lobian 
<br />
Machine at this stage. So, with OCCAM razor, once enough of physics is 
<br />
derived, you can eliminate the grand-mother and the whole YD 
<br />
assumption. Some mathematician asked me to put the UDA argument under 
<br />
the form: motivation&quot;, and to state that my real &quot;scientific&quot; 
<br />
hypothesis are CT and AR. I find that dishonest and misleading, 
<br />
because, without understanding the necessity of the reversal, the 
<br />
interview of the Lobian machine would resemble to nothing but a little 
<br />
piece of pure mathematics, especially given that I have until now 
<br />
extracted to few real physics to really call OCCAM. All my papers 
<br />
introduce the grandmother (and YD), and then translate the argument in 
<br />
the Lobian language.
<br />
But then if the logics of the observables that  I have derived from 
<br />
comp (at the necessary place) appears to be von Neumann Quantum logics, 
<br />
I know people will eliminate the grandmother and the YD, for bad 
<br />
reasons (They want pure math, they hate cognitive science, etc.). My 
<br />
fear is that people take the epistemological elimination of the 
<br />
grand-mother (and the YD assumtion) as an ontological elimination of 
<br />
the first person, and nothing could be more wrong than that.
<br />
See the footnote 3. in the SANE paper, and the text
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  would you have any objections to us concentrating, from here on, on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your &quot;YD hypothesis&quot;?
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no problem with that. I am willing taking full responsability 
<br />
for the YD hypothesis, even if at some points we can forget it, as I 
<br />
explain above.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I am saying this because I actually think that it is the real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting and original part of your proposal
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Actually I agree. But the YD hypothesis with fixed (high) level of 
<br />
substitution is the everyday bread of cognitive science since Plato.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  need those two other huge &quot;body guards&quot; which I happen to be friends 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with. OK?
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If you agree with this I may have something interesting to tell you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about your idea that you have not anticipated!
</em><br />
<br /><br />I'm very curious!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please,don't COMP out! Say &quot;yes&quot;, Doctor Bruno!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, the real Doctor is Stathis Papanoiannou, in this list ;-)
<br />
<br />Let me comment your last post also.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Thanks for your assent on this. I am sure that CT and AR are needed, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at some point, for your really outrageous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  conclusions. But I am sure you agree that they cannot save them if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;Yes doctor&quot; presumption can be shot  down by itself. Right?
</em><br />
<br /><br />So, I repeat because it is a difficult point. Strictly speaking I don't 
<br />
need the YD (Yes Doctor) hypothesis to get physics from comp, because I 
<br />
just interview a lobian machine on its consistent extension. But I need 
<br />
it to explain why it must be so, and make explicit the link with 
<br />
cognitive science, psychology, theology ....
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This would save me from having to read through your Dovetail-Lob 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc... argument which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is probably way above my head!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Please don't feel obliged to follow the argument. Do it if you really 
<br />
want to find what is wrong in the path toward the &quot;outrageous 
<br />
conclusion&quot;. I mean that the Universal Dovetailer Argument is much more 
<br />
simple than some people imagine, although many remain unaware that the 
<br />
real difficulty is in the &quot;movie graph&quot; part. OK: cognitive science is 
<br />
not easy.
<br />
For the second part, the interview of the universal lobian machine, the 
<br />
difficulty resides in understanding some amount of computer science, 
<br />
logic and logics, and quantum physics.
<br />
I prefer the slow but sure path, take your time, I'm patient: you can 
<br />
ask me questions in my next life ;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  We obviously move in very different circles because I was taught by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very stubborn old strong AI types and cognoscendi
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  cognitivists and I have never heard anyone argue for something like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that YD hypothesis!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Glad you notice. although the idea is defended and attacked since 
<br />
Plato, I am perhaps the first to tackle it in a hypothetico-deductive 
<br />
way. But then I'm lucky being born after Godel and Lob. (Which &quot;I&quot;? I 
<br />
don't know).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But as you have conceded no one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  needs it to defend the old-fashioned materialist functionalism credo 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you (and I) do not subscribe to anyway.
</em><br />
<br />OK,
<br />
<br />Now tell me what I didn't anticipate from YD, I'm very curious :)
<br />
And please feel free to shot down my work in any way. It is the best 
<br />
way for me  to illustrate the solidity of my argumentation :)
<br />
... and who knows ? perhaps you will find an error or some awkwardness. 
<br />
I would appreciate and acknowledge.
<br />
<br />Bruno
