Brent Meeker:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Observation involves (necessitates) the AGI having experiences, some of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which are an experiential representation of the external world. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; process of generation of the experiential field(s) involves the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insertion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the AGI in the chain of causality from that which is observed 'out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there' through the external world to the sensing surface, impact (causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; interaction) measured by sensing, transport (causality again) of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; measurement through the AGI to the brain where the measurement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; participates in the causality that is the creation of the experiential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; field.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So that is what is *involved* in creating the experiential field.  But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is the field?  I understand it is a representation of the external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world, but what about it makes it a representation? I hope you're not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going to say because &quot;the observer&quot; recognizes or uses it as such.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />The fields: 
<br />
In the case of visual field: virtual bosons as photons
<br />
In the case of aural fields: virtual bosons as phonons
<br />
In the case of touch fields: virtual bosons as touchons :-)
<br />
In the case of touch fields: virtual bosons as tasteons :-)
<br />
<br />I don't know the details of the various bosons yet, but there is an infinity
<br />
of possibilities as the virtual bosons are arbitrarily configurable by the
<br />
spatiotemporal behaviour of the neural membranes involved. This is virtual
<br />
matter in the same sense that all the members of the standard model depict
<br />
matter i.e.  boson is to matter as virtual boson is to virtual matter.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It is by virtue of the existence/reality of the _entire_ causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; chain that the experiential field can be created and be called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the external world. (Clearly experiential fields can also be created
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hallucinations/dreams, without the full causality chain - but that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the 'observation' we are talking about). In making use of the complete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; causal chain the oberver has access (inherits some of the properties of)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to that which is observed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This sound like your experiential field is a play performed in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cartesian theater fof the edification of the observer.
</em><br />
<br />No, it's better visualised as 'being a not-mirror' :-)
<br />
Imagine you embedded a mirror in your head, but you were only interested in
<br />
everything the mirror was not. That is, the image in the mirror is
<br />
manipulating the space intimately adjacent to the reflecting surface. Keep
<br />
the space, throw the reflecting surface and glass away. What you are
<br />
interested in is 'being' that space, not the mirror. When you do that the
<br />
'movie screen' that is the experiential field becomes part of you. Yes it's
<br />
a play, only 1 viewer who literally 'is' the theatre, no regressing
<br />
homunculi. It's just that the brain material (neurons) paints the space like
<br />
the mirror did. 
<br />
<br />BTW....Each neuron is like a single paintbrush and they all paint in
<br />
parallel real time. Neurons to not have to actually 'fire' to paint. There
<br />
are no particles actually traveling anywhere. If you slice occipital with a
<br />
scalpel early damage would interfere with learning and ability to report
<br />
contents of vision... but not necessarily the visual field itself. It'd take
<br />
a lot of damage before the visual field was reportably affected...by that
<br />
stage I'm pretty sure you'd have bled to death ... not an experiment I'd
<br />
like to participate in, but that's my prediction. :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;This is not 'creating reality' in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Berkeleyian sense. This is participation in it. This is construction of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; representation of it from within the reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This process I have described is observation and all of observation -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; nothin else counts as observation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So anything happening in my brain that has a causal connection to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world is an observation.  I can buy that, but it seems so broad as to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  include things, like recalling memories, not usually called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;observation&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brent Meeker
</em><br />
<br />Recalled memories are in the same class as the hallucinations/dreams I
<br />
mentioned. Such internally sourced fields (including all the emotions) are
<br />
not the ones I call 'observation'. The sensory fields are hooked into the
<br />
casual chain from the sensory measurements. They participate in the
<br />
observation process.
<br />
<br />All pretty straightforward.
<br />
<br />The only weirdness is the solution to the 'hard problem' that enables the
<br />
direct portrayal of the external world in your head (how the few necessary
<br />
external properties are inherited). These are the solution to the
<br />
unity/binding problem. Virtual bosons, whilst easy to see in the brain, do
<br />
not solve the unity/binding problem. That is, why all the painting neurons
<br />
actually general a single picture.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless that's my slant on building an observer.
<br />
<br />The main thing to get from the depiction is that measurement (or any causal
<br />
interaction, for that matter) is NOT observation from the point of view of
<br />
being able to formulate survivable generalisations about the external world
<br />
in the face of arbitrary levels of novelty. Dumb-as-doggy-do
<br />
machines/computers hooked up to sensing transduction and using a-priori
<br />
rules (programs) do not 'observe' at all. They merely act 'as-if' they are
<br />
observing to the extent that the derived rules are faithful to the distal
<br />
world within which the machine is supposed to be successful. They only
<br />
survive by virtue of their groundedness in the real human observations that
<br />
gave them the rules they use.
<br />
<br />That's the basic set of design decisions (gotta choose something!) behind
<br />
the 'artificial scientist' that must have 'real' observations.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Colin Hales
