Hi Alan,
<br />
<br />Thank you very much for making my point even more clear(*).
<br />
<br />You know &quot;my theory&quot; (which is just the classical machine's theory) has 
<br />
been named &quot;machine biology&quot;, and &quot;then &quot;machine theology&quot;. It is my  
<br />
thesis director in France who asked me to use the term &quot;machine 
<br />
psychology&quot; instead of &quot;theology&quot;. I really don't care of the wording 
<br />
but it seems to me, for empirical reasons, that people are more shocked 
<br />
by an expression like &quot;physics is derivable from machine psychology&quot; 
<br />
than by &quot;physics is derivable from machine theology&quot;. This is related 
<br />
to the fact that most theologies admit cosmogonies unlike psychology. 
<br />
None of those words are well chosen, but if you think &quot;theology&quot; is 
<br />
necessarily &quot;mystical&quot; I can go back to the word &quot;psychology&quot; instead. 
<br />
Or you could help me to find a less shocking wording (and less 
<br />
flattening than just &quot;computer science&quot; which is defensible assuming 
<br />
comp).
<br />
<br />Sometimes the &quot;moderation posts&quot; are very interesting by themselves. It 
<br />
is a little sad that this one is authoritative and does not admit 
<br />
replies (in the FOR-list). (Given that my point was really that 
<br />
&quot;theology&quot; could be amenable to scientific discourse, once we make some 
<br />
assumptions).
<br />
<br />Assuming the computationalist hypothesis, it is natural to define 
<br />
&quot;machine theology&quot;  by all what is *true about*  the consistent 
<br />
machines. By incompleteness this is much less than what consistent 
<br />
machines can prove about themselves. Now the gap between provability 
<br />
and truth is amenable to mathematical analysis (by Godel, Lob, Boolos, 
<br />
Solovay, etc.).
<br />
Precisely: G' minus G. (The Solovay provability logics(**)).
<br />
<br />Alan, how could I communicate? If I explain in plain english I will 
<br />
look mystical and moderated out.  If I explain the &quot;mystical&quot; out, then 
<br />
I will look technical, and moderate out again.
<br />
<br />It is a pity because it seems to me all this is relevant with the 
<br />
Church-Turing thesis and principle discussed in FOR. Of course on this 
<br />
point I disagree with David Deutsch, but then I disagree with all 
<br />
physicists except J. A. Wheeler (if I may borrow this sort of 
<br />
expression to DD :).
<br />
<br />Ah! I just remember a wording I have used for the machine's theology a 
<br />
long time ago, it is the collection of propositions belonging to the 
<br />
difference between computer science and computer's computer science 
<br />
(which is non empty by incompleteness again). But that is long and 
<br />
could look both mystical and technical.
<br />
Sometimes I add the restriction that the machine should be able to 
<br />
correctly bet on those propositions.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I will search for better words ... I didn't expect to be 
<br />
moderated out so quickly this time ;)
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Bruno

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have decided that the theology discussion is far too prone to wander

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into mysticism and religion, if, indeed, it has not done so already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and mysticism and religion are off-topic.

<br /><br />BM: The problem is that if the &quot;scientist&quot; dismiss some fundamental

questions, they will be tackled by those who will use some urgency

feeling related to them to to do &quot;total unrigorous manipulative

pseudo-theology&quot;, so that the scientist will say &quot;you see, let us keep
<br />
those things under the carpet&quot;. Your negative attitude is unfounded and

self-fulfilling, I'm afraid.

<br /><br />No sincere questions are &quot;non scientific&quot;.  Prejudice against some

possible sense in those questions will not help making them more clear

and, who can know in advance, susceptible to scientific progress on

them.
