Everything folks,
<br />
<br />Here's a posting I made last night to another list, a list of folks who 
<br />
meet to discuss math. I had been telling them about nonstandard logic, 
<br />
notably Intuitionist or Brouwer/Heyting logic, and the natural logic of 
<br />
toposes. This post below expands on a few points we had been talking 
<br />
about at our session in Palo Alto a few days ago.
<br />
<br />(By the way, if anyone is local to the Bay Area and wants to try one of 
<br />
the evening gatherings, let me know. We just started meeting and it's 
<br />
too soon to know how it'll go in the future. The basic idea is to have 
<br />
an informal group similar to the &quot;Assembler Multitudes&quot; nanotechnology 
<br />
discussion group that Ted Kaehler ran in the early 90s. I enjoyed that 
<br />
group immensely and was disappointed to see it fade out. With all of the 
<br />
new excitment in math, and with links to the cosmology and Everything 
<br />
universes, it seems to be a good time to try something again. We had six 
<br />
people at our gathering a few days ago.)
<br />
<br />The background for this article is not given here, so I'll make a very 
<br />
few points now:
<br />
<br />* conventional logic (Aristotelian, Boolean) uses &quot;law of the excluded 
<br />
middle&quot;: A or Not-A, something is or is not, the complement of an open 
<br />
set is a closed set. The complement of a complement of a set is the set.
<br />
<br />* alternative or nonstandard logics exist, and turn out to be quite 
<br />
natural...when looked at properly.
<br />
<br />* one of these is the logic pursued by Brouwer early in the 20th 
<br />
century: Intuitionism (which is not mysticism, by the way). Brouwer 
<br />
argued that only constructible entities have meaning, that abstractions 
<br />
about infinite sets or things like the axiom of choice are misleading. 
<br />
His student Heyting formalized the axioms of Intuitionist logic. 
<br />
Marshall Stone proved in the 1930s that the set of operations on open 
<br />
subsets of a set (think of blobs drawn on a page, or time intervals, 
<br />
etc.) forms a Heyting algebra, that is, that the natural logic for these 
<br />
open sets is not Boolean logic, but Heyting logic.
<br />
<br />* lattices are sets of node and links between the nodes which satisfy 
<br />
certain properties, such as that any two nodes have a &quot;meet&quot; and &quot;join.&quot; 
<br />
Events in time are a good example of a lattice.
<br />
<br />* partially ordered sets (posets) are those with some relationship (such 
<br />
as &quot;less than or equal to&quot; or &quot;preceeds or happens at the same time&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;is contained in or equals&quot;) such that certain properties of comparison 
<br />
exist. Posetss are less ordered than the integers, for example, which 
<br />
are fully-ordered. An example is containment and inclusion of open sets 
<br />
(or intervals on the line).
<br />
<br />(The Web has a lot of good definitions, complete with diagrams and 
<br />
drawings, of these ideas. For example, MathWorld has this article on 
<br />
posets: <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartiallyOrderedSet.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartiallyOrderedSet.html</a>.)
<br />
<br />* To relate this to the Everything list, sort of, imagine the lattice of 
<br />
events in &quot;our&quot; universe. It forms a poset, basically. What about 
<br />
possible &quot;branch points&quot; where other universes form (as in MWI)? What 
<br />
about the overall notion of &quot;possible worlds&quot;? (Branching, fictional, AI 
<br />
planning, plurality of worlds a la David Lewis, etc.).
<br />
<br />* Fotini Markopoulou has been looking at causal sets and the nature of 
<br />
time. Her articles are available at the xxx.lanl.gov arXive site.

<br />
Second, while watching a fairly silly movie called &quot;Signs&quot; today, I was 
<br />
thinking about the issue of &quot;when is a negation of a negation of 
<br />
something not the same as that something. That is, &quot;not not A !=! A&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;not not A NEQ A&quot; or A' ' NEQ A. (Lots of symbologies exist, and our 
<br />
keyboards and screens can't easily handle the most common ones.)
<br />
<br />An example Mac Lane gives in &quot;Form and Function&quot; is this:
<br />
<br />Consider the real number line. Consider the topology of open sets (or 
<br />
intervals). Suppose that we define an open set (or interval) U which is 
<br />
the open set of all of the positive reals _EXCEPT_ the number 1. Then 
<br />
&quot;Not U&quot; or &quot;Complement of U&quot; would be the set of all negative reals. (1 
<br />
would not be in this complement because any actual number is of course a 
<br />
_closed_ set (endpoints and all that stuff from the definition of open 
<br />
and closed intervals. (Drawing a picture on a blackboard would help!)
<br />
<br />So far, no surprises.
<br />
<br />However, the negation or complement of his open subset (the negative 
<br />
reals) is the open subset of all of the positive reals. So Not Not U is 
<br />
bigger than U.
<br />
<br />This phenomenon of Not Not something being larger than something is 
<br />
common in Heyting algebras.
<br />
<br />Think about time. Think of a &quot;lattice&quot; of events combining in various 
<br />
causal ways to product events, which then combine with other events, and 
<br />
so on. Judea Pearl has some of these causal diagrams in his book 
<br />
&quot;Causality,&quot; and Lee Smolin has some in his book &quot;Three Roads to Quantum 
<br />
Gravity.&quot; A basic idea, to be sure.
<br />
<br />OK, suppose one is at time t. What's the &quot;negation&quot; or &quot;complement&quot; of 
<br />
the open set &quot;PAST&quot;? Obviously, &quot;FUTURE.&quot; Not-PAST is FUTURE and 
<br />
Not-FUTURE is PAST. So Not-Not-PAST is PAST and Not-Not-FUTURE is 
<br />
FUTURE. Standard Aristotelian or Boolean logic, standard common sense. 
<br />
Or is it?
<br />
<br />Drawn as a lattice, with the various events having various links and 
<br />
with a &quot;partial ordering&quot; (hence the term &quot;poset&quot;), the FUTURE is 
<br />
affected by events which are unable to be compared (before, after, same 
<br />
time) as events right now or in the PAST.
<br />
<br />This may not sound clear. In a Newtonian world, with no limits on the 
<br />
speed of information flow, the PAST is plausibly the same for all 
<br />
observers. But not so in our actual world. Events &quot;outside our light 
<br />
cone&quot; cannot be said to have occurred before some time, after some time, 
<br />
or at the same time as something. Different observers travelling at 
<br />
different speeds may see entirely different orders of events. There is 
<br />
no absolute PAST or FUTURE.
<br />
<br />OK, but at some future time, when the light cones intersect, some event 
<br />
from that &quot;other&quot; light cone can help to make some event happen. For 
<br />
example, a supernova happening &quot;now&quot; at Alpha Centauri will take 4.3 
<br />
years to make its presence felt here on Earth.
<br />
<br />Perhaps you see where this is going. Not-PAST is FUTURE, but 
<br />
Not-Not-PAST is not the PAST. Things get bigger, exactly as with the 
<br />
example above with the real number line and the open subset topology on 
<br />
it.
<br />
<br />In fact, the lattice that makes up non-classical time and the open 
<br />
subset topology both are examples of posets. (The oddly-named poset is 
<br />
thus a common thing, more &quot;practical&quot; than a fully-ordered set where 
<br />
'trichotomy&quot; holds: something is either bigger than, smaller than, or 
<br />
the same size as something else. Or an event either occurs before, 
<br />
after, or at the same time as some other event.)
<br />
<br />(Ultra-speculatively, it would be interesting to see what connections 
<br />
exist between the amount of &quot;size growth&quot; and entropy, a la the 
<br />
Bekenstein bound and holographic models of relativistic systems. I sense 
<br />
there's something there, but I haven't looked hard enough yet, or with 
<br />
enough knowledge.)
<br />
<br />And there's another parallel example. Those causal diagrams, with things 
<br />
happening and combining and contributing to future events...well, they 
<br />
are of course just a logic circuit. And though it is canonically true 
<br />
that these circuits use &quot;Boolean logic&quot; (Boolean algebras), that is in 
<br />
fact only _locally_ true. The global picture is one of a lattice just 
<br />
like the lattice above with time and events.  The FUTURE is more than 
<br />
just a negation or complement of the PAST...it is affected by 
<br />
information flow from other parts of the universe (the chip, the 
<br />
computer, the program). This is why computations are not trivial...
<br />
<br />So, it seems natural to view logic circuits and programs in this 
<br />
&quot;lattice/poset/Heyting algebra&quot; scheme...which is presumably what all 
<br />
those books and papers on such things is going to tell me when I am able 
<br />
to read them! (And why category theory/topos theory/sheaves is so 
<br />
closely tied to computer science.)
<br />
<br />This is very cool stuff. The basic stuff of reality.
<br />
<br />There may be practical applications. Clockless logic, reversible 
<br />
computing, and issues of concurrence are perhaps best analyzed in terms 
<br />
of these poset lattices. Checking Google on this, I find that Vaughn 
<br />
Pratt, a local prof at Stanford I expect most of you have heard of, has 
<br />
been exploring this area for a while now. (And I saw his name just 
<br />
yesterday in the URL Peter sent us on Mac Lane's comments on e-mail.)
<br />
<br />Note that the &quot;lattice/poset&quot; model doesn't require the speed of light 
<br />
limits that relativity gives us. It applies just as well to conditions 
<br />
of limited visibility into what other agents are doing (hence links to 
<br />
categorification of money??) and to essentially any situations where the 
<br />
aforementioned trichotomy fails. I contend that this is &quot;most of the 
<br />
time.&quot; (Though as analysts and scientists we often then simplify and 
<br />
make assumptions to get to situations where trichotomy applies or is 
<br />
assumed to apply, and hence where linear orderings are usable and hence 
<br />
where the &quot;weirdnesses&quot; of Intuitionistic/Heyting logic don't show up.)
<br />
<br />A huge amount of stuff to learn on this. Which I count as being good, 
<br />
because I hate boredom! I can see why Smolin says in
<br />
&quot;Three Roads&quot; that topos theory is perhaps the hardest thing he's ever 
<br />
tired to learn. Most branches of mathematics, like partial differential 
<br />
equations or differential geometry, have a clearly defined set of tools 
<br />
and results. This area keeps expanding, with background needed in first 
<br />
order logic, proof theory, type theory, topology, more topology, 
<br />
algebra, lattice theory, and more! Familiarity with Kleene, Rosser, 
<br />
Church, Curry, Godel, and all of the other logicians is helpful. Just 
<br />
one of my books, Paul Taylor's &quot;Practical Foundations of Mathematics,&quot; 
<br />
looks like it will take me years and years to master.
<br />
<br />Great interdisciplinary stuff, though, as it hits on the themes above: 
<br />
the causal structure of reality, cosmology, why information is so 
<br />
important, the nature of language (possible worlds semantics), and even 
<br />
the deep nature of computation.
