<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;You have to consider the huge number of alternative states you could be

in.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;1) Consider an observer moment that has experienced a lot of things.
</em><br />
These
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;experiences are encoded by n bits. Suppose that these experiences were
</em><br />
more
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;or less random. Then we can conclude that there are 2^n OMs that all have
</em><br />
a
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;probability proportional to 2^(-n). The probability that you are one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;these OMs isn't small at all!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;2) Considering perforing n suicide experiments, each with 50%  survival
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;probability. The n bits have registered the fact that you have survived
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;n suicide experiments. The probability of experiencing that is 2^(-n).
</em><br />
The
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;2^(n) -1 alternate states are all unconscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;So, even though each of the states in 1 is as likely as the single state
</em><br />
in
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;2, the probability that you'll find yourself alive in 1 is vastly more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;likely than in 2. This is actually similar to why you never see a mixture
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;two gases spontaneously unmix. Even though all states are equally likely,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;there are far fewer unmixed states than mixed ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand your point, but I think you are making an invalid assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the relationship between a random sampling of all the OM's available
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to an individual and that individual's experience of living his life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose a trillion trillion copies of my mind are made today on a computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and run in lockstep with my biologically implemented mind for the next six
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; months, at which point the computer is shut down. This means that most of
</em><br />
my
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure is now in the latter half of 2005, in the sense that if you pick
</em><br />
an
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moment at random out of all the observer moments which identify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves as being me, it is much more likely to be one of the copies on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computer. But what does this mean for my experience of life? Does it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean that I am unlikely to experience 2006, being somehow suspended in
</em><br />
2005?
<br />
<br />I would say so. You would find yoursef to be suspended in 2005, just like
<br />
you are now suspended between 1900 and 2100. But this would require the
<br />
simulations of your mind in 2005 to dominate over all other versions of you.
<br />
Now unless experiencing 2006 would require a miracle this can't be the case.
<br />
The reason is that all possible versions of you 'already' exist in the
<br />
multiverse. Your measure in 2005 is what it is. This includes the effects of
<br />
others simulating your mind experiencing 2005 (the simulation can be done at
<br />
any time, of course).
<br />
<br />So, you can say that your measure for experiencing time t is:
<br />
<br />m(t) =  m_{biol}(t) + m_{sim}(t)
<br />
<br /><br />m_{biol} being the 'biological' contribution of your measure and m_{sim} the
<br />
digital contribution. Both terms are fixed by the laws of physics. If indeed
<br />
m_{sim}(2005) is trillions of times larger than m_{biol}(2005) and zero at
<br />
other times, you would be suspended in 2005. But this cannot be the case
<br />
unless there is some reason why m_{sim}(t) is so strongly peaked around
<br />
2005. If there are branches in which someone is simulating you in 2005 for
<br />
no good reason, then that decision is taken at random. That means that in
<br />
some other branch you are simulated in some other time. So, the measure
<br />
isn't strongly peaked around 2005 at all!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; More generally, if a person has N OM's available to him at time t1 and kN
</em><br />
at
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time t2, does this mean he is k times as likely to find himself
</em><br />
experiencing
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; t2 as t1? I suggest that this is not the right way to look at it. A person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only experiences one OM at a time, so if he has &quot;passed through&quot; t1 and t2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it will appear to him that he has spent just as much time in either
</em><br />
interval
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (assuming t1 and t2 are the same length). The only significance of the
</em><br />
fact
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there are &quot;more&quot; OM's at t2 is that the person can expect a greater
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variety of possible experiences at t2 if the OM's are all distinct.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The same is true here. It must follow from the laws of physics (which
<br />
include the effects of simmulations) that there are indeed many more copies
<br />
of you at t2.
