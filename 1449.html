<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that this is exactly what I would expect. The reason I don't see white
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rabbits is that I'm still relatively young, so expect that the third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person WR explanation should still apply to me. Of course, I would not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;expect that other people would report 1st person white rabbits to me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which neatly explains why they don't exist in the literature.
</em><br />
<br />I guess you are talking about usual senility. That argument doesn't 
<br />
convince me. More about that later, when I will explain more clearly
<br />
the 1-white rabbit through the UDA.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Maybe this explanation is still rather too woolly for the more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rigourous of us, but surely it must be the kernel of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explanation. A more satisfactory theory would be able to make some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;predictions about the rate of departure from a a normal lawlike environment.
</em><br />
<br />Indeed.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'd prefer to avoid the use of the word _set_, as set has a specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical meaning which may or may not be relevant in this case,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;however I believe this is what I mean. Now, currently I have a picture
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that such a collection of consistent mathematical theories (including
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the completion obtained by allowing the input program to grow to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinity (\aleph_0 of course) - and allowing the machines to execute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for infinite time) pretty much exhausts the range of mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theories that might be interesting. (It would certainly include N, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;example). So what exactly do you mean by an orthogonal collection of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical theories? One that cannot be constructed by means of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(in)finite combinations of the original collection?
</em><br />
<br />Such combinations will alter the measure. Worst, how will you climb
<br />
the ladder of more powerfull theories, how will you be sure those
<br />
are consistent ? Will you choose set theories with the axiom of choice
<br />
or with the axiom of indeterminacy: the mathematics are not the same,
<br />
the word &quot;measure&quot; has different meaning in each. Etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I really feel I need to understand your thesis chapter 5. However, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;get thrown off the horse within the first couple of pages.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;i) You say that assuming a minimum of &quot;pop psychology&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          COMP_n \Rightarrow \neg\Box COMP_n
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In English, I interpret this as saying that COMP_n implies the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possibility that COMP_n is false. (Using the definition \Diamond p
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;\equiv \neg\Box\neg p.) What is the source of this remarkable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;statement?
</em><br />
<br />There are two roots for that 'remarkable statement':
<br />
1) An arithmetical roots is just Godel's second incompleteness theorem:
<br />
<br />Read &quot;comp_n&quot; as &quot;I am consistent&quot;, then Godel's th. implies:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;(I am consistent)  \Rightarrow  (not-provable (I am consistent))
<br />
<br />Which is indeed equivalent to
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;(I am consistent)  \Rightarrow  (consistent (I am not consistent))
<br />
<br />Consistency is a sort of arithmetical possibility. And it is indeed
<br />
a remarkable fact that the &quot;inconsistency&quot; of a machine is relatively 
<br />
consistent with that machine. You can add to the axioms of Peano
<br />
arithmetic that &quot;arithmetic is inconsistent&quot; and you get a consistent
<br />
although very unreasonnable arithmetical theory. (BTW this is yet another
<br />
example of a mean to build orthogonal theories).
<br />
<br />This can also be nicely illustrated with some Kripke model, but I will
<br />
not do it here (because I would need drawings). More on that latter
<br />
when everybody has read Chellas book ;-)
<br />
<br />2) The second roots is the duplication part of the UDA. Read the box
<br />
as 'I can communicate scientifically that'
<br />
In that case if I duplicate at some level n a person which does not 
<br />
believe in comp_n, then the doppelganger will understand that he will 
<br />
never be able to communicate (scientifically) to the original person 
<br />
that `he' has survived the duplication. That is comp_n is not
<br />
scientifically communicable.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the original person point of view the very fact that the 
</em><br />
doppelganger will appear to him *as* a doppleganger will confirm
<br />
his belief that comp_n is could be false: he would have been killed
<br />
in case the original (&quot;me&quot; he says) would have been destroyed.
<br />
<br />There is a relation between 1) and 2) which is that Godel's theorem
<br />
implies that &quot;if I am a machine then I cannot know which machine I am&quot;.
<br />
Penrose did not understand that point in his book &quot;the emperor's new
<br />
mind&quot; but he did eventually understand it in his second book 
<br />
&quot;the shadow of the mind&quot;. This is an almost unanimously accepted
<br />
statement concerning Godel and machine philosophy. 
<br />
Intuitively you can see the link by interpreting a &quot;reconstituted&quot; 
<br />
person in some environment as a consistent extension of that person.
<br />
This explain the importance of the concept of &quot;consistent&quot; extension
<br />
for the search of the measure on the possible computational 
<br />
continuation. I think that this could be used to clarified some
<br />
points in your discussion with Alastair.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;ii) You introduce the interpretation of \Box p as Bew(`p'), where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;latter is the Goedel sentence corresponding to p. How does this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpretation work?
</em><br />
<br />No. The Goedel's sentence is &quot;p iff \neg Box  p&quot;. (Box = Provable)
<br />
The sentence &quot;p iff Box  p&quot; is the Henkin-Lob sentence. The crazy
<br />
happening is that the Henkin-Lob sentence is true and provable.
<br />
This is not yet important. The important thing here is to realise
<br />
that \neg Provable \neg p = Consistent p, and vice versa:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\neg Consistent \neg p = Provable p.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm not trying to criticise these - merely understand them.
</em><br />
<br />I appreciate very much.
<br />
