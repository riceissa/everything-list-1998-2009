<br />I like very much your sense of humour, Gilles.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Again all this stuff relies on what I called comp2, ie the hypothesis that

</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Being digitalisable ourself (with comp) we don't
<br />
need to be emulated at *any* analogical level (if that exist at all).
<br />
Comp = there is a level where we are psychologicaly  equivalent, no more.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To speak like Jacques, I think that's the worst

</em><br />
<br />Do you really think that someone believe a digital machine can emulate 
<br />
in extenso (completely) an analogical machine (if that exist) ?
<br />
I don't believe that such an idea ever emerged from computer science.
<br />
If that idea is what you mean by comp2, I think that this 
<br />
crackpot idea emerges in your own mind.
<br />
<br />To be sure, there are sense in which digital system can emulate 
<br />
continuous 
<br />
one, and may be there are sense in which comp2 could be interesting after 
<br />
all, but I have not the time to deal with constructive 
<br />
mathematics now, alas :-(.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The flaw is that even if it were the case, the required information is so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;huge that it could not be physically realized by any system in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Universe. You must invoke a super Universe where the amount of available
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information would by far exceed that in our own universe. So it won't take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a million years to do it. It will never be done...
</em><br />
<br />False. By &quot;if it were the case&quot; I guess you mean there is a level where 
<br />
we are digitalisable. In that case, in some definite sense, 'it'  *has* 
<br />
been
<br />
done, in the atemporal and immaterial realm of the relations between 
<br />
numbers.
<br />
<br />Now, even about the question &quot;will we build real simulacron in some
<br />
futur?&quot;, I am no more so sure it is impossible.
<br />
There was a time I was &quot;sure&quot; it was impossible. But reflexion on the 
<br />
possibly practical existence of quantum
<br />
computing (i.e. the ability to compute 'Fourier transform' on arbitrarily 
<br />
large
<br />
set of outputs of some programs) makes me *less sure* about that.
<br />
<br />Especially because we don't need to emulate any environment at all 
<br />
(still less universes) only 
<br />
counterfactually related correlations between observers (classical UTM).
<br />
<br />So I begin to think that it is not entirely inconcevable that simulacron 
<br />
may indeed be build,  for exemple by those among us who believe their
<br />
brains are hot (classical) machines. (It is comp with high level of 
<br />
subst.)
<br />
<br />But even today children begins to share complex virtual environment,
<br />
through the net, and we can see the birth of truly virtual kind
<br />
of cities ...
<br />
<br />and you know what happened when amoebas invented the phones, (the brain)
<br />
so I think it is hard to imagine what the net will gives ...
<br />
... in the long run.
<br />
<br />Don't look at the movie Gilles, read the book :-)
<br />
<br />Bruno
