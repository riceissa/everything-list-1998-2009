Science Fiction writer Greg Egan has a short story online at
<br />
<a href="http://www.netspace.net.au/~gregegan/MISC/SINGLETON/Singleton.html">http://www.netspace.net.au/~gregegan/MISC/SINGLETON/Singleton.html</a>
<br />
that deals with some of the ethical implications of the Many Worlds
<br />
Interpretation of QM.  It describes the motivation for the invention of
<br />
the &quot;Qusp&quot;, a device Egan has also used in other stories.  A Qusp is
<br />
a quantum computer suitable for running a mind, but in a special way.
<br />
It is designed to avoid splitting into multiple decoherent parts as
<br />
usually happens in quantum evolution.  The idea is that if your mind
<br />
is running on a Qusp, and you make a decision, it only goes one way.
<br />
You don't decide in different ways in different worlds.  This is supposed
<br />
to be more satisfying for people of a certain philosophical bent.
<br />
<br />This story provokes several thoughts which I could expand upon but which
<br />
I will state only briefly here.
<br />
<br />The first is the question of whether an appropriate response to a
<br />
demonstration of the MWI (or the more radical notions of multiple
<br />
universes we consider here) is a sense of existential despair, as one
<br />
realizes that any decision and choice in life was made differently by
<br />
a counterpart in another universe.  I don't think this is reasonable.
<br />
Your decision process should be seen as altering the measure or proportion
<br />
of universes in which you do one thing or the other.  In Egan's story
<br />
he mostly ignores measure.  I think that the proper philosophy is to
<br />
consider measure as being of crucial importance.  Your job in life is
<br />
to bend the measure of the branches to maximize the welfare of whatever
<br />
is most important to you.
<br />
<br />I wrote some time back about how this perspective could play out in
<br />
some commonplace situations.  The example I gave was driving too fast
<br />
and unsafely down a residential street.  A child could have run out in
<br />
front of you and you wouldn't be able to stop.  In fact you didn't hit
<br />
anyone and you give a sigh of relief.  But you should realize that in
<br />
some universes you weren't so lucky.  Rather than thinking in terms
<br />
of outcomes in particular universes, you need to take a larger view
<br />
and look at the multiverse as a whole.  Understand that your action
<br />
reduced the measure of the lives of the children who live on that street.
<br />
Even though you can't see or measure the reduction, it was real and your
<br />
action did affect the multiverse.  You caused actual harm by driving
<br />
too fast.
<br />
<br />A related source of existential worries is simply that the MWI is
<br />
deterministic.  Some philosophers have claimed that free will is
<br />
inconsistent with a deterministic universe, and have seized upon the
<br />
supposed randomness of QM as offering a place for free will to enter.
<br />
I don't agree with this because free will based on quantum randomness
<br />
may be &quot;free&quot; but it is not &quot;will&quot;; you don't choose the outcomes of
<br />
quantum measurements.  But in any case, MWI takes away the illusion of
<br />
quantum randomness; the evolution of the Schrodinger equation is fully
<br />
deterministic when we look at the multiverse as a whole.  Fortunately
<br />
there is a pretty substantial philosophical literature on compatibilism,
<br />
the doctrine that free will can exist in a deterministic universe,
<br />
so people who are concerned about this can study philosophy for a while.
<br />
<br />One final comment about Egan's Qusp: it's not clear that it really makes
<br />
sense, that there is a problem that needs solving and that the Qusp can
<br />
solve it.  Egan is worried about universe splitting.  But ordinary,
<br />
classical computers don't normally split.  Give them a certain input
<br />
and they will always produce the same output.  Of course, if the input
<br />
itself comes from the universe, that is split already, but Egan admits
<br />
that there is nothing he can do about that.  He just wants his computer
<br />
running his mind not to split any more than what is forced by coupling
<br />
to the outside environment.  So the point is that the Qusp doesn't add
<br />
any capabilities that an ordinary classical computer won't have.
<br />
<br />The only way to make a computer which itself splits is to give it a source
<br />
of quantum randomness, a true random number generator.  Now, it is very
<br />
likely that our own brains work that way.  The messy chemistry that is
<br />
involved with our neural firing is probably chaotic enough that quantum
<br />
variations get amplified and lead to decoherence.  A human brain left to
<br />
itself would split into multiple decoherent branches, I strongly suspect.
<br />
<br />But I doubt that splitting is fundamental to the brain's operation.  We
<br />
could simulate a brain on a classical computer and it would no longer
<br />
split, but it would still be just as functional.  So this is all Egan
<br />
would have to do for his Qusp, and it seems to me that the non-Qusp
<br />
AIs would probably work that way.  I don't see why they would go out
<br />
of their way to include a source of quantum randomness in the other 
<br />
AIs, and that would be the only way to make them split.
<br />
<br />More fundamentally, though, I think that splitting due to the environment,
<br />
which Egan admits can't be prevented, will still be more than enough to
<br />
raise the same existential issues he was trying to solve with the Qusp.
<br />
You will still decide things both ways, because tiny environmental
<br />
differences will get amplified.  I don't see that running on a Qusp will
<br />
really give you the kind of assurance he is hoping to get.
<br />
<br />Anyway, it is an interesting story, in the first half at least.  And it
<br />
is good to see some thoughtful discussion of the philosophical issues
<br />
raised by the MWI.
