<br />Yes, at least FAPP (For All Practical Purposes).

<br /><br />Perhaps but it is relevant with Wei Dai question only as an argument 
<br />
against either MWI, comp or everything-like realm or theory.
<br />
Nevertheless, with comp or MWI, there is a question.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Wei Dai asks:
<br />
<br />&quot;Given the MWI or one of the &quot;everything&quot; theories we've discussed, the
<br />
universe must contain multiple observers who have exactly the same
<br />
memories and experiences as you do. Should you identify with all of them,
<br />
or should you think, &quot;I am one of these people, but I don't know which&quot;?&quot;
<br />
<br />Now, if all the Worlds are identical, you are right, we can identified 
<br />
these worlds with a single one, at least FAPP.
<br />
When the worlds diverges, we cannot make these identifications and, my 
<br />
feeling here, is that Wei Dai is correct when he proposes that we should 
<br />
think:
<br />
&quot;I am one of these people, but I don't know which&quot;.
<br />
<br />Let us look another illustration with a thought experiment.
<br />
Suppose I give you the choice between the experiments A and B (and 
<br />
nothing else!):
<br />
In both experiments you are destroyed after being &quot;read&quot; (your 
<br />
description is encoded on some disk) and then you are reconstituted in 1 
<br />
000 000 boxes which are put at some places. The boxes are, from inside, 
<br />
undistinguishable. There is a door in all the boxes.
<br />
<br />In experiment A, one box is put in *paradise* and 999 999 are put in 
<br />
*hell*.
<br />
In experiment B, one box is put in *hell* and 999 999 are put in 
<br />
*paradise*.
<br />
<br />(I suppose also that the different places in *hell* (resp. *paradise*) 
<br />
are distinctibles. Let us call that the DISTINCT hypothesis)
<br />
<br />What will you choose ?
<br />
<br />I would answer: if for some reason I know I will never open the door, I
<br />
&nbsp;don't care and I can choose between A and B randomly. If I know I WILL 
<br />
open the door then I choose  A.
<br />
Put in another way: untill I open the door I can identify myself
<br />
&nbsp;(*my-futur-self*) with all the copies FAPP, but once I open the door 
<br />
then I identify myself with one of those copies, and I don't know which 
<br />
one in advance.  But I do have some &quot;information&quot; helping me in my choice.
<br />
<br />Do you agree ?
<br />
<br />Are there some computationnalist or many-worlders who disagrees?
<br />
<br />Another question is what will happen if we relax the DISTINCT hypothesis.
<br />
&nbsp;With both comp and MWI there are senses in which we can erase memories,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;making possible for the &quot;corresponding worlds&quot; to fuse, and making the 
<br />
&quot;uncertainty quantification&quot; more difficult to define.
<br />
