</em><br />
<br />&quot;P is true&quot; is not different to &quot;P&quot;. That is not the difference I
<br />
making.
<br />
<br />I'm making a difference between what &quot;exists&quot; means in mathematical
<br />
sentences and what it means in empiricial sentences (and what it means
<br />
in fictional contexts...)
<br />
<br /><br />The logical case for mathematical Platonism is based on the idea
<br />
that mathematical statements are true, and make existence claims.
<br />
That they are true is not disputed by the anti-Platonist, who
<br />
must therefore claim that mathematical existence claims are somehow
<br />
weaker than other existence claims -- perhaps merely metaphorical.
<br />
That the the word &quot;exists&quot; means different things in different contexts
<br />
is easily established.
<br />
<br />For one thing, this is already conceded by Platonists! Platonists think
<br />
Platonic existence is eternal, immaterial non-spatial, and so on,
<br />
unlike the Earthly existence of material bodies. For another,
<br />
we are already used to contextualising the meaning of &quot;exists&quot;.
<br />
We agree with both: &quot;helicopters exist&quot;; and &quot;helicopters
<br />
don't exist in Middle Earth&quot;. (People who base their entire
<br />
anti-Platonic philosophy are called fictionalists. However,
<br />
mathematics is not a fiction because it is not a free creation.
<br />
Mathematicians are constrained by consistency and non-contradiction
<br />
in a way that authors are not. Dr Watson's fictional existence
<br />
is intact despite the fact that he is sometimes called John
<br />
and sometimes James in Conan Doyle's stories).
<br />
<br />The epistemic case for mathematical Platonism is  be  argued on the
<br />
basis of the
<br />
objective
<br />
nature of mathematical truth. Superficially, it seems persuasive that
<br />
objectivity requires  objects.
<br />
However, the basic case for the objectivity of mathematics is the
<br />
tendency
<br />
of mathematicians to
<br />
agree about the answers to mathematical problems; this can be explained
<br />
by
<br />
noting that mathematical logic is based on axioms and rules of
<br />
inference, and
<br />
different mathematicians following the same rules will tend to get the
<br />
same
<br />
answers , like different computers running the same problem.
<br />
(There is also disagreement about some axioms, such as the Axiom of
<br />
Choice,
<br />
and different mathematicians with different attitudes about the AoC
<br />
will
<br />
tend to get different answers -- a phenomenon which is easily explained
<br />
<br />by the formalist view I am taking here).
<br />
<br />The semantic case for mathematical Platonism is based on the idea
<br />
that the terms in a mathematical sentence must mean something,
<br />
and therefore must refer to objects. It can be argued on
<br />
general linguistic grounds that not all meaning is reference
<br />
to some kind of object outside the head. Some meaning is sense,
<br />
some is reference. That establishes the possibility that mathematical
<br />
terms do not have references. What establishes it is as likely
<br />
and not merely possible is the obeservation that nothing like
<br />
empirical investigation is needed to establish the truth
<br />
of mathematical statements. Mathematical truth is arrived at by a
<br />
purely
<br />
conceptual process, which is what would be expected if mathematical
<br />
meaning were restricted to the
<br />
&nbsp;Sense, the &quot;in the head&quot; component of meaning.
<br />
<br /><br />A possible counter argument by the Platonist is that the downgrading of
<br />
mathematical existence to a mere metaphor is arbitrary. The
<br />
anti-Platonist must
<br />
show that a consistent standard is being applied. This it is possible
<br />
to do; the standard is to take the meaning of existence in the context
<br />
of
<br />
a particular proposition to relate to the means of justification of the
<br />
proposition.
<br />
Since ordinary statements are confirmed empirically, &quot;exists&quot; means
<br />
&quot;can
<br />
be perceived&quot; in that context. Since sufficient grounds for asserting
<br />
the
<br />
existence of mathematical objects are that it is does not contradict
<br />
anything else
<br />
in mathematics, mathematical existence just amounts to concpetual
<br />
non-contradictoriness.
<br />
<br />(Incidentally, this approach answers a question about mathematical and
<br />
empirical
<br />
truth. The anti-Platonists want sthe two kinds of truth to be
<br />
different, but
<br />
also needs them to be related so as to avoid the charge that one class
<br />
of
<br />
statement is not true at all. This can be achieved because empirical
<br />
statements rest on non-contradiction in order to achive correspondence.
<br />
If an empricial observation fails co correspond to a statemet, there
<br />
is a contradiction between them. Thus non-contradiciton is a necessary
<br />
but insufficient justification for truth in empircal statements, but
<br />
a sufficient one for mathematical statements).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Where is it shown the UD exists ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you agree that the number 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... exist (or again, if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prefer, that the truth of the propositions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ex(x = 0),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ex(x = s(0)),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ex(x = s(s(0))),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is independent of me), then it can proved that the UD exists. It can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proved also that Peano Arithmetic (PA) can both define the UD and prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it exists.
</em><br />
<br />But again this is just &quot;mathematical existence&quot;. You need some
<br />
reason to assert that mathematical existence is not a mere
<br />
metaphor implying no real existence, as anti-Platonist
<br />
mathematicians claim. I do not think that is given by computationalism.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Tell me also this, if you don't mind: are you able to doubt about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; existence of &quot;primary matter&quot;? I know it is your main fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; postulate. Could you imagine that you could be wrong?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is possible  that I am wrong. It is possible that I am right.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But you are -- or were -- telling me matter is impossible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Only when I use Occam.
</em><br />
<br />Occam does not support conclusions of impossibility. It could
<br />
be a brute fact that the universe is more complicated than
<br />
strcitly necessary.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Without Occam I say only that the notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primary matter is necessarily useless i.e. without explanatory purposes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (even concerning just the belief in the physical proposition only) .
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a non trivial consequence of the comp hyp. (cf UDA).
</em><br />
<br />As is the way with these things, we anti-Platonists appeal
<br />
to Occam as well (although not qua impossibilia).
<br />
<br />All the facts about mathematical truth and methodology can be
<br />
established
<br />
without appeal to the actual existence of mathematical objects.
<br />
In fact, the lack of such objects actually explains the
<br />
objectivity and necessity of maths. Mathematical statements
<br />
are necessarily true because there are no possible circumstances
<br />
that make them false; there are no possible circumstances that
<br />
would make them false because they do not refer to anything
<br />
external. This is much simpler than the Platonist
<br />
alternative that mathematical statements :
<br />
1) have referents
<br />
which are
<br />
2) unchanging and eternal, unlike anything anyone has actuall seen
<br />
and thereby
<br />
3) explain the necessity (invariance) of mathematical statements
<br />
without
<br />
4) performing any other role -- they are not involved in
<br />
mathematical proof.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But the negative integers exist (or &quot;exist&quot;), so it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; an existing predecessor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. But the axiom Q1 &quot;Ax ~(0 = s(x)&quot; is not made wrong just because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you define the negative integer in Robinson Arithmetic. The &quot;x&quot; are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still for &quot;natural number&quot;. The integer are new objects defined from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the natural number. All right? To take another example, you can define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in RA all partial recursive functions, but obviously they does not obey
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the Q axioms, they are just constructs, definable in RA.
</em><br />
<br />So the specialness of Time depends on the specialness of nautral
<br />
numbers, depends on the specialness of Robinson Arithemtic ?
