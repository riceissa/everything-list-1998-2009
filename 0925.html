...there would seem to be far more different mathematical structures
<br />
where this type of scenario occurs (the odd white rabbit scuttling
<br />
across a ceiling, for instance, to reuse an earlier example),
<br />
So statistically we should be in one of these 'contrived' universes...
<br />
Does anyone happen to have an idea about how to respond to this
<br />
challenge to Tegmark's hypothesis?
<br />
<br />Statistically we should not be in such a universe unless we exist in an
<br />
arbitrary mathematical structure, for example, in which time was
<br />
directed by a potentially variable set of arbitrary laws. If we do not
<br />
exist as such, then those seemingly possible universes are not actually
<br />
possible, and what we experience is exactly what is possible.
<br />
<br />If chaos is out there, it would be here as well. Its similar to the idea
<br />
that if existence could not be, then a universe would not be here. My
<br />
point is that the solution is not to find some logical fact that
<br />
sustains order for conscious beings at the edge of chaos, but rather
<br />
figure out what is faulty about our expectation of chaos.
<br />
<br />Here is what I understand. Contrary to our expectations, time is
<br />
directed purely by what is most probable. Much of what we think of as an
<br />
intricate and systematic reality is simply what is most probable in
<br />
time. To begin explaining, first I must suggest that what is real,
<br />
primarily speaking, is the moment that we exist in, and not the system
<br />
of many moments that we ordinarily think of as reality. So, I postulate
<br />
that every possible moment or physical pattern exists as real as any
<br />
other. This is the way in which the universe is totally infinite.
<br />
<br />I believe the static world satisfies the necessity for the Universe to
<br />
be infinite, and is the only way in which the Universe is radically
<br />
infinite. Although the patterns of a rabbit crossing my ceiling do exist
<br />
as real as those where it does not, they, as well as most, do not
<br />
connect together to form a temporal system. Why not?
<br />
<br />Not time, but change itself has a natural direction. It is possible to
<br />
see that direction if we create a model of all possible moments or
<br />
states. Unfortunately, our modern mathematics does not exactly mirror
<br />
the physics of space-time, so it seems to us that this is not possible.
<br />
If the mathematical plane did mirror the universe there would be an
<br />
ultimate positive infinity number. Although there is a physical absolute
<br />
zero like that of the complex plane, there is not an ultimate positive
<br />
or single largest number to represent the infinite density of
<br />
space-time. There is no positive infinity number, however, there is
<br />
distinctly a first moment of time, and a physical state where the volume
<br />
of space-time is zero and density is infinite.
<br />
<br />Infinite density is an extreme physical value. Consequently the set of
<br />
all possible states is not indefinite, but rather it includes definite
<br />
boundaries. Rather than chaotic, the set of all possible states is quite
<br />
simple to envision, a spectrum of density patterns with two outer
<br />
extremes of zero and infinite density, in between which all possible
<br />
states exist and can be at least vaguely imagined.
<br />
<br />Once this spectrum, infinite yet bordered by extremes, is acknowledged
<br />
its relationship to and influence of space-time is difficult not to
<br />
notice. The universe of space-time begins near or from the point of
<br />
density and travels (by expanding and cooling) almost directly toward
<br />
the zero state. The movement through state space is sudden at first,
<br />
then slowly, then apparently the rate increases again,
<br />
<br />The only possible explanation for the direction and momentum of time is
<br />
that the actual spectrum extends beyond zero (as does the mathematical
<br />
plane) and includes an identical but inverse set of patterns, a positive
<br />
and a negative side. The equal number of states on either side of zero
<br />
makes the balance of zero inevitable. Zero is by nature a great
<br />
attractor for time, for any and all change, pulling us toward it. The
<br />
momentum slows as we draw nearer, as the group of positive and negative
<br />
states equalize. But then apparently, to my own surprise, the rate
<br />
appears to increase in the end near zero, I expect this is because Omega
<br />
zero or a perfectly flat space extends infinitely in all directions.
<br />
<br />In any case, time is simply moving in the direction of greater balance
<br />
within the overall state space of possibilities. So the possible
<br />
directions of time that make up the many worlds universe are not
<br />
arbitrary. The only possible and natural direction of time or change is
<br />
toward balance. Anything else would be arbitrary and require a reason or
<br />
supernatural explanation, such as consciousness, etc.
<br />
<br />Our universe, and all others within the total wave function of all the
<br />
MWs comprise the natural directions of time, which in fact with a little
<br />
more study turns out to be a fourth dimension of space. Time as we know
<br />
it is actually space; directions which pass through the 3D static
<br />
spatial moments of the Universe&#x2019;s state space. It takes some work to see
<br />
this clearly, and there is more to an aggregate state space model, but
<br />
in ending, it isn&#x2019;t that space-time is not real compared to the static
<br />
universe. Rather it is simply secondary or relative to the structure of
<br />
the absolute or permanent universe.
