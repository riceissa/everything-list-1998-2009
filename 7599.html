<em class="quotelev1">&gt; True, it isn't always necessary to compute things in the same order--if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you're simulating a system that obeys time-symmetric laws you can always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reverse all the time-dependent quantities (like the momentum of each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particle) in the final state and use that as an initial state for a new 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation, and the new simulation will behave like a backwards movie of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original simulation.
</em><br />
<br />One problem with this in practice is that it seems that the information
<br />
needed to specify the final state is far greater than the information
<br />
needed to specify the original state, at least with physics like ours.
<br />
In our universe, you could take a snapshot at some time that recorded all
<br />
the particle motions in a brain.  Then you could evolve it forward and
<br />
produce the successive subjective experiences.  However, I don't think the
<br />
snapshot has to be completely detailed.  Some sloppiness is acceptable.
<br />
The brain is robust and you could change the details of thermal motions
<br />
very considerably and the brain would still work fine.
<br />
<br />If you took a snapshot at the end and evolved it backward it would
<br />
also work, in theory, but in practice it would not work unless every
<br />
detail of every motion was precise to an incredible degree.  (This is
<br />
ignoring issues of QM state reduction and such, I'm basically considering
<br />
a Newtonian clockwork here.)  It's like, it's easy to come up with
<br />
motions to scramble an egg; but to come up with motions to unscramble
<br />
one will require absolute precision in every respect.  The result is
<br />
that the information requirements for specifying a final-state based
<br />
simulation that includes an arrow of time are exponentially greater than
<br />
the information needed to create a plausible initial-state simulation.
<br />
<br />If we then add the concept of measure based inversely on the size of
<br />
the information description, we find that almost all measure of such
<br />
simulations comes from initial-state based ones rather than final-state
<br />
based.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But since I don't have a well-defined mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory of what it means for two computations to have the same &quot;causal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure&quot;, I'm not sure whether the causal structure would actually be any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different if you computed a universe in reverse order. When I think of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;causal structure&quot;, I'm not really presupposing any asymmetry between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;cause&quot; and &quot;effect&quot;, I'm just imagining a collection of events which are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; linked to each other in some way like in a graph, but the links need not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have any built-in direction--if two events are linked, that doesn't mean one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; event is the cause and the other is the effect, so the pattern of links 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could still be the same even if you did compute things in reverse order. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;From what I've read about loop quantum gravity, it's a theory in which space 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and time emerge from a more primitive notion of linked events, but I'm 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pretty sure it's not a time-asymmetric theory.
</em><br />
<br />My feeling is that causality, like time, is in the eye of the beholder.
<br />
It's not an inherent or fundamental property.  Rather, it is a way that
<br />
we can interpret events in some kinds of universes.  Completely chaotic
<br />
universes (where every moment is random and uncorrelated with the next)
<br />
would not have causality in any meaningful sense.  Likewise for static
<br />
universes.
<br />
<br />In fact I would suggest that causality only exists in our universe in
<br />
areas where there is an arrow of time; that is, in areas which are far
<br />
from equlibrium and where entropy is unusually low.  The problem in
<br />
equilibrium regions is that you can always look at things two ways.
<br />
Suppose particle A collides with B and changes its course so that B
<br />
collides with C.  We can express this as that A causes B to hit C.
<br />
But all the physics works just as well in the reverse direction, in
<br />
equilibrium, so we could just as easily say that C caused B to hit A.
<br />
<br />Scerir has also posted some interesting paradoxes along these lines
<br />
relating to QM.  Suppose we have a photon that passes through a
<br />
polarizer oriented at 20 degrees from vertical, then through one
<br />
oriented at 40 degrees, and makes it through both.  At the end we would
<br />
say its polarization was 40 degrees.  But what was it between the two
<br />
polarizers?  Conventionally we would say that the first polarizer made its
<br />
polarization become 20 degrees and the second polarizer then changed the
<br />
polarization to 40 degrees.  But actually you can just as easily argue
<br />
that the photon polarization was 40 degrees between the two polarizers.
<br />
That interpretation works just as well, a sort of retroactive causality.
<br />
<br />As with time, my guess is that if we restrict our attention to observers
<br />
like us, of a type we can comprehend, then automatically we are going to
<br />
pick out information systems that have a notion of time, an arrow of time,
<br />
and hence a sense of causality.  Not all systems have these properties,
<br />
but some do, and all the ones that we would identify as observers fall
<br />
into that category.
