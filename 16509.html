<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay, going back to basics.  It seems to me that there are two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A) The problem of explaining WHAT we perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B) The problem of explaining THAT we perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first issue is addressed by the third-person process of physics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and of just generally trying make sense of what we perceive as we go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through the daily grind of life.  Everybody has a grasp of this issue,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because you're faced with it everyday as soon as you wake up in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; morning, &quot;what's going on here???&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Well, that is &quot;grandmother physics&quot;. It works well locally, but is  
<br />
refuted by quantum mechanics, and actually is not tenable with just  
<br />
the assumption of computationalism. There is an hard problem of matter.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second issue is obviously the more subtle first-person problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />Computationalism makes necessary the reduction of the hard problem of  
<br />
matter to the less hard problem of mind. The problem of mind is less  
<br />
hard, with comp, because computer science and the provability logics  
<br />
can reduce the classical mind problem to the study of the correct  
<br />
discourse of the self-introspecting machine using mathematical logic  
<br />
to define the notion of self-referencial correctness. We get freely  
<br />
the many nuances between true, communicable, provable, knowable,  
<br />
inferable, observable, sensible, etc...
<br />
<br />I think you have opted for platonist idealism at the start, so perhaps  
<br />
you are not motivated to run through the Universal Dovetailer  
<br />
Argument, whose main goal is to show that if we assume  
<br />
computationalism (the assumption we can use classical teleportation as  
<br />
a motion means, or that we are Turing-emulable) then we have to reduce  
<br />
the physical laws to number theory/computer science (and a theory of  
<br />
consciousness, which I take as a theory of machine's knowledge, with  
<br />
the usual modal axiom of consciousness. Consciousness is the &quot;true  
<br />
believe in a reality&quot;. But with comp that reality is not the physical  
<br />
reality, it is more the belief in elementary arithmetic, and from the  
<br />
point of view of the machine it is a bet on self-consistency: there is  
<br />
a reality which &quot;satisfy me&quot;, there is a model making &quot;me&quot; valid. I  
<br />
use Gödel Henking &quot;completeness&quot; theorem here.
<br />
<br />You can take a look:
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHALAbstract.html">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHALAbstract.html</a>
<br />
<br />I have already explain ten times this in this mailing list. I think  
<br />
most grasp the six or seven steps, but some trouble remains for the  
<br />
8th step. I intent also to come back soon or later to the seventh step  
<br />
(which contains typical computer science difficulty) in my  
<br />
conversation with Kim.
<br />
Search UDA in the archive of this list. I have finished in March a new  
<br />
version of UDA (in 08 proposition) which has benefited from the  
<br />
conversation with the list, and I will put it, someday, on my web page.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, for A, the fact that we are able to come up with rational-seeming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanations for what we experience, and that there seems to us to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an orderly pattern to what we perceive, doesn't answer the deeper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question of the ultimate nature of this external world that we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observing.
</em><br />
<br />I agree. Aristotle's naturalist hypothesis is an excellent  
<br />
methodological simplification, but it departs from all fundamental  
<br />
questions asked by Plato. And once Aristotle simplification is taken  
<br />
as a granted &quot;fact&quot;, or as authoritative axiom,  or worse: as obvious,  
<br />
then you can only be led to person elimination, in theory or in  
<br />
practice.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here we get into issues of scientific/structural realism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words, what do our scientific theories really mean?  (http://
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plato.stanford.edu/entries/structural-realism/)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I don't think we can assign any real meaning to what we observe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; until we have an acceptable understanding of the first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective experience by which we make our observations.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The mind-body problem is the problem of the relation between being and  
<br />
appearance. Between the always doubtful sharable objectivity and the  
<br />
always non communicable non doubtable direct true apprehension.  
<br />
Between third person povs and singular or plural first person pov.  
<br />
between Quanta and Qualia.
<br />
Physical reality is a first person plural type of things. QM confirms  
<br />
this through the multiplication of entangled population of observers.  
<br />
Physics concerns invariant patterns in all universal machine (self)-  
<br />
observation, and, (unless I am wrong 'course), the physical reality is  
<br />
the border of the intrinsic abyssal ignorance of all universal  
<br />
machines. My point is only that this entails verifiable/refutable  
<br />
facts, and up to now, QM confirms this. Comp easily refute any  
<br />
newtonian or classical physics.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the question of consciousness is more fundamental than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions of physics.
</em><br />
<br />Not at all. Those two questions are both fundamental and very  
<br />
fundamentally related. If you define consciousness by the true belief  
<br />
in a (non necessarily correct or probable) reality (we are conscious  
<br />
in dreams), then just computer science (and logic) can explain why and  
<br />
how consciousness differentiate in universal machine histories, and  
<br />
why stable and sharable dreams develop following long and deep (in  
<br />
Bennet sense) ultra-parallel computations (ultra-parallel =  
<br />
2^aleph_zero histories).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can come up with scientific theories to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain our observations, but since we don't know what an observation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really is, this can only get us so far in really understanding what's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going on with reality.  Until we have a foundation in place,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything built above is speculative.  To rely on physics as your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foundation is &quot;with more than Baron Münchhausens audacity, to pull
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the swamps of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothingness.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />We totally agree on this, except that such a point is not obvious, at  
<br />
least for most people after 1500 years of abuse of the Aristotelian  
<br />
methological simplification. See the paper for a proof that once we  
<br />
assume computationalism (and thus keep the notion of consciousness at  
<br />
the start) physics  has to be entirely reduced to the last mystery:  
<br />
the mystery of numbers. This one can be shown insoluble by *any*  
<br />
machine. All self-referentially correct machine can understand that  
<br />
none of them can ever explain where the (natural) numbers comes from.  
<br />
This makes them again a natural start. Without assuming them, we never  
<br />
get them.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But here we hit a problem because the process that we use to explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective data doesn't work when applied to subjective experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a discontinuity.  The third-person perceived reality vs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first-person experienced reality.  The latter apparently can't be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explained in terms of the former.
</em><br />
<br />All my point, Kelly, is that if you assume the computationalist  
<br />
hypothesis, (digital mechanism, or simply Mechanism) then the former  
<br />
has to be explained from the latter.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But without an explanation for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; latter, I don't see how any meaning can be attached to the former.
</em><br />
<br />But the later is not so difficult ... once you take some time to study  
<br />
computer science and mathematical logic. And then the former reappear  
<br />
under a measure problem on computations.
<br />
<br />I am amazed by the fact that we talk on comp since years here, and it  
<br />
seems many still don't realize comp is made possible by the discovery  
<br />
of the universal machine (by Babbage, Post, Turing, Church, Kleene,  
<br />
Markov ...). It is a bomb! A creative bomb, for a change. &quot;Nature&quot;  
<br />
invented it before 'course, again, and again, and again .... So does  
<br />
the numbers, trough their effective enumeration of their computable  
<br />
relations.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I think that is for this reason that I don't get hung up on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;white rabbit&quot; problem.  Arguments based on the probability of finding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yourself in this state or that state are fine if all other things are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equal, and that's the only information you have to reason with.  But I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't think that we're in that situation.
</em><br />
<br />Read the UDA and tell me where you have a problem, because this  
<br />
paragraph is far too ambiguous.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I start with the assumption of physicalism and then say that based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on that assumption, a computer simulation should be conscious,
</em><br />
<br />You mean by a physical computer?  Eventually this exist only in purely  
<br />
mathematical universal machine's dreams;
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then from there I find reasons to think that consciousness doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depend on physicalism.
</em><br />
<br />I agree. But this is the reason why we have to justify completely the  
<br />
physical appearance from computer science. No doubt information theory  
<br />
has a role there, but it is just a part of a very large and rich  
<br />
subject.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  To me, the most likely alternate explanation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to be that consciousness depends on information.
</em><br />
<br /><br />What do you mean by &quot;information&quot;?  Which theory are you referring  
<br />
too?  The term &quot;information&quot; is as tricky as the term &quot;random&quot; or  
<br />
&quot;infinite&quot;.
<br />
With comp pure noise (iterated self-duplication) multiplies &quot;freely&quot;.  
<br />
But the deep things arrive in the many probable relative informations  
<br />
on possible histories, in the limit the redundancy makes the deep  
<br />
difference.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relying on some of my thought experiments that assumed physicalism as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; support for my conclusion of &quot;informationalism&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I think the discontinuity between first and third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience is another important clue, because I think that this break
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be noticeable to all rational conscious entities in all possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds (even chaotic, irrational worlds).  They should all notice a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference in kind between what is observed (no matter how crazy it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is), and the subjective experience of making the observation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Further, let's say that I am a rational observer in a world where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changes to brain structure do not appear to cause changes to behavior
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or subjective experience.
</em><br />
<br />? (I guess here you come back with the idea that comp is false, isn't  
<br />
it). Remember comp is incompatible with the very idea that there is a  
<br />
material thing somewhere (by UDA). Ontologically there is only numbers  
<br />
together with their additive and multiplicative structure. This  
<br />
determine the whole dreamy-reality inside views structure of the  
<br />
number theoretical &quot;matrix&quot;. See my URL if interested.
<br />
It seems to be consistent with your ontological view, but with comp,  
<br />
computer science provides the math for the epistemological sides, and  
<br />
thanks to the incompleteness phenomenon (and others) all the nuances  
<br />
gives very different and incompatible, as such, inside views of  
<br />
Arithmetic. Most divided in two, the communicable and the non  
<br />
communicable.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Physicalism wouldn't have much appeal in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this world.
</em><br />
<br />In any world. Weak materialism, the idea that matter exists  
<br />
*primitively&quot; is provably false in the comp theory, with a minimal use  
<br />
of Occam.
<br />
Matter is not the answer, matter is the question. Reversal.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rather, dualism would seem to have a clear edge as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; default explanation.
</em><br />
<br />Dualism does not work at all. It uses the identity theory. The UDA  
<br />
step 8 and 07 gives no choice in the matter (no pun intended).
<br />
<br />But you are platonist we can agree with this.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it might be even easier to make the leap to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonism in such a world, as presumably Plato's &quot;ideal forms&quot; might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be even more appealing.
</em><br />
<br />Especially with Church thesis. Theoretical computer science provides  
<br />
an entire new realm. Theoretical computer science is a branch of math  
<br />
100% unrelated with physics, a priori. Of course many physicists  
<br />
follow Landauer and his idea that reality is based on quantum  
<br />
information, but my point is that even that move cannot work: quantum  
<br />
information has to be a first person plural reflect of classical  
<br />
digitalness. Bits and Qubits are related by a double arrow. This makes  
<br />
comp a testable theory. David Deutsch seems also to believe that  
<br />
physical computability supersedes in fundamentality the usual à-la- 
<br />
Post-Church-Kleene-Turing... classical computability, but I provide a  
<br />
reason to believe that this form of quantum fundamentality is a  
<br />
consequence of the numbers fundamentality. In their extensionnal  
<br />
relation (like Fermat theorem) and intensional relation (like in  
<br />
Kleene or Godel's theorem).
<br />
See my paper on Plotinus. The universal machine seems to plagiate  
<br />
Plotinus!
<br />
We have a theology here. Correct machines are always humble and can  
<br />
*only* pray on their consistency, and pray and work on the  
<br />
satisfiability of their dreams.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So in such a world you wouldn't get to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonism by way of thinking about computer simulations of brains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (since brain activity isn't correlated with behavior),
</em><br />
<br />If you mean &quot;brain physical activity isn't correlated in an one-one  
<br />
way with subjectivity&quot;, then I am OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I think you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would still get there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question is, what kind of world NOT lead you to Platonism?  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think only a world that didn't have first person experience.
</em><br />
<br />We agree on Platonism. But come on, the Pythagorean did already knows  
<br />
that numbers quick back. Since then we know that there are universal  
<br />
numbers which quick back universally. Comp and computer science are  
<br />
interesting for providing the shape (the math) of the uncomputable and  
<br />
insoluble which machines have to live with and sometimes name. And  
<br />
physics is solidified by its ultimate foundation in arithmetic. With  
<br />
comp there is a lot of work to do, that's sure.
