<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In the materialist view, my mental state is just the

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we need some definition of &quot;state&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Hmmm.  Well, I think my view of the word is pretty much the dictionary
<br />
definition.  Though there are two different meanings in play here.
<br />
<br />The physical state:
<br />
<br />&quot;the condition of matter with respect to structure, form,
<br />
constitution, phase, or the like&quot;
<br />
<br />And the mental state:
<br />
<br />&quot;a particular condition of mind or feeling&quot;
<br />
<br />Though ultimately I'm saying that there is no actual physical world
<br />
that exists outside of and independent from our perceptions.  You and
<br />
I probably perceive a very similar world, but there other conscious
<br />
observers who perceive very different worlds.  But all worlds are
<br />
virtual worlds that exist only inside the minds of conscious platonic
<br />
observers.  And I base this conclusion on the line of thought laid out
<br />
in my previous posts.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we discretize your brain, say slice it into Planck
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; units of time as Jason suggested, now we need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have something to connect one state to another.
</em><br />
<br />Why do we need to have something extra to connect one state to
<br />
another?  What does this add, exactly?
<br />
<br />I think that these instances of consciousness are like pieces from a
<br />
picture puzzle.  But not a jigsaw picture puzzle...instead let's say
<br />
that each puzzle piece is perfectly square, and they combine to make
<br />
the full picture.
<br />
<br />How do you know where each piece fits into the overall picture?  By
<br />
the contents of the image fragment that is on each puzzle piece.
<br />
<br />So each puzzle piece has, contained within it, the information that
<br />
indicates it's position in the larger framework.  The same is true of
<br />
instances of consciousness.
<br />
<br />Based on how well the edges of their &quot;images&quot; line up, you can get
<br />
some idea about the relationship between two instances of
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In idealism, the content of a state consciousness (a Planck slice, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a brain, but of a stream of consciousness) seems to me to be very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; small
</em><br />
<br />Well, I'm not sure how much of the brain's information is needed to
<br />
represent a particular state of consciousness.  But I don't think that
<br />
it's a crucial question.  My answer is:  more than none of it, but
<br />
less-than-or-equal-to all of it.  Somewhere in that range.  Ha!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You say it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connected by the correlation of information content, but is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unique?  Is there a best or most probable next state or what?
</em><br />
<br />So I guess I'm taking the position of &quot;extreme platonism&quot; here.  The
<br />
result is, I suppose, indistinguishable from that of modal realism.
<br />
<br />All possible &quot;next states&quot; exist.  None of them are &quot;best&quot; or &quot;more
<br />
probable&quot; than any other.  Every possible future lies ahead of you,
<br />
and some version of you will experience each one of them.  There will
<br />
be a version of you that never sees anything that strikes you as
<br />
unusual and who says &quot;the universe is very normal, and this all makes
<br />
perfect sense, and how could it be any other way.  These people who
<br />
advocate extreme platonism are crazy, because it doesn't match what I
<br />
observe.&quot;
<br />
<br />But, there will also be a version of you who never has a normal
<br />
experience again.  For eternity you will go from strange experience to
<br />
strange experience.  And this version will say, &quot;ah, ya, Kelly was
<br />
right about that extreme platonism thing.&quot;
<br />
<br />And there will be all points between the two extremes.
<br />
<br />Though, I think that this view does make a testable prediction.  Which
<br />
is:  there will be no end to your experiences.  There is no permanent
<br />
first person death.
<br />
<br />Of course, many realities will be unpleasant enough that this isn't
<br />
necessarily a good thing.  All good things lie before you.  But so do
<br />
all bad things.  Blerg.
