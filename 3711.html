<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would say that a single theory cantnot explain all becuase even that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to go yet?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I turn your question round how as a human being can you say that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;knowledge to Numbers without Physicsl context, in other words how does a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Baby find this. Now this dont mean Plato or you are wrong but it harder

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to prove your right since you are in the middle of Reality like our

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hologuy,He too cant know!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also if this is right surly it mean that your theory and means linked

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with comp are in fact formed from within Reality hence cant really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explain the Outline of Reality or the existence of Numbers without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;context for the idea of Numbers themselves come from within Reality so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what is truth???
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Even my idea are abstraction related to yours and yours too mine so we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are both in this Strange loop sorry?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree with all you say except I have shown that with the comp hyp
<br />
physics *cannot* be the fundamental theory of reality. Physics emerges
<br />
from a deeper theory which is just the psychology of machine. Stable
<br />
laws emerge from sheaf of coherent computationnal histories. The
<br />
block reality is just the (non axiomatisable) set of arithmetical truth.
<br />
&quot;Physical&quot; appears to be an indexical invariant, like &quot;here&quot;, &quot;now&quot;,
<br />
&quot;modern&quot;, &quot;artificial&quot;, etc.
<br />
<br />I don't think I could have know the notion of number without physical
<br />
context, but this does not logically imply that numbers *arise* from the
<br />
physical context.
<br />
<br />Concerning the hologuy or the dreamer he cannot know the real but
<br />
can discover some relative falsities. In its mathematical
<br />
neigborhoods, where (by definition)
<br />
he survives, the probability that most hologuys discover in the long run
<br />
the immateriality of any of the UM which locally supporte it/them is
<br />
near 1. So progress is always possible (and even unavoidable).
<br />
<br />Roughly speaking physical is the mathematical as seen from inside
<br />
by mathematical machine.
<br />
Everett has embedded the physicist in the physical world, and has
<br />
shown that this makes the probability rule a theorem instead as of a
<br />
quasi-inconsistent axiom. I show that if you embed the mathematician
<br />
in the mathematical reality then the deterministic equation must also
<br />
become a theorem.
<br />
<br />Math and arithmetic is not a collection of conventions, it kicks back
<br />
so much enough that it become reasonable (and obligatory with the comp
<br />
hyp) to attempt to reduce physics to machine psychology or computer
<br />
science.
<br />
<br />Of course we will never be sure of any theory (but that is not the
<br />
point, is it?).
<br />
Nor can we solve all questions. For exemple we cannot solve the question
<br />
of the origin of natural numbers. What is nice is that the comp hyp
<br />
*can* explain why no (sound) machine could explain that origin.
<br />
<br />Remember also that what I say is in principle testable. Just compare the
<br />
physics derived from the machine psychology with the physics
<br />
derived from observation.
<br />
<br />I think we share much of the same *philosophy*. We just choose different
<br />
theories. Perhaps because we don't ask the same question. I am interested
<br />
in the mind-body problem and in the problem of the origin of the physical laws.
<br />
<br />I just showed if we are digitalisable entity then the
<br />
empirical realities admit necessarily a non empirical explanation.
<br />
<br />I consider the number reality as a good candidate for the non 
<br />
empirical reality first because, by humility, I believe that the 
<br />
proposition
<br />
&quot;17 is prime&quot; is independent of the contingent and empirical ways &quot;I&quot; got
<br />
it; and second, because for logical reason it can be shown that without
<br />
that number reality it would be hard to just talk consistently about it.
<br />
<br />I insist you should read carefully the Universal Dovetailer Argument
<br />
(uda, cf URL below) because I am not sure you have seen *how should* the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;physical laws emerge from some sum on all computations (or Sigma_1
<br />
relations between numbers), if those laws emerge at all. Future will
<br />
decide!
<br />
<br /><br />Best regards and many thanks for your kind interest,
<br />
<br />Bruno
