<br />John M wrote: (Some criticisms which I am struggling with genuine effort to
<br />
understand, independent of attacks on style,
<br />
which I may have started. Sorry
<br />
<br /><br /><br />
A few factors:
<br />
<br />1. BRAINS AND BRAIN SOFTWARE ARE HIGHLY SPECIALIZED AND OPTIMIZED
<br />
<br />One thing I didn't state clearly. While I'm proposing a model of mind
<br />
as software, brain as hardware, this just tells us what a mind is capable
<br />
of computing, in principle; that is, computable functions. Every half-
<br />
decent computer, and every different high-level programming language, is
<br />
Turing equivalent, but each design yields different things that can be
<br />
computed conveniently or quickly. Turing-equivalence says nothing about
<br />
performance, and performance, on certain types of computations, is key to
<br />
how a brain of an animal works. So a brain is a computer optimized for
<br />
certain types of computations, and the software of a brain would be pretty
<br />
specialized in its detailed form to do computations efficiently on that
<br />
type of hardware.
<br />
<br />Also, if you are uncomfortable thinking of software as having to be loaded
<br />
onto a brain to get it to function, then think of the software as being
<br />
already in the brain, in analogy to the software being implemented as ROM
<br />
firmware or processor microcode, or some other more comfortable analogy.
<br />
Just because it's already &quot;built-in&quot; doesn't mean it isn't essentially
<br />
software. I would define the essence of software as being &quot;information
<br />
processing procedures&quot;.
<br />
<br />2. THE HUMAN MYSTIQUE - LET'S GET OVER OURSELVES, PEOPLE
<br />
<br />One of the biggest bugbears that would-be AI researchers face is &quot;the
<br />
human mystique&quot; attitude. The attitude that we are so fricking amazing
<br />
that no one could possibly understand us using our puny science. Well, I
<br />
think AI researchers would agree that humans (and other animals) are
<br />
pretty amazing indeed, but that doesn't stop an attempt to make inroads
<br />
into understanding how human minds work (or how a generalization or
<br />
interestingly similar variation of our minds work).
<br />
<br />The AI approach is to try to tease out general insights about cognition,
<br />
knowledge, intelligence by putting theories of same to the test of
<br />
implementation on a computer.
<br />
<br />That is, if you could create an alternative implementation of  a process
<br />
that seemed to be perceiving and thinking and acting (say, conversing
<br />
about many domains and new domains) with similar effect to a human
<br />
perceiving and thinking and acting, then you have learned at least
<br />
something about the perception and thinking processes in general.
<br />
<br />Maybe you have just learned more and more about what is NOT ESSENTIAL to
<br />
those processes, but if that's the case, at least you will have eliminated
<br />
a lot of the cloudiness of considering it all to just be unfathomable
<br />
levels of complexity.
<br />
<br /><br />3. THE QUALIA OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOT EXPLAINED BY AI, BUT LOTS IS
<br />
<br />I didn't claim that AI yet gives us any adequate insight into the
<br />
&quot;qualia of consciousness.&quot; But at least AI research can eliminate as
<br />
mysteries a number of behaviours closely tied to the qualia of
<br />
consciousness. To wit, it proposes that reflective cognition (a well
<br />
understood process) on the relation of a self-symbol to environment
<br />
symbols may have something to do with some of the behaviours that we
<br />
associate with consciousness. And it proposes that the shifts of &quot;primary
<br />
attention&quot; that seem to be a notable aspect of &quot;the qualia of
<br />
consciousness&quot; can be explained as emergence to the fore of the cognitions
<br />
of some few of the many different cognitive agent processes supervising
<br />
cognition effort at the highest level, in response to different primary-
<br />
drive-related priorities at various times, and also in response to how
<br />
well those cognitive agents have succeeded at coming up with a relevant
<br />
answer to something.
<br />
<br />I would say that if we are to be able to theorize cogently about how the
<br />
qualia of consciousness come about, at the least we have to be able to
<br />
eliminate the above factors from consideration, and claim that &quot;there is
<br />
still something else, separate from all that, and it is THIS.&quot; &lt;-- still a
<br />
mystery (to me anyway).
<br />
<br />4. GIVE ME HINTS OF A BETTER THEORY OF MIND THAN INFORMATION PROCESSING
<br />
<br />If you don't like a theory of brain as hardware, mind as software, it
<br />
is your responsibility, in the scientific tradition, to come up with a
<br />
better theory of mind. I am truly interested (no sarcasm).
<br />
<br /><br />5. DON'T JUST SAY &quot;IT'S VERY COMPLEX&quot;. BE MORE SPECIFIC
<br />
<br />Appealing to &quot;complexity&quot; or &quot;the unfathomable complexity of the whole&quot;
<br />
(paraphrased) seems to me to be a mystic's cop-out, similar to the
<br />
religious arguments of yore. Maybe that's not what you're doing. I'm not
<br />
reading carefully enough.
<br />
<br />6. REDUCTIONISM ISN'T EVERYTHING, BUT IT IS DAMNED USEFUL
<br />
<br />It seems to me that it is the whole reductionist approach that you are
<br />
attacking. I would counter that while reductionism is certainly never the
<br />
whole answer, it does at least produce some simpler questions (about
<br />
subsets of reality) which it is manageable to try to find real answers to.
<br />
If you don't like reductionism at all, please stop using all those nasty
<br />
products of it, like any technology more advanced than a rock to throw. I
<br />
hope you're not just proposing that we give up the entire scientific
<br />
project and sit and say &quot;ommmm&quot;. Don't get me wrong, I respect people who
<br />
do that and would like to be able to myself, but I find that the
<br />
scientific method (which requires reductionism as one of its techniques)
<br />
is also useful.
<br />
<br />7. EMERGENCE OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS IS WAY COOL. AI ALREADY USES THAT IDEA
<br />
<br />There is nothing incompatible between AI (i.e. intelligence-as-
<br />
information-processing) research and the realization that there is
<br />
profundity in the emergence of complex systems with emergent structure and
<br />
behaviour. The two ideas go hand in hand.
<br />
<br />8. DON'T USE QUANTUM MECHANICS AS A CRUTCH
<br />
<br />Don't use QM as a crutch to obtain the needed air of mystery surrounding
<br />
human cognition. QM may very well be involved somehow, but a lot
<br />
can be explained without resorting to it.
<br />
For example, a convincing illusion of free will could be generated
<br />
simply by the operation of an extremely complex, layered, classical
<br />
information processing machine whose behaviour is determined in a fixed
<br />
but maximally complex way by its information inputs and its algorithms,
<br />
which themselves are altered in complex ways over time by the inputs.
