Bruno:
<br />
Your individual 'believing' the invisible horses (excellent parable) -
<br />
when learned physics etc., will not 'deny' even the necessity of those
<br />
invisible horses: he will &quot;EXPLAIN&quot; and CALCULATE what they are in his
<br />
belief-system of the invisible horses.
<br />
That is exactly what the developing physical sciences do in their
<br />
reductionist development. They do not 'substitute' (deny) the old
<br />
superstitions, rather explain them and calculate them with the newer
<br />
superstitions. In most cases (entropy, energy, etc.) even the names are
<br />
retained. (Laplace was an extraordinary revolutionist).
<br />
<br />A nasty question: Do you NOT rename (explain) &quot;primary matter&quot;  by numbers?
<br />
(as YOUR initiational concept?) or, as you called it:
<br />
(&gt;&quot;mathematical coherence of the computations&quot;. &lt;)
<br />
Aren't numbers- (computations? in UDA's views) the 'new' invisible horses, -
<br />
or God's creation? i.e. the 'origin' of everything? I agree with your logic:
<br />
the thought does not 'eliminate' the invisible horses, but many 'scientists'
<br />
are in parallel religious believers (maybe also of creationism).
<br />
<br />In my world(view) matter is our interpretation of phenomena and even regular
<br />
physics can prove it by going down the particulate ladder ending up in no
<br />
matter-like fundamentals (I discount the semantic joke calling (wavelike?)
<br />
Q-entities  a 'particle' - even if so, it is not a matter-particle). Perfect
<br />
duplication is in my views not feasible, because in the incessantly changing
<br />
everything a duplication would be performed under &quot;not-identical&quot;
<br />
circumstances to the original template-circumstances. I speak about infinite
<br />
wholistic interconnectedness here.
<br />
<br />I changed the Subject-line, because I don't want to aggravate &quot;Father Ted&quot;.
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Computationalism entails COMP.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno, could you distinguish between your remarks vis-a-vis comp, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the one hand: a belief in 'primary' matter can be retained provided
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is not invoked in the explanation of consciousness,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Imagine someone who has been educated during his entire childhood with
<br />
the idea that anything moving on the road with wheels is pulled by
<br />
invisible horses. Imagine then that becoming an adult he decides to
<br />
study physics and thermodynamics, and got the understanding that there
<br />
is no need to postulate invisible horses for explaining how car moves
<br />
around.
<br />
Would this &quot;proves&quot; the non existence of invisible horses? Of course
<br />
no. From a logical point of view you can always add irrefutable
<br />
hypotheses making some theories as redundant as you wish. The
<br />
thermodynamician can only say that he does not need the invisible
<br />
horses hypothesis for explaining the movement of the cars , like
<br />
Laplace said to Napoleon that he does not need the &quot;God hypothesis&quot; in
<br />
his mechanics. And then he is coherent as far as he does not use the
<br />
God concept in is explanation.
<br />
<br />The comp hypothesis, which I insist is the same as standard
<br />
computationalism (but put in a more precise way if only because of the
<br />
startling consequences) entails that &quot;primary matter&quot;, even existing,
<br />
cannot be used to justify anything related to the subjective
<br />
experience, and this includes any *reading* of pointer needle result of
<br />
a physical device. So we don't need the postulate it.
<br />
And that is a good thing because the only definition of primary matter
<br />
I know (the one by Aristotle in his metaphysics) is already refuted by
<br />
both
<br />
experiments and theory (QM or just comp as well).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other: that under comp 'matter' emerges from (what I've termed) a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recursively prior 1-person level. Why are these two conclusions not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contradictory?
</em><br />
<br /><br />'Matter', or the stable appearance of matter has to emerge from the
<br />
&quot;mathematical coherence of the computations&quot;. This is what the UDA is
<br />
supposed to prove. Scientifically it means that you can test comp by
<br />
comparing some self-observing discourses of digital machines (those
<br />
corresponding to the arithmetical translation of the UDA (AUDA)) with
<br />
empirical physics. Again this cannot disprove the (&quot;religious&quot;) belief
<br />
in Matter, or in any Gods, for sure.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You will have to attach
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness to actual material infinite.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why is this the case?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Because it is a way to prevent the UDA reasoning (at least as currently
<br />
exibited) to proceed. It makes sense to say that some actual material
<br />
infinity is not duplicable, for example. To be sure, the AUDA would
<br />
still work (but could be less well motivated).
