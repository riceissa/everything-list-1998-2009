<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Physical Program isnt over yet!

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The wider approach:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thought (Guess Reason Creativity.......)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Experiment-Physical(in what ever way Nature throws it at you)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />You talk like if I was *proposing* COMP as the TOE which
<br />
should replace Physics. Obviously you believe in a
<br />
*apparently* wider vision.
<br />
<br />I try to comment shortly this in two ways:
<br />
<br /><br />1) A weak way: 
<br />
I don't think it is possible to explain the physical laws
<br />
by taking for granted a physical law. Of course observations
<br />
and inferences of physical laws can help, but those who
<br />
search for an explanation of the existence of the physical 
<br />
laws (and not just for  a compression of the empirical 
<br />
information) must jump outside physics at some stage.
<br />
Now, it is possible to justify that a TOE without the
<br />
natural numbers cannot justify natural numbers. So a minimal
<br />
TOE must be an extension of some arithmetics.
<br />
Then, incompleteness phenomena can explain why it is quite
<br />
possible we don't need to postulate anything above numbers.
<br />
So why should we postulate a &quot;physical reality&quot; nobody has ever
<br />
been able to define?
<br />
<br /><br />2) A strong way: 
<br />
The computationalist hypothesis (comp) in the cognitive science
<br />
entails the incomptatibility of the weak materialist assumption
<br />
(the assumption that there exist independent substances).
<br />
Comp makes possible to reformulate the mind-body problem, and
<br />
it takes necessarily the form of justifying sort of average
<br />
conditional belief in apparent substance by universal machine, 
<br />
where belief is defined
<br />
axiomatically: B(p) must verify B(p-&gt;q) -&gt; (Bp -&gt; Bq), etc.
<br />
I like to express this result as: comp -&gt; reversal between
<br />
physics and (machine) psychology.
<br />
'course, I may be wrong, but then I would like to know where.
<br />
(look at the UDA).
<br />
<br />Please, be aware I am not saying that COMP is a panacea capable
<br />
of explaining everything. The UDA shows exactly the contrary:
<br />
if we take the comp postulate seriously we have to justify 
<br />
machine beliefs in matter/energy/time without postulating
<br />
matter/energy/time. That's all.
<br />
At this stage physics is redined as the search of a relative
<br />
measure (integral) on the consistent extensions computationaly
<br />
accessible.
<br />
<br />UDA is only one half of my thesis.
<br />
The miracle is that, following Godel, you can translate the UDA
<br />
in pure arithmetic, and you can (thanks to important works
<br />
mainly by Grzegorczyk, Segerberg, Solovay, Boolos, Goldblatt, 
<br />
Visser) extract the logical structure of that space of
<br />
computationally accessible consistent extensions. We get a sort
<br />
of quantum logic. (This is the second half of my thesis)
<br />
To day it looks like that logic is rich enough for defining 
<br />
universal quantum computing (thanks to Deutsch fundamental 
<br />
discovery of universal quantum computing, but also some more
<br />
recent paper like the Rawling and
<br />
Selesnick in the journal of ACM 2000)
<br />
<br />Only the future will confirm that it is or that it isn't a 
<br />
mirage. That could very well lead to a refutation of comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Much of 'Science and Sanity ' has been incorporated into our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;culture without any direct reference to it. Most people remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Korzybski's phrase 'The map is not the territory; the map doesn't cover
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all of the territory; and the map is self-reflexive (it becomes part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the territory)'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. In particular if you embed the map in the territory, there
<br />
is a point of the map which will refer correctly to its own
<br />
position. Something similar happens with comp. There exists
<br />
set of key invariants, fixed points, for computational transformations
<br />
in computational spaces.
<br />
<br />David Deutsch insists we take our theories seriously, and I am
<br />
just saying that those who postulate comp should take seriously the
<br />
very counterintuitive and big consequences of that postulate. 
<br />
<br />There is no reason to think that comp will stop the Physical
<br />
Program. I even expect the contrary. I'm open to the idea that in the
<br />
future, comp will perhaps predict that any unifying theory of the empiry 
<br />
can be empirically refuted, perhaps even constructively so.
<br />
(But I have always fail in trying to prove that, to be honest).
<br />
<br />Bruno
