<br />Of course, my personal answer would take into account the fact that I  
<br />
already have a problem with the materialist's idea of &quot;matter&quot;. But I  
<br />
think we're supposed to be considering the question in the context of  
<br />
mechanism and materialism. So I'll ask, what should a mechanist- 
<br />
materialist say about the state of Alice's consciousness during the  
<br />
exam?
<br />
<br />Maybe I'm jumping ahead, but I think this thought experiment creates a  
<br />
dilemma for the mechanist-materialist (which I think is Bruno's  
<br />
point). In contrast to many of the other responses in this thread, I  
<br />
don't think the mechanist-materialist should believe that Alice is  
<br />
conscious in the case when every gate has stopped functioning (but  
<br />
cosmic rays are randomly causing them to flip in the exact same way  
<br />
that they would have flipped if they were functioning). Alice is in  
<br />
that case functionally identical to a random-number generator. It  
<br />
shouldn't matter at all whether these cosmic rays are striking the  
<br />
broken gates in her head, or if the gates in her head are completely  
<br />
inert and the rays are striking the neurons in (say) her arms and her  
<br />
spinal chord, still causing her body to behave exactly as it would  
<br />
have without the breakdown. I agree with Telmo Menezes that the  
<br />
mechanist-materialist shouldn't view Alice as conscious in the latter  
<br />
case. But I don't think it's any different than the former case.
<br />
<br />It sounds like many people are under the impression that mechanism- 
<br />
materialism, with it's rejection of zombies, is committed to the view  
<br />
that Lucky Alice must be conscious, because she's behaviorally  
<br />
indistinguishable from the Alice with the correctly-functioning brain.  
<br />
But, in the sense that matters, Lucky Alice is *not* behaviorally  
<br />
indistinguishable from fully-functional Alice. For the mechanist- 
<br />
materialist, everything physical counts as &quot;behavior&quot;. And there is a  
<br />
clear physical difference between the two Alices, which would be  
<br />
physically discoverable by a nearby scientist with the proper  
<br />
instruments.
<br />
<br />Lets imagine that, during the time that Alice's brain is broken but  
<br />
&quot;luckily&quot; acting as though it wasn't due to cosmic rays, someone  
<br />
throws a ball at Alice's head, and she (&quot;luckily&quot;) ducks out of the  
<br />
way. The mechanist-materialist may be happy to agree that she did  
<br />
indeed &quot;duck out of the way&quot;, since that's just a description of what  
<br />
her body did. But the mechanist-materialist can (and must) claim that  
<br />
Lucky Alice did not in fact respond to the ball at all. And that  
<br />
statement can be translated into pure physics-talk. The movements of  
<br />
Alice's body in this case are being caused by the cosmic rays. They  
<br />
are causally disconnected from the movements of the ball (except in  
<br />
the incidental way that the ball might be having some causal effect on  
<br />
the cosmic rays). When Alice's brain is working properly, her act of  
<br />
ducking *is* causally connected to the movement of the ball. And this  
<br />
kind of causal connection is an important part of what the mechanist- 
<br />
materialist means by &quot;consciousness&quot;.
<br />
<br />Dennett is able to - and in fact must - say that Alice is not  
<br />
conscious when all of her brain-gates are broken but very luckily  
<br />
being flipped by cosmic rays. When Dennett says that someone is  
<br />
conscious, he is referring precisely to these behavioral competences  
<br />
that can be described in physical terms. He means that this collection  
<br />
of physical stuff we call Alice really is responding to her immediate  
<br />
environment (like the ball), observing things, collecting data, etc.  
<br />
In that very objective sense, Lucky Alice is not responding to the  
<br />
ball at all. She's not conscious by Dennett's physicalist definition  
<br />
of consciousness. But she's also not a zombie, because she is behaving  
<br />
differently than fully-functional Alice. You just have to be able to  
<br />
have the proper instruments to know it.
<br />
<br />If you still think that Dennett would claim that Lucky Alice is a  
<br />
zombie, take a look at this quote from <a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/zombic.htm">http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/zombic.htm</a> 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;: &quot;Just remember, by definition, a zombie behaves indistinguishably  
<br />
from a conscious being–in all possible tests, including not only  
<br />
answers to questions [as in the Turing test] but psychophysical tests,  
<br />
neurophysiological tests–all tests that any 'third-person' science can  
<br />
devise.&quot; Lucky Alice does *not* behave indistinguishably from a  
<br />
conscious being in all possible tests. The proper third-person test  
<br />
examining her logic gates would show that she is not responding to her  
<br />
immediate environment at all. Dennett should claim that she's a non- 
<br />
conscious non-zombie.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, I think Bruno's thought experiment causes a problem for  
<br />
the mechanist-materialist, as it is supposed to. If we believe that  
<br />
the fully-functional Alice is conscious and the random-gate-brain  
<br />
Alice is not conscious, what happens when we start turning Alice's  
<br />
functioning brain-gates one-at-a-time into random brain gates (and  
<br />
they luckily keep flipping the way they would have)? Alice's deep  
<br />
behavior changes - she gradually stops responding to her environment,  
<br />
although her outward behavior makes it look like she still does - but  
<br />
clearly there's nothing within Alice &quot;noticing&quot; the change. We  
<br />
certainly can't imagine (as Searle wants to) that Alice is internally  
<br />
feeling her consciousness slip away, but is powerless to cry out, etc.
<br />
<br />It's tempting to say that this argument simply shows us that Lucky  
<br />
Alice must be conscious after all, but that's just the other horn of  
<br />
the dilemma. The mechanist-materialist can only talk about  
<br />
consciousness in computational / physical terms. For Dennett, if you  
<br />
say that Alice is &quot;aware&quot;, you must be able to translate this into  
<br />
mechanistic terms. And I can't see any mechanistic sense in which  
<br />
Lucky Alice can be said to be &quot;aware&quot; of anything.
<br />
<br />I prefer to just say that Bruno's thought experiment shows that  
<br />
there's something wrong with mechanism-materialism, but it's not  
<br />
obvious (yet) what the solution is.
