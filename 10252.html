<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's a bit late in the day perhaps to tell me you 'don't even know what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mean by first person'!
</em><br />
<br />Haven't I been saying that all along.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I'll have another go.  I'm concerned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to distinguish two basic meanings, which failing to specify IMO causes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a lot of confusion:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) First person 1 (FP1) - the point-of-view that is directly claimed by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an individual (FP1i) such as David or Peter, or what is generally meant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when the word 'I' is directly uttered by such a person.
</em><br />
<br />A sense of &quot;1st person&quot; that cannot possibly be more fundamental
<br />
than a person. And persons are not fundamental....
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) First person 2 (FP2) - representations of an FP1 point-of-view as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modelled within members of the FP1 community. The usage of 'David' or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Peter' in point 1) exemplifies one type of such representation, whose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presumed referent is an FP1i person.
</em><br />
<br />Or whose presumed referent is just a person.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My speculation is that both of the above arise through specific sorts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of differentiation of an axiomatically FP1 context (FP1g).
</em><br />
<br />FP1 depend on a particular kind of structure, a
<br />
person, with a particular kind of mental apparatus
<br />
allowing it to have such a thing as a &quot;point of view&quot;.
<br />
<br />How could FP1-ness be more fundamental than those structures and
<br />
apparatuses ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My reason
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for this speculation is to simplify the ontological assumptions.  If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our existential context
</em><br />
<br />What is an &quot;existential context&quot; ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; is FP1 then any zone within it is also FP1 and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consequently, when structured into FP1i persons, yields the direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience with which we all claim familiarity.  I have been at pains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to point out that the nature and content of experience are a function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of such structure, and we shouldn't think in terms of 'conscious rocks'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or whatever.  Having established such an FP1 context, we can then go on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to show that FP2 and third person (TP) are simply other zones, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves organised for self-experience/ self-reporting, that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; categorised in specific ways for specific purposes. They are not novel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontological states.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If 3rdP &quot;zones&quot; are 3rdP because of the way they
<br />
are organised, the 1stP zones are 1stP becasueof the way
<br />
they are organised. The fundamental situation, absent
<br />
variation in organsation, is surely 0-personal.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You seem to think that the boundraries of the self are given by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; secondary,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; non-fundamental structures and properties, likewise qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a good point.  However, it prompts me to deny that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures you refer to are 'secondary'.
</em><br />
<br />How can structures fail to be secondary ? Surely whatever
<br />
they are constructed out is primary ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In claiming the FP1 context
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be 'primitive', I'm saying that it is irreducible.
</em><br />
<br />An irreducible structure or an irreducible non-structure ?
<br />
How can you have an irreducible structure ? How can you hav
<br />
e a person without a structure ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We have to begin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhere.
</em><br />
<br />Indeed. But why not begin with something simpler than
<br />
a person ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Likewise, in relying on 'differentiation' of this context
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and here I'm designedly agnostic about whether this 'differentiation'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resolves into comp, strings, or whatever)
</em><br />
<br />A much graver question is whether you can have personhod without
<br />
differentiation,
<br />
and first-personhood without personhood.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I'm also claiming the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independent irreducibility of primitive differentiation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussed this in one of my replies to Bruno in this thread.  Clearly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the undifferentiated FP1g context can yield no experience since thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceived it can have no 'content', either 'perceiver' or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'what-is-perceived'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So it must be differentiated.
</em><br />
<br />Assuming that it is 1st-personal. Dropping that
<br />
assumption allows you to state the more intuitive conlusion
<br />
that differentiation a plurality are not fundamental. (That is,
<br />
it allows you to explain the complex in terms of the simple,
<br />
rather than the complex)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now it seems to me that such a basic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion of differentiation (prior to any schematisation into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental-object-of-the-month) is primitive and irreducible, not to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say semantically paradoxical (since an undifferentiated whole that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the sum of everything cannot in logic rely on symmetry-breaking from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any source whatsoever).
</em><br />
<br />Err. Hmm. Whatever. I still think that if you are not
<br />
reducing the complex to the simple, you are not really
<br />
*explaining*.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Such apparent paradoxicality is a good test of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'primitiveness'. Both primitives are required,
</em><br />
<br />Huh ? What's the other one ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  because without the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'whole', the mutual transmutability of all phenomena is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incomprehensible, and without the 'part', no phenomena can arise at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all.  Consequently the differentiation process, and the structures to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which it gives rise, are as fundamental as the context itself.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You've lost me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As to 'qualia', I'd like to put it as follows. In my account of things,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our existence within the FP1g context is what gives us our purchase on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the (rest of the) world, what enables us to 'grasp it'.
</em><br />
<br />Not the causal interactions explained in detail by science ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whatever we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceive, we do so in terms of our existence in this form.  Such direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; access, what we sometimes call 'experience', is by this token both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incorrigible, and literally indescribable.  To take one of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; favourite examples, the 'experience of red', this is something which we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know by 'direct grasp', and as such it takes its place within our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'shareable knowledge base', or SKB.  But we cannot 'describe' (i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reduce) this direct experience, even to ourselves.  What we can do is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to refer to it ostensively - to 'point' to it - and to relate it to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other elements within the SKB.
</em><br />
<br />That merely states the qualia issue. The problem I have is that
<br />
since qualia are not (AFAICS) explained by your fundamental
<br />
1st person thingy, it is difficult to see what useful work it is doing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This puts us on precisely the same footing as the other members of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; FP1i community with whom we can share the SKB. So IMO 'qualia' are an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attribute of the FP2-type modelling of the SKB.  You know what I mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the term because we can both 'point' to parts of the SKB that in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view possess this attribute.  But the 'redness-of-red' is the medium,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 'means whereby', we grasp some element of the world directly, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is in itself not transmissible - it's not part of the SKB information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; content, it's the *medium* of the SKB (and everything else).
</em><br />
<br />Does that claim follow from 1st-personness , or is it a second
<br />
claim ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direct FP1 aspect 'red' is a fundamental structure based on a primitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context with a primitive process of differentiation.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Why shoukdn't FP1i be the most primitive 1st-person,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; arising from 0-personality ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It depends what you want 0-personality to mean.
</em><br />
<br />Neither 1st nor third person. If no structure capable
<br />
of 1st-person experience has a risen (e.g the universe 13
<br />
billion years ago) then
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim that FP1g has 'personality' in the FP1i sense of a single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual point-of-view.
</em><br />
<br />That's one of the things that makes it so hard to understand.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   What I'm claiming is that both have the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontological status, and since when we come to the 'individuation' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the context - i.e. ourselves (amongst others) - we know incorrigibly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that this ontology is first-personal, this status must per simplicitas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be first personal.
</em><br />
<br />We know that we are persons. How fundamental
<br />
that may be , is a matter of investigation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You may wish to distinguish 0-personal from third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal, in which case we might be able to agree on a more mutually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; satisfactory terminology (I'd be more than happy to abandon my terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for more transparent ones).
</em><br />
<br />3rd-personal: known to a person.
<br />
0-personal: neither knowing nor known.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my view the conceptual problems in trying to rationalise first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal with third personal is that IMO 'third person' is an attribute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; applicable only in a metaphorical or classificational sense to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'objects' within the SKB.
</em><br />
<br />Hence the need for a separate defintion of 0-personal.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The SKB is the 'third personal world', but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because ordinary language and inter-personal discourse forces us to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicate exclusively in terms of the SKB, this puts us into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; schizoid state between the 'world-out-there' (i.e. our ostensive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; references to the SKB, the FP2 or descriptive world) and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'world-in-here' (i.e. our 'experience' or 'direct grasp' of the SKB,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the FP1 or instantiated world).
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When I posit the FP1-only ontology,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm saying that all of this can be modelled as the 'world-in-here',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though of course not in a naive solipsistic sense - i.e. not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world-in-FP1i, but the world-in-FP1g.
</em><br />
<br />I still don't see what the non-naive sense is.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; All of that is structural and therefore seconfary to any prime
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; substance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that would be a telling point but for my arguments above.
</em><br />
<br />Which argument ? I find what you say very difficutl to follow.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You could have done the same starting from a 0-personal position.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope you can now see why I believe that I could not, unless it turns
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out that you mean by 0-personal what I mean by FP1g.
</em><br />
<br />I can't. You seem to be assuming that the 1st-personal
<br />
is fundamnetal or nothing. I don't see where you get
<br />
tht dichotomy from.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To test this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could you elaborate on how in your view the 'directly manifest' first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal point-of-view (not, mark you, FP2 descriptive analogs thereof,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such as the reference in this sentence) arises from the 0-personal.
</em><br />
<br />It is only directly manifest inasmuch as it how the brain
<br />
seems to itself. That does not make it ontologically fundamental.
<br />
<br />What is epistemologically basic -- subjective expereince -- is
<br />
ontologically very complex and very far from basic. A lot
<br />
of philosophy goes into the weeds when it confuses epistemic
<br />
prioirty with ontological priority.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 0-personal entails that under appropriate structural delimitation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such 'pinched-off' zones display FP1i first person-hood - such as that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which I presume you are modelling these words *right now* - then it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may turn out that we are merely confusing terms rather than concepts.
</em><br />
<br />The 0-personal does not exclude the 1st personal. The 1stP and 3rdP
<br />
emerge from it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; David

<br />(PS could you write *less* next time ? I find tha the more you write,
<br />
the less
<br />
&nbsp;I understand!)
