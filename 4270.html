Wolfram is fascinated by the generation of complexity and randomness 
<br />
from simple
<br />
rules, and sees this as a fundamental and unexpected observation.
<br />
<br />(As a long-time programmer, I'm puzzled by his surprise at this. My bugs 
<br />
often have
<br />
&nbsp;a complex and seemingly random nature, even in programs thought to be 
<br />
trivially simple. ;-)
<br />
<br />But seriously, we were taught in 3rd or 4th year comp sci. that if your 
<br />
computing
<br />
system can do IFs, LOOPs, and SUBROUTINE CALLS (or equivalent), it can 
<br />
compute
<br />
anything that can be computed (anything that can be computed using a 
<br />
finite number of
<br />
computing steps operating on finite data, that is). It is a universal 
<br />
computer.
<br />
<br />It is not really surprising at all to a programmer that some simple
<br />
combinations of IFs LOOPs and SUBROUTINE calls can start to generate 
<br />
assymetric
<br />
output, which when fed back in as input data can lead to non-linear 
<br />
systems and
<br />
complexity, and even randomness, in a hurry.
<br />
<br />---------
<br />
Wolfram criticizes current scientific theories, almost all based on 
<br />
simple mathematical
<br />
equations, as being able to model only the simple and regular aspects of 
<br />
systems.
<br />
These aspects, he seems to imply, might in many cases not be the most 
<br />
interesting
<br />
aspects of the systems. We are only describing those aspects, and those 
<br />
particular
<br />
systems, he says, because simple regularities are all that our 
<br />
pathetically limited
<br />
mathematical equation toolbox allow us to describe. And there is so much
<br />
more interesting complexity to the world, which cellular automata can 
<br />
better
<br />
emulate.
<br />
---------
<br />
But what if, in general, irregular complexity is boring, and it is only 
<br />
really
<br />
fundamental simplicities, and emerged simplicities, that are interesting?
<br />
What if mathematical-equation-based science was right all along?
<br />
<br />Alright. Overly simple arrangements might be a little dull (limited in
<br />
capacity for interesting properties or behaviours) too.
<br />
<br />What if there is a kind of &quot;interesting&quot; range of complexity of system.
<br />
A system characterised by simplicities and order sufficient to ensure 
<br />
some regular
<br />
structures (identifiable system components, hierarchical organization of 
<br />
components)
<br />
and regular behaviours, but with enough constrained complexities of
<br />
interaction between components to make the system capable of  a range
<br />
of non-trivial behaviour and interaction with other systems or components.
<br />
<br />Is this a kind of system that is only of interest to us with our particular
<br />
human interests? Or is there anything more fundamentally important about
<br />
systems with particular levels or arrangements or mixes of order and 
<br />
complexity?
<br />
<br />Are there, for example, any general rules about the mix of simplicity, 
<br />
order,
<br />
and complexity (arrangements of entropy) that can produce higher-level
<br />
emerged systems which may have properties of  being identifiable,
<br />
sustainable or recurring, instrumental in even higher level systems etc.
<br />
<br />This is way out there stuff vaguely sketched. I know.
<br />
<br />In any case, I tend to agree with Kurzweil's criticism of Wolfram that 
<br />
Wolfram
<br />
doesn't focus enough the issue of how we find rules that produce the 
<br />
emergence of
<br />
higher-level order (simplicities, but with enough &quot;mobility&quot; to be 
<br />
interesting).
<br />
Wolfram, he says, focusses purely on the generation of
<br />
arbitrary complexity, and that's only part of the picture.
