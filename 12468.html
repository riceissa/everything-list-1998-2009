So! I'm an old fart AND a young whipper snapper! Isn't nature 
<br />
wonderful!  :-)
<br />
<br />Brent: 'Except it is obvious that it doesn't take that specific 
<br />
structure to make the muscles move - anything that sets off the 
<br />
appropriate efferent nerve will work.  Do you agree that your brain 
<br />
could be replaced, say neuron by neuron, with electronic neurons and 
<br />
still move your muscles...and still maintain your consciousness? '
<br />
<br />MP: This is a trick question of course, because in order to make any 
<br />
sense of it at all, at very least somebody has to say 'ceteris paribus' 
<br />
which ought to make us very suspicious at the outset. After that we need 
<br />
virtually to assume the very thing at question in order to proceed with 
<br />
the answering. That is to say, the question falls into a hole straight 
<br />
away if we do not allow the 'Turing emulation hypothesis' am I right?
<br />
<br />I for one have at very least grave doubts about the validity of numeric 
<br />
emulation of the Real world. On the other hand, numeric emulation of an 
<br />
already digitised model probably presents no problems to an entity with 
<br />
unlimited time and resources,
<br />
<br />MP: So Brent's question is actually composed of several parts and I 
<br />
don't have the time, or the theoretical language, to do the full kind of 
<br />
analysis that it deserves. Thus rough and ready but plain English is all 
<br />
I can give you here.
<br />
1/   Yes, ever since Galvani or somebody tried dissecting frogs on a 
<br />
pewter plate with a steel knife [yes?] it has been known that electric 
<br />
stimulation of muscles will cause them to twitch, even if the animal is 
<br />
already dead. At the most superficial level therefore it is true that 
<br />
'all we need' is to provide sufficiently discriminated sequential 
<br />
stimulation of all the muscles involved, either directly on the muscles 
<br />
or indirectly on the efferent neurons, and we could make a fresh corpse 
<br />
get up and walk.
<br />
<br />2/     Getting it to talk would be much harder, although making it 
<br />
produce the APPEARANCE of talking would be just a sophisticated 
<br />
extension of making it 'take up its bed and walk'. So yes, in principle, 
<br />
we could make a real good zombie suitable for a bit part in Hollywood, 
<br />
but not only would it not be conscious, it would have no autonomy 
<br />
whatsoever. It would just be dead meat on the move. And very much on the 
<br />
nose before long also! :-)
<br />
<br />3/   We then reach the first deep limit: even if we emulate vast numbers 
<br />
of movement patterns, our wandering corpse will not be engaged in 
<br />
problem solving if all we have is an on board computer pushing out 
<br />
stimulation patterns for the muscles in response to remote control and 
<br />
inertial control routines in the on-board computer. If we try to emulate 
<br />
the activities of ALL the neurons in the recently deceased brain we will 
<br />
encounter complexity pretty much beyond all imagining. Yes a team of 
<br />
crafty Igors might imagine interactions amongst groups of neurons and 
<br />
model in silicon what they imagine the organic neurons to have been 
<br />
doing. But they have a snag to overcome: They don't know what 
<br />
synergistic effects emerge out of the interactions of vast numbers of 
<br />
neurons. They are confronted with a fundamental choice:
<br />
a/   to work out what small bits of the brain do then construct a 
<br />
silicon based brain emulator comprised of many replicated copies of 
<br />
functional units and force it to LEARN, how to act properly, or
<br />
b/   take out a mortgage on all real estate in the galaxy and buy or 
<br />
make all the equipment needed to do the philosophers' facsimile!
<br />
<br />The reason for this is because the Igors [sounds much better than 
<br />
'Nerds'] do not know beforehand everything there is to know about 
<br />
neurons working together. I mean the processes involved in the 
<br />
transmission of depolarisation waves or impulses along the dendrites and 
<br />
axons are reasonably well understood, but how much are neurons in close 
<br />
proximity to each other affected by local area electromagnetic fields 
<br />
generated by the actions of large numbers of their neighbours? As I have 
<br />
asserted before, the human brain is a dynamic system, and if the Igors 
<br />
want to emulate everything significant about the functioning of neurons 
<br />
then it is not sufficient to make what someone thinks is an electric 
<br />
model of a neuron, they have got to know already just what it is that is 
<br />
significant.
<br />
<br />4/   For the reasons given so far [and hopefully they are sufficiently 
<br />
clear] it may be possible to create a generalised rendition of a 
<br />
'typical' human being, but it won't be you or me or any other particular 
<br />
person. Now I know that logicians, engineers and economists want to deal 
<br />
with an abstract and ideal case and therefore demand that we say 'if all 
<br />
the practical problems could be overcome, how about then?' so I can go 
<br />
along with the game and say that: By definition, if you really could 
<br />
emulate within a silicon based computer system EVERYTHING SIGNIFICANT 
<br />
about the structure and functioning of a human brain, then if follows 
<br />
that so long as the body, or body emulation including the brain 
<br />
emulation in question can interact with an environment like what its 
<br />
organic original was involved with, the entity in question would be 
<br />
conscious.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; There is NO ultimate answer to the meaning of life, the universe and

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  everything except that IT IS, and you are here to take part in it

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and observe yourself and others doing so. Existence is the source of

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; value, indeed it is the essence of value.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am not in the habit of putting myself forward, but here I believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the ideas are what count and I believe the issue is very important. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, problem - we're all human beings here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mean at 55 yo I know I have already attained 'old fart' status for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; most people I meet. But one thing I know for sure is that, just like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; me, YOU are not going to live for ever. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno thinks he will  :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As most of you seem a fair
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bit smarter than me I assume that you can/will mostly choose how you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; spend your limited lifetime. Choose wisely 'cause it's a once-off.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I really do think that before any of you get much older you should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; take a VERY careful look at what I have been writing here. Have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; look also at the common meanings for the word physics [samples
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; included below]. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't need to read definitions of physics - I are one. :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If you don't then I think you are going to spend the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rest of your lives chasing shadows, and end up a bunch of old men
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sitting on the cyberspace equivalent of a park bench, STILL chewing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; over the same old problem! Of course, if that is what you want then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that's fine. But don't say you weren't warned!  :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There's something to be said for chewing the metaphysical fat.  But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worry about yourself - I race motorcycles on the weekend.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the fact is, being conscious is inherently paradoxical, and there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; no escape from the paradox, just like there is no escape from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe - until you die that is. Your impressions, perceptions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; feelings, intuitions, etc. of being here now [where you are of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; course] is what it is like to be the updating of the model of self in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the world which you brain is constantly constructing all the time you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are awake. When you sleep there are times when enough of the model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; gets evoked that you have a dream that you can remember. The paradox
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is that for most of the time we assume that this awareness -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness, call it what you like - IS the world, i.e. what it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; like to be 'me' here now, whereas in fact it is only what it is like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to be the model of 'me' here now. This does not mean that you don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exist; you do exist, and you must pay taxes in partial payment for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the privilege, until you die that is. [I work for the Australian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Taxation Office so I know about these things :-] There is however a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; lot more stuff going on in your brain than is actually explicitly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; involved in your consciousness of the moment, as far as I can see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; there are usually a couple or triple of very sophisticated tasks 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; going on in parallel but swapping in and out of focussed attention as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  needs and priorities of the moment require. There are often also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; several other tasks simmering away like pots on the back burners of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your stove.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree.  Consciousness is a very small part of thinking - even of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical and mathematical thinking (c.f. Poincare' effect).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I believe it is the hippocampus which maintains the tasks in process
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  through re-entrant signalling to the relevant cortical and other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; areas which embody the salient features of the constructs involved.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Binding is achieved through re-entrant signalling of resonant wave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; forms such that each construct EXISTS as a dynamic logical entity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; able to maintain its own structure sufficiently to prevent certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; other things happening and to invoke through association [or perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; through reaction to patterns of inhibition, whatever] other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; constructs as necessary. Note the key word 'exists'. The energy is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; supplied through the work done as the neurons re-establish the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; resting potential of their cell membranes. And here I should point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; out that most of the posts on this list do not seem to talk much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; about structure, and yet it is the spatia-temporal structures of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; interacting cell assemblies which embody the patterns of information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which make muscles move. Think about it! This is what you should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; really concentrating on, because you and I are NOTHING if our muscles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can't be made to move in exactly the right way and the right time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Except it is obvious that it doesn't take that specific structure to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make the muscles move - anything that sets off the appropriate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; efferent nerve will work.  Do you agree that your brain could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; replaced, say neuron by neuron, with electronic neurons and still move 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your muscles...and still maintain your consciousness?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I know I have written 'I believe' up there a few times, but if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; wish I can go hunting for you and find a bunch of references that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; back up what I am saying. I do not have access to pay-as-you-go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; academic journals, so I have been gleaning ideas and items of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; interest about this for the last couple of decades. I put it to you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that if you seriously think I am wrong, then you have a moral duty to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; show me on the basis of clear and unambiguous empirical evidence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; where it is that I am wrong about this. Because otherwise it is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a matter of opinion and speculation, in which case mine is as good as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; anybody else's that I have seen on consciousness related lists and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what I am proposing is not in contradiction to any good evidence that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I have heard about. I think William of Occam would be more than happy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with what I am putting forward.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I hope no one is offended by this. Is they are, sorry! But time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; returns for no one and you do not have for ever, just all the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; there is - for you. That is what entropy is about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Entropy is about possibilities.
