This is an extract from the full work on solipsism. It is one special
<br />
section written in the first person, for what else could a solipsist
<br />
scientist do? I'd be interested in any comments... it paints a rather
<br />
bizarre picture of science.

<br />
I, Solipsist Scientist
<br />
<br />Copyright(c) 2006. Colin Hales. All rights reserved.
<br />
-------------------------------------------------
<br />
I am a solipsist scientist in that I accept that my mind, which is producing
<br />
the dialogue you now read, is the one and only conclusively proven mind and
<br />
possibly the only mind. My mind is an image in a kind of mirror; a
<br />
phenomenal mirror. The image I see and feel and smell and taste is all I
<br />
have to enact my craft, my science. Modern neuroscience shows me my brain in
<br />
the act of being a mirror for me. The image is what philosophy calls my
<br />
phenomenal consciousness or my phenomenality. I can experiment on my own
<br />
phenomenality say, by closing my eyes, which I note has a dramatic effect on
<br />
my ability to do science. When I sleep dreamlessly my phenomenality is
<br />
absent and when I awake the apparent external world in my mirror is
<br />
consistently behaving as if it recently had me asleep in it. Yet, as a
<br />
solipsist I am forced to question the actual existence of what is depicted
<br />
in my mirror. It is only an image, after all, and images can be fabricated.
<br />
As a solipsist I attribute this apparent external world depicted within my
<br />
mirror to be the work of the 'magical fabricator'.
<br />
<br />At the same time I must find it remarkable that my phenomenality somehow,
<br />
via the mysterious solution to the 'hard problem', appears to intimately
<br />
connect me to an external world. I know that my sensory data (nerve signals
<br />
from the peripheral nervous system that have no innate phenomenality) are
<br />
used by my apparent brain to create my phenomenality. As a scientist my job
<br />
is to extract and depict regularity in the appearances within my phenomenal
<br />
mirror's image as scientifically justified beliefs in the form of useful,
<br />
predictive generalisations. I know that when I do science what I am doing is
<br />
correlating the appearances of the contents of my phenomenality. The most
<br />
obvious evidence of this in any of my scientific papers is that of the
<br />
'test' subject in contrast to the 'control' subject. In the case of
<br />
Newtonian dynamics I would be correlating the behaviour of a mass and the
<br />
space it inhabits. All of this makes very good sense to me. Yet I am
<br />
troubled.
<br />
<br />Within my mirror's image are what appear to be other scientists with brains
<br />
that look the same as mine. These scientists are merely fabrications in my
<br />
own mirror's image. Yet despite being mere fabrications they appear, to me,
<br />
to do science on exquisitely novel things just as well as I do using my real
<br />
mind. At the same time I cannot see the image in their mirror and vice
<br />
versa. All report seeing only brain material. I take this as lending support
<br />
to my solipsism in that I can claim their minds not to exist, which is
<br />
consistent with my conviction that the external world does not exist. If I
<br />
am right, and my image(mind) is the only image(mind), then their science is
<br />
done without any image of their own. The 'magical fabricator' of my image
<br />
goes to an amazing amount of trouble to make it appear 'as-if' the external
<br />
world shown to me in my mirror does exist. The scientists within it behave
<br />
'as-if' they had the kind of mind I know I must have to do science.
<br />
<br />To be a solipsist scientist in this circumstance is to live in cooperation
<br />
with this extravagant fabrication including apparent scientists as adept as
<br />
myself. As a solipsist scientist, inwardly and silently I deny (remain
<br />
scientifically unable to confirm) that an external world exists. But as a
<br />
scientist within this apparent world I am fundamentally conflicted. To be
<br />
consistent with the behaviour of all the other scientists, outwardly I am
<br />
forced to act 'as-if' there was an external reality. Also, inwardly I know
<br />
my mind is the only proven reality, yet to my scientist colleagues, to
<br />
remain consistent I must deny my own mind as much as I deny theirs. I live
<br />
in this situation of denial that I have something more than my colleagues
<br />
have. I am thus doubly conflicted, for I must also act 'as-if' I have no
<br />
mind, for to declare otherwise is to be inconsistent with my claims about my
<br />
scientist colleagues, to whom I am identical.
<br />
<br />Yet despite this odd personal situation the system works, in a way. My
<br />
scientist colleagues continue to act as-if they had minds. Their scientific
<br />
lives - our lives - of appearance correlation go on as usual. The whole
<br />
system is consistent. I, the solipsist, get to inwardly claim my own mind's
<br />
existence and deny an external world. Outwardly I act 'as-if' there is an
<br />
external reality and deny my own mind and my colleagues'. They get to act
<br />
exactly like I do. All along I know that it is actually the work of the
<br />
magical fabricator, a belief I must also withhold to maintain appearances to
<br />
my science colleagues, since within this fabricated world such a claim would
<br />
be rejected on the grounds of empirical parsimony. My savior is
<br />
'objectivity'. As scientists we get to agree what appearances we are
<br />
describing and in doing so it is 'as-if' we are accessing an external
<br />
reality. The method is so successful scientists have a belief in an
<br />
'objective view' of the external world shared by all of them. The icing on
<br />
the solipsist's cake is that the inconsistency even works in the rather odd
<br />
self-referential boundary condition of the science of mind where the
<br />
scientific evidence system is pointed at the scientific evidence system to
<br />
do science. This unique science has taken the form of the Neural Correlates
<br />
of Consciousness. Scientists can correlate appearances of brain material
<br />
with hearsay reports of mirror image contents - phenomenal contents - quite
<br />
successfully and it has all the hallmarks of providing knowledge of the mind
<br />
in exactly the same way as it has provided knowledge of everything else.
<br />
Provided the scientists go on acting as if this technique is delivering an
<br />
explanation of 'mind' (that I outwardly deny exists), then even in the face
<br />
of the obviously anomalous evidentiary paradox (looking for appearances and
<br />
instead finding brain material) the system self-perpetuates. The scientists
<br />
even invented a theorem called the 'mind-brain identity theorem' to make
<br />
sure nobody went so far as to intuit anything like a magical fabricator or
<br />
its proxy.
<br />
<br />This I know is all just 'as-if' behaviour but if I stay quiet about it the
<br />
whole system works. My internal life thus masked, the whole system gets to
<br />
behave outwardly consistently. The only inconsistency is me and my unique
<br />
mind. Late at night in the quietude I wonder about my mind. How do I
<br />
reconcile my solipsistic internal life as a scientist with my outward
<br />
behaviour? On reflection I can see there are two choices. Firstly (a) I can
<br />
accept my mind as conclusive proof supporting continued fervent adherence to
<br />
the belief in a magical fabricator. Alternatively, (b) I can let a real
<br />
external world be responsible for my phenomenal mirror and all the contents
<br />
it shows me. What would my life as a scientist be like if the laughably
<br />
implausible option (b) were real? As a scientist I would, in effect, be
<br />
talking about mirrors, not images within them. 
<br />
<br />In the case (b) world I would still lead a dual life as a scientist. On one
<br />
hand I can happily correlate the appearances within mirror images and do
<br />
science like it has always been done. Nothing is wrong with it. After all it
<br />
is responsible for all the apparent technology we have. On the other hand I
<br />
also get to describe the external world in a completely different way. I get
<br />
to describe systems capable of creating what functions as mirrors, and not
<br />
only that, systems that appear to behave as they do when viewed with the
<br />
mirrors it makes. I realise this is an extraordinarily constrained problem.
<br />
There simply cannot be many systems that can do all of this. If we could do
<br />
this kind of science then  'images in the mirror' act as support for both
<br />
types of description - the description of image behaviour and the
<br />
description of systems that can make mirrors that appear like brains to the
<br />
mirror. Whatever that system is, it is capable of construction of things in
<br />
the external world with appearances we observe as such as atoms, elephants
<br />
and scientists and their phenomenal mirrors. In this alternative world my
<br />
mind is effective proof of the existence of an underlying reality. I no
<br />
longer have to pretend. I can lead an outwardly honest dual life as a
<br />
scientist within a world of scientists with minds like me. The magical
<br />
fabricator has been replaced by an external world. Not the external world of
<br />
appearances, but an underlying external world capable of generating mirrors
<br />
with appearances that depict the natural world as it does to us. In this new
<br />
world of science seeing is evidence of mind and thus an underlying external
<br />
world. In contrast, that which is seen is empirical evidence of the behaving
<br />
external world and also is evidence of seeing.
<br />
<br />If I am right to be a solipsist I live in the universe of the magical
<br />
fabricator forced to play a pretend life 'as-if' there is a real external
<br />
world with fictitious scientific colleagues, all doing the same thing. If I
<br />
am wrong to be a solipsist and the external world is justified (which
<br />
scientists paradoxically behave 'is-if' true already), then all scientists
<br />
in that world, behaving 'as-if' there was an external world are actually
<br />
also tacit solipsists in denial of all minds, just like me. So as a
<br />
scientist I face a dilemma. I look around myself and what do I see universal
<br />
evidence of? The world I live in is a case (a) world. No scientist anywhere
<br />
has, for any reason other than accidentally, ever looked at systems
<br />
producing worlds with scientists in them complete with minds in it, built of
<br />
it. Indeed when they do the scientific world snaps back, declares the
<br />
attempt irrelevant metaphysics consistent with an outward denial of mind. In
<br />
this bizarre world of 'objective' scientists outwardly all acting 'as-if' an
<br />
external world exists, all scientists are actually virtual solipsists
<br />
outwardly acting 'as-if' there is no such thing as mind whilst being totally
<br />
reliant on their phenomenality to do science. And, like me, they are in
<br />
effective (methodological) denial of their own mind, tacitly affirming
<br />
belief in a magical fabricator. Scientists in this state will go on forever
<br />
correlating appearances within their denied mirrors and never get to do
<br />
science on mirrors. Which one to choose? Perhaps I'll go where the
<br />
fictitious money is. to the land of the virtual magical fabricator. and keep
<br />
quiet.
