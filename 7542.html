<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can we imagine a universe like ours, which follows exactly the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same natural laws, but where time doesn't really exist (in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense), where there is no actual causality?
</em><br />
<br />You yourself have already provided the key example in imagining
<br />
a two dimensional CA where the second dimension can be taken as
<br />
y instead of t.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we can find a reasonable interpretation... of a pattern in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the [this CA] universe as something that we would consider a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious observer in our own universe, then we would be right
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to say that this CA universe has consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />I would be VERY HAPPY to abandon my belief that somehow time is
<br />
special. It's very annoying to suspect myself of simply having
<br />
a failure of imagination, in that I could not---as Einstein
<br />
perhaps did---see our 4-D block universe as just any old 4-D
<br />
continuum.  But I encounter a runaway reductio that smashes up
<br />
my attempt to *believe*.
<br />
<br />Okay, so suppose we have a book one trillion times as large as
<br />
Wolfram's (or as big as we need to have), and we cut out all the
<br />
pages and line them up so that we have a two dimensional layout
<br />
that is recognizably a conscious entity. This now, as you know,
<br />
no longer exhibits any *time* at all; it is a &quot;succession of
<br />
frozen states&quot;, that is, each horizontal line of the CA is, as
<br />
you describe, connected to the next only by..., only by what?
<br />
<br />Well, it seems that it is *we* who spot the connection. We guess
<br />
and then accept that there is a rule that associates each horizontal
<br />
line with the next one. Not so simple as the rule you give (i.e.,
<br />
s[x,t+1] = s[x,t] XOR (s[x-1,t] OR s[x+1],t]), of course, but
<br />
nonetheless entirely objective after we see it.
<br />
<br />We can call it time---or not---, just as you also point out.
<br />
<br />(I will later claim that what is missing is the underlying
<br />
continuous machinery, but to do so right now would be to miss
<br />
the point of your argument.)
<br />
<br />So we have this sequence of horizontal lines which are connected
<br />
by a rule. The input to the rule is line N and the output is
<br />
line N+1. Indeed, I am tortured by the resemblance to quantum
<br />
states: we seem in our own comfy universe to have a succession
<br />
of states connected only by the Schrödinger equation.
<br />
<br />One interesting point about this two dimensional consciousness
<br />
is that it's not clear (to me) whether it needs to persist in
<br />
our time. That is, would it make any difference if we destroy
<br />
this large two dimensional map?  On the one hand, since it
<br />
seems to be independent of time, the answer would be &quot;no&quot;,
<br />
but on the other, what if Hal Finney and Wei and whoever, is
<br />
right about UDs and measure, and destruction of the 2-D layout
<br />
makes it &quot;harder to find&quot; when all the OMs are being counted
<br />
up by Heaven?  I don't know.
<br />
<br />But anyway, for me, the horrid reductio always kicks in at this
<br />
point: what should it matter if these 1-D lines composing the
<br />
layout are scattered in space? What does it matter if they're
<br />
chopped up?
<br />
<br />Is it really only the case that &quot;they're harder to find&quot;?  That
<br />
they're &quot;less manifest&quot; in Everything? It's too hard to believe.
<br />
<br />Do we not need a *continuous* parameter?  Are we not back with
<br />
Zeno wondering how the arrow can move if it's just in a
<br />
succession of instants?  It seems to me that Zeno would have
<br />
been right for any *finite* number of locations (or instants),
<br />
and there would have been no such thing as true motion.
