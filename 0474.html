<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It seems to me that we cannot derive only OUR physics from classical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computation theory because we can also derive other physics of other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes; we can derive only the part of our physics which says that our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe is regular, in the sense I explained in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://www.website2u.com/log/text/reflmph/english/regul.htm">http://www.website2u.com/log/text/reflmph/english/regul.htm</a> :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;The informations that we perceive are not random, they contain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;regularities.
</em><br />
<br />It is indeed consistent with comp. that the multi-verse-phenomenology 
<br />
extends itself in a multi-multi-verse-phenomenology, with a somewhat 
<br />
weaker &quot;accessibility&quot; relation among clusters of &quot;many-worlds&quot;.
<br />
Note that there is no universe at all, and that &quot;universes&quot;, with comp 
<br />
are only kind of projections made by collection of self-referentially 
<br />
correct machines sharing deep algorithmic information trough a common 
<br />
[defined by a quotient by some indistinguishibility equivalence relation, 
<br />
(itself linked to the comp substitution level)] computationnal history.
<br />
<br />Comp makes possible to derive the necessary part of (all) physics, which 
<br />
happen to include the many-world phenomenology, indeterminism... Unless 
<br />
the substitution level is very low, there is no hope to derive from comp 
<br />
something like the existence of the sun and the moon around the earth. In 
<br />
that sense we cannot derive OUR physical reality. 
<br />
Nevertheless, I tend to believe that it should be possible to derive also 
<br />
some qualitative aspects of classical mechanics under the form of some 
<br />
variationnal principles. 
<br />
<br />Your remark reminds me the following statement by Raymond Smullyan (at 
<br />
the page 47 of Forever Undecided):
<br />
<br />&quot;The physical sciences are interested in the state of affairs that holds 
<br />
for the ACTUAL world, whereas pure mathematics and logic study ALL 
<br />
possible state of affairs&quot;. [emphasis by Raymond].
<br />
<br />I am astonished to find such a statement in a book which bear on modal 
<br />
logic and self-reference because the very concept of &quot;ACTUAL&quot; can be 
<br />
considered as a typical (indexical) concept definissable with 
<br />
self-reference.
<br />
Indeed with comp any world and any time is considered as actual by the 
<br />
self-referential machines which belong to them. The non-triviality of the 
<br />
self-referential machines (as Smullyan illustrates so well) help to 
<br />
isolate the non-empty common part of all possible physics or &quot;actualness&quot;.
<br />
<br />BTW, another idea of you seems to be consistent, and perhaps necessary 
<br />
&nbsp;with comp (I need more thinking), is the fact that there could be an 
<br />
infinity of levels of physical-explanation.
<br />
This is provable (from Godel-Blum's speed-up phenomenon) if we take the 
<br />
(not really occamist ?) notion of &quot;more-efficacious theory&quot;, which is a 
<br />
theory with shorter proof for all theorems (except a finite number of 
<br />
exception).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This outside world is not directly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;accessible but only through this information exchange.
</em><br />
<br />Exactly, with or without the (new?) comp conception of &quot;outside world&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;- Consider a given program P.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- Chose randomly a program P' (for example generate a random string,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analyze
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it, if it is not a syntaxically correct program generate another one)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- Consider the probability f(P) that the output of P is included in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;output of P' (i.e. the proportion of programs P' in the Universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dovetailer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whose output contains the output of P).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- The conjecture says that f(P) is greater for small programs P than for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; big
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Small programs appear often as parts of other programs in the Universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dovetailer, so their output are often produced by other programs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But there could be big programs whose output appears often in the Universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dovetailer, for example a program with a big piece of code which is never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;called. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So instead of considering the size of P, we could consider size'(P) =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;smallest n such that n = size(P'') and P'' produces the same output as P.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The conjecture says that f(P) is greater for small size'(P) than for big
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;size'(P), i.e. the repartition of programs looks like :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Exercise :

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- Formulate precisely the conjecture;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- Prove it.
</em><br />
<br />That seems interesting. You should perhaps also take into account the 
<br />
fact that there are programs which will &quot;naturally&quot; dovetail on the real 
<br />
oracles. This entails kind of multiplicative noise. In our multi-verse 
<br />
that could be represented by (sort of bohmian) initial position of 
<br />
&quot;particles&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't believe in COMP because I don't believe that consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;supervenes on a finite program, because consciousness is the perception of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an outside by an inside, but this inside must also be perceived by an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of this inside, and so on ad infinitum,
</em><br />
<br />It is hard to attribute consciousness to a finite thing, but, at least 
<br />
for me, it is equally hard to attribute consciousness to infinite things.
<br />
Remember also that with comp consciousness is ultimately linked to 
<br />
infinite collection of computationnal (including counterfactuals) 
<br />
histories. This, in some (still vague) sense, makes a link between 
<br />
consciousness and infinities.
<br />
<br />(I add also that most infinite regression in computer science are handled 
<br />
with the first, or better the second, recursion theorem).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't believe in COMP because ...
</em><br />
<br />Remember I propose thought experiments showing intuitively that if comp 
<br />
is true then comp is, in a variety of sense, unbelievable. (And latter I 
<br />
propose a relation with godelian sentences).
<br />
<br />I don't know if COMP is true (of course). I don't even known if I hope or 
<br />
fear it to be true. However I aknowledge easily that I am quite 
<br />
fascinated by the ontological and epistemological consequences of it.
<br />
<br />Actually, the question is not &quot;is comp true ?&quot;. May be the real questions 
<br />
looks much more like &quot;would you accept your son to marry a 
<br />
computationnalist woman?... or your daughter a computationnalist man ?, 
<br />
or ...?
<br />
<br />The beauty of comp, at least according to my taste (for sure), is that it 
<br />
gives a complete justification why, if comp is true, it cannot be 
<br />
anything but a matter of personal opinion.
<br />
<br />Of course there is something diabolical here (to speak like Raymond 
<br />
Smullyan). For it shows comp having some self-fulfilling meaning for 
<br />
consistent reasonners.
<br />
<br />Am I a computationnalist ?  I prefer to remain silent (here).
<br />
<br />May be I have a common point with Jacques M. Mallah, I feel myself much 
<br />
more like an advocate ... of any (hopefully consistent) sets of possible 
<br />
computationnalist beliefs.
<br />
Perhaps a real modern computationnalist (or mechanist) hero is Thomas 
<br />
Donaldson, a US mathematician with a brain tumor who has been under trial 
<br />
for having ask physician to cryogenise his still-living brain.
