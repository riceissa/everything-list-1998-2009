<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To me, this dichotomy remains the biggest mystery in science and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophy. I have very reluctantly settled on the idea that there is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fundamental (=irreducible=axiomatic) difference here, which I know is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something of a copout. I really would like to have one &quot;scientific&quot; theory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that at least potentially explains &quot;everything&quot;. As it is, even finding a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;clear way of stating the dichotomy is proving elusive.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually that *difference* is not *really* fundamental. Although I could 
<br />
have taken it as axiom, it appears
<br />
that the mechanist hypothesis literally forces us to introduce that 
<br />
difference. It is hard to explain this without being a little bit 
<br />
technical. The main fact. is that, in the apparently crisp domain of formal 
<br />
provability by correct machine or correct theorem prover, once the machine 
<br />
are sufficiently powerful, we get this
<br />
<br />provable(p)    does not entail    provable(p) and true(p)
<br />
<br />This should be astonishing, because we have restricted ourself to correct 
<br />
machine, so obviously
<br />
<br />provable(p) entails the truth of p, and thus provable(p) entails 
<br />
&quot;provable(p) and p&quot;; so what ????
<br />
<br />What happens is incompleteness; although provable(p) entails true(p), the 
<br />
machine is unable to prove that.
<br />
That is the correct machine cannot prove its own correctness. By Tarski 
<br />
(or  Kaplan &amp;Montague 1961)
<br />
such correctness is not even expressible by the machine (unlike provability 
<br />
and consistency).
<br />
But, (and that's what the &quot;meta&quot; shift of level makes it possible); we can 
<br />
define, for each proposition p, a modal connective knowable(p) by 
<br />
&quot;provable(p) and p&quot;. Accepting the idea that the first person is the 
<br />
knower, this trick makes it necessary for any correct machine to have a 
<br />
different logic for something which is strictly equivalent for any 
<br />
omniscient outsider. In some sense this explains why there is necessarily a 
<br />
gap between (3-person) communicable proof and (1-person) non-communicable 
<br />
(as such) knowledge.
<br />
This is so important that not only the knower appears to be variant of the 
<br />
prover, but the observables, that is: physics, too.
<br />
But that could lead me too far now and I prefer to stop.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Some previous posts in the current thread have attacked this idea by, for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;example, explaining ethics in terms of evolutionary theory or game theory, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but this is like explaining a statement about the properties of sodium 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chloride in terms of the evolutionary or game theoretic advantages of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;study of chemistry. Yes, you can legitimately talk about ethics or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chemistry in these terms, but in so doing you are talking meta-ethics or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meta-chemistry, which I think is what Bruno means by &quot;level shift&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes, ok. And indeed evolutionnary theory and game theory and even logic are 
<br />
sometimes used to just put that difference under the rug making 
<br />
consciousness a sort of epiphenomenon, which it is not, for incompleteness 
<br />
is inescapable, and introspective machines can only build their realities 
<br />
from it. All this can be felt as highly counter-intuitive, but the logic of 
<br />
self-reference *is* counter-intuitive.
