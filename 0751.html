<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wonder if it's because of the fact that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm a newcomer to the group that you resent me.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No but I will admit one thing.  When you first showed up, I hoped
<br />
you might be a positive addition, a potential ally against this madness.
<br />
Naturally I was dissapointed when you started spouting that suicide crap
<br />
and it became clear that you were the most serious crackpot yet about it
<br />
and had no potential for meaningful discussions with me.  This
<br />
dissapointment probably affected my post.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You really did offend me in your original &quot;Craziness&quot; post.  Not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because you think the idea was crazy, but because of this statement:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Chris Maloney - the latest, and worst, addition to our little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    group.  It's not exactly a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mean - you didn't even direct it at me, but you were verbally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rolling your eyes about me to the rest of the group.  And this:
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually I did direct it at you.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    But then the human capacity for stupidity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    never ceases to amaze me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I, for one, feel amazed that you continue to insult me after my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; repeated attempts to communicate respectfully.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's no insult.  It's true and therefore not slander.  I do not
<br />
insult people or say things just to upset them unless I am provoked.
<br />
Neither do I coddle people or pretend to respect them when I do not.  If a
<br />
toddler makes a scribble I say 'very nice', but I expect an adult to take
<br />
my real opinion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You've betrayed yourself in significant ways in this last post.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First of all, you said that you didn't respond to my two technical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; posts because they said nothing new, yet you did respond to Hal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who wrote basically the same things I had been writing.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had also not wanted to get into it since I have a lot to do, but
<br />
once I was responding anyway it made sense to throw in some technical
<br />
stuff which would serve as a response to both of you at once.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Don't you think that maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you could be wrong?  I was trying to make the point that, let's say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from a &quot;bird perspective&quot;, if you saw two intelligent people bashing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it out about an issue, and disagreeing at a fundamental level, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one of them must be wrong.  But *both* have similar feelings that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the other is being just plain stupid, and not thinking clearly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That person in the bird perspective would have no a priori reason
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to think that one or the other is wrong, and is stupid.  If you'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grant that I have similar feelings about your position on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issue (I do), *how* can you be so certain that it's you and not me 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that's right?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same way I know anything, from the specifics of the case.  If
<br />
I had no other information besides the fact that I disagree with someone,
<br />
then I would agree that I could be wrong.  But then, with no other info,
<br />
no disagreement would be possible since I wouldn't know the question.  But
<br />
I do have other info and am certain of the answer.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I really can't believe that you didn't respond to this part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of my post, or didn't get it at all:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    If we disagree, it must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    because either we're starting from different premises, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    one of our logical reasoning is flawed, or perhaps one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    us is biased in our thinking in a way that we are unaware of.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting from premises which are not fully understood is much like
<br />
bias, but full understanding of the premises often only comes once we know
<br />
how they play out.  And flawed logic is hard to seperate from different
<br />
premises in many cases except in the most clear cut case of an algebraic
<br />
mixup or the like.  I think your reasoning is flawed - you use measure
<br />
one way to get quantum probabilities, but reject it in other contexts - 
<br />
but it's hard to prove to you that it's not just different premises.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if someone insists on holding to a position he can always make
<br />
it a postulate and say 'postulates just come down to intuition and so mine
<br />
are as good as yours'.  In other words, religion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Poor you!  You must be awfully altruistic, to bear the burden of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talking all of us poor, deluded souls out of our madness.  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to me strange that you care so much -- judging from your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other personality traits, I'd expect you to chuckle if any of us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually went through with it.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidently your model of me does not successfully predict the
<br />
'strange' behavior.  I suggest you revise it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my altruism does have limits and as I said I will probably
<br />
leave the group soon.  Believe it or not I do not enjoy discussing ideas
<br />
that I hate and would rather talk about something interesting.  QS is
<br />
important but no more technically interesting to me than an extended
<br />
discussion of the proposition that 1+1=3.  (But then 0 would equal to 1, I
<br />
say; it must be wrong.  No, they say, there is only one zero therefore
<br />
0=1.  Etc. ad nauseum.)
