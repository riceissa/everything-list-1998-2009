</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm just trying to wax philosophical here, but do you think that our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; goal should actually be to utter that 'something'?  Do you think we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could?  Would we be able to understand it if we uttered it?  Or is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this simply the realm of faith?  As in Bruno's definition of reality,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's the un-totally-explainable reason why we keep doing science?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
*(a) Appearance Aspect*
<br />
We utter all existing &quot;laws of appearances&quot; as 'laws of nature' knowing 
<br />
they are not actually proven. An alien with a totally different 
<br />
P-consciousness would have a completely different collection of &quot;laws of 
<br />
appearances&quot; which would be equally predictive (human and Alien agree on 
<br />
predictions, not laws of nature).
<br />
<br />*(b) Structure Aspect*
<br />
OTOH, if we also allow ourselves to hypothesise 'structural primitives 
<br />
and their appropriate rule sets of interaction such that (a) an observer 
<br />
emerged and became a scientist with a P-consciousness and that 
<br />
simultaneously was consistent with (b) all the &quot;laws of appearances&quot;. 
<br />
The 'structural primitives' and rules are no better known than. Human 
<br />
and Alien 'laws of structure' must converge, for both human and alien 
<br />
are made of it. You'd have to translate them into each other's syntax, 
<br />
but once translated they must be identical.
<br />
<br />*-------------------------*
<br />
(a) is NOT reality, but about it.
<br />
(b) is NOT reality, but about it.
<br />
In both cases we have ambiguity and lack of certainty (in the sense of 
<br />
ultimate truth).
<br />
<br />So.... in what sense can anyone claim that in (a) we have accessed 
<br />
anything proven, ultimate or unique? They are all interim hypotheses of 
<br />
status &quot;thus far not wrong&quot; and predictive.
<br />
<br />Likewise in (b).
<br />
<br />So yes.... we can most certainly 'utter that something'....we have no 
<br />
lesser grounds than we have to 'utter the existing appearances'. What we 
<br />
don't have any sane right to continue to do is install arbitrary beliefs 
<br />
based on maths rapture that &lt;X&gt; (a) and (b) are identical or &lt;Y&gt; to 
<br />
install metabelief in (a) that enshrines (a) by assuming a structural 
<br />
role to certain (a) maths ....... where both &lt;X&gt; and &lt;Y&gt; have failed 
<br />
chronically for 2000 years to predict P-consciousness, which must 
<br />
clearly be the responsibility of (b), the noumenon.... for (a) science 
<br />
presupposes P-consciousness and scientists.
<br />
<br />*So yeah!..... Let there be LOTS of such utterances and no more 
<br />
religious metabelief about (a)!*
<br />
<br />This result has come from years of forensic metascience on my part.  
<br />
Here's an extract from the 'Dual Aspect Science' paper:
<br />
<br />&quot;A final contextual note. The idea of non-uniqueness of the knowledge 
<br />
bases (T and T') of human science is quite resonant with other shifts in 
<br />
perspective in the past. Human science must be a little sobered under 
<br />
the dual aspect framework because the laws originally constructed under 
<br />
a single aspect framework are recognised as non-unique and human-centric 
<br />
under a dual aspect framework. In going to dual aspect, human 'laws of 
<br />
nature' are displaced from the 'centre of knowledge' in the same way 
<br />
that the earth was displaced from the centre of the universe in the 
<br />
science of days gone by. On reflection it is impossible not to notice 
<br />
that if the transformation to dual aspect science is to have its 
<br />
objectors, those objectors can be seen to have the role of the church in 
<br />
the original scientific upheavals. The notional '/church of metabeliefs 
<br />
Figure 2(a) and 2(b)/' will provide us much food for thought!&quot;
<br />
<br />/Figure 2(a) and 2(b) is a diagram pointing at metabeliefs /&lt;X&gt;  and &lt;Y&gt; 
<br />
above.
<br />
T is the (a) aspect 'laws' and T' is the (b) aspect 'laws'.
<br />
<br />*Here's my abstract from the same paper:*
<br />
<br />&quot;Our chronically impoverished explanatory capacity in respect of 
<br />
P-consciousness is used as a vehicle for exploration of the idea that 
<br />
the problem may be a problem with science itself, rather than its lack 
<br />
of acquisition of some particular knowledge. The hidden assumption built 
<br />
into science is that science itself is a completed human behaviour. 
<br />
Removal of this assumption is achieved through a simple revision to our 
<br />
science model which is constructed, outlined and named 'dual aspect 
<br />
science'. It is constructed with reference to existing science being 
<br />
'single aspect science'. The new model is consistent with and predictive 
<br />
of the very explanatory poverty that generated it and is simultaneously 
<br />
a seamless upgrade in that no existing law of nature has to be altered 
<br />
in any way. *The framework is completely empirically self-consistent and 
<br />
serves to eliminate the behavioural inconsistencies that currently 
<br />
inhabit a world in which single aspect science has been inherited rather 
<br />
than chosen and in which its presuppositions are implemented through 
<br />
habit rather than by scientific examination of options by the scientists 
<br />
actually carrying out science.* The overall implication is that a 
<br />
discovery is made that has the potential to explain P-consciousness. 
<br />
However the discovery is about ourselves as scientists. We have to fully 
<br />
discover how to do science.&quot;
<br />
----------------------------------
<br />
<br />I expect the &quot;church of mathematics rapture&quot; (that we have had since QM 
<br />
was concocted) will reject the paper as some kind of heresy in due 
<br />
course. I'll let you know.
<br />
<br />Geeze, when I started my artificial general intelligence project I'd 
<br />
never have predicted in a million years that I'd have to change the 
<br />
whole of science to get my hardware design validated. I have to have a 
<br />
viable basis to claim a (new type of) chip is having experiences... that 
<br />
basis is dual aspect science. I have my own set T' (have called it 
<br />
'entropy calculus' here before).
<br />
<br />BTW the framework predicts there are actually 2 complete &quot;theories of 
<br />
everything&quot;, T-TOE and T'-TOE. The T-TOE is only about appearances and 
<br />
is pretty much useless because it says nothing about P-consciousness (or 
<br />
scientists). The T'-TOE is literally the complete set T' and predicts 
<br />
P-consciousness consistent with the T-TOE.
<br />
<br />The conflict between these two styles of TOE is already visible. Nobody 
<br />
gets that they are not competing. They are complementary. people who 
<br />
worked on strings, branes, loops, noise, froth etc are doing T' science. 
<br />
They just keep failing to make neuroscience predictions and fall into 
<br />
the trap of competing with T' predictions.... The clarity of the dual 
<br />
aspect framework is remarkable.
<br />
<br />enuff already. Done it all to death.
<br />
<br />Here in my rowboat my Galileo complex is coming along nicely :-P
