Hi,
<br />
<br />Doesn't this part:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a materialistic framework, ' I ' am a bunch of atoms. These atoms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen to constitute a system that has self-referential qualities that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we call consciousness. If it happened that these atoms temporarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (like in a coma or anesthesy) or permanently (death) lose this quality,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so will ' I '.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Contradict this part:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is not useful to talk about 1st person experiences in 3rd person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms, since when we do that we lose the very thing that we want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to study.
</em><br />
<br />Since surely one can describe &quot;a bunch of atoms with self-referential 
<br />
qualities&quot; in wholly objective, i.e. 1st person, terms?   But I'm 
<br />
getting ahead of myself here..  I think we actually agree on 99% of 
<br />
this issue.  I think the only place we disagree is on some very subtle 
<br />
issues regarding how one can refer to &quot;I&quot;.  Let me then explicitly 
<br />
state that I am a materialist and a functionalist with regard to 
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me stress this point: *I am, for all practical purposes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; one and only one specific configuration of atoms in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; specific universe. I could never say that ' I ' is ALL the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; copies, since I NEVER experience what the other copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Here I think you're making an assumption. You are certainly not ALL 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; copies, but then it doesn't follow that you are only 1.  &quot;You&quot; could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a fuzzy set of copies that have experiences so similar that they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be told apart.  That is, they cannot be told apart &gt;yet&lt;.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Unnoticeable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; differences eventually can percolate up and make a noticeable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; difference, or they can be made noticeable by making more sensitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; observations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I am making an assumption, and working through it. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption is that there is nothing external to the physical body to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; account for consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />I totally agree with &gt;this&lt; assumption.  It's the &quot;one and only one&quot; 
<br />
part that I disagree with, to this extent:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may, if you wish, decide to refer to one and only one universe and 
<br />
to the Eric within that universe.  That is, you can stipulate that the 
<br />
Eric you are referring to is a completely specified entity.  But to do 
<br />
so meaningfully, you would need to take some sort of god-like view of 
<br />
the plenitude, and *actually specify* the Eric you're talking about.  
<br />
Otherwise how do you know what you are referring to?  Just saying &quot;I&quot; 
<br />
or &quot;one and only one&quot; does not do the job.  (Like Wittgenstein's man 
<br />
who says &quot;I know how tall I am!&quot; and proves it by putting his hand on 
<br />
top of his head.)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say that you were able to completely specify one Eric, by giving 
<br />
a (possibly infinitely) long description.  Let's call the entity you 
<br />
have thus specified &quot;Eric01&quot;.  Our point of difference seems to be 
<br />
this:  You believe that when Eric01 says &quot;I&quot;, he is referring precisely 
<br />
to Eric01.  I believe that when Eric01 says &quot;I&quot;, he is referring to the 
<br />
entire ensemble of Erics who are identical to Eric01 in all the ways 
<br />
Eric01 is capable of detecting.  Because each member of this ensemble 
<br />
is also saying &quot;I&quot;, and meaning the same thing by it.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you would say that since each completely specified Eric is in fact 
<br />
different, each one has a different consciousness.  Here is where our 
<br />
disagreement about _reference_ is relevant to QTI.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I definitely agree with you that if you mean to completely specify one 
<br />
Eric when you say &quot;I&quot;, then it is almost certain that that Eric will 
<br />
die in one of these dangerous situations.  But let's now specify TWO 
<br />
Erics:  Eric01 and Eric02.  They are indistinguishable from each other, 
<br />
and indeed their universes are identical, save for a tiny fluctuation 
<br />
which will miraculously save Eric02's life tomorrow, but doom Eric01.  
<br />
If Eric01 and Eric02 mean the same thing when they refer to &quot;I&quot; the 
<br />
instant before the death-event, then that &quot;I&quot; is going to survive, even 
<br />
though Eric01 does not.  If they refer to different things, then there 
<br />
is no question of &quot;I&quot; surviving; it is simply the case that Eric01 dies 
<br />
and Eric02 lives.  Let me stress that I do not think anything like 
<br />
&quot;Eric01 and Eric02 'share' a 'consciousness' that reaches between their 
<br />
universes&quot;.  It's simply that if there is no way for Eric01 to know 
<br />
that he is Eric01 rather than Eric02, then there is no difference 
<br />
between them with respect to their consciousness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A particular atom interacts with the atoms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or other particles in its universe only (interference is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interaction).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore a set of atoms do the same. All experience comes from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interactons that take place in a particular universe. There are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a set of universes so similar that cannot be told apart. But after any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; event (like a particle's interaction with another, or someone's death 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a larger scale) these universes have decohered enough so that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot equalize them anymore.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, they have decohered with respect to some events.  But if this &quot;no 
<br />
cul-de-sac conjecture&quot; holds, then there must be some events that still 
<br />
can happen, with respect to which some set of universes has not yet 
<br />
decohered, that would lead at least one member of an &quot;I&quot;-continuum away 
<br />
from the danger.  I am not sure I understand why some say it must hold, 
<br />
but I'm going through the archives..
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that when people respond to this question they forget the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption that I am making and argue assuming other philosophical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; framework.
</em><br />
I hope I've clarified the issue on this regard.. with the assumption 
<br />
you made, you are right, that almost all the completely specified 
<br />
entities die.  But I think for this assumption to be meaningful you 
<br />
must actually be capable of making those specifications.
<br />
<br />Sorry to complicate things by introducing Eric01 and 02, etc.. these 
<br />
posts have a way of becoming long and unreadable, and I can't follow 
<br />
all the messages in this whole thread.  But thanks for having a good 
<br />
discussion.
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
Pete
