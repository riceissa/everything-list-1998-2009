<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which can be broken down into the relationships between a lot of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sub-patterns, each of which is an observer-moment. The idea that physics

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should ultimately be explainable in terms of nothing more than causal

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationships between events, and that higher-order concepts like

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;particles&quot; and &quot;spacetime&quot; would emerge from this level of explanation, is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an idea that some approaches to quantum gravity seem to favor, like loop

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum gravity--it's at least not out of the question that a final

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;physical&quot; ToE would be about nothing more than causal relationships between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events. If so, it would just be a different &quot;interpretation&quot; of this theory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to say that each sub-network in this universal causal network would be an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moment of some kind, and my &quot;meta-physical&quot; speculation would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you could *start* by looking at all possible finite causal networks and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finding a unique measure on them, and the appearance of the huge causal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; network we call the &quot;physical universe&quot; could be derived from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationships between all the sub-patterns implied by this unique measure. 
</em><br />
<br />This is a very interesting speculation which raises some random questions
<br />
and comments:
<br />
<br />1. One problem I have is with the notion of causality.  Do you view this as
<br />
something that is well defined, the degree and/or kind of causality that
<br />
one node in a causal network applies to another?  Would it be merely a
<br />
boolean (node A either does or does not have a causal influence on node
<br />
B) or would it be more complex (node A promotes B while inhibiting C)?
<br />
I realize that these are detailed questions to be asked of an embryonic
<br />
theory but it would help to understand what your notion of causality is.
<br />
<br />One of my concerns is that some universes may not have causality as well
<br />
defined as ours does, and I wonder how well your theory would work there.
<br />
In fact, even in our universe one can certainly imagine situations and
<br />
relationships between events where the existence or degree of causality
<br />
is not at all well defined.  I'm worried about basing a model for
<br />
consciousness on something as abstract and ill defined as causality.
<br />
Are we replacing one mystery with another?
<br />
<br />2. If we think of the &quot;causal pattern&quot; which corresponds to a conventional
<br />
observer-moment, say your experience of eating a particular bite of cherry
<br />
pie, would you imagine that this is something which could in principle
<br />
be diagrammed, and/or represented in some kind of canonical form?
<br />
So we could point to this picture and say, this *is* that particular
<br />
experience of eating that byte of cherry pie.  That would be pretty
<br />
cool, and I do think that ultimately any theory of consciousness is
<br />
going to have to be able to do something like this.
<br />
<br />3. Presumably the actual causal patterns of our conscious moments are
<br />
very large.  We have trillions of neurons each with tens of thousands
<br />
of synapses, firing at hundreds or thousands of times per second.
<br />
That's a lot of activity, all of it intricately linked into what might
<br />
well be called a causal network, although the &quot;causality&quot; involved is
<br />
quite complex and involves integration over time.  But assuming that we
<br />
could in fact imagine representing that in canonical form, clearly the
<br />
representation would be very large.
<br />
<br />We could imagine successively simpler &quot;causal patterns&quot; until we got
<br />
down to quite trivial ones.  Calling them &quot;observer moments&quot; seems to
<br />
be a bit of a stretch, given the enormous number of orders of magnitude
<br />
difference between what we would normally recognize as a conscious OM and
<br />
one of these trivial ones.  But on the other hand I agree that we could
<br />
probably not draw a line in this succession of causal patterns and say
<br />
this half are conscious, this half are unconscious.  Presumably we are
<br />
talking about shades of gray here, degrees of consciousness.  It never
<br />
completely goes away, although it certainly gets close enough to zero
<br />
for all practical purposes.
<br />
<br />4. Another point is that for a &quot;causal pattern&quot; to actually be
<br />
recognizably conscious requires more than complexity.  One can imagine
<br />
any number of causal networks of perhaps tremendous complexity that would
<br />
not seem particularly likely to correspond to what we would recognize
<br />
as conscious experience.  (In terms of the &quot;shades of gray&quot; analogy,
<br />
even though the networks are at least slightly conscious by definition,
<br />
there would still be virtually no &quot;gray&quot; there.)
<br />
<br />5. To me, this points to the problem with panpsychism theories like this.
<br />
On the one hand, everything is conscious (at least a little bit).
<br />
This saves us from the Sorites paradox, that it's impossible to draw a
<br />
line among shades of gray and try to separate white from black.  But on
<br />
the other hand, in practice only brains are noticeably conscious (and
<br />
probably only big brains; the nematode with its 302 neurons can't have
<br />
much consciousness).  Even though our stomachs and earlobes are causal
<br />
networks and have their little slivers of consciousness, only our brains
<br />
manage to really count.  It just seems strange that if consciousness is,
<br />
in the metaphysical sense, so easy that it's omnipresent, then why do
<br />
so few systems actually exhibit it?
