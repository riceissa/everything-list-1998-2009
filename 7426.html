<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I think that if it is given that either you or your duplicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;must die, then you should willingly sacrifice yourself if it will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;enrich your duplicate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Either way, I think you wake up the next morning very satisfied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;with the outcome.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How do you wake up the next morning if you're the one who died? Unless you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can effect some sort of mind merge just before dying, you lose all the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences that you have had since you and your duplicate diverged...
</em><br />
<br />Well, Stathis, for heaven's sake!  You've already admitted that a
<br />
little memory loss does not threaten your identity!  Recall the Aussies
<br />
you wrote about who customarily lose an entire evening's inebriation :-)
<br />
<br />So remember: your duplicate in the next room is *exactly* in the
<br />
same state you are in right now if you lose a little recent memory,
<br />
and then have some new experiences that are identical to his over
<br />
the last few minutes. So he *is* you!  That's what I mean when I
<br />
say that we must regard duplicates as selves.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still don't really understand why you are so insistent that your duplicate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is you and should be considered on a par with yourself when it comes to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deciding what is in your self-interest. You have arrived at this conclusion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the fact that you and he were physically and mentally identical at the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment of duplication, and will remain more similar than a pair of identical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; twins despite diverging post-duplication. However, I don't see why it is any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less valid or less rational if I say that I find the idea of having a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplicate around disturbing, and would prefer not to be duplicated, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; especially if there is a chance the two of us might meet.
</em><br />
<br />I've always considered it interesting psychologically how people
<br />
would react to their duplicates. It happens that so far as I know,
<br />
my duplicate and I would get along splendidly. (Of course, with
<br />
our luck, we would discover a completely intolerable mannerism
<br />
that we each have  :-(
<br />
<br />But whatever.  G. H. Hardy could not stand the sight of himself
<br />
in the mirror, and the first thing he'd do when arriving at a hotel
<br />
is put towels over any of the mirrors. I've even noted a recent 
<br />
tendency for me to avoid eye contact in a mirror!  But seriously,
<br />
these idiosyncrasies aren't important in the high-stakes games,
<br />
e.g., will you die now so that your duplicate in the next room
<br />
gets $10,000,000, (given that one of you must die).
<br />
<br />And let's go back to this crazy &quot;transfer&quot; that seems (from my
<br />
viewpoint) to occupy the attention of those who believe in
<br />
&quot;continuers&quot;.  So you expect to be the person who arrives at
<br />
the other end if you are disintegrated here and teleported
<br />
there. You even expect to be him if the original here is 
<br />
not disintegrated.  (Here I must lash out at the bizarre
<br />
probability calculus that ensues for many at this point:
<br />
whether or not they *are* the remote version seems to depend
<br />
on what happens locally here. Sheese.)
<br />
<br />So if all the 1000 Stathis's in the various rooms are to die
<br />
but one, then that one &quot;continues&quot; all the others. Now we
<br />
play a trick. The 1000 don't actually die but are placed in
<br />
instantaneous suspended animation.
<br />
<br />Oops!  The big Bean-Counter Upstairs who keeps track of where
<br />
the serial numbers go is confused!  He had better have all
<br />
1000 Stathis's continue in the one, just in case something
<br />
goes wrong with the suspended animation machinery.  But then...
<br />
what to do when nothing goes wrong?  How to send all the souls
<br />
back into the original bodies???  (Of course, here in this paragraph
<br />
I am just attempting to ridicule a point of view in which I do not
<br />
believe. The truth is, of course, is that no &quot;transfers&quot; take place,
<br />
and the whole idea of a &quot;continuer&quot; is wrong.)
<br />
<br />If you believe that the 1000 will continue in the one (what, I
<br />
wonder, with probability 1000?), then they'll &quot;continue&quot; in the
<br />
one whether or not they're disintegrated. 
<br />
<br />And what about this, as a further attack on the probability idea:
<br />
We start with 1000 Stathis's in 1000 hotel rooms, all happily
<br />
looking forward to the afternoon. Then during 1 millisecond all
<br />
but one are killed off, and in the next millisecond the random
<br />
one who survived is copied into the remaining 999 hotel rooms.
<br />
I suppose---if you believe in that silly probability thing---
<br />
that you figure your odds (as a particular person, say in room
<br />
506) as being 1 in 1000.
<br />
<br />:-)  Then let whole scenario repeat every 50th of a second, 
<br />
and pretty soon your odds of surviving are less than one in
<br />
a billion???
<br />
<br />No:  we have to accept the simple solution I suggest: you are
<br />
your duplicates, near and far, future and past, whether or not
<br />
your instance is collecting memories of their own particular
<br />
locales. A few minutes', or even a few months', worth of
<br />
memories doesn't really matter much so far as SURVIVAL is
<br />
concerned. This is simple, and it seems to me, obviously true.
<br />
