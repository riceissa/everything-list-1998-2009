<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'd like to revive an old thread, that has been bothering me a lot 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lately.  I hope you'll all agree that it's a fascinating puzzle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wei Dai posed this way back, in February of last year:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/index.html?mID=38">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/index.html?mID=38</a>.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've read the entire thread, and I don't think the question was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ever resolved.  Wei, Nick Bostrom, and Hal Finney were the main
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contributors.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But there's an alternative way of computing this probability.  She
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believes that at time t1, the odds are 1/2 that she'll have seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heads.  She also knows that if, at time t1, she saw heads, then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; odds will be 1 that at all later times, she'll continue to remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seeing heads.  Likewise, if she saw tails at time t1, she'll 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continue to remember seeing tails.  So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     P(H,t3) = P(H,t1) = 1/2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So which is correct?  I know which solution I prefer, but I'd like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to get some feedback first.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think the reasoning for this example is very solid.  You have
<br />
to introduce this notion of &quot;the probability that I will remember X at
<br />
time B, given that I remember it at earlier time A.&quot;  Then you have to
<br />
assume that it is 1.
<br />
<br />But there is no sound basis for this assumption or this methodology.
<br />
It is based on our common experience, but we have no experience with
<br />
copy machines of this type.  I think we have to use mathematics rather
<br />
than experience to guide us in new situations.  So this reasoning does
<br />
not seem convincing to me.
<br />
<br />One thing you did not say was why the other answer, P(H,t3) = 2/3, was
<br />
problematical.  I believe it had to do with decision theory.  In classical
<br />
decision theory, a choice is evaluated by taking all possible outcomes,
<br />
multiplying the possible outcome times the utility of that outcome, and
<br />
summing the results.  You then make the choice which maximizes this sum.
<br />
<br />An example where this might seem to be a problem is the following.
<br />
You are offered a bet where you will pay $15 if the coin is tails, but
<br />
win $10 if it is heads.  If P(H) is 2/3, you might want to take the bet.
<br />
<br />The resolution is to look at when the payment is made.  If it is after
<br />
you are duplicated, and each instance of your duplicates receives the
<br />
$10, then it is a good bet.  If the payment is made before duplication
<br />
(but after the coin flip) then your head-observing duplicates don't
<br />
actually end up with $10 each, but rather $5.  The duplicating machine
<br />
does not duplicate money, or any of your material possessions.  In fact,
<br />
being duplicated in effect cuts your material possessions in half.
<br />
So the real choice is between $5 with probability 2/3 and -$15 with
<br />
probability 1/3, not a good bet.
<br />
<br />An interesting variant though is to introduce nonmaterial rewards.
<br />
They used to have kissing booths at the fair.  For a few dollars you
<br />
would get to kiss a beautiful girl.  Suppose that is worth $10 to you.
<br />
Now the bet is offered; you pay $15 on tails but get a kiss on heads.
<br />
The payment will be made before duplication.
<br />
<br />In this case I would say that it is a good bet.  The memory of the kiss
<br />
gets duplicated with you, and each of your duplicates ends up with a
<br />
memory that is worth $10.  So in this case you have P=2/3 of gaining
<br />
something worth $10 and P=1/3 of losing something worth $15, making
<br />
it favorable.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that one need not bring MWI into this at all.  The only big
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption is the existence of a copy machine.  Instead of MWI, one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can think of the identical experiment being carried out on an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ensemble of, say, 100 hapless souls Albert, Bernard, Caroline, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At time t1, some number close to 50 will have seen heads.  At time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; t2, there will be 150 people, 100 of whom remember seeing heads,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and 50 of whom remember seeing tails.  From a bird perspective,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you picked any person at random from this group, the chance that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they'll have seen heads is 2/3.
</em><br />
<br />One difference though is that the MWI duplicates all of your material
<br />
possessions, unlike the copy machine.  That changes the answer I would
<br />
give, as in the kissing example above.  So it is not clear to me that
<br />
copying presents issues involving subjective probabilities in the same
<br />
way that an MWI model does.
<br />
