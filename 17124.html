<br />
David,
<br />
I thought you are facing the Scottish mountains for a relaxation and instead
<br />
here is a long - enjoyable- tirade about ideas which I try to put below into
<br />
a shorthand form by *my* vocabulary. But first a plea to Mrs. N:
<br />
*'please, do keep David away from te computer for the time of the Scottish
<br />
tourism, as he suggested it, to get him a good  mountaineering **relaxation
<br />
what we all would luv if we just can afford it....'*
<br />
and now back to David:
<br />
<br />&quot;causal accounts&quot; are model-based originating choices in a view reduced into
<br />
the figment of a 'physical world' i.e. in a conventional science lingo, so
<br />
ingeniously formed over the millennia. It is our *perceived reality*, with
<br />
math, based on the most pervasive (dominating?) principle, called physics,
<br />
all *- in* *the ongoing &quot;HUMAN&quot; ways of our thinking.*
<br />
<br />Everything exists what we 'think of' in our MIND (nonexistent? *no way*, we
<br />
think of that, too). There is nosuch thing as a  '3rd pers.explanation, it
<br />
is a 1st pers. idea, interpreted by all the   &quot;3rd persons&quot; into their own
<br />
(1st pers) &quot;mindset&quot;(?).
<br />
<br />Ontology is today's explanation of today's epistemic inventory.
<br />
A nice, reductionist philosophy. Not applicable for tomorrow's discoveries.
<br />
A *'physical realist'* is a conventional scientist within the given
<br />
figments. This list tries to overstep such 'human' limitations - falling
<br />
repeatedly back into the faithful application of it.
<br />
<br />As Brent asked: &quot;Is the physics account of life incomplete or wrong?  Do you
<br />
consider &quot;life&quot; to have been eliminated?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;eliminated&quot; WHAT? I spent some braingrease to find out what many (some?) of
<br />
us agree upon as 'life' - no success. YET it does exist even in Brent's mind
<br />
(who is a very advanced thinking list-member). (Robert Rosen identified life
<br />
as his *'M&amp;R'*  (Metabolism and Repair) based on his (mathematical) biology
<br />
ways. I may extend the domain into 'ideation' and 'not-so-bio' domains, even
<br />
into the stupidly named &quot;in-animates&quot;).
<br />
<br />Our millennia-evolved human (reductionistic - conventional) views are based
<br />
on timely evolving observational skills what we call &quot;physical&quot; - worldview,
<br />
science, explanatory base etc. So no wonder if everything is touching it. It
<br />
is not 'more real' than anything we could sweat out for explaining the
<br />
unexplainable.
<br />
It all undergoes (ontological etc.) changes as epistemy grows.
<br />
I don't want to touch here the chicken-egg topic of &quot;numbers&quot;, yet this,
<br />
too, is a HUMAN dilemma between Bruno and friends vs. David Bohm. And we are
<br />
figments within the totality, not the original creators. We don't 'see' too
<br />
far.
<br />
Somebody asked me: &quot;How do we learn something that is aboslutely 'N E W' ? I
<br />
had no answer. I tried: by playing with unrelated relationships - which is
<br />
only manipulting the existent.
<br />
Even Star Trek relied on modified knowables as novelty, the absolute new is
<br />
not available to us - unless already having been hinted in some corner of
<br />
the totality as a 'findable' relation. The quality from quantity Leninian
<br />
principle may give a clue to it, if a large enough background can be checked
<br />
(cf. Bruno's words to get to anything by using enough many numbers for it).
<br />
Still such cop-outs include my usual retort: applying the &quot;somehow&quot;
<br />
<br />Finally: COMP and reality? not this embryonic binary algorithm based
<br />
(physical) contraption, not even an advanced fantasy kind of similar
<br />
deficiencies can approach what we cannot: the unfathomable 'reality' of them
<br />
all. It is not a 'higher inventory', it (if there is such an 'it' - I did
<br />
not say: exists) is beyond anything we can imagine humanly. We can speculate
<br />
about reality's 'human' type aspects of partial hints we can humanly
<br />
approach and make a pars pro toto dream of it - we are wrong for sure.
<br />
<br />Have a healthy mountain-climb in Scottland
<br />
<br />John M

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I note that the recent posts by Peter Jones - aka the mysterious 1Z,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the originator of the curiously useful 'real in the sense I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real' or RITSIAR - occurred shortly after my taking his name in vain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmm.......
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, this signalled the resumption of a long-running debate about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the validity of causal accounts of the first person based on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functional or computational rationale.  I'm going to make an attempt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to annihilate this intuition in this thread, and hope to encourage
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feedback specifically on this issue.  You will recall that this is at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the heart of Bruno's requirement to base COMP - i.e. the explicitly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational account of mind - on the the number realm, with physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derived as an emergent from this.  Step 08 of the UDA addresses these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issues in a very particular way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I've always felt that there's a more intuitively obvious and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just as devastating blow that can be dealt to functional or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational notions based on physical entities and relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceived as ontologically foundational and singular (i.e. no dualism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; please).  So as not to be misunderstood (too quickly!) let me make it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clear at the outset that I'm addressing this to first person conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience, not to third person descriptions of 'mentality' - so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eliminativists can stop reading at this point as there is nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; further that requires explanation in their view (as odd as I trust
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this sounds to you non-eliminativists out there).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The argument runs as follows.  To take what physics describes with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maximal seriousness - as standing for ontological reality - is just to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take its entities and causal relationships seriously to the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extent.  God knows, physicists have gone to enough trouble to define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these entities and relationships with the most precisely articulated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of nomological-causal principles we possess.  Consequently, taking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these with maximal seriousness entails abjuring other causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principles as independently efficacious: i.e. showing how - or at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least being committed to the belief that - all higher order causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principles somehow supervene on these fundamentals.  Any other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; position would be either obscurantist or incoherent for a physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I should say at this point that I'm not criticising this position,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm merely articulating it.  It follows from the foregoing that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; although we may speak in chemical, biological, physiological or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; historical narratives, we believe that in principle at least these are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reducible to their physical bases.  We also know that although we may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speak of cabbages and kings, weather, oceans, processes, computations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and untold myriads of equally 'emergent' phenomena, we still must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; retain our commitment to their reducibility to their physical bases.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So of course, we can - and do - legitimately speak, in this way, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical computers as 'performing computations', but following the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foregoing principle we can see that actually this is just a convenient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shorthand for what is occurring in the physical substrates upon which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the notion of computation must - and of course does - rely for its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realisation in the world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be more explicit: The notion of a 'program' or 'computation' - when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we place it under analysis -  is a convenient shorthand for an ordered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of first person concepts which finds its way into the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; account in the form of various matter-energy dispositions.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; macroscopic media for these are variously paper and ink, actions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer keyboards, patterns of voltages in computer circuitry,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; illumination of pixels on screens, etc.  All of these, of course, can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - and must - reduce to fundamental relations amongst physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'ultimates'.  At some point after entering the physical causal nexus,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this chain of dispositions may re-enter the first person account
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (don't ask me how - it's inessential to the argument) at which point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they may again be construed *by someone* in computational terms in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first person context.  But at no point is the 'computation' - qua
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept - in any way material (pun intended) to the physical account;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a fortiori, in no way can it - or need it - be ascribed causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significance in terms of the physical account.  After all, what could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this possibly mean?  Are these spooky 'computational' relationships
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'reaching across' the energy-transfers of the computer circuitry and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changing their outcomes? Of course not.  How could they?  And why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would they need to?  Everything's going along just fine by itself by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purely physical means.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope the foregoing makes it clear that computer programs and their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations - at the point of physical instantiation - literally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't exist in the world.  They're semantic formulations - ways of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speaking - that have applicability only in the first-person context,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and we can see that this is true any time we like by performing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of 'eliminativist' demonstration performed above: i.e. we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eliminate the concept without affecting the action on the ground one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whit.  Of course, this is the insight that makes the strictly physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; account of mind - as presently understood - problematic if one wishes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to take the first person seriously, because it shows the notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'emergence' to be redundant at the level of causation. It's just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another way of speaking, however much insight it carries - for us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, it isn't my wish to make that point again here.  Rather my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intention has been to show that whatever options are left in strict
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physicalism to address the first person issues seriously - without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eliminating them - emergence is emphatically not one of them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope this makes the argument clear, and also illustrates the point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Bruno's reversal of numbers and physics to save the computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; account of mind (and body, as it happens).  To be absolutely explicit:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if functional-computational relations are to be taken to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamentally causally efficacious, they must be held to be real and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foundational in exactly the sense (RITSIAR) ascribed to those in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical account.  But for that to be the case, all other causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relations must supervene on them - again just as in the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; account.  But now, of course, this must include physics itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, you don't of course have to accept COMP.  But if you want to be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical realist, it means you can only hang on to the computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation of mind by eliminating the mind itself from reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Personally, not being committed to such an explanation, this doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in itself constitute my problem with current physical accounts.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternative is rather that physics as an account of mind must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incomplete, or else it is wrong.   But that's another story.
