Hi Bruno,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your answers. I follow you in passing on our points of 
<br />
agreement (and erasing them).

&nbsp;Hi Godfrey,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;I see we agree on many things. I comment only where we take distance.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Le 12-août-05, à 19:33, kurtleegod.domain.name.hidden a écrit :
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; That is a wonderful point you make above! But my own was that &gt; 
</em><br />
acknowledging something may not exactly be the same as admitting its &gt; 
<br />
reality; it can in fact be just the opposite when what is acknowledge &gt; 
<br />
is someone else's belief for instance. How
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; (consensual) reality is acquired is a pretty complicated and still &gt; 
</em><br />
mysterious process. I would venture that a lot of what we
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; would count as &quot;subjective reality&quot; is just that! (more below)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure I understand you, and pêrhaps it is just a question of 
<br />
vocabulary. If I acknowledge a belief of someone, it seems to me that I 
<br />
take as real (or very plausible) that that someone has a belief, not 
<br />
that the belief is true.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Altough the subjective reality is just that, I guess, subjective. I 
<br />
take as objective the existence of &quot;subjective reality&quot;, or at least I 
<br />
take as objective the existence of the discourse and silence on 
<br />
subjective reality, and what I am searching an explanation on is 
<br />
exactly that, how to explain in objective term the subjective 
<br />
discourse, including the fact that we know we cannot make objective 
<br />
that subjectivity. This is part of the so-called mind-body problem.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, like Lee, that my subjective view is neurons firing is just 
<br />
false. To say that it is the sult of neurons firing is much more 
<br />
interesting but actually makes the problem worse (as serious 
<br />
philosopher of mind know very well). The reason is that if neurons 
<br />
firing explains all my behavior, it is just more enigmatic that 
<br />
something like consciousness has ever evolved.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanation is more subtle and demanding and eventually forces us 
<br />
to revised our oldest prejudices about the nature of reality.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am trying to make is that a lot of your back and forth 
<br />
discourse on the 1st versus the 3rd person misses the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2nd person in between them! More specifically: I am quite convinced 
<br />
that one good part of what we call &quot;the Mind&quot; or
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;the Self&quot; and perhaps even &quot;Consciousness&quot; is generated by social 
<br />
interaction rather than by any &quot;inner realm of subjectivity&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect this is true about all of what we call &quot;symbolic&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;meaningful&quot; including a lot of the support for mathematical
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding though I guess I am a platonist to the extent that I 
<br />
think of mathematical objects as existing independently
<br />
&nbsp;of any of our semantics in a realm of their own.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As for consciousness I do agree with you that whatever explains it may 
<br />
seriously require a revision of our oldest and,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;very possibly, some of our newest prejudices about reality but 
<br />
certainly most of outr old prejudices about... consciousness-
<br />
&nbsp;yours (and mine) included! ;-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;... skipped
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; If I understand it correctly this is that one materially supported &gt; 
</em><br />
conscious entity could
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; be entirely (and analytically) replaced by a digitally constructed &gt; 
</em><br />
one without it even being conscious of it. Am I right? Is
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; this what you COMP ? If so you are right in one thing: it is one 
</em><br />
hell &gt; of a stronger contention than the strongest AI hyp
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; (and that much more unlikely).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;OK. But please note that 99,9% of the scientists take it for granted. 
<br />
Actually I know only Penrose postulating explicitly the negation of 
<br />
comp. This forces him to speculate about the falsity of both quantum 
<br />
mechanics and general relativity.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I would rather not bring Penrose to this discussion though he is 
<br />
someone I much appreciate and will not easily dismiss. Unfortunately I 
<br />
can't claim I understand his Byzantine time-asymmetric proposals as 
<br />
alternatives for QM and GR enough
<br />
&nbsp;to criticize them, and I am not alone in this.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But I thought about your COMP and such over the weekend and I realized 
<br />
I have to take back what I said above! I can
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;perfectly well imagine a world in which no one has yet built a 
<br />
conscious machine from scratch but someone has found a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;procedure for replacing one's consciousness by a digital one in the 
<br />
way you describe. Why should one imply the other?
<br />
&nbsp;...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't say that either. I don't know if I am a genious, but I don't 
<br />
know if I am not a genious either ;-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;Oh, Bruno, don't be so bashful ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; And since you are a machine your years and years
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; and years may surely add to two centuries! No wonder you outrun your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modesty...
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never said that I am a machine. I have not the slightest idea 
<br />
if comp is true. But I am sure that if comp is true then physics 
<br />
emerges from the arithmetical relations, well, as sure as I am sure of 
<br />
the irrationality of the square root of 2. I give a proof.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I am sorry, than! As you speak so much of acts-of-faith I 
<br />
concluded, too soon I gather, that you took all those years of toil
<br />
&nbsp;as a consequence of your beliefs. Silly me!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Oh but you make it sound so easy! See: its is the &quot;derive physics &gt; 
</em><br />
from computer science&quot; that I have my first problem with!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the object of the proof I gave. The proof is 100% third person 
<br />
accessible, like any proof. What is hard, perhaps, is that the proof is 
<br />
done in a field which is in the intersection of theoretical physics, 
<br />
theoretical computer science and theoretical cognitive science.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And just how sure are you that there is such an intersection? Or is 
<br />
that also an article of faith?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Easier said than done, I'm afraid. Stephen Wolfram sent me his huge 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; book but I remain as unconvinced by it as everyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; else who has read it about his &quot;tinker bell&quot; version of Quantum &gt; 
</em><br />
Mechanics. I heard Ed Fredkin a number of times and,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; though he is quite charming, I don't think he has any better answer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to that question...
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolfram, like Schmidhuber, entirely dismiss the 1/3 distinction. The 
<br />
proof I gave shows that Wolfram is just wrong on those matter. I am 
<br />
nearer Svozil and Chaitin (but well beyond, probably).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I thought Svozil and Chaitin were near at all I might understand 
<br />
you better. At least we agree that Wolfram is wrong!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; More specifically: I believe QM puts a big kabosh into any &gt; 
</em><br />
non-quantum mechanistic view of the physical world. If you
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; don't get that, than maybe you don't get a lot of other things, &gt; 
</em><br />
Bruno. Sorry if this sounds contemptuous. It is meant
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; to be.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not seem contemptuous, it seems just circular. If you have the 
<br />
two following axioms:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;1) There is a physical world
<br />
&nbsp;2) The physical world is described by QM
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it seems obvious to me that &quot;QM puts a big kabosh into any 
<br />
non-quantum mechanistic view of the physical world&quot;.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Now don't worry, I believe more in the quantum than in comp! I 
<br />
thought, in the past, that I would quickly refute comp with quantum 
<br />
mechanics. But the fact are there, comp, as far as it has been tested 
<br />
implies everything we can deduce from the quantum. Comp is not yet 
<br />
refuted, and evidences add up that the quantum is derivable from comp 
<br />
(or from numbers through comp).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I believe in the quantum, but if comp is correct, I can no 
<br />
more believe in &quot;1)&quot;, i.e. I must abandon the existence of a physical 
<br />
world, and the quantum describes only the way machine dreams 
<br />
interference generate the stable illusion of solidity and time from 
<br />
arithmetical truth (under the form of confirmable bets, the Lobian Bp &amp; 
<br />
Dp).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lots of &quot;ifs&quot; in there! Since you found me circular let me just ask 
<br />
you this:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;If the physical world does not exist (you say that COMP implies this) 
<br />
why even bother deriving physics? Can't machines
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;dream just like we do, about lovely, terrifying and yet unphysical 
<br />
things?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I suspect that I can with just a bit of work, show you that QM 
<br />
invalidates your COMP hyp if I actually understand it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you be so kind as to state it out for me in one full sentence so 
<br />
I have a clear&quot; line-of-sight&quot;?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Incidentally, the reverse reduction of computer science to physics &gt; 
</em><br />
seems to be a lot more hopeful specially since most
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; computations seem to run a lot faster in physical computers than &gt; 
</em><br />
on... (what are the alternatives again?).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you study the Universal Dovetailer Argument, you will see that any 
<br />
machine betting correctly and consistently on any piece of &quot;observable&quot; 
<br />
reality, will bet that to simulate that piece of reality exactly, there 
<br />
is a need of simulating an infinity of computations. Remember we don't 
<br />
know in which computations &quot;we are&quot;, and the &quot;physical&quot; appearances 
<br />
emerge from some probabilistic interference among all the possible 
<br />
computations. Without QM, for example, with just a Newtonian World I 
<br />
would directly interpret my proof as a refutation of comp.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe there is a typo in what you say above because if that argument 
<br />
actually says that &quot;any machine betting correctly and consistently on 
<br />
any piece of &quot;observable&quot; reality, will bet that to simulate that piece 
<br />
of reality exactly, there is a need of simulating an infinity of 
<br />
computations&quot; than I would not take it to Vegas (;-) ! This is because 
<br />
we can in fact, not just bet but,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;predict, with certainty, and simulate with arbitrary precision, the 
<br />
behavior of a good number &quot;pieces of observed reality&quot; by
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves and even verify the certainty of those predictions with a 
<br />
finite collection of finite algorithms which is what we
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;do call physics (classical or quantum, theoretical or empirical) ). 
<br />
What we cannot do is to reproduce by any finite set of algorithms worth 
<br />
betting on the type of persistent built-in correlations that pairs (and 
<br />
trios, etc..) of these pieces of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;observable reality manifestly carry between them once they have been, 
<br />
once, part of the same piece! Even coins
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;don't toss that way! That is where the &quot;kabosh&quot; is! There is no 
<br />
dovetailing out of it...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Also if Newtonian physics is enough to shoot down your hypothesis than 
<br />
it must be dead already since Newtonian physics
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is the correspondence limit of QM and QM is right!!! I really don't 
<br />
follow you here...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; OK, no one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; has built a truly quantum computer just yet but a lot of people 
</em><br />
think &gt; they are about to do it!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;I'm quasi sure they will!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'm quasi sure me or someone else will extract the existence of a 
<br />
quantum computer in the neighborhood of any &quot;conscious&quot; lobian machine, 
<br />
or refute comp. comp will provide really solid foundations for the 
<br />
quantum, if it is correct. In particular physical *laws* will be real 
<br />
general laws pertaining on all possible observers.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, again, I would much like to know what these &quot;solid foundations 
<br />
for the quantum&quot; are but am happy in my believe
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that particular(?) physical laws are *already* real general laws and 
<br />
indeed apply to all possible observers even without
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;your help or George Levy's opposition!!! If I stop believing in 
<br />
gravity can I fly? (:-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Sure will (take it with and entire salt mine)! My point is that we &gt; 
</em><br />
already have ways of explaining other people's experiences
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; on the basis of empathy or antipathy and in terms of direct 
</em><br />
causation.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Causation? Sorry but I consider such a notion as very vague (and very 
<br />
interesting).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ten thousands notion of causality, and a lot of them can be 
<br />
studied as necessary implication: B(p-&gt;q) in some modal logic. So I 
<br />
consider they are at least as many notion of &quot;causation&quot; than there are 
<br />
modal logics. And there is an infinity of modal logics ...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My fault I am sorry, I should have written &quot;interaction&quot; instead of 
<br />
causation. I fully agree with you about the latter.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;[GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Bill Clinton was found of saying &quot;I feel your pain&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; no one called him on that obvious lie! I can think of some numbers &gt; 
</em><br />
that would tell me about the pain others are feeling
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; (checked the price of gas today? $2.59 a gallon!!! That hurts!!!)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;Quite cheap from here!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;Sorry again! I feel your *bigger* pain (even if I don't own a car!)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Seriously, I see nothing wrong with what you saying as long as you &gt; 
</em><br />
couch it in that &quot;faith-based&quot; argumentation.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all theories are faith-based. But, yes, comp, is not only 
<br />
faith based, but it justifies why some part of it are necessarily 
<br />
faith-based, if true.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some more than others, I would add. I catch your point but again I 
<br />
think this is a bit of a cop out.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Your argument is cute and may very well be defensible that way. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; day and and age it may actually be better supported
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; that way than as hard clad science, who knows?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard clad science. I know of course that it could look 
<br />
&quot;philosophical&quot; because I indeed tackle a &quot;philosophical problem&quot;. But 
<br />
I did actually chose purposefully special hypotheses for making the 
<br />
conclusion 100% testable, as it makes testable many variant of comp 
<br />
(like some weakening or strengthening).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people, including Bohr, qualified the Einstein Podolski Rosen 
<br />
paper as &quot;philosophical&quot;. But then (30 years later) Bell shows it to be 
<br />
testable (and Deutch: exploitable). My work is like EPR+BELL, although 
<br />
it bears on the mind body problem. The UDA part corresponds to EPR and 
<br />
the translation of the UDA in the language of a sufficiently rich 
<br />
machine theorem prover is the BELL part: I arrive to propositions as 
<br />
vulnerable as it is possible to be.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Again your modesty precedes you. The Bell argument, thanks largely to 
<br />
Clauser, Horn, Shimony and Holt, Aspect et all
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;became an item of &quot;experimental metaphysics&quot; and is soon to become a 
<br />
major industry! And this without anyone having to sell their soul or 
<br />
body to a digitalist surgeon. May you be so blessed...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Oh, what a pity! I was kind of bracing to see that derivation! I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure it would drive your point across a lot quicker.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Oh well, I could probably give you a couple of other outrageous &gt; 
</em><br />
hypothesis from which you could derive the whole
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; of physics, not constructively of course! You are the logician but &gt; 
</em><br />
isn't it the case that from an assuredly false premise
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; you can derive anything?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh please! If you don't know the premise is false, then by deriving 
<br />
anything from the premise gives in any circumstances interesting 
<br />
information. Take the case where I would derive the false from comp, 
<br />
then I would have derive a refutation of comp. (p -&gt; f is the same as 
<br />
~p). That would be something!
<br />
&nbsp;So non constructive proof can be interesting and informative!
<br />
&nbsp;Anyway, my proof *is* constructive.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I thing you got my point. The false tends to be more interesting than 
<br />
the true... and more heartbreaking too.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; The second part is a translation of that argument in the language of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; the &quot;universal machine itself&quot;. This, by the constraints of &gt;

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Oh gosh! Another let down! Well maybe those pesky Quantum Computer 
</em><br />
builders can rescue you after all one day.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Here you are right. This is actually predictable from comp. One of the 
<br />
quantum logics should be quantum tractable, and not classically 
<br />
tractable.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I said to much when I say the questions are intractable. I 
<br />
should insist on the fact that I did solve one of the main decisive 
<br />
question (and comp succeed the test), and that, concerning many others, 
<br />
I have not yet really try to solve them, but professional logician does 
<br />
not find them easy, so I doubt I will get them. Now, I could prove that 
<br />
all of them are tractable in the sense that less than a CETI project 
<br />
could solve them (like you can simulate a &lt;few-bits&gt;-quantum computer 
<br />
with enough classical bits.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;You lost me here. Are they tractable or not? I wasn't aware that the 
<br />
CETI project can solve intractable problems !!!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I heard that you plan to become immortal (after a little digital &gt; 
</em><br />
plastic surgery) you will have the time to wait for it!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the contrary. I plan to be mortal, but with comp this seems 
<br />
extremely hard if not impossible. This is the feature I dislike the 
<br />
most in comp. It is not clear there could be any hope of finding a way 
<br />
to get out. There could be a whole arithmetical Bardo Thodol.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(This is already true with Everett QM). That's another reason to think 
<br />
about using the word &quot;theology&quot;, perhaps.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Bruno, imortel malgre soi!! And presumably &quot;imortel qui mal y 
<br />
pense, aussi !&quot; , no? Gosh, I wasn't counting on that
<br />
&nbsp;in my retirement plans... (;-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously for a second: I doubt that I know enough to understand all 
<br />
your demonstrations and arguments or judge their
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;correctness in detail, and I am no Dr. Phil, but I have the distinct 
<br />
impression that you are too enamoured with your COMP
<br />
&nbsp;hyp to let it go. Is this possible?
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Take it easy,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Bruno
