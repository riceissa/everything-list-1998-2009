<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the main point of disagreement between the two camps now is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relative SSSA versus absolute SSSA (Marchal's terms). Can we all agree

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that given the absolute SSSA, there is no justification for QS? (Higgo's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;I don't care about anything&quot; doesn't count.) If so, someone from the QS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; camp should respond to my argument that the absolute SSSA is necessary for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practical reasoning. 
</em><br />
<br />(I see that my earlier attempt to respond to Wei's point about the
<br />
SSSA being the basis for practical reasoning was badly confused, but I
<br />
think I will have to learn more about the philosophical underpinnings
<br />
of probability theory before I can give a better response.)
<br />
<br />I may have the wrong definition here; if so please could you briefly
<br />
summarize the absolute SSSA?
<br />
<br />I think the idea is that each observer-moment has a measure which
<br />
describes the probability that it would be selected randomly from
<br />
among all observer-moments.  Each moment of consciousness that we
<br />
experience is weighted by that measure, and it is much more likely that we
<br />
experience high measure moments than that we experience low measure ones.
<br />
In particular, our current experiences of reading and writing on this
<br />
mailing list should be relatively high measure compared to a potentially
<br />
vast number of extremely low measure and hence improbable ones.
<br />
<br />The question then is whether we should commit quantum suicide (QS) in
<br />
this model.  There are two problems that we have to dispose of first.
<br />
The first is that this universe is deterministic, hence questions of
<br />
policy may seem meaningless, since there is no free will.  We will in fact
<br />
commit QS or not depending on the laws of physics and not any policies
<br />
we adopt.  This objection I think we can dispose of in the standard ways
<br />
in which free will is coupled with determinism, mainly claiming that the
<br />
two phenomena are identical but occur at different levels of description.
<br />
<br />The second problem is that there seems to be no need for a definition
<br />
of identity in this model; each observer-instant exists on its own,
<br />
and although the laws of physics are such that its measure will be
<br />
related to the measures of succeeding and following observer-instants,
<br />
there is no other necessary coupling between them.  In particular we
<br />
don't assume that there is one person whose identity flows from one
<br />
moment to the next.  Rather, each observer instant exists on its own.
<br />
So it is not clear what it means to ask whether &quot;I&quot; should commit QS,
<br />
if the concept of identity isn't used.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless I think we can say that whatever policy is appropriate with
<br />
regard to QS can be expressed independently of any concept of identity.
<br />
The policy would be something like, &quot;commit QS if circumstances at the
<br />
observer-instant in question satisfy condition X.&quot;  The question is
<br />
then what rule a general observer should adopt in deciding whether to
<br />
commit QS.
<br />
<br />We still need one more element, though: what the goal is of the observer?
<br />
He needs to decide whether to commit QS based on some criteria.
<br />
What should they be?
<br />
<br />It seems to me that we can identify two goals which are both plausible,
<br />
one which would justify QS and one which would not.  The first would
<br />
be to maximize the average happiness of all observer-instants in the
<br />
universe.  The second would be to maximize the total amount of happiness
<br />
in the universe.  (I believe this was discussed earlier on the list,
<br />
so I apologize for going over old ground, but I have forgotten the
<br />
resolution if any.)
<br />
<br />In the first goal, if we look at a transitional observer-instant,
<br />
suppose we have that the happiness level going into that instant is 100.
<br />
Then the universe splits into good and bad branches, each with probability
<br />
.5 compared to the original branch.  In the good branch the happiness
<br />
level is 120, and in the bad branch it is 80.  In this little piece of
<br />
the big picture, the average happiness level is 100 (100*1 + 80*.5 +
<br />
120*.5)/(1+.5+.5).
<br />
<br />If QS is used to prune the bad branch, the average happiness level climbs
<br />
to (100*1 + 120*.5)/(1+.5) or 106.7.  So in this case QS would appear to
<br />
be justified.  All observers should adopt the policy of committing suicide
<br />
whenever something bad happens, which will raise the average happiness
<br />
lvel of all observer-instants in the universe.
<br />
<br />If the second goal is adopted, then QS is not justified.  Even bad things
<br />
have a positive happiness value.  (If things get so bad that there is a
<br />
negative happiness value, suicide might be justified, but that would be
<br />
true in a single universe model as well so this does not count as QS.)
<br />
In the situation above, the total happiness is 100*1+80*.5+120*.5 or 200,
<br />
while if we commit QS the total happiness drops to 160.
<br />
<br />So it seems to me that even with the absolute SSSA (if I have understood
<br />
it properly) there is a matter of goals which must be resolved before
<br />
we can say that QS is unjustified.
<br />
