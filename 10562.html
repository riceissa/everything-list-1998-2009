Peter Jones writes (quoting SP):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What about an inputless computer program, running deterministically like a recording.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Would that count as a program at all,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would be a trivial case.
</em><br />
<br />Trivial does not mean false.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  and could it be a conscious program, given that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computationalism is true?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously not, since people have inputs.
</em><br />
<br />There are several possible responses to that. Firstly, it isn't necessarily true that only people 
<br />
can be conscious, even if people (and maybe some animals) are the only entities we have good 
<br />
reason to believe are conscious. 
<br />
<br />Secondly, there is always the possibility that an inputless, deterministic machine might be able 
<br />
to receive input. We might open the case, connect a lead with alligator clips, and start communicating 
<br />
with it in morse code. To the program, it would be like a message from God. You would then have to 
<br />
decide at which point the program became conscious: when the case was opened, when the message 
<br />
was sent, or was it conscious all along? If you say it was not conscious until the message was actually 
<br />
sent you would have to say that an entity was only conscious while receiving input, and stopped 
<br />
being conscious while it was analysing the input already received.
<br />
<br />Finally, it is possible to have the same kind of interaction that a machine with environmental inputs  
<br />
has by connecting two previously inputless machines to each other. They can then have a two way 
<br />
conversation, each surprised by the other's responses, but the system as a whole remains inputless 
<br />
and deterministic. The ultimate example of this is, as Brent Meeker suggested, a self-contained virtual 
<br />
reality. The universe as a whole could be seen as just this, unless you believe that God speaks to us 
<br />
from outside.
