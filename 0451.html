Hi James,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno, I finally got around to replying to this missive of yours.  But I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;still not sure what you're saying as I don't know precisely what you mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;your mind (consciousness) includes your immediate expectations&quot;
</em><br />
<br />The idea comes from Helmholtz. He attempts to define conscious perception 
<br />
as unsconscious inference. What I mean is that you cannot be conscious 
<br />
(having a subjective private life) without having some implicit 
<br />
expectation, if only the expectation that the next instant will looks 
<br />
approximately the same as the current instant. The neurophysiological 
<br />
study of dreams has shown that the cerebral stem play a role in trigging 
<br />
the cortex for making these instinctive inferences (in dreams for 
<br />
exemple). Actually such an idea can be find also in Descartes where 
<br />
consciousness generates potential representations. Dostoiesvski also 
<br />
describes consciousness as accessible truth.
<br />
A very good book on consciousness is the recent one by William SIEGER 
<br />
(&quot;Theories of Consciousness&quot;, Routledge 1999). I recommand it. It is a 
<br />
good introduction to the mind/body problem from Descartes to Quantum 
<br />
approaches.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Forthermore, the idea of transportation has no place in my ontololgy as all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes are discrete and contain no movement.  Universes are related to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other universes only by correlation, which is a subjective feature.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;see that your hand moves smoothly from one point to another. In fact, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have viewed a huge number of unrelated universes in such a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way that they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;related.  It so happens that there is a universe in which you hand is at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point a, and another in which your hand is at point a+1, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appear to be related. But they are not. In an infinite multiverse universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which appear to have any relation you like do in fact exist. We appear to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist in those sets of universes which can be strung together so that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;laws of physics appear to emerge (weak anthropic principle, my dear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; friend).
</em><br />
<br />I totally agree with what you are saying here, with some nuances. Replace 
<br />
Universe with Computationnal (and consistent) histories, etc. I will not 
<br />
try to be more precise at this stage. Even in the restricted 
<br />
interpretation of MWI these nuances exist.
<br />
<br />BTW does someone understand why Tegmark does not include the &quot;consistent 
<br />
histories approach to QM&quot; in the &quot;many-world&quot; type of QM-interpretation?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm thinking of Tegmark's and Schmidhuber's ideas that complexity is only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;apparent when you see a subset of the simple reality, like the Mandelbrot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;set. This ties in nicely with the Buddhist idea that it is only our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ignorance that allows us to see the world at all. Once you see the whole -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;like the Mandelbrot equation - you no longer see the one little piece of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the set that you once thought so interesting and complex.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It seems that *everything* has no meaning unless you view it from the very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;narrow subjective perspective that we have. If you take the Arcimedian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspective, then you can say nothing but 'everything is'. Resolution of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;separate phenomena can only occur as we occlude our vision. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Before you can talk about anything, you have to define our level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ignorance. Or perhaps defining our level of ignorance is the only weay to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;define anything.
</em><br />
<br />This is a very nice idea. In fact theoretical computer science is 
<br />
partially based on this principle.  
<br />
There exists also a lot of illustration of that idea in mathematical 
<br />
logic. For exemple with Skolem paradox.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Note that, although I can't see why our consciousnesses are not 'immortal'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;under MWI, that doesn't mean that I think we exist as separate entities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;undergoing successive experiences in time. And it doesn't mean I think it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;good or desirable to be immortal.
</em><br />
<br />I am glad you are aware of that. Sometime I hope comp is false. 
<br />
Immortality, once you understand where it comes from with comp and/or 
<br />
MWI, is not necessarily a good news.
<br />
The old materialist notion of death (eternal peace, nothingness) looks 
<br />
like wishfull thinking now.
<br />
The fact that you don't necessarily think we exist as separate entities
<br />
undergoing successive experiences in time can be made more precise:
<br />
1) from the 3d person point of view, we are not separate entities
<br />
undergoing successive experiences in time.
<br />
2) ... but we (at least most of us) feel that we live as separate entities
<br />
undergoing successive experiences in time : and that should be explained.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The 'great programmer' could have the intelligence and consciousness of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;amoeba. And why bother talking about him if he's not needed - Ockam would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not approve. 
</em><br />
<br />You need UD in the same way you need any program or numbers.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The great program (Juergen, please correct me) looks something like LET
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A=A+1 GOTO START.  Any ideas on how a program runs when you don't have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;flow of time, but a static block universe?
</em><br />
<br />... the same as newtonian time &quot;occurs&quot; in the static relativity 
<br />
space-time.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the 3-person Archimedian point of view there is no running program. 
</em><br />
Your remark about the &quot;moving hand&quot; applies here as well ...
<br />
Your &quot;LET A=A+1 GOTO START&quot; is correct but rather trivial (and 
<br />
unpedagogical) as a UD. You could have choose the empty program as well. 
<br />
I suggest you write a real UD :). That is : you choose a universal 
<br />
machine, and you write an explicit generator of all the possible 
<br />
execution of your universal machines. (= about 10 lines in PROLOG, 100 
<br />
lines in LISP, 1000 lines in FORTRAN).
<br />
If you are courageous, you can write a dovetailer on the solutions of the 
<br />
Dewitt-Wheeler equations !
<br />
Note that a UD is (recursively) equivalent to a program which almost 
<br />
compute OMEGA Chaitin number.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;One point of disagreement with Juergen: you don't need  infinite strings of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;great programmers.  There need be no great programmer, just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the program. And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;since there's no programmer to make it complicated, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the program is as simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as it can be.
</em><br />
<br />I guess Schmidhuber should'nt anthropomorphise UD. The great programmer 
<br />
(Schmidhuber recognize that explicitely) is a program. Its execution 
<br />
generates all possible (with Church's Thesis) possible UDs.
<br />
Once you admit a minimal amount of arithmetical platonism, you inherit 
<br />
all the UDs, independently of your using or not using them.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Bruno
