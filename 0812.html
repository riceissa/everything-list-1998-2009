<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And you admit (if I read correctly your URL) that your proposal (for

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; There is indeed an &quot;implementation&quot; problem.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	I think the idea of my proposal is basically correct, but it needs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;refinement.  It should be made more precise and possible to state more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simply and must be tested with a barrage of proposed implementations that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;must be declared &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.  But in research it is to be expected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that it may take several tries (and maybe several people) to get something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;right.  I'm being cautious because I've already tried and rejected a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number of ideas that seemed good at the time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	Currently it has not been proven that the problem can be solved or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that my proposal does so, and it also has not been proven that this is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the case.  It may well be impossible to either find a solution or to prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that one does not exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; My feeling (let us say) is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this problem is *fatal* for the physical computationalist (like you ; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; BTW thanks for this nice expression).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What I JUST show in my thesis is that IF the mathematical (arithmetical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is enough)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computationalist solve the &quot;implementation problem&quot; (your term) THEN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; she will justify the origin of the appearance of the physical laws and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; solve the mind body problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	I don't see much difference is this respect between the 'math' and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'physics' versions.  You still want a 'math' computation that simulates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the universe to implement a brain computation, so you need the same kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of solution to the implementation problem.  Without this you have almost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no chance to get the right predictions but the universe is less complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than the brain.
</em><br />
<br />I have no doubt we agree on some key points.
<br />
<br />Unlike Dennett you are aware of a &quot;matter problem&quot; (through the 
<br />
interpretation of QM),
<br />
Unlike Penrose you are aware of a &quot;mind problem&quot;, including the fact that 
<br />
the link
<br />
between computation and physical activity is not obvious.
<br />
And I agree gladly with you when you say that an interpretation of QM
<br />
needs a theory of mind.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless I am not quite sure we have the *same kind* of 
<br />
implementation problem.
<br />
Roughly speaking you try to find criteria for linking consciousness to
<br />
physical instantiation of computations. 
<br />
<br />What I say, is that if we take the computationalist hypothesis seriously 
<br />
then
<br />
<br />- 1) your implementation problem is necessarily insoluble ...
<br />
<br />- 2) ... untill you understand that with comp there is just no physical 
<br />
activities at all, only relative believes in *physical activities* by 
<br />
kind of *mean* machines (and the means are taken on the whole set of 
<br />
infinite computationnal histories, ...
<br />
<br />- 3) ... so that there is no other choices than to justify the (relative) 
<br />
beliefs, by machines, in physical laws. This could be done through
<br />
a sort of theoretical psychology (or theology, cf the immortality point), 
<br />
which, thanks to comp, is essentially theoretical computer science, 
<br />
including classical information theory.
<br />
We should explain for exemple, why there is no appearance of white flying 
<br />
rabbits ...
<br />
<br />I am aware of saying something quite radical here. For exemple most people
<br />
in the quantum computing community are thinking, following Landauer, that
<br />
the very existence of quantum computers show that information is 
<br />
physical. This is because they belief from the start in a *physical 
<br />
world*,
<br />
and I guess because they have not thought enough on the mind body problem 
<br />
(IMHO).
<br />
<br />In fact I tend to believe that the classical Church's thesis CT
<br />
entails the falsity of what David Deutsch called the &quot;Church Turing 
<br />
principle&quot; (CTP). This means that the constraints of the classical 
<br />
computationnalism (with CT) are enough for explaining the appearance
<br />
(in the machine's mind) of &quot;physical computation&quot; apparently violating 
<br />
Church's thesis.
<br />
<br />We agree on important points which are unfortunately not understood
<br />
by many people, but we disagree on important points too.
<br />
We disagree on the immortality question but we disagree also on what I
<br />
would like to call the necessary reversal that comp implies.
<br />
<br />If I am correct,
<br />
it will be hard to maintain that physics is necessarily the fundamental 
<br />
(ontological)
<br />
science (an Aristotelian Dogma).
<br />
With comp the fundamental science is not physics, but, let us say, the
<br />
psychology of the Universal Turing Machines. What Garlanter and John
<br />
Myhill call &quot;exact psychology&quot;.
<br />
Physical realities are inside-(relative)-views by machines belonging 
<br />
to a vast collection of  -implementation independent-  sharable dreams 
<br />
(computationnal histories).
<br />
<br />A real attempt to derive, in this spirit, physics from psychology is
<br />
given in the chapter 5 of my thesis <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal</a>.
<br />
But I don't think it is worth to engage on that godelian road before 
<br />
people acknowledges the *reversal* between physics and psychology, which 
<br />
has 
<br />
nothing to do a priori whith the incompleteness phenomenon, but is a
<br />
prelude to some interesting (new) interpretations.
<br />
<br />Bruno.
