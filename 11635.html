<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perfectly into position in each case by virtue of its content alone.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I think we're in agreement, Stathis, but I'm trying to focus on a
<br />
problem, and what I think is a non-trivial aspect of evolved brain
<br />
functionality that would be required to overcome it. Of course, I agree
<br />
with you that each aspect of the experience '.....falls perfectly into
<br />
position in each case by virtue of its content alone' - it's precisely
<br />
what I've been arguing. But there's a subtler point here also, I think,
<br />
that leads to the problem. Let's take the 'cat sat on the mat': now
<br />
'cat' starts at t1 and 'mat' ends at t2. Let's subdivide t1t2 into
<br />
occasions o1-o1000, and let teleportation occur between each. Each
<br />
occasion o1-o1000 is as informationally closed as OMt1t2 (the
<br />
'teleportation' is of course inserted precisely to make this point),
<br />
but now it has become implausible to believe that any individual
<br />
occasion, say o492, is of sufficient extent to recover any coherent
<br />
component whatsoever of the conscious thought 'the cat sat on the mat'.
<br />
And yet, we know that we *are* in fact able to routinely recover such
<br />
components, corresponding loosely to a 'specious present' of some 1.5
<br />
seconds extent.
<br />
<br />Now comes the problem: how do we account for our manifest ability to do
<br />
this without invoking some form of illicit 'continuity' between
<br />
informationally separated occasions of arbitrarily fine granularity? No
<br />
individual occasion apparently contains all the necessary information,
<br />
and it seems that we almost can't stop ourselves imaginatively invoking
<br />
some sort of continuity over multiple occasions, in order that coherent
<br />
experiences can somehow be recovered by summing over the sequence.
<br />
<br />I think, if true, this would be a real problem in reconciling our
<br />
experience with the facts, and I think therefore that it requires a
<br />
real solution (actually an aspect of Barbour's time capsule theory
<br />
which I'm extrapolating a bit further). Simply, if what I'm arguing is
<br />
valid, it must follow that my assumption about individual occasions
<br />
'not containing the necessary information' *must be wrong*.
<br />
Consequently, sufficient information to recover 'speciously present'
<br />
dynamic experiences *must* in fact be *simultaneously* represented by
<br />
the brain - be present on one occasion - and that this simultaneous
<br />
'dynamic' presentation must be the engine that renders both the
<br />
duration and the dynamism of the experience. And, to complete the
<br />
(evolutionary) circularity, this would be precisely *why* the brain
<br />
would possess this capability - because without it, extended, dynamic
<br />
environmental presentations would simply be *unavailable* to the
<br />
organism.
<br />
<br />Does this make sense?

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; David,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consider these three examples:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (a) You utter sentence S, &quot;the cat sat on the mat&quot;. The word &quot;on&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; starts at time t1 and finishes at time t2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (b) At time t1 while uttering S you are intantaneously teleported to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distant location.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (c) You have no actual past but materialise de novo at time t1 as if in (b),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uttering  &quot;... on the mat&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are interested in your phenomenal consciousness between t1 and t2 in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each case (ignoring the change of scenery due to the teleportation). It is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doubt quite complex, involving not only saying the word &quot;on&quot; but also a sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of self, a sense of the whole sentence and your place in it, an idea that this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; part of an experiment, and so on. There may even be a lag between action and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; awareness, so that you are actually conscious of saying &quot;sat&quot; in the interval
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; t1t2 rather than when you actually said it, and there will probably be at least some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense of continuity between &quot;sat&quot; and &quot;on&quot; during t1t2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The point is, whatever you are thinking during t1t2, you are thinking *something*,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and you are thinking the same something in (a), (b) and (c). Whatever complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain processes are occurring during t1t2 in (a) are also occurring in (b) and (c), and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore whatever conscious processes are occurring during that interval in (a) will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also occur in (b) and (c), and you will not lose your place in the sentence or your sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of continuity of consciousness. The OM t1t2 is exactly the same in each case, and falls
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perfectly into position in each case by virtue of its content alone.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It's still unclear to me from the above whether we're in agreement or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not. I'm concerned that you may be assuming what is to be explained,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; owing to an illegitimate sleight of intuition. That is, it's so normal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for us to think in terms of the overall 'sequence of moments' that it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; easy to forget that the posit for OMs is that they are *informationally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; closed* with respect to other OMs (this is the point I've been debating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with Peter, with which I thought you agreed). If OMs are thus closed,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then it must follow that whatever information is required to generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the experience of 'a given moment' (under-defined, but see below)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *must* be contained in its entirety within *some* (but of course not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; every) OM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Were that not the case, *no* individual OM would contain all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; elements of a coherent conscious experience, and by the same token
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *any* coherent conscious experience would necessarily have to span
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *multiple* OMs. But any such assumption - i.e. meta-assembly of data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; over multiple OMs - is precisely what we wish to rule out of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; account. A 'successor' OM - and any conscious state dependent on it -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; must simply 'forget' anything about 'prior' OMs that is not re-encoded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; within it - beyond such encoding, everything else is simply radically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; absent. A metaphor here might be a cine-film. An OM is then a frame. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all you have is a single frame, then your 'experience' must be strictly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; limited to whatever is contained in that frame, unless you can somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; surreptitiously sneak a glance at - or recall at will - other frames.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; we rely on the machinery of the brain keeping track of everything to generate successive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; moments of consciousness which pull everything back into coherence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Is what you say above consistent with the constraints on OMs in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; account? I think perhaps we may intend the same thing here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This consideration, at least, strongly suggests (IMO entails) something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; entirely non-trivial about what the brain is actually doing (your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'engineering problem'), beyond representing simple 'snapshots' from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; external input. To overcome the 'OM constraint', it needs to assemble,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from these 'instants', 'rolling constructs', each of which encodes an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; updated version of the 'specious present', *simultaneously*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; representing multiple snapshots and their relations. It may be entirely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; owing to such 'time capsules' (as Barbour, taking this issue seriously,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; implies) that we are able to assemble and implement a dynamic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience of 'time'. In fact, we can be pretty sure that there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; brain mechanism doing something like this, because as Colin recently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reminded us, there are syndromes that interfere with it, changing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'dynamic granularity' (refresh rate). So our dynamic experience - the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'A-series' - may depend critically on such 'time-synthesising'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mechanisms within brain structure and function, rather than mapping in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a simple sequential way to external 'B-series' events. And this of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; course would then make sense of why such biological time-mechanisms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would have evolved. That is, because successive improvement in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ability to represent, and consequently discriminate and respond to, an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; environment perceived as dynamic events and processes at variable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; levels of granularity, confers obvious survival advantage.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for memory being encoded in or accessible to an OM, that is an unnecessary complication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As you said previously, the OM's are related solely by their information content. If the seconds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of your life were sliced up, shuffled and thrown to the wind, (t1) 3:10:02 PM of 10/10/06 would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still subjectively follow (t2) 3:10:01 PM of 10/10/06 even though there is no connection or &quot;flow&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of information between them. If you look at how t1 and t2 are generated, then yes, there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connection - they both come out of your head - but once generated, they form a natural sequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which cannot be disrupted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But my point about the 'coherence' of consciousness is that it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (especially from what occurs, or fails to occur, when it deteriorates)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that complex representation and processing of *temporally extended*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information sequences (e.g. grasp of the entirety of the content and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meaning of a sentence or proposition) is necessary for one to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience and act as a fully-functioning conscious individual.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Consequently, it seems to me that such processes must converge on OMs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in which all the necessary information is fully encoded and expressed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (which is essentially what Barbour seems to be claiming for his 'time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; capsules' - e.g. his 'flight of the kingfisher' example). Without this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the alternative seems to be that the individual random, wind-blown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seconds of your metaphor would need to be totalised in some additional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; non-information-based manner in order to coordinate an ensemble of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; informationally incomplete, discrete elements into coherent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiences. AFAICS they only 'form a natural sequence' from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quasi-objective perspective of our philosophical stance. And such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coordination is in any case what we were assuring Peter was both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unnecessary and impossible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; We have to distinguish between what actually happens to create the moments of a stream of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness and what is the minimum logically necessary that needs to happen. My brain must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; at some subconscious level have the structure of the whole sentence spanning a 2 second interval
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; t1-t2 or else the sentence could not be generated. But that's just an engineering problem: if the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; moments t1 and t2 come about with exactly the right sort of phenomenal content, magically, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; by random processes, then I will experience a coherent 2 second span of consciousness in which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; utter the full sentence. The only way I might not experience this is if there is something wrong with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the actual phenomenal content of t1 and t2: if whatever vague sense I have of the whole sentence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; during t1 and t2 is missing during either or both intervals, then I would forget what I was saying.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The vague sense of the whole sentence has two parts, in t1 and t2, just as the sentence itself has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; two parts. If we had a longer sentence through further nitervals t3, t4 and t5, it could be, for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; that during t4 the sense of the whole sentence is completely absent, and only in retrospect from t5 is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; it seen that t4 was part of the whole. This sort of thing happens all the time during absent-minded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; moments, and we rely on the machinery of the brain keeping track of everything to generate successive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; moments of consciousness which pull everything back into coherence.
