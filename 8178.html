<br />
<br />Very interesting. I had heard of this theory a couple of decades ago,
<br />
but never new who originated it. Interestingly, something similar is
<br />
being revived by Rueda and Haisch. see arXiv:gr-qc/0504061. I quote a
<br />
recent New Scientist article on the topic:
<br />
<br />&quot;WHERE mass comes from is one of the deepest mysteries of nature. Now a
<br />
controversial theory suggests that mass comes from the interaction of
<br />
matter with the quantum vacuum that pervades the universe.
<br />
<br />&quot;The theory was previously used to explain inertial mass - the property
<br />
of matter that resists acceleration - but it has been extended to
<br />
gravitational mass, which is the property of matter that feels the tug
<br />
of gravity.
<br />
<br />&quot;For decades, mainstream opinion has held that something called the
<br />
Higgs field gives matter its mass, mediated by a particle called the
<br />
Higgs boson. But no one has yet seen the Higgs boson, despite
<br />
considerable time and money spent looking for it in particle
<br />
accelerators.
<br />
<br />&quot;In the 1990s, Alfonso Rueda of California State University in Long
<br />
Beach and Bernard Haisch, who was then at the California Institute for
<br />
Physics and Astrophysics in Scotts Valley and is now with ManyOne
<br />
Networks, suggested that a very different kind of field known as the
<br />
quantum vacuum might be responsible for mass. This field, which is
<br />
predicted by quantum theory, is the lowest energy state of space-time
<br />
and is made of residual electromagnetic vibrations at every point in
<br />
the universe. It is also called a zero-point field and is thought to
<br />
manifest itself as a sea of virtual photons that continually pop into
<br />
and out of existence.  ?If particles are at rest, then the net effect
<br />
of this jiggling is zero, but an accelerating particle would
<br />
experience a net force?
<br />
<br />&quot;Rueda and Haisch argued that charged matter particles such as
<br />
electrons and quarks are unceasingly jiggled around by the zero-point
<br />
field. If they are at rest, or travelling at a constant speed with
<br />
respect to the field, then the net effect of all this jiggling is
<br />
zero: there is no force acting on the particle. But if a particle is
<br />
accelerating, their calculations in 1994 showed that it would
<br />
encounter more photons from the quantum vacuum in front than behind it
<br />
(see Diagram). This would result in a net force pushing against the
<br />
particle, giving rise to its inertial mass (Physical Review A, vol 49,
<br />
p 678).
<br />
<br />But this work only explained one type of mass. Now the researchers say
<br />
that the same process can explain gravitational mass. Imagine a
<br />
massive body that warps the fabric of space-time around it. The object
<br />
would also warp the zero-point field such that a particle in its
<br />
vicinity would encounter more photons on the side away from the object
<br />
than on the nearer side. This would result in a net force towards the
<br />
massive object, so the particle would feel the tug of gravity. This
<br />
would be its gravitational mass, or weight (Annalen der Physik, vol
<br />
14, p 479).  ?If they could come up with a prediction, people would
<br />
take notice. We're all looking for something we can measure?
<br />
<br />&quot;Rueda and Haisch say this demonstrates the equivalence of inertial
<br />
and gravitational mass - something that Einstein argued for in his
<br />
theory of general relativity. &quot;In place of having the particle
<br />
accelerate through the zero-point field, you have the zero-point field
<br />
accelerating past the particle,&quot; says Haisch. &quot;So the generation of
<br />
weight is the same as the generation of inertial mass.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;The idea is far from winning wide acceptance. To begin with, there's a
<br />
conundrum about the zero-point field that needs to be solved. The
<br />
total energy contained in the field is staggeringly large - enough to
<br />
warp space-time and make the universe collapse in a
<br />
heartbeat. Obviously this is not happening. Also, the pair's work can
<br />
only account for the mass of charged particles.
<br />
<br />&quot;Nobel laureate Sheldon Glashow of Boston University is
<br />
dismissive. &quot;This stuff, as Wolfgang Pauli would say, is not even
<br />
wrong,&quot; he says. But physicist Paul Wesson of Stanford University in
<br />
California says Rueda and Haisch's unorthodox approach shows promise,
<br />
though he adds that the theory needs to be backed up by experimental
<br />
evidence. &quot;If Haisch [and Rueda] could come up with a concrete
<br />
prediction, then that would make people sit up and take notice,&quot; he
<br />
says. &quot;We're all looking for something we can measure.&quot;
