<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are wrong. 
</em><br />
<br />I quite disagree. They are computed and relatively multiplied.
<br />
It is Everett insight to show that [the observer + object evolved
<br />
deterministicaly] entails the quantum *statistic* from the point
<br />
of view of the observer. It is really 1-statistics.
<br />
<br />Is it not the basic motivation for everything-type of explanation?
<br />
<br />(remember Hal Finney first sentences in the first post of this
<br />
discussion list:
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;A weak notion of the idea that all universes exist is the many worlds
<br />
interpretation of quantum mechanics.  This is basically regular QM minus
<br />
wave function collapse.  Everett showed that, if you look at it right,
<br />
a universe which does not have wave function collapse could actually be
<br />
said to look to its inhabitants as though it did have collapse.
<br />
This has the advantage that the universe becomes deterministic, and
<br />
there is no new information or randomness which must appear as the
<br />
universe evolves.&gt;&gt;)
<br />
<br />And Everett makes that clear in his &quot;theory of the universal wave
<br />
function&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The computation does not contain within it the actual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observations by the observers - all it contains is probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distributions for the attributes the observers see. The actual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observations are simply resolved by chance.
</em><br />
<br />There is no need for 3-chance. There is only 1-chance.
<br />
That is chance from the point of view of the computed (emulated)
<br />
observers. It looks locally as 3-chance because our computations
<br />
are (classicaly) entangled.
<br />
It is the same chance that the one occuring in the self-duplication 
<br />
experiment.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is easier to discuss using the Schmidhuber Plenitude, which i
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ascribe to as a great idea. Unfortunately, the Schmidhuber Plentiude
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does not imply COMP (If it does, I'd be interested to see the proof!)
</em><br />
<br />You force me to reread Schmidhuber! OK, I can assure you:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMP = Schmidhuber Plenitude.
<br />
<br />Schimudhuber Plenitude *per se* is what I called once UD*. That is
<br />
the complete running of the UD. 
<br />
COMP say that my actual state belongs to UD*. If that whas not the
<br />
case in Schimudhuber Plenitude, it would hardly be a candidate for a
<br />
theory of everything.
<br />
<br />So Schmidhuber and me have exactly the same postulates.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately Schmidhuber seems not to be aware of the distinction 
<br />
between first and third person/machine's point of view. 
<br />
So he missed the computationalist indeterminisme, the white rabbit, 
<br />
the random oracle phenomenology, the continuum phenomenology, 
<br />
the uncomputability feature of the apparent universe, the
<br />
non existence of any substancial universe, etc.
<br />
<br />Schmidhuber believes in a naive mind/body relation which
<br />
makes him believe that observer can be attached to their 
<br />
computable universe. If that was the case the universal prior
<br />
would probably be enough to &quot;explain the white rabbit away&quot;. 
<br />
But all my reasoning shows such attachement cannot 
<br />
exist.
<br />
Schmidhuber believes classical problems of philosophy go away.
<br />
I believe comp gives just a way to *formulate* them.
<br />
<br />But there is no doubt we believe in the same comp hyp. His
<br />
invocation of the compiler theorem witnesses his belief in Church
<br />
thesis and in arithmetical realism.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If your &quot;digital&quot; copy passes the Turing test, I will not know whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it is a zombie or not.
</em><br />
<br />Honestly I am not sure I care about what you *know* or pretend 
<br />
to know, I'm afraid.
<br />
The real question is the following. Suppose for the sake of the
<br />
argument than your daughter falls in love with my &quot;digital&quot; copy.
<br />
And suppose that *in all apparences&quot; my &quot;digital&quot; copy *seems* in 
<br />
love with your daughter.
<br />
Would you agree with my &quot;digital&quot; copy getting married with 
<br />
your daughter?
<br />
<br />BTW how do you know *I* am not a zombie?
<br />
In these matter we can only bet, isn't it? (with comp this is
<br />
a theorem).
<br />
<br />Best Regards
<br />
Bruno
