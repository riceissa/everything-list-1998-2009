Hi Charles
<br />
<br />Sorry, I am not responsible for these statements. I was only quoting
<br />
Bruno Marchal's post or 09/19. However, I agree with Bruno very much. It
<br />
seems that as in mathematics, any (religious) belief anchored by a rigid
<br />
credo (set of axioms) is bound to be either incomplete or inconsistent.
<br />
The fanatic insists that his position is both complete and consistent.
<br />
The agnostic accepts the incompleteness of his belief. In fact the
<br />
agnostic accepts that his current belief is only temporary and may
<br />
evolve depending on new information.

<br /><br />I am fascinated by antiterrorism methods that expose the inconsistency
<br />
of terrorists. The problem is that that no matter what rational argument
<br />
you could come up with, they will find a way to &quot;rationalize&quot; their
<br />
position. It may be that the root of the problem is emotional and no
<br />
amount of rational argument will work. It's like being faced with a
<br />
tiger and trying to explain to the tiger that eating you will generate
<br />
inconsistency in his set of belief. Unfortunately, it may be that the
<br />
only way to show the inconsistency of their terrorist to the terrorists
<br />
is by means of the ultimate argument: force.
<br />
<br />While battling terrorism by using consistency methods may not be
<br />
applicable directly to the terrorists themselves, they may help win the
<br />
heart and mind of those who are sitting on the fence.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Richard Dawkins strikes me as a &quot;militant&quot; or indeed a &quot;religious&quot; atheist, for example.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
I don't know enough about Richard Dawkins personal beliefs except for
<br />
his generalization of the principle of evolution. Brought to its
<br />
ultimate generalization I believe that this principle can bring the
<br />
physical world, life and consciousness out of the plenitude. Creation is
<br />
converted from creatio ex-nihilo to creatio ex-toto. In other words God
<br />
did not have to do anything. Creatio ex-toto just happened. In my
<br />
opinion, this does not diminish God in any way. Au contraire! He created
<br />
the world by doing nothing! Talk about power and magic! Even if we show
<br />
creatio ex-toto, the question of God doesn't go away. It only makes God
<br />
greater. The question of God is just moved to a meta level.
<br />
<br />In summary, I think that someone can believe in evolution, can believe
<br />
that God did &quot;nothing&quot; and yet be intensely mystical and believe in a
<br />
higher God.
<br />
