<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; say that a person at a particular instant in time can be fully

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; described by some set of data.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Not fully. I agree with Brent that you need an interpreter to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that person manifest herself in front of you. A bit like a CD, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will need a player to get the music.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that consciousness is the self-interpretion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information.  David Chalmers has a good line:  &quot;Experience is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information from the inside; physics is information from the outside.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />First person experience and third person experiment. Glad to hear  
<br />
Chalmers accept this at last.
<br />
In UDA, inside/outside are perfectly well defined in a pure third  
<br />
person way: inside (first person) = memories annihilated and  
<br />
reconstructed in classical teleportation, outside = the view outside  
<br />
the teleporter. In AUDA I use the old classical definition by Plato in  
<br />
the Theaetetus.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still don't see what an interpreter adds, except to satisfy the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuition that something is &quot;happening&quot; that &quot;produces&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.  Which I think is an attempt to reintroduce &quot;time&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't think so. The only &quot;time&quot; needed is the discrete order on the  
<br />
natural numbers. An interpreter is needed to play the role of the  
<br />
person who gives some content to the information handled through his  
<br />
local &quot;brain&quot;.   (For this I need also addition and multiplication).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I don't see any advantage of this view over the idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious states just &quot;exist&quot; as a type of platonic form (as Brent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mentioned earlier).
</em><br />
<br />The advantage is that we have the tools to derive physics in a way  
<br />
which is enough precise for testing the comp hypothesis. Physics has  
<br />
became a branch of computer's psychology or theology.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; At any given instant that I'm awake, I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious of SOMETHING.
</em><br />
<br />To predict something, the difficulty is to relate that consciousness  
<br />
to its computational histories. Physics is given by a measure of  
<br />
probability on those comp histories.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I'm conscious of it by virtue of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental state at that instant.  In the materialist view, my mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state is just the state of the particles of my brain at that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instant.
</em><br />
<br />Which cannot be maintained with the comp hyp. Your consciousness is an  
<br />
abstract type related to all computations going through your current  
<br />
state.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I say that what this really means is that my mental state is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the information represented by the particles of my brain at that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instant.  And that if you transfer that information to a computer and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; run a simulation that updates that information appropriately, my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness will continue in that computer simulation, regardless of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the hardware (digital computer, mechanical computer, massively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parallel or single processor, etc) or algorithmic details of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer simulation.
</em><br />
<br />OK. But it is a very special form of information. Consciousness is  
<br />
really the qualia associated to your belief in some reality. It is a  
<br />
bet on self-consistency: it speed up your reaction time relatively to  
<br />
your most probable histories.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, what is information?  I think it has nothing to do with physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; storage or instantiation.  I think it has an existence seperate from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that.  A platonic existence.  And since the information that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; represents my brain exists platonically, then the information for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every possible brain (including variations of my brain) should also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist platonically.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You make the same error than those who confuse a universal dovetailer  
<br />
with a counting algorithm or the babel library. The sequence:
<br />
<br />0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... , or 00 01 10 11 100 101 110 111 go through all  
<br />
description of all information, but it lacks the infinitely subtle  
<br />
redundancy contained in the space of all computations (the universal  
<br />
dovetaling). You work in N, succ, you lack addition and  
<br />
multiplication, needed for having a notion of interpreter or universal  
<br />
machine, the key entity capable of giving content to its information  
<br />
structure. This is needed to have a coherent internal interpretation  
<br />
of computerland.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Conscious experience is more the content, or the interpretation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that information, made by a person or by a universal machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If the doctor makes a copy of your brain, and then codes it into a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; string, and then put the bit string in the fridge, in our probable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; history, well in that case you will not survive, in our local  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; probable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; history.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given the platonic nature of information, this isn't really a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concern.  In Platonia, you always have a &quot;next moment&quot;.  In fact, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience all possible &quot;next moments&quot;.  The &quot;no cul-de-sac&quot; rule
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; applies I think.
</em><br />
<br />By definition, indeed, once we want to quantify the first person  
<br />
indeterminacy.
<br />
&quot;next moment&quot; makes sense only relatively to (universal) machine. It  
<br />
is the &quot;next step&quot; relatively to some computation and thus universal  
<br />
machine interpreting that &quot;machine&quot;.
<br />
The cul-de-sac/no-cul-de-sac depends on the points of view adopted by  
<br />
the machine itself.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If you say yes to a doctor for a digital brain, you will ask for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; brain which functions relatively to our probable computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; history. No?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I won't worry about it too much, as there is no doctor, only my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceptions of a doctor.  Every possible outcome of the &quot;brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; replacement operation&quot; that I can perceive, I will perceive.
</em><br />
<br />Not in the relative way. You have to explain why you see apples  
<br />
falling from a tree, and not any arbitrary information-theoretical data.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Including outcomes that don't make any sense.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You have to explain why they are *rare*. If not your theory does not  
<br />
explain why you put water on the gas and not in the fridge when you  
<br />
want a cup of coffee.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Additionally, every possible outcome of the operation that the doctor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can percieve, he will perceive.  Including outcomes that don't make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So it seems to me that a lot of your effort goes into explaining why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we don't see strange &quot;white rabbit&quot; universes.
</em><br />
<br />Indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus the talk of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilities and measures.  I'm willing to just say that all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes are experienced.
</em><br />
<br />That is absolutely true. But we don't live in the absolute (except  
<br />
perhaps with salvia :). We live in the relative worlds/states. I  
<br />
cannot go to my office by flying through the window. The probability  
<br />
that I end up in an hospital is far greater than arriving in piece to  
<br />
my job place.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Strange ones, normal ones, good ones, bad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones, ones with unbreakable physical laws, ones with no obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical laws at all.  It's all a matter of perception, not a matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of physical realization.
</em><br />
<br />That is true, but we want to explain &quot;the stable appearance of atoms  
<br />
and galaxies&quot;, and what happens when we die.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes there is a world in which you computer will transform itself into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a green flying pig. The &quot;scientific&quot;, but really everyday life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; question, is, what is the &quot;probability&quot; this will happen to &quot;me&quot; here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure what it means to ask, &quot;what is the probability that my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer will turn into a green pig&quot;.  One of me will observe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything that can be observed in the next instant.  How many things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that?  I'm not sure.  More than 10...ha!  Setting aside physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; limits, maybe infinitely many?  Given that I might also get extra
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sensory capacity in that instant, or extra cognitive capacity, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, of course all of that sounds somewhat crazy, but that's where you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; end up when you try to explain consciousness I think.  Any explanation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that doesn't involve eliminativism is going to be strange I think.
</em><br />
<br />The comp theory explains why we cannot explain consciousness, nor  
<br />
truth. But we can bet on computational states, then the thought  
<br />
experiments show that physics is derivable from computer science/ 
<br />
number theory in term of probabilities, and we can compare those  
<br />
probabilities with the one we extract from the long observation of our  
<br />
neighborhoods. Comp is a concrete testable theory, but we have to  
<br />
derive the physics from it to do so. There is a gift because it gives  
<br />
a complete arithmetical interpretation of an earlier type of theory  
<br />
like Plotinus theology, which does not eliminate the person like  
<br />
modern materialism, comp lead to a natural distinction between truth  
<br />
about us, and provable by us.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, if you are willing to say that consciousness is an illusion, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can just stick with materialism/physicalism and you're fine.
</em><br />
<br />You are right. But consciousness is the only thing I have no doubt  
<br />
about. The *only* undoubtable thing. The fixed point of the cartesian  
<br />
systematic doubting attitude. A theory which eliminate my first  
<br />
person, or my consciousness, although irrefutable by me, is wrong, I  
<br />
hope, I hope it to be wrong for you too. (Why would I send a post on  
<br />
consciousness to a zombie?)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that case there's no need to invoke any of this more esoteric stuff
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like platonism.  Right?
</em><br />
<br />Right. Materialism is a trick based on a lie (consciousness, and thus  
<br />
pain, suffering are illusions) and an illusion (there is matter). This  
<br />
is used to stop fundamental inquiry. It is not a coincidence that  
<br />
authoritative theologies insists on materialism so much. Before  
<br />
Darwinism God created the man, after Darwinism God created the matter.  
<br />
Assuming comp, couple matter-man
<br />
<br />Any content of consciousness can be an illusion. Consciousness itself  
<br />
cannot, because without consciousness there is no more illusion at all.
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
