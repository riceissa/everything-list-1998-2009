<br />Not sure what you're getting at - do you mean that, under materialism,
<br />
the mere existence (not specific activity) of physical properties
<br />
suffices to generate conscious experience? If so, I don't follow. I
<br />
assume (see below) that, under materialism, experience -&gt; psychological
<br />
activity -&gt; physical activity.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but it is still quite possible that a class of phsyical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems picked out by some computational(but ultimately physical)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of properties are conscious/cognitive in veirtue of those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proeprties -- ie computationalism is a sort of convenient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shorthand or shortcut to the physically relevant properties.
</em><br />
<br />But this is the very nub. And it may be dead wrong, so would you
<br />
address this directly? What is being claimed (in this form, a general
<br />
appeal to the class of arguments referred to by the UDA 8th step) is
<br />
that under materialism, 'computationalism' (i.e. the 1st variety in my
<br />
taxonomy) precisely *can't* 'pick out' a set of 'physically relevant
<br />
properties' in any stable way, because the physical instantiation of
<br />
any given 'computation' is essentially arbitrary, and can extend to any
<br />
number of diverse physical properties, to choice. Under materialism,
<br />
specific conscious experiences should presumably map, or reduce, to the
<br />
activity of an equivalently stable set of physical properties (in an
<br />
analogous sense to, say, specific neurological processes reducing
<br />
stably downwards through the physical substrate). And this can't be the
<br />
case if I can change the physical properties of the computational
<br />
substrate at will, from step to step of the program if necessary. So
<br />
the claim is that, under materialism, some other schema than
<br />
computationalism must ultimately be deployed to explain any stable
<br />
*general* mapping from consciousness to physics. I agree that this is a
<br />
bold claim, but it does appear to stem from a basic dislocation in the
<br />
supervention scheme consciousness -&gt; computation -&gt; physicalism. Its
<br />
consequence is that if we wish to claim that consciousness does in fact
<br />
supervene stably on computation, as opposed to the physical itself,
<br />
then such computation must itself be defined in a manner unconstrained
<br />
to specific *physical* properties. This is a reductio devised to show
<br />
the consequences of the starting assumptions. You pays your money.....
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The point is that computationalists can continue to believe in matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so long as they don't believe in numbers.
</em><br />
<br />But if I'm right, they can't also believe that 'computation' - which is
<br />
only arbitrarily constrained physically - is an adequate explanatory
<br />
schema for consciousness. It's just a metaphor, and metaphors per se
<br />
(as opposed to their instantiations) aren't 'real in the sense that I
<br />
am real'.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well, if he is, so what? If we allow him this, what then follows -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; isn't this more interesting?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; He claims that computationalism is incompatible with

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; materialism. That is not modest (or correct AFAICS)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think the 'modesty' part is meant more to relate to provability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; vs.believability, per Goedel/Lob - that we must live with doubt (i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; empiricism is ineliminable). As to computationalism, there seems to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; some confusion on the list (and elsewhere) between (at least) two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; varieties.At least four!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The first might I suppose be characterised as minimalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; comp, dealing with programs as instantiated in (as one might say) real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; - i.e. material - computers. Clearly it would make no sense to say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this kind of computationalism is incompatible with materialism - i.e
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that physical processes can 'compute'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So how does he get &quot;computationalism is incompatible with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; materialism&quot; out of such interviews?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;From the 8th step of the UDA argument. This attempts to show that if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one (but not you, I think?) starts with the much stronger assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that *consciousness supervenes on computation itself*,What is a &quot;computation itself&quot;? A process? And algorithm?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then it can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; also supervene on the physical.Using supplementary assumptions -- such as &quot;only activity counts&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; AFAICS, this stems fundamentally from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the inability to stabilise the instantiation of a computation, given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the lack of constraint on the material substrates that can be construed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as implementing equivalent computations. Given materialism, in other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; words, 'computation' is just a metaphor - it's the physics that does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the work.Yes, but it is still quite possible that a class of phsyical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems picked out by some computational(but ultimately physical)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of properties are conscious/cognitive in veirtue of those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proeprties -- ie computationalism is a sort of convenient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shorthand or shortcut to the physically relevant properties.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I have to say that I think this may really point to a fatal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; flaw in any assumption - within materialism - that consciousness can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; supervene on the physical *per computation* in the standard AI sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; However, consciousness may of course still be shown to supervene on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; some physically stabilisable material process (e.g. at the neurological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or some other consistently materially-reducible level of explanation).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Bruon's empirical prediction require a UD to exist. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; is an assumption beyond computationalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But not beyond 'comp', which is a horse of a different colour.A Trojan horse with Plato in its belly...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The UDA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; argument attempts to establish, and show the consequences of, a 'comp'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; constrained to CT, AR, and the 'modest empiricism' of 'yes doctor'. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *assumes* that putative stable conscious experiences are associated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with certain types of machine thus defined. From this stems the claim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that the consciousness of such machines can't simultaneously supervene
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on an unstabilisable externally-defined 'material' substrate - in fact,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the 'material' also has to be an emergent from the computational in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this view.You are presenting the conclusions, not the argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Comp and materialism start from radically different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; assumptions, and have diametrically opposed explanatory directions.The idea that materialism is not compatible with computationalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a bold and startling claim.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If comp is not &quot;standard&quot; computationalism, the fact that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incompatible with materalism may be a lot less impactive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp might simply beg the question.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; However, I don't think they treat the *observables* in any essential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; way as less 'real', but differ radically as to the source - and here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; its does get difficult, because one can no longer simply appeal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; directly to those observables - as Johnson failed to note in stubbing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; his toe on the stone.The Johnsonian argument can be used as a wayof establishing the meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of &quot;exist&quot;. It answers the question &quot;what definition of existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is there other than the mathematical one&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How can he come to conclusions about the uneality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of matter without assuming the reality of something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; to take its place?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well, in the end we can only believe that whatever it is must be 'real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in the sense that I am real', or where are we?The point is that computationalists can continue to believe in matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so long as they don't believe in numbers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No, it's really easy. I am real, or I would not

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; be writing this. What you mean is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; establish it by abstract argumentation is difficult.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it is. That is why empiricists prefer empiricisim.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well, as you know, I've also had some discomfort with aspects of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; platonic or other possibly implicit assumptions in this approach, but I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; think now that it's interesting and fruitful enough to suspend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; judgement on this pending further (preferably empirically refutable)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; results, without fully committing as a believer - but then that is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what is demanded. However, I acknowledge the robustness of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Johnsonian approach to refutation!

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assumptions involving numbers and their relations.Yes. But he says he isn't assuming Platonism, although he must be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  As he often
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reiterates, this is a 'modest' view, making no claim to exclusive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explanatory truth,He claims that computationalism is incompatible with

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and - dealing as it does in 'machine psychology' -

<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limiting its claims to the consequences of 'interviewing' such machines

<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and discovering their povs.So how does he get &quot;computationalism is incompatible with

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In achieving these results, AFAICS, no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claims need be made about the fundamental 'ontic realism' of numbers:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rather one is doing logic or mathematics from an axiomatic basis in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; normal way.How can he come to conclusions about the uneality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of matter without assuming the reality of something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; to take its place?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The question of which set of 'ontic prejudices' we in fact employ as we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go about our daily affairs is of course another issue.And yet antoher issue is whether the conclusions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; a valid arguiment must be contained in its premises.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It may of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eventually turn out that theoretical or, preferably empirically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disconfirmable, results derived from comp become so compelling as to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; force fundamental re-consideration of even such quotidian assumptions -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e.g. the notorious 'yes doctor' proposition.Bruon's empirical prediction require a UD to exist. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; is an assumption beyond computationalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But as Bruno is again at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pains to point out, this won't be based on 'sure knowledge'. It will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always entail some 'act of faith'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To establish what is in some ultimate sense 'real' - as opposed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knowable or communicable - is extraordinarily difficult,No, it's really easy. I am real, or I would not

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and perhaps at

<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computationalism. Rather, it's about resolving the explanatory
