<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Brent Meeker
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It wouldn't make any difference: if solipsism were true, people would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; behave exactly as they do behave,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; most of them not giving the idea that there is no external world any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consideration at all, the rest deciding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that although it is a theoretical possibility, there is no practical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; purpose served by worrying about it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Their explanation, if they have any, as to why they behave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; as they do would be peppered with &quot;as ifs&quot;. Solipisism is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; for people who prefer certainty to understanding.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; COLIN HALES:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yay!.... someone 'got' my little dialogue!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The point is that scientists are actually ALL tacit solipsists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My point was that scientists *do* prefer understanding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to certainty, and therefore are *not* solipsists. I can't think of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything I have said, or that you have said, that leads
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the conclusion that scientists ingenreal are solpsitsts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I'm still wiating for an example of an instrumetalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ornithologist...)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I disagree and can show empirical proof that we scientists only THINK we are
<br />
not being solipsistic.
<br />
<br />We ARE actually -methodologically- solipsistic because consciousness
<br />
(phenomenal consciousness itself) = [seeing itself] is not accepted as
<br />
evidence of anything. We only accept the 'contents' of phenomenal
<br />
consciousness' = [that which is seen] as scientific evidence. We think that
<br />
predicting 'seeing' will come from the act of analysing that which is
<br />
seen... this is logically fallacious. Like observing the behaviour of
<br />
monalisa within the painting and then using that behaviour to divine canvas,
<br />
paint and an artist: silly/illogical.
<br />
<br />This behaviour is 'as-if' we are solipsists - that we do not believe mind
<br />
(other minds) exist. We are being inconsistent in an extremely fundamental
<br />
way. This is a complex and subtle point - a cultural blind of enormous
<br />
implication.
<br />
<br />As for an example of an instrumentalist ornithologists? Hmmm... perhaps ask
<br />
the utilitarianist nominalist paleontologists. They may know! :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; way a solipsist can exist is to outwardly agree with the massive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; confabulation they appear to inhabit whilst inwardly maintaining the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'real truth'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It isn't a real truth. if it were, it wouldn't matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how they behave.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  There's no external reality...It's not real!...so being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; duplicitous is OK.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But to go on being a tacit solipsist affirmed by inaction: not admitting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciouness itself of actually caused by something...is equivalent to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; inward belief of Bishop Berkeley-esque magical intervention on a massive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; scale without actually realising it. The whole delusion is maintained by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; belief in an 'objective-view' that makes it seem like we're directly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; accessing an external world when we are not - it's all mediated by MIND,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What are &quot;we&quot;, if we are neither mind nor world ?
</em><br />
<br />Your words assume that mind is not part of/distinct from/intrinsically apart
<br />
from the world. This is a linguistic trap. 
<br />
<br />WE are inside a universe of stuff, WE are made of stuff with
<br />
perceptions(appearances) of stuff constructed by stuff behaviour. When WE
<br />
look as atoms WE are seeing stuff behave atomly. Other stuff in our heads
<br />
paints atoms to look like that. Does that make sense? 
<br />
<br />There is no objective view in this. Only appearances. We are NOT directly
<br />
accessing the external world. We never have and we never will.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which we deny by not admitting it to be evidence of anything.... and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; around we go.... the whole picture is self consistent and inherently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; deluded and ultimately not honest. This is the state of science.... the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; last 2 paragraphs of the latest version of my little monologue are as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; follows:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; where:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; CASE (a) world: Virtual solipsist world. In this world I accept my mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conclusive proof supporting continued fervent adherence to the belief in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; magical fabricator.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; CASE (b) world: In this world I let a real external world be responsible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for all phenomenal mirrors. Concsiousness is held as proof of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; described underlying natural world, totally compatible with normally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; traditional empirical science of appearances _within_ consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or we are just conscious OF things ,and they are NOT &quot;within&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ============================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;If I am right to be a solipsist scientist I live in the universe of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; magical fabricator, forced to play a pretend life 'as-if' there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; external world with fictitious scientific colleagues, all doing the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; thing. What is the reality of my life as a scientist telling me? I look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; around myself and what do I see universal evidence of? The world I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; actually live in is world (a). This evidence acts in support of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; solipsism. No scientist anywhere has, for any reason other than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; accidentally, ever looked at systems producing worlds with scientists in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; them complete with minds inside it, built of it. The world I actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; live
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in is the world of the 'as-if' ficticious objective view where scientist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; believe without justification that they are literally describing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; natural world, and not how it appears to them. Indeed when someone tries
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to describe an underlying world they the scientific world snaps back,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; declares the attempt irrelevant, empirically unsupportable and therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unscientific metaphysics....consistent with an implicit outward
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; methodological denial of mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But if I am wrong to be a solipsist, then the evidence paints a very odd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; picture of science. In this bizarre world, 'objective' scientists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; outwardly all act 'as-if' an external world exists yet scientists are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; actually virtual solipsists outwardly acting 'as-if' there is no such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; thing as mind whilst being totally reliant on their mind to do science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; also unaware that is the case. And, like me, being in methodological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; denial of their own mind, are tacitly affirming belief in a magical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fabricator through a cultural omission of paying due attention to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reviewing their own scientific evidence system. Scientists in this world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; will go on forever correlating appearances within their denied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mirrors and never get to do science on phenomenal mirrors. Which one to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; choose? Perhaps I'll stay where the fictitious money is... in the land
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the virtual magical fabricator...and keep quiet.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ======================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm done with yet another paper. This ..place... I have reached in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; depicting science I have reached from so many different perspectives now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it's almost mundane... So many I don't know where to submit them any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; .....each different approach results in the same basic conclusion....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; science is structurally flawed and never questions itself - there's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any science done on science - since when did we earn the right to be one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; corner of the natural world immune from scientific method? Is this a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; club
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or a professional discipline? The current state of science - complete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; failure to solve the physics of phenomenal consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why should it have a phsyics ? Is there a physics of stock markets
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Surely consicousness is a high-level phenomenon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />[A glass of water] is a high level phenomenon of [water atoms]
<br />
[consciousness] is a high level phenomenon of [what?]
<br />
<br />You can't have a high level phenomenon of a collection of &quot;something&quot;
<br />
without a &quot;something&quot;. This belief is called 'magical emergentism'. In
<br />
consciousness studies you can claim [what?] to be something seen with
<br />
consciousness. The point is that the [what?] above will not be viewable with
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
<br />That does not mean we can't be scientific about it. What it means is that
<br />
the permission to examine potential [what?] is a behaviour currently
<br />
prohibited by science because of the virtual solipsism I speak of. To speak
<br />
of the [what?] is to speak of something that creates SEEING but is not SEEN
<br />
directly. The correctly chosen [What?] will enable seeing that makes the
<br />
seen look like it does, so 'seeing' is actually viable indirect evidence. 
<br />
<br />If scientists are being virtual-solipsists by failing to accept seeing as
<br />
evidence of something then seeing will never be explained. Do you 'see' how
<br />
this blind works? Think of it like this:
<br />
<br />a) study New York traffic from Alpha-Centauri
<br />
b) devise a very predictive 'LAW OF TRAFFIC'. It seems, when you make an
<br />
observation (see) of something it travels at a certain speed. This becomes
<br />
the 'LAW OF TRAFFICS' (we know it is mediated by local traffic regulations).
<br />
This is a behaviour you can 'see' from alpha-centauri as an
<br />
alpha-centaurian.
<br />
c) Now use the LAW OF TRAFFICS as a definition/construction primitive of
<br />
cars.
<br />
<br />This does not make sense. 
<br />
<br />If CARS are what is used to see things (on alpha-centauri!) and you only
<br />
accept direct observation as scientific evidence you'll never get to explore
<br />
something that can be cars and therefore never get to explore seeing. What
<br />
you have is 'speed limits'. You'll all talk with each other as if you live
<br />
in a universe literally constructed of 'speed limits' (The LAW OF TRAFFICS)
<br />
when it's actually made of cars.
<br />
<br />Generalise it and apply it to human? Take any law of physics. The universe
<br />
is NOT made of a law of physics. It's made of something that behaves 'as-if'
<br />
it does when we LOOK at it and devise a rule to predict it. This does not
<br />
mean the universe is made of the rules we devise. None of the rules will
<br />
explain LOOKing. The logic is the same.
<br />
<br />That is what I am talking about and that is the effect of science's 'as-if'
<br />
solipsism. An underlying structure (eschewed as metaphysics) is responsible
<br />
for 'Seeing'. Despite this amazing evidence provider being actually demanded
<br />
by science to provide scientific evidence, the underlying structure is
<br />
regarded as devoid of evidence. This happens when the underlying structure
<br />
is more directly 'evidenced' by the act of acquiring scientific evidence
<br />
than whatever it is supplying as 'that which is seen'.
<br />
<br />This is yet another version of the solipsism - acting as if MIND does not
<br />
exist. I have been in and around this in so many ways.... it always comes
<br />
out the same.... 
<br />
<br />Cheers
