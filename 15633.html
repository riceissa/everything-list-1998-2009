<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Here, below, is the plan of my heroic attempt (indeed) to explain why

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think that: IF we assume that we are machine,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Never understood what people meant by &quot;a machine&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Actually I was thinking &quot;digital machine&quot; or digitalizable machine.  
<br />
Like &quot;Mechanism&quot; will always mean digital mechanism.
<br />
I will explain this later.
<br />
To define the notion of machine in general is not easy. With the usual  
<br />
physical theories most things are machine and are even digital or  
<br />
analog but still digitalizable machine.
<br />
I prefer not working with precise definitions, and instead illustrate  
<br />
the concept through the reasoning.
<br />
<br />The main idea is that a machine or a mechanism is something which is a  
<br />
finite combination of a finite number of elementary parts (or locally  
<br />
finite, it could grow) and which behavior in all circumstances can be  
<br />
explained or reduced to the predictible local behavior of the  
<br />
elementary parts). When the occurence of the elementary parts are  
<br />
many, this leads to differential equation, when not so many, it gives  
<br />
rise to difference equation or recursive processes.
<br />
<br />The very idea of &quot;explanation&quot; is often implicitly or explicitly rely  
<br />
on mechanism, or on &quot;a&quot; mechanism.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've always thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was a machine.
</em><br />
<br />This is not obvious. Is the system Earth-Moon really a machine?  
<br />
Already with the rough definition given above, we could doubt it, if  
<br />
only because the Moon-Earth system is usually described by&quot;infinite&quot;  
<br />
real variable functions. The real functions operate on the real  
<br />
numbers, the &quot;points&quot; of the line, which are infinite &quot;objects&quot;. With  
<br />
quantum mechanics the apparent real things get digital, but if you  
<br />
keep the collapse of the wave, it is hard to even describe you as  
<br />
either a physical thing still less a machine. With the many world, the  
<br />
&quot;usual&quot; mechanist explanation of the observer is preserved, except for  
<br />
the classical mechanics behind. (Albeit only logicians, to be sure,  
<br />
have provided, computable or mechanist function on the reals with non  
<br />
computable derivatives).
<br />
<br />And what about the &quot;believers&quot;? Jacques Arsac, a french computer  
<br />
scientist wrote a book beginning by &quot;I am a Catholic so I cannot  
<br />
believe in Artificial Intelligence, and its point is that we are not  
<br />
machine. Renault, the car firm, made an advertising based on the idea  
<br />
that &quot;you are not a machine&quot;.
<br />
But the real trouble with the &quot;mechanist idea&quot; is its apparent  
<br />
elimination of the subject, it explains consciousness &quot;away&quot;. Not only  
<br />
mechanism does not solve the mind body problem, but when mechanism and  
<br />
materialism are combined, as it is usually still done, you get  
<br />
nihilism. This is really my point. I was just anticipating.
<br />
<br />No need to ask question here. You will soon understand this by  
<br />
yourself with the point &quot;1)&quot; and &quot;2)&quot;. Well, we will see.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; C'est evident. Consequently it surprises me when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people question it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It would already be a success for me if you begin to doubt mechanism.  
<br />
Eventually you will perhaps (if you are patient enough) understand why  
<br />
no machine can really believe in Mechanism. The logic of mechanism  
<br />
will take us &quot;near inconsistency&quot;. It is impossible to take it for  
<br />
granted.
<br />
And things are worst than that: if we are machines, we cannot  know  
<br />
which machine we are, but we can bet (and argue that &quot;nature&quot; has  
<br />
already bet on mechanism, etc.).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm surprised even that it took until Descartes to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; achieve this enlightenment although you will probably say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Plotinus was already onto it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Plotinus and Descartes are aware that, by deciding to preserve the  
<br />
soul, or the person, or consciousness (etc.), matter become doubtful.  
<br />
&quot;malin génies&quot;  appears (Descartes), indeterminateness appears (Plato,  
<br />
Aristotle, Plotinus). Descartes has understood that it has to  
<br />
introduce a God, to preserve the consistency of mechanism. It is a  
<br />
sort of superconsistency axiom, which could easily lead to  
<br />
inconsistency. Descartes gived rise to the &quot;modern mind body problem&quot;.  
<br />
Descartes used &quot;soul&quot; instead of &quot;mind&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Presumably anything that isn't some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phantasm that defies the laws of physics - and therefore probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot exist - is going to be a machine of some sort.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have I got anywhere near it or am I not even wrong on that?
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are wrong, but don't worry, almost everybody is wrong on this, and  
<br />
this by assuming comp, and assuming, for now, that my own reasoning is  
<br />
correct, which I hope you will understand by yourself if patient enough.
<br />
I am probably also, wrong, at some level. All machine could be wrong  
<br />
on that, but we can be less and less wrong.
<br />
<br />The problem with mechanism is that it predicts that the laws of  
<br />
physics defy mechanism. White rabbits, white noise, and many unwelcome  
<br />
infinities crop everywhere and then. It is an unsolved problem in the  
<br />
precise (digital) version of mechanism I am pointing too.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why should it be news to anyone that we are machines - I've been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assuming it all along. Now you will tell me how I should be - what??
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Experiencing reality? Interpreting reality? Both?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything (appears to my conscious mind to be) an ensemble of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something else(s) including moi et toi, and it all works somehow in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; co-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operation and the universe exists - ergo we are machines - we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extrapolate from this that the universe is a gigantic Machine since we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appear to be a part of an ensemble as a machine element. Ergo the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Multiverse exists because it's all a fractal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What's the other option - that never made it into my brain?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It depends what you mean by &quot;universe&quot;, but I could interpret your  
<br />
talk favorably --- by cheating a bit on the sense of each word.
<br />
Let us say you are correct, just that if we assume the digital  
<br />
mechanist hypothesis, then such a picture will have to arise from a  
<br />
&quot;natural matrix&quot;, given by the natural numbers + addition and  
<br />
multiplication. This already constitute the &quot;gigantic machine&quot;. Have  
<br />
you see Matrix?  You should read &quot;SIMULACRON III&quot;.
<br />
The fractalness is everywhere, which makes hard to say &quot;we belong here  
<br />
or there&quot;, we ourselves are everywhere, including in dreams included  
<br />
in dreams included in dreams etc. The big whole could be a gigantic  
<br />
Machine, indeed a universal dovetailer, but then a notion of first  
<br />
person or subjective Big Whole will appear, and that big whole will  
<br />
not be capable to be seen as a machine, from inside.
<br />
Other funny things like that will appear too. Some capable of making  
<br />
the mechanist hypothesis testable (by white rabbits counting).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Genial!! - allons-y
</em><br />
<br />Slowly but surely. &quot;1)&quot; asap. &quot;1)&quot; is the point that if you are a  
<br />
machine *you* are already immaterial. (The immateriality will then be  
<br />
somehow contagious on ... everything).
