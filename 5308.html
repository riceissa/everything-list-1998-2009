<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe a different example will make my point clearer. We could be living

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in base reality or a simulation. You can choose a measure in which the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moments like us living in base reality have a greater measure, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one in which the observer-moments living in simulations have a greater
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure. These two measures have different implications on rational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behavior. The former implies we should plan for the far future, whereas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the latter says we should live for today because the simulation might end
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at any moment, and we should try to behave in ways that wouldn't bore the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people who might be running and observing the simulation. (See Robin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hanson's &quot;How To Live In A Simulation&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/lifeinsim.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/lifeinsim.html</a>).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can you offer any arguments that one of these choices is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irrational?
</em><br />
<br />What about arguments that attempt to estimate the fraction of observers
<br />
who are in simulations versus in base realities, such as Nick Bostrom's
<br />
Simulation Argument, www.simulation-argument.com?
<br />
<br />Are you saying that such arguments are pointless, and that no matter
<br />
how convincing they became, both choices would be equally rational?
<br />
What is the difference between these kinds of arguments, and those
<br />
based on observation?
<br />
<br />Or would you say that it is rational to reject observations?  After all,
<br />
among the infinity of universal distributions there are enough to justify
<br />
rejecting any specific observation as a &quot;flying rabbit&quot;, a special case
<br />
exception which is built into the UTM that defines the distribution.
<br />
There exist universal distributions which can accommodate any such
<br />
exceptions.
<br />
<br />Doesn't this philosophy ultimately reject all evidence, and further,
<br />
make it impossible to make predictions? There is a universal measure
<br />
which is consistent with my past observations and yet lets me conclude
<br />
that the sun won't rise tomorrow.  Is it just a matter of taste and not
<br />
rationality that determines my beliefs on this matter?
<br />
<br />If my understanding of these questions is correct, we have to find
<br />
a stronger set of rules and constraints on rationality, for the term
<br />
to have a useful meaning.  Maybe we don't have them yet, but it isn't
<br />
acceptable to call such a wide range of behaviors rational.
