</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; There is a widespread confusion between two kind of idealism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1) There is solipsism, sometimes called &quot;subjective idealism&quot;. It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (as James Higgo said) the doctrine that I am dreaming, that I am the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; builder of reality, and all other people are just zombie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is a ridiculous doctrine, although it can be used to illustrate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some philophical point, like the concept of zombie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is a ridiculous doctrine, because a doctrine is something you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; communicate, and why should someone try to communicate things to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; zombie. So solipsisme (like some strong form of positivism) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; self-defeating.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't agree that this is a ridiculous doctrine, or that a believer in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;solipsism should not communicate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A solipsist may communicate with others, even if he believes they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not conscious, in order to get information and ideas.  In his model of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the world, certain information comes to him only through interaction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with the outside.  If he is to work out his ideas in fullness, he can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;best do so by interacting with the outside world.  This may involve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bouncing ideas off of other people, and even trying to persuade them,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in order to test the quality of his ideas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is like a believer in more conventional philosophies who finds it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;useful to write his ideas down on paper (or on a computer), in order to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;clarify them and look for problems and new approaches.  He doesn't think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the paper or computer is conscious, but this method of interacting with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the outside world can still be productive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The real problem with solipsism, IMO, is that it fails to predict or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explain why the world is the way it is.  Fine, I'm dreaming.  Why?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why am I dreaming that I live in a lawful universe?  And why do I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dreams within the dream, and those dreams are not of a lawful universe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;None of this is explained.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Contrast this with other approaches to philosophy, such as the all-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes models we have been discussing.  These approaches have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;potential to truly explain why the universe is lawful, and why we see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;things in roughly the way they are.  It might even turn out that our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very universe is, by some measures, the most probable one to exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We don't know for sure that things will work out this way, but at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;least the potential is there.  This makes it a very productive avenue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to explore.  It is hard to see how solipsism could begin to provide this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;kind of explanation.
</em><br />
<br />I agree. Although I would not call something a &quot;communication&quot; if
<br />
it is not intended to someone. But that is a question
<br />
of mere definition. I also believe that solipsism has weak power
<br />
of explanation.
<br />
<br />When you say:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Contrast this with other approaches to philosophy, such as the all-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes models we have been discussing.  These approaches have the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;things in roughly the way they are.  It might even turn out that our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very universe is, by some measures, the most probable one to exist.
</em><br />
<br />I agree a lot. Of course I belief more in a all computations (or number
<br />
theoretical truth ...) doctrine. I'm not sure that an expression like 
<br />
&quot;our 
<br />
universe&quot; will not lead to some form of cosmo-solipsism (the doctrine that
<br />
other universe cannot exist).

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I totally agree with Hal here.  I don't believe it's a ridiculous doctrine 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;either, for exactly the reasons pointed out above.
</em><br />
<br />If you believe the 'single moment' is yours, and that I'm not conscious,
<br />
then I think the original Russel's fear was founded.
<br />
<br />Sorry, but I don't feel like I am a zombie.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My answer to you is that it is simpler for the laws of physics to directly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;control what you &quot;dream&quot; about than for the laws of physics to control a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe, which feeds you inputs, which forms what you dream about.  Things 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are always simpler without a 3rd party intermediary.  So, conventional 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;science is definitely a productive anvenue to explore, because it explains 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the laws of our &quot;dream&quot;.  As for MWI, I am not a true solipsist because I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe that all possible dreams exist in the plentitude.  For this reason, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;everyone I know is a zombie in my dream, but in all of reality, they are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not, because the dream that would correspond to their reality does exist, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even though it does not interact with mine.
</em><br />
<br />OK. Then again you are very near the doctrine I derived for comp.
<br />
The nice thing with comp is that it gives logical reason why the dreams
<br />
does interact or interfere.  
<br />
The phenomenology of physical modalities comes from
<br />
these interactions. The physical is what makes the dreams sharable.
