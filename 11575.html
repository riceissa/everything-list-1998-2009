</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of information between them. If you look at how t1 and t2 are generated, then yes, there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connection - they both come out of your head - but once generated, they form a natural sequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which cannot be disrupted.
</em><br />
<br />But my point about the 'coherence' of consciousness is that it seems
<br />
(especially from what occurs, or fails to occur, when it deteriorates)
<br />
that complex representation and processing of *temporally extended*
<br />
information sequences (e.g. grasp of the entirety of the content and
<br />
meaning of a sentence or proposition) is necessary for one to
<br />
experience and act as a fully-functioning conscious individual.
<br />
Consequently, it seems to me that such processes must converge on OMs
<br />
in which all the necessary information is fully encoded and expressed
<br />
(which is essentially what Barbour seems to be claiming for his 'time
<br />
capsules' - e.g. his 'flight of the kingfisher' example). Without this,
<br />
the alternative seems to be that the individual random, wind-blown
<br />
seconds of your metaphor would need to be totalised in some additional
<br />
non-information-based manner in order to coordinate an ensemble of
<br />
informationally incomplete, discrete elements into coherent
<br />
experiences. AFAICS they only 'form a natural sequence' from the
<br />
quasi-objective perspective of our philosophical stance. And such
<br />
coordination is in any case what we were assuring Peter was both
<br />
unnecessary and impossible.
<br />
<br />The 'snapshot with memory' view of things is surely only viable if each
<br />
snapshot can be shown to be fully efficacious in reconstituting what we
<br />
do in fact experience - and this, short of magic, surely requires the
<br />
discrete presence within each snapshot of all the necessary process and
<br />
information. It seems to me that this might be a productive slant on
<br />
what work the brain might actually be doing in constructing the sort of
<br />
spatio-temporally dimensioned experiences we encounter. IOW, it isn't
<br />
just 'recording and replaying', but creating and continually updating a
<br />
coherent informational construct, centred on an embedded 'I', that
<br />
reads-out 'self-referentially' as a 4D world. Any given OM would
<br />
represent the state-of-update of this construct, with consequent full
<br />
access to its resources at that particular state-of-update.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; (b) can't be right. However many copies of you there are, you only experience being one at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; a time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Stathis, I concur with this view, and for the reasons you give.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; However, much as I hate to complicate this issue further, I wonder if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you have a view on the following. I mentioned to Peter the issue of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; destructive effect of loss of short-term memory on the coherence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'normal' conscious processes - e.g. forgetting the beginning of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sentence before getting to the end of it - an affliction to which I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not entirely a stranger myself! From this, it seems to me that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; notion of a 'state of consciousness' as being discrete with an OM, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'time-capsule', might be overly simplistic, unless we conceive of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; necessary extent of memory as being entirely encoded in, and accessible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to, an individual OM - i.e. an OM can represent a 'fully-conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; individual'. For that matter, what temporal duration is an OM supposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to encompass - a 'Planck-length' instant; the entire 'specious present?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This whole issue seems to be under-defined, but the danger is that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; very notion of 'the present' might need to be treated as an emergent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from a coordinated ensemble, rather than being inherent in individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; OMs. But then what would coordinate them?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Any thoughts?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's certainly possible to have a very fragmented stream of consciousness. While
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fortunately rare these days, the most extreme forms of disorganised schizophrenia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are from the patient's point of view something like having random, disconnected thoughts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and perceptions without even a sense that they belong to a single enduring individual to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bind them together.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think of an OM as the shortest possible period of conscious experience, which would make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its apparent duration many milliseconds. Much of the discussion in which the term OM is used
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could as easily (and less ambiguously) use observer-second or observer-minute without loss
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the general point. Of course, hours of real time physical activity might have to occur for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each subjective moment of consciousness, and those hours may be divided up into infinitesimals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a block universe, or whatever the underlying physics dictates. The OM concept has analogies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with block universe models, but it is philosophically useful regardless of what the actual nature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of time is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for memory being encoded in or accessible to an OM, that is an unnecessary complication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As you said previously, the OM's are related solely by their information content. If the seconds
