Brent: 'But they lasted a lot longer than we have.'
<br />
<br />MP: Indeed this is probably true in most cases, but what none of them 
<br />
had, which we DO have access to, is scientific method. Now I know Bruno 
<br />
is dismissive of scientific method as applied in the modern world, but I 
<br />
think Bruno is being idealistic. The fact is that we live in an ecology 
<br />
made of dirt. I mean, what is good soil if not bug pooh! And we live in 
<br />
a real world in which entropy is king, so to speak.
<br />
<br />You are right that modern American culture seems irretrievably, and 
<br />
perhaps fatally, dependent on burning oil in car engines. Well that may 
<br />
just be the doom of the USA. It does not have to be the doom of the rest 
<br />
of humankind!
<br />
<br />In fact, if 'Americans' were really smart they would realise that not 
<br />
only do they have one of the most well watered continents, supplied with 
<br />
very fertile soils [compared to Australia anyway], and abundantly 
<br />
supplied with useful minerals accessible to safe and sensible mining, 
<br />
endowed with beautiful landscapes, beaches, snow fields, lakes, 
<br />
wonderfully diverse flora and fauna. Not only ALL THAT which so many 
<br />
USA-ns either ignore in mind boggling ignorance or just take for granted 
<br />
in a media mesmerised torpor but, under Yellowstone National Park [or is 
<br />
that 'Jellystone'] there is a vast reservoir of heat energy which needs 
<br />
to be tapped or else one day it's going to blow and spread deep ash from 
<br />
Harlem to Hollywood.
<br />
<br />The caveat will be DO NOT BREACH THE TOP OF IT!  The trick to successful 
<br />
usage will be to sink water-filled shafts down many kilometres in the 
<br />
cooler rock around the perimeter of the hot spot and then tunnel and 
<br />
drill horizontally into the hot mass so as to gradually liberate the 
<br />
heat energy and gas pressure. Remote control mining underwater should 
<br />
not be hard to master for the spiritual descendants of Edison, Bell, 
<br />
Ford, and so forth.
<br />
<br />When I contemplate things like that I find myself boggled by the amazing 
<br />
stupidity of the so-called 'free market' ideologues who cannot 
<br />
understand how come cooperation is billions of times more powerful than 
<br />
the puny efforts of the so-called captains of industry who advocate  
<br />
scientifically discredited concepts of social Darwinism in order to 
<br />
maintain a dysfunctional, unfair, inefficient and life-threatening 
<br />
status quo.
<br />
<br />[Amen! Amen! In the Name of Capital, Money, and Market, Amen!     Hail 
<br />
Banks! Mothers of Money, Blessed art Thou amongst Companies!]
<br />
<br />Hmm think of it ... Father Capital, Dollar Bill the Son, and the Unseen 
<br />
Hand of Market, the Comforter who is always with us and is never wrong 
<br />
... :-)
<br />
<br />But really, my point is that in this modern era we finally have the 
<br />
intellectual tools we need to liberate the human race from slavery. Only 
<br />
some of it is 'rocket science', the rest is common sense and hard work, 
<br />
coupled with the realisation that a person who is truly smart and truly 
<br />
strong, is also truly kind. Why? Because his/her cup runs over, and 
<br />
there is nothing nobler than to help those in need who share our world 
<br />
during our transient passing through.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; My point is that, with all due respect to the late Douglas Adams, and I

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; suppose to whoever it was who wrote the book of Daniel in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Judaeo-Xian Bible, the TRUE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;Writing on the Wall&quot; AKA God's last message to humankind, is five short 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; words in plain-English:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     * Shape up or die out!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What I say is if we really want to 'shape up' and survive, then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; compassion, democracy, ethics and scientific method are four essential 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ingredients without which our modern world will go the way of all those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; other civilisations your mentioned. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It will go the way of those other civilizations anyway because: a) it's dependent on energy from cheap oil and b) all civilizations rise and fall, none last forever.
