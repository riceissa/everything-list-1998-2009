<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formulations.

<br />As I hope I had made clear in some of my earlier posts on this, mostly 
<br />
this past summer, I'm not making any grandiose claims for category 
<br />
theory and topos theory as being the sine qua non for understanding the 
<br />
nature of reality. Rather, they are things I heard about a decade or so 
<br />
ago and didn't look into at the time; now that I have, I am finding 
<br />
them fascinating. Some engineering/programming efforts already make 
<br />
good use of the notions [see next paragraph] and some quantum 
<br />
cosmologists believe topos theory is the best framework for &quot;partial 
<br />
truths.&quot;
<br />
<br />The lambda calculus is identical in form to cartesian closed 
<br />
categories, program refinement forms a Heyting lattice and algebra, 
<br />
much work on the fundamentals of computation by Dana Scott, Solovay, 
<br />
Martin Hyland, and others is centered around this area, etc.
<br />
<br />As is so often the case, the mathematical physicist John Baez has done 
<br />
a fine job of introducing the subject to physicists and providing some 
<br />
motivation. Here's one of his articles:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/topos.html">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/topos.html</a>
<br />
<br />As for the mix of concrete and abstract, I studied plenty of abstract 
<br />
stuff on set theory, topology, analysis, and of course in physics. But 
<br />
I also did a lot of applied physics and engineering during my career at 
<br />
Intel. Believe me, I would have been in deep trouble had I proposed 
<br />
that we look into applications of Tychonoff's Theorem when we having 
<br />
problems with our dynamic RAMs and CCDs losing occasional stored bits 
<br />
in what were called &quot;soft errors.&quot;
<br />
<br />But knowing a lot of abstractions helped me in countless ways. And now 
<br />
that I am free to pursue what I wish (have been since 1986), studying 
<br />
math that has some points of contact with ontology, physics, even AI, 
<br />
is what I am enjoying. I should be receiving Peter Johnstone's massive 
<br />
2-volume set, &quot;Sketches of an Elephant: A Topos Theory Compendium,&quot; in 
<br />
the next few days.
<br />
<br />And ya gotta crawl before ya can walk. I'm only recently gaining a good 
<br />
appreciation of S4, the logic system closely related to time and 
<br />
causality. Had I not learned S4 vs. S5, more computability theory than 
<br />
I used to know, a lot of stuff about lattices, quantum logic, and 
<br />
category theory, I surely would not be able to make sense of _any_ of 
<br />
what Bruno talks about!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact, perhaps this is a key problem with computers.   Most human 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whom I know have enormous difficulty in finding a Golden Mean between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstraction and concreteness insofar as the concrete reality and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality are concerned if you get my meanings.   The problem is only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slightly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less prevalent in academia.   Computers seem to be nowhere near 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solving this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem - in fact, the more similar to human beings they get, the more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficult it may be for them to solve the problem.   I am not even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most human beings in or out of academia think that there should be a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Golden
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mean between abstraction and concreteness [exclamation mark - several 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; keys are out including that one].
</em><br />
<br />I have experience in both of the areas you talk about. Now I'm not 
<br />
saying this is why you should believe what I write, but at least my 
<br />
background spans both the *applied* (in college, working in a Josephson 
<br />
junction lab on superconductivity, and at Intel, working on microchips, 
<br />
and with some startup companies I've been working with for the past 
<br />
decade or so) and the *theoretical*  (math, physics, computer science, 
<br />
logic, topos theory, etc.).
<br />
<br />Few things thrill me more than taking something which seems to be as 
<br />
abstract as unworldly as anything imaginable and applying it in the 
<br />
real world.
