<br />Since my name has popped up I'll stop lurking and come clean!  I've
<br />
been thinking about this again since reading Galen Strawson's recent
<br />
defence of 'panpsychism' in &quot;Consciousness and its place in Nature&quot;.
<br />
His view is that any 'emergent' phenomenon must supervene on
<br />
fundamental properties of the same type - e.g. 'liquidity' is a
<br />
characteristic behaviour of a fluid that simply supervenes on the
<br />
objective characteristics of its constituent molecules, which in turn
<br />
supervenes on quantum-level phenomena and so on down to superstrings
<br />
or whatever.  But there is no analogous narrative in which it is
<br />
correspondingly obvious that 1st-person *experience* should ever
<br />
'emerge' from any objective or 3rd-person description, in his view.
<br />
<br />Also in mine.  Reviewing some of my earlier posts on this subject, I
<br />
would now say that my view is that our 1st-person experience is
<br />
privileged direct evidence (i.e. the *only* direct evidence we have)
<br />
that we, and all phenomena of which we are aware, emerge through
<br />
differentiation of a subjective existential field. Such
<br />
differentiation may be termed 'sense-action', because it is
<br />
simultaneously the self-sensing relationships of (what Strawson terms)
<br />
'ultimates' (e.g. vibrational strings) that emerge through
<br />
differentiation, and the source of all action and structure.  We
<br />
abstract our notion of 'physical law' from the inter-relations of such
<br />
ultimates, but it is crucial that we do not concretise such 'law' as
<br />
some real superadded influence introjected from 'outside' the
<br />
existential field.  Rather, we take the field for what it is, and
<br />
accept that it feels and does as we find it.  This is simply wielding
<br />
Occam's razor with precision to prevent an infinite regress of
<br />
'explanation'. Ultimately, to preserve the appearances, existence must
<br />
necessarily be self-actualising , self-motivating, and self-sensing.
<br />
<br />By rooting sense-action in the ultimates, we can now embed our own
<br />
intuitive sensing and motivation firmly where it needs to be in
<br />
ultimate reality.  Fundamentally, we do what we do for (something
<br />
like) the reasons we believe, and we feel what we feel because that is
<br />
(something like) how reality ultimately feels about it.  Our actions
<br />
emerge from ultimate action, and our sensing emerges from ultimate
<br />
sensing.  This is crucial for questions of 'free will' and suffering
<br />
(which I do not put in scare quotes).  Our 'will' is a complex
<br />
emergent of ultimate will-to-action, and our painful experiences are
<br />
directly inherited from underlying layers of sense-action that
<br />
simultaneously motivate our consequential actions.
<br />
<br />By contrast, the 'non-conscious' zombie is existentially and causally
<br />
disconnected - as postulated, it is abstracted from sense-action; it
<br />
cannot see, hear, or feel and hence cannot enact (except in *our*
<br />
imagination).  No self-sensing = no relationship = no action.  The
<br />
poor creature is a free-standing 'physical abstraction' - the
<br />
uninhabited husk of a self-actualised subject.  It's the notion you're
<br />
left with when you posit an 'externalised world' (i.e. a model) in
<br />
pure intellectual abstraction from concrete self-actualisation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; With comp neither matter nor mind can be taken as primitive or primary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality.
</em><br />
<br />My approach proposes something like a fundamental subjective field as
<br />
'primitive' (in an Occamish way).  Such a field is not yet mind nor
<br />
matter, but both 'mind' and 'matter' emerge from it through
<br />
differentiation, with characteristics that supervene naturally on
<br />
those proposed as primitive.  That is: its fundamental action is self-
<br />
motivated and self-sensing, and consequently all complex emergents are
<br />
experienced as self-motivated and self-sensing. If valid, this
<br />
approach is a knock-down argument against the equation of
<br />
consciousness with computation.  The reason is that computational
<br />
'causation' depends on the introjection of 'rules' from a context
<br />
external to the computed 'world', and hence loses contact both with
<br />
intrinsic causal self-motivation and the fundamental linkage of felt-
<br />
sense and action.  Hence any felt-sense a computer may possess as a
<br />
concrete object must necessarily be independent of whatever purely
<br />
programmed 'actions' it may be instantiating. Also, the notion of,
<br />
say, a rock implementing any computation, and hence potentially any
<br />
attached consciousness, is likewise struck down by the lack of
<br />
coordination between ultimate sense-action and the notional
<br />
computational content.
<br />
<br />I've written the above fairly quickly and it's probably not very well
<br />
expressed, but if anyone's interested I'd be happy to debate and
<br />
enlarge.  But it expresses why I think Torgny's position is absolutely
<br />
untenable.  If he were 'unconscious' as he claims he would be a
<br />
zombie, and hence, abstracted from the reality of sense-action, he
<br />
would exist only in our imaginations.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; While I would point out that physics cannot possibly explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; everything, being a necessarily constrained subjective model of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;reality&quot;, I would like to reinforce the point about &quot;consciousness.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Consciousness certainly exists, as a description relating a set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observations having to do with subjective awareness, but there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; nothing requiring that we assign it the status of an ontological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; entity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The importance of being precise! Now I agree with you, although I did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disagree with your answer to Torgny.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW distinguishing subjective awareness  and consciousness is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1004-fallacy ... at this stage.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, to say that consciousness exists as a description could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misleading. It could exist as a phenomenon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't believe that people in this list would take consciousness as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primary reality, except perhaps those who singles out the third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;universal soul&quot; hypostasis (the first person, alias the one described

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by Bp &amp; p in the lobian interview) like George Levy, David, etc.
