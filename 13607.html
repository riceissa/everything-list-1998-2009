<br />I'd be happy with that sign, if you substituted a phrase like 'way of
<br />
being' for 'magic'. There is no analogy between the two cases, because
<br />
Russell seeks to pull the entire 1-person rabbit, complete with 'way
<br />
of being', out of a hat that contains only 3-person formalisations.
<br />
This is magic with a vengeance.  The ding an sich (and, although I mis-
<br />
attributed monads to him, Kant knew a 'thing' or two) is what we all
<br />
participate in, whether you intuit it or not.  And my hat and my
<br />
rabbit, whether 0, 1, or 3-person versions, are participatory all the
<br />
way down.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So a hydrogen atom has a 1st-person world view, but this is more than it's        &gt; physical interactions (which are merely part of it's formal description)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe so - but my intuition doesn't tell me anything about it.
</em><br />
<br />Clearly not.  But your sometime way with (dis)analogy leads me to
<br />
mistrust your intuition in this case. Firstly, we're dealing with a
<br />
*reductive* account, so '1-person world view' in the case of a 'de-
<br />
formalised' hydrogen atom must be 'reduced' correspondingly.  Such a
<br />
beastie neither sees nor hears, neither does it dream nor plan.  But
<br />
then, it's 'formalised' counterpart isn't 'wet' either.  But the
<br />
*behaviour* of such counterparts is standardly attested as a 'reduced'
<br />
component of 3-person accounts of the 'emergence' of 'liquidity'.
<br />
<br />Analogously (and this really *is* analogous) the de-formalised
<br />
participant ('DFP') referenced by 'hydrogen atom' is a 'reduced'
<br />
component of a participative account of the emergence Russell's 1-
<br />
person world.  But it's merely daft to suppose that its 'way of being'
<br />
entails a 1-person 'mini sensorium', because it manifestly lacks any
<br />
'machinery' to render this.  Its humble role is to be a *component* in
<br />
*just* that 'machinery' that renders *Russell's* 1-person world.
<br />
<br />DFPs aren't just the 'medium' of 1-person accounts, but that of *all*
<br />
accounts: 0, 1, or 3-person.  All accounts are 'DFP-
<br />
instantiated' (whatever else?).  The one you're presently viewing is
<br />
instantiated in the medium of DFPs variously corresponding to
<br />
'brains', 'computers', 'networks' etc.  A 3-person account is just a
<br />
'formal take' on 'DFP reality'; a 1-person account is a 'personal
<br />
take'; and a 0-person account is a 'de-personalised take'.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (Other than sensing being a particular subclass of interaction)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Please, spare me the physico-mathematical imperialism!  You say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;interaction is in terms of fields'&quot;.  I think what you might claim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; more modestly is something like &quot;there is a mathematical formalism in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which interaction is modelled in terms of 'fields'&quot;.  Fair enough. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; implicitly the formalism is a projection from (and reference to) a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *participatory* actuality which isn't simply 'mathematical' (pace
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Bruno - and anyway, not in the sense he deploys it for the purposes of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; COMP).  And I'm not of course imputing 'sensing' to the formalism, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to the 'de-formalised participants' from which it is projected.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'Participatory' here means that you must situate yourself at the point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of reference of your formalism, and intuit that 'thou-art-that' from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which the projection originates.  If you do this, does the term
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'sensing' still seem so 'soft'?  The formalisms are projections from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the participatory semantics of a 'modulated continuum' that embraces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you, me and everything we know.  When you situate yourself here, do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you really not 'get' the intuitive self-relation between continuum and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; modulation? Even when you know that Russell's 1-person world - an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'emergent' from this - indeed self-relates in both sense and action?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If not, then as Colin is arguing, you'd have to erect a sign with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'then magic happens' between 'emergent' and 'reductive' accounts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sounds like the sign is already up and it reads, &quot;Participatorily intuit the magic of the de-formalized ding an sich.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Sensing to me implies some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; form of agency at one end of the interaction. I don't attribute any sort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; of agency to the interaction between two hydrogen atoms making up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; a hydrogen molecule for instance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Same illustration. 'Hydrogen atoms' are again just projective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; formalisms to which of course nobody would impute 'agency'.  But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; situate yourself where I suggest, and intuit the actions of any 'de-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; formalised participants' referenced by the term 'hydrogen atoms' that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are implicated in Russell's 1-person world.  From this perspective,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any 'agency' that Russell displays is indeed inherent in such lower-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; level 'entities' in 'reduced' form.  This is a perfectly standard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; aspect of any 'reductive-emergent' scheme.  For some reason you seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; prepared to grant it in a 3-person account, but not in a participatory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The customary 'liquidity' and 'life' counter-arguments are simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; misconceived here, because these attributions emerge from, and hence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are applicable to, formal descriptions, independent of their 'de-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; formalised' participatory referents.  But you can't apply the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; semantics of 'sensing' and 'agency' in the same way, because these are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ineluctably participatory, and are coherent only when intuited as such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'all the way down' (e.g. as attributes of 1-person worlds and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; participatory 'sense-action' hierarchies on which they supervene).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So a hydrogen atom has a 1st-person world view, but this is more than it's physical interactions (which are merely part of it's formal description)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe so - but my intuition doesn't tell me anything about it.
