<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   I think the main point of disagreement between the two camps now is

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;                                                                 &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My understanding of the &quot;Strong&quot; Self Sampling Assumption is shaky, but I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think I agree with the above statement. I would find it clearer if it could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be rephrased as follows: If the number of branching in the MW is absolute 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then there is no justification for QS.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is the crux of the matter.
</em><br />
<br />I have quite the same feeling, although I would say it is my understanding
<br />
of the &quot;absolute&quot; strong SSA which is shaky.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jaques Mallah's position is summarized in his words:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&lt;&lt; Your total measure would be reduced, so there would be less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers with that name in the ensemble, and the total number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers would be less. &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Clearly Jacques views the number of branches in the MW as absolute  and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;limited. If you do QS and trim a few branches you just end up with less 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;branches. The more stringent the QS conditions (winning a $1million or a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;$1billion or having Elvis Presley come back to life) the smaller the number 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of branches you end up in. And if you make the conditions too stringent you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;may end up with nothing. No more of you.
</em><br />
<br />More or less OK. Jacques, do you agree with that understanding ?
<br />
In fact there is no inconsistent world (let us hope). So, even with the relative infinite &quot;branching&quot; if you make the conditions too stringent you
<br />
may end up with nothing too (or may be you get mad ...).
<br />
In fact I am not sure Jacques M Mallah will agree. I am not sure Jacques accept you can survive even a QS with conditions not stringent at all.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If however, the number of branches does not change no matter where you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the MW -- according to a kind of a super Cosmological Principle -- then no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;matter how many times you commit QS, you still have the same number of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;branches left. This, I think, is the &quot;relative&quot; SSSA that Wei Dai and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Marchal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are talking about. Adding branches or subtracting branches has no impact on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the probability of your future existence. And it is precisely in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discussion of probability in this environment that some of the hottest 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discussions with Jacques have taken place.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So which is it? absolute and limited number of branches or relative and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unlimited?
</em><br />
<br />The problem is that Jacques M Mallah is computationnalist. I am afraid that this entails he has no other choice than to choose the relative SSA.
<br />
Only by choosing a strong physicalist ontological principle AND by choosing a strong (and rather mysterious) link between consciousness and physical activity, will it be possible for him to get a &quot;limited MW&quot; in which branching is absolute. Such a link between consciousness and physical activity has been showed incompatible with mechanism (by myself in 1988, and independently by Tim Maudlin in 1989, precise reference in  <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal</a>.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This said, I think that NOTHING justifies QS. My position however is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ethical. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As the idea of the MW matured in my mind, I have become convinced that while 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the MW is absolutely infinite, it is possible to avoid the nihilist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche and evolve an ethic of the many worlds. In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fact the JUSTIFICATION FOR QS COULD BE TURNED ON ITS HEAD as I have pointed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;out in my last post. Beautifully said in the 23rd psalm: &quot;The Lord is my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shepherd, I shall not want...the shadow of the valley of death (the MW)... I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shall fear no evil... .my cup runneth over&quot; The knowledge that we are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;immortal and that all stings and arrows are temporary can give us a new 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspective on the world.
</em><br />
<br />Mmm...I don't know. Perhaps. I must say that I agree a lot with Gilles Henri
<br />
when he said to George (about the 4 june 99):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Generally speaking, I find it a curious idea to base any ethical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consideration upon scientific theories. Science's goal is not to tell what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is good or not. It just deals with objective facts and tries to find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relationships between them. It could be a scientific question (although not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;often asked) to ask why and how we define our categories of good and evil.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is not a scientific one to ask if they are justified.
</em><br />
<br />... and I believe also in the reciprocal, i.e. I find it a curious idea to base a scientific or even philosophical consideration upon ethical principle(°).
<br />
I believe nevertheless that &quot;honest science&quot; can lead to ethical (non normatively) practice, in a sort of indirect way: The more you scrutinize the *real*, the more you realize it is *big-and unknown*, and the more you feel humble, and the more you try not to impose your personal values upon others.
<br />
<br />May be. (I guess I am over-optimistic here, and beside, who could ever tell us what is honest science ?).
<br />
... Perhaps Russell Standish is right about MWI and euthanasia. This is not a link between ethics and science. If an *ethics* is given, science (knowledge, belief) can change our behaviour, of course.
<br />
<br />Bruno.
<br />
<br />(°)John Bell, for example, argue at some place, against Everett MWI from ethical consideration.
