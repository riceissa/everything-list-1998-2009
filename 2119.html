<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: &quot;Bostrom,N  (pg)&quot; &lt;N.Bostrom.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jacques Mallah wrote (some time back):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  It has applications in cosmology, evolutionary biology, thermodynamics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and the problem of time's arrow, game theoretic problems with imperfect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;recall, the philosophical evaluation of the many-worlds and many-minds 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;interpretations of quantum mechanics and David Lewis' modal realism, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;even for traffic planning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would have liked to see some discussion of each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;application.  I guess that's for the book.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I suppose so. I haven't at all resolved the target-audience problem yet. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;For instance, you complain about the wordiness, but many philosophers I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;talk to think that it is much to brief in many places. Different cultures; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hard to satisfy them all. Also remember that few people will have spent as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;much time as you have thinking about these issues prior to reading the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;text.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could make a dense version and a long one.  Some parts of what you 
<br />
have are redundant or use long words where short ones would be just as 
<br />
precise.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also, you could have included the stuff you and I discussed about how the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;using the MWI prevents some of the counterintuitive	consequences (e.g. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;regarding Adam.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If I remember correctly, I was not convinced that MWI prevents these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consequences.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I though you were.  In <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m560.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m560.html</a> 
<br />
you say:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, you are right that on the MWI, if Adam thinks there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;substantial probability that the q.m. chance of a deer appearing is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;substantial, then you wouldn't get the shift that the paper refers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to. And as you say, Adam could obtain evidence for the hypothesis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the q.m chance is substantial from observing his situation.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You also said in that post you weren't sure how to combine the QM 
<br />
probabilities with the SSA, but in your last post to RS you seemed 
<br />
reconciled to doing so.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Even if it did, I don't think it would be very relevant since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we are concerned with what is a sound methodology, something which, one may 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think, should be independent of specific assumptions about the world. In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;particular, If one is advocating a general principle (such as SSSA-R) then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a single genuine counterexample, even if it is hypothetical, would suffice 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to refute it or force us to restrict its scope.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure what you mean in this context.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;However, we discover new consequences of SSA that are more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;counterintuitive than the Doomsday argument. Using these results, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;construct a version of SSA that avoids the paradoxes and does not lead to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Doomsday argument but caters to legitimate methodological needs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here's the part I really object to.  Your SSA was vague (you didn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even discuss observer-moments up to that point), but was OK as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;far as it went.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;When you introduced the SSSA, you went off track.  Your SSSA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;gives obviously wrong results, such as not leading to the Doomsday
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;argument
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;On the contrary, SSSA leads to DA just as surely as SSA. It is only when 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;going to the relativized version of SSSA, i.e. SSSA-R, that one can avoid 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;DA. Funny, btw, that you think that not leading to DA should be considered 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a fault! Most people seem to regard DA as a reductio ad absurdum (which I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think is unfair, although DA may be rather counterintuitive).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DA is not counterintuitive as far as I am concerned.  It's common 
<br />
sense.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I said SSSA I meant SSSAR.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;and in the &quot;god's coin toss&quot; where it gives the wrong Bayesian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability for the coin.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course, what is the &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; probability is precisely what is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at stake here.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 'coin toss' case, the answer is obvious.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Nor is there any theoretical justification for not regarding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all observer-moments to be in the same reference class.  (As you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can tell I am partial to the ASSA.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The main motivation is that it avoids certain consequences that most people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;regard as highly counterintuitive and unacceptable.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I've already stated that I regard those consequences as obvious 
<br />
and intuitive.  But there's another issue.  A motivation is not the same as 
<br />
a justification.  In this, the fact that all OMs should be considered in the 
<br />
same class is intuitively obvious prior to any consideration of consequences 
<br />
or shmonsequences.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You might then ask how I would avoid the Adam-style problem.  The answer is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;already somewhere in the paper: if Adam is a freak, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't need to worry much about him.  It's in the nature of Bayesian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability that for some people the method must backfire.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do say that, yes, but if we have a nice alternative then this problem can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;become decisive. The thing is not so much that Adam would have been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mistaken - who cares, except himself? - but rather that we don't seem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;willing to follow the rule that we prescribe for Adam. If we are not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;willing to do that - in all cases where the rule says it should be applied 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- then we don't really accept the rule. That is, we don't really accept the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unrestricted applicability of SSA. The question then arises, what rule do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we accept? And I suggest that the answer is SSSA-R.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's an unfortunate fact that intuition is a double edged sword.  It's 
<br />
our only guide to fundamental issues, but it's also a product of our 
<br />
specialized experiences, society, etc. and very unreliable when it comes to 
<br />
guessing complex things.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case &quot;our&quot; intuition is based upon the fact that we have never 
<br />
encountered a situation like Adam's.  Darwinian evolution depends upon 
<br />
repetitive situations, but by definition if Adam is right in thinking he's 
<br />
not going to reproduce, he wouldn't have reproduced.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would follow any advice I would give to Adam if I were in his 
<br />
situation.  Of course, thanks to the MWI that's extremely unlikely.  (Even 
<br />
if there are just a lot of regular old alien worlds with life, that would 
<br />
end Adam's dilemma for the same reason as the MWI.)

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I finally had a bit of a chance to glance through Nick's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thesis. I guess Nick stayed out of the ASSA/RSSA debate for good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reasons.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Maybe so :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;His SSSA introduced SSA over observer moments, so one could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rightly say that the ASSA and the RSSA are both examples of SSSA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Note the SSSA clearly states that the reference class includes all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer moments that don't differ by any relevant respect.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that was SSSAR.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, that's an applicability condition. I imagine that in many real cases, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;maybe some observer-moments will differ in relevant respects, even some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moments that belong to the same reference class - at least I don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;yet know any reason to rule out this case. In the context of QM, for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instance, one may want to assign weights to observer-moments that reflect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the amplitude of the branches of the universal wave function on which they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;live. Possibly also things like clarity of consciousness etc. should be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;taken into account. It is trivial to bake weightings of observer-moments 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;into SSSA-R, but I thought it would just complicate the formula and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wouldn't really add anything to do so, in the absence of interesting things 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to say about how those weights are to be determined.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do have some half-baked ideas about how the reference class is to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;defined, which I didn't include in the thesis. I might try them out here, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if they look promising after thinking some more about them.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, isn't your SSSA-R useless without that?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do you come down in the quantum immortality debate?  If your 
<br />
SSSAR is really the same as the RSSA as Russell Standish seemed to say in 
<br />
his posts to me, that's certainly a counterintuitive consequence of it.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell, I know I said my next post would be on your paper, but I've had 
<br />
other things to do lately.  I'm working on it.
