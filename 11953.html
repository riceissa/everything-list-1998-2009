<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes - but I'm not talking about merely functioning. I am talking about the

</em><br />
<br />You assume, but have no shown, that it is in a class of its own.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The adaptive behaviour you speak of is adaptivity in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respect of adherence or otherwise to an internal rule set, not adaptation

</em><br />
<br />False dichotomy.
<br />
Any adaptive system adapts under the influence under the influence of
<br />
external impacts, and there are always some underlying rules, if only
<br />
the rules of physics.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW 'Adaptive' means change, change means novelty has occurred. If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have no phenopmenality you must already have a rule as to how to adapt to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all change - ergo you know everything already.
</em><br />
<br />Rules to adapt to change don't have to stipulate novel inputs in
<br />
advance.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I spent tens of thousands of hours designing, building,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; benchtesting and commissioning zombies. On the benchtop I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; have pretended to be their environment and they had no 'awareness'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; they weren't in their real environment. It's what makes bench
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;  testing possible. The universe of the zombies was the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; universe of my programming. The zombies could not tell if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; they were in the factory or on the benchtop. That's why I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; can empathise so well with zombie life. I have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; literally swatted by zombies (robot/cranes and other machines)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; like I wasn't there....scares the hell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; out of you! Some even had 'vision systems' but were still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; blind. so....yes the zombie can 'behave'. What I am claiming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; is they cannot do _science_ i.e. they cannot behave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; scientifically. This is a very specific claim, not a general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; claim.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I see nothing to support it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have already showed you conclusive empirical evidence you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; demonstrate on yourself.
</em><br />
<br />No you haven't. Zombies aren't blind in the sense
<br />
of not being able to see at all,. You are just juggling
<br />
different definitions of &quot;Zombie&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps the 'zombie room' will do it.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;- it's all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; same - action potential pulse trains traveling from sensors to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; No, it's not all the same. Its coded in a very complex way. It's like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; saying the information in you computer is &quot;all the same -- its all ones
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and zeros&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; yes you got it - all coded....I am talking about action potential pulse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trains. They are all the same general class. Burst mode/Continuous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mode,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; all the same basic voltage waveform, overshoot, refratory period...LTP,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; LTD, afterhyperpolarisation.... all the same class for sight, sound,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taste, imagination, touch, thirst, orgasm etc etc... coded messages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; travelling all the way from the periphery and into the brain. They are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the same...and..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; They need to be interpreted an contextualised against other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; other information. How does that lead to the conclusion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that zombies can't do science?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They can do science on their sensory data only.
</em><br />
<br />All the data in the human phenomenal view originated in the
<br />
senses. Unless you are appealing to clairvoyance.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; They have no a-priori
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; method for applying any interpretation
</em><br />
<br /><br />There is no reason why they should lack apriori
<br />
methods are behaviour, behaviour is function.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; as to its context in the natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world that originated the sensory feeds.
</em><br />
<br />Absent clairvoyance, we contextualise one sensory feed
<br />
against another. You have not made it clear
<br />
why that requires phenomenality
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you like: it can do the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science of its boundary. Even that is a stretch - for it has no idea it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has a body or any boundary.
</em><br />
<br />Blindsight can reach beyond the boundary.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; They cannot contextualise NOVELTY with respect to the external world,
</em><br />
<br />Once more, asserted without argument/
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; merely against the non-phenomenal rule-set they have concted.
</em><br />
You have no evidence that humans use anything more
<br />
grand than a &quot;concocted rule set&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; They cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do science on the natural world - but they can do science on zombie sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; data and internal rule-sets, whose correpondence with any sort of external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world is a complete mystery.
</em><br />
<br />Humans use educated guess-work -- conscious and unconscious --
<br />
to relate sense data to an external world. Why shouldn't zombies?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If any of the rules they concoct happen to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correpond to the a natural world law it'd be an accident and they'd never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know it.
</em><br />
<br />Nonsense. They would no whether their &quot;concocted&quot; rules worked
<br />
or not in the same way humans do -- their rules would
<br />
fail to predict. They might fail to predict
<br />
unconscious sense data instead of failing to predict conscious
<br />
perceptions. but the two are in sync anyway.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; None of it says anything about WHY the input did what it did. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causality outside the zombie is MISSING from these signals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It's missing from the individual signals. But we must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be able to build up a picture of the external causes on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the basis of the combined information. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; don't have anything else to go on. Pheneomenality is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not an extra source of information that clairvoyantly tells
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you where each photon originated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes it is an extra source. That is the whole point. The fact that you call
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it 'clairvoyance' merely means that it is unknown. Why is it so impossoble
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to think that your current understanding of the universe may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incomplete?
</em><br />
<br />That is not how phenomenality is generally understood,
<br />
and there is no evidence for it. That means you
<br />
haven't &quot;proven&quot; anything about Zombies, since you
<br />
need to assume something quite strange and not
<br />
widely accepted about phenomenality in order
<br />
to arrive at your conclusion. Anyone can avoid your conclusion
<br />
by rejecting your assumption.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is nothing supernatural going on. The reality of phenomenality is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stark. Your neurons have a way of access enough information to constrcut
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal scenes.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. I am disputing that the process requires extra information
<br />
that doesn't arrive through the senses (or the genes).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; They do it. They are real. There is far more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information inthe phenopmenal scenes than arises from the sensing.
</em><br />
<br />Nonsense. The brain is a filtration system. The is a lot
<br />
*less* information available to consciousness than comes
<br />
in through the senses.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inability to see how that may be does not negate it as a reality.
</em><br />
<br />The fact that there is no evidence for it negates it as
<br />
reality.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the mathematical proof I gave the extra information is built into P(.),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which the zombie does not have.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; They have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; intrinsic sensation to them either. The only useful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; information is the body knows implicitly where they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; came from..which still is not enough because:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Try swapping the touch nerves for 2 fingers. You 'touch'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; with one and feel the touch happen on the other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The touch sensation is created as phenomenal consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; in the brain using the measurement, not the signal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; measurement itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Now think about the touch..the same sensation of touch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; could have been generated by a feather or a cloth or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; another finger or a passing car. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; context is what phenomenal consciousness provides.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It creates it out of information that is also available to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; zombie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No it doesn't. The information the zombie has is &quot;neurons a,b,c,d, fired
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in finger tip'. That's it. The zombie and the human both have that.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. And humans make the hypothesis that a particular pattern of firing
<br />
in those particular neurons was probably caused by a thing called a
<br />
&quot;feather&quot; , which
<br />
correlates with various visual data. There is nothing to stop
<br />
a zombie doing the same.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1228072">http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1228072</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It doesn't create new information ex nihilo.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course not. It creates new information by a mechaniusm you don;t
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand that is perfectly natural. &quot;ex nihilo&quot; actually means it can;t
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do it based on what I know...not that it is impossible.
</em><br />
<br />Mechanism is function. If humans have that mechanism , so do zombies.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes but how is it to do anything to contextualise the input other than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlate it with other signals?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Why would it need to ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What's the difference between &quot;neurons z,x,x,c,v,f,r,we,w, in my retina
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (none of which, in themselves, generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; any phenomenal consciousness, they trigger it downstream in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cranium/cortex).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; re robot...now do science on a signal and use the signal to make a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement about the natural world that generated/caused the signal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elsewhere away from/outside the robot. It can't. It's blind, deaf,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; taste or smell or touch.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It can interact with its environment: you have already conceded that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No. It's body boundary (which it has no means to intuit) can interact with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever impacts with it. That's it. Beyond the boundary? Multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external worlds could present the same stimulus and the zombie would never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know.
</em><br />
<br />The same is true of humans. We can be fooled. we don't
<br />
exist in a state of complete certainty about what is causing our
<br />
phenomena, and we
<br />
don't have magical clairvoyant powers.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The main fact is that the zombie does not have sensation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; at all and that as a result it cannot do science on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; world outside the zombie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A zombie has sensors which can alter its behaviour in response
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to changes in the environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;It doesn't even know there is a world to do science on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Why not? Because it can't paint a causal picture of where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; its signals came form? Why not?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where does this notion of 'causality' come from? You. Not it. You are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; projecting your internal life into the numbers the zombie has. Stop it!
</em><br />
<br />My notion of causality is function/behaviour. It is not a phenomenon --
<br />
not a taste or colour, it does not seem like anything.
<br />
So my zombie counterpart has it as well.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; All it can do is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; correlate measurements with each other, measurements that could have come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; from anywhere and the zombie can never tell from where.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Why not? Surely it only takes a kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for information analysis to tell that a set of signals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probably came form a cubic object, or whatever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where has the zombie got any idea of 'cube', space, distance?
</em><br />
<br />If it is a functional duplicate of person, it will have them
<br />
since they are functional.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You! Stop doing that. You keep grounding the zombie in your own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences and assuming it can do what you can. It has no idea of space,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time ,matter, causality, the natural world itself....NOTHING.
</em><br />
<br />So you say. But the standard definition is the a zombie
<br />
is a functional duplicate. You seem to be talking past
<br />
everybody on this point.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I have great empathy for the poor zombie! Indeed I am starting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; to realise that it may be my practical training which has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; enabled me to better understand the zombie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am not sure you grasp the standard meaning of &quot;philosophical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Zombie&quot; at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I couldn't care less about the philosopghical zombie.
</em><br />
<br />If you are not talking about philosophical zombies,
<br />
it is misleading to use the term.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Who ever said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophy had a patent on the concept!
</em><br />
<br />It's a question of communication. Language is based on shared meanings.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you like dump the whole label
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and replace every occurrence of the word zombie with &quot;a human but with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain not capable of phenomenal consciousness&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />If you do that, it is still far form clear
<br />
that your claims would follow. Would
<br />
a human without PC have a concept of
<br />
&quot;cause&quot;? Well, they wouldn't have
<br />
learnt it phenomenally..but maybe they would
<br />
have learnt it unphenomenally...or maybe it
<br />
would be innate ... maybe it is innate in humans...
<br />
<br />Using your definition of &quot;zombie&quot;, the situation is jut unclear.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What point is there in bothering with it. The philosophical zombie is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ASSUMED to be equivalent! This is failure before you even start!
</em><br />
<br />If you can show that the idea is self-contradictory, you can prove
<br />
something.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong and it's proven wrong because there is a conclusively logically and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirically provable function that the zombie cannot possibly do without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenality: SCIENCE.
</em><br />
<br />You haven't shown that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The philosophical zombie would have to know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything a-priori, which makes science meaningless.
</em><br />
<br />PZs only lack phenomenality. They don't
<br />
necessarily lack the ability to take in information.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no novelty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a philosophical zombie. It would have to anticipate all forms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; randomness or chaotic behaviour.... NUTS.
</em><br />
<br />Assuming &quot;no phenomenality&quot; means &quot;no sensory perception
<br />
whatsoever&quot;. Unwarrantedly.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am only intersted in the state where there is no phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness and the role it has in science. You can have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical zombie - it's an oxymoron and you're welcome to it. You can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; let it define your world if you like - I'd prefer to let the natural world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be my guide.
</em><br />
<br />Why use the word if you don't like the concept?
