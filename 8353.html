There was more to my post, which I've included below, which was meant 
<br />
to answer questions from multiple contributors here.
<br />
<br />Thanks, Hal Ruhl, for responding.  Somethings coming from All AND 
<br />
Nothing seems just as mysterious as coming from one of them. And if the 
<br />
somethings which are generated are all possible somethings, then we are 
<br />
back at the same problem as something in particular coming from All.
<br />
<br />Thanks to Hal Finney, at least for launching into my worm-in-apple 
<br />
analogy and we got some amusement out of it, but analogies are flawed, 
<br />
and I think that we got off on a rabbit trail a little.  The purpose of 
<br />
the worm-in-apple analogy was not to belittle current theories of 
<br />
physics as an end in itself.  It was to show that, for all we know, the 
<br />
universe could be so complex and contingent that it is far greater than 
<br />
any intelligent being would need, and hence far greater than any 
<br />
Intelligent-Being-opic Principle would dictate.
<br />
<br />But what about the other points and challenges in my post, below?
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in that the zero information  principle in particular, or Bruno's

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA, or Hal Ruhl's consistency  argument lend strong support

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a plenitude assumption over a single  reality.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that the only really good reason in  favour of a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single reality is to preserve some notion of faith in  God,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as omniscient deities do not seem compatible with  plenitudes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And that, I'm afraid is somewhere science cannot  go.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So as in the case of my Nothing and my All it seems

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the apex of causation may be neither infinite regression
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;or&quot; termination but rather both [an &quot;and&quot;].
</em><br />
<br />I'm saying that the &quot;All&quot; is on equal ontological footing with the
<br />
&quot;Nothing&quot;.  Pulling something out of Nothing is just as believable as
<br />
pulling something out of All.  I think Quentin touches on the
<br />
total mystery of both:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; as I said before I don't think/feel that single universe is on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same level as multiverse... Just by using &quot;absurd&quot;  feeling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was talking about. If there is a single reality, you have  to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anwser why this one ? why like this ? what is the ultimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason for the reality to be limited to this subset ? If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take the multiverse(everything) theory this is easily explained.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand, multiverse theory by now could not  answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why you're experiencing this precise reality among all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible that are in the multiverse.
</em><br />
<br />The question &quot;Why this particular something?&quot; is just as  mysterious in 
<br />
the
<br />
context of All as in the context of Nothing. The  problem is that we 
<br />
really
<br />
don't realize how totally All All is.  We are  used to being able to 
<br />
compute
<br />
probabilities in the context of an &quot;all&quot; that is  quantifiable.  So 
<br />
then it is
<br />
tempting to extend that notion to  the All and say like Quentin's first 
<br />
half,
<br />
&quot;If you take the multiverse(everything) theory this is easily 
<br />
explained.&quot;
<br />
<br />But when we realize the total indeterminacy and contingency of this
<br />
universe, extending down to even our first person point of view, and 
<br />
apparently
<br />
to the quantum level, then Quentin's second question is just as 
<br />
unanswerable
<br />
in the context of All as in the context of Nothing.  When we realize how
<br />
All All is, and how complex and contingent this something is, we start
<br />
eating our own tail like in Hal Ruhl's argument.
<br />
<br />Throughout the history of science, the perpetual message from the 
<br />
universe
<br />
is that the sky is wider than the brain.  I'm convinced that if we all, 
<br />
<br />including Bruno and his Lobian machine, somehow took a tour of the 
<br />
whole
<br />
universe (whatever that is), including all of it's intricacies from the 
<br />
smallest
<br />
to the largest, and the mathematical rules behind it, we would find it 
<br />
so
<br />
complex and contingent that we would be converted over to the idea
<br />
that the universe is far greater than anything the ANTHROpic Principle
<br />
dictates.  [We should include the Lobianopic Principle, too!]
<br />
<br />Even if you do not hold my above conviction, how can you escape the
<br />
possibility that it is true?
<br />
<br />To look at this from a different perspective, suppose there was a worm 
<br />
that
<br />
lived in an apple, and the worm was super-intelligent to the point of 
<br />
being
<br />
able  to grasp all of our mathematical concepts that Tegmark claims are 
<br />
<br />sufficient to describe all of reality.  Then the worm asks, &quot;Why is it 
<br />
that
<br />
I'm in this apple?&quot;  Actually the apple is the whole of observed 
<br />
reality for the
<br />
worm, so it is analogous to our observed universe.  However the
<br />
observABLE universe for the worm is the same as our observable universe.
<br />
Then the worm comes up with a multiverse theory along with a
<br />
Wormopic Principle, saying that the whole observable universe is just
<br />
complex enough to sustain the inside of an apple.  Surely this must be
<br />
true, since the worm can grasp all of mathematics?
<br />
<br />&quot;Explanatory power&quot; is in the eye of the beholder, and this is 
<br />
infinitely
<br />
true when applied to Everything.
