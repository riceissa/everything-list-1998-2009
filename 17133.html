<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am proposing, I suppose:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CONSCIOUSNESS  =&gt; EVERYTHING ELSE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So obviously it seems useful to postulate the existence of things like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quarks and electrons, which we then use to make predictions about what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will happen if we do this, that, or the other.  However, I think there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is good reason to believe that this only holds true in our own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relatively well-behaved part of what is actually a vast experiential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wilderness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any proposal that has our consciousness as being &quot;caused&quot;, whatever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the causal mechanism, is open to the possibility that we are caused to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience something that is not reflective of the reality that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; produced the experience.  Dreams, delusions, hallucinations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brains-in-vats, and computer simulations of brains all offer real or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceivable examples of scenarios where what is experienced might lead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one astray in trying to determine the underlying nature of things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If our conscious experience is caused, then for all we know we're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; giant amorphous blobs floating in 12 dimensional space, but with just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the right internal causal structure to produce the conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience of being humans in 3-dimensional space.
</em><br />
<br />You are using the identity thesis. It is inconsistent for any rational  
<br />
agent who believe that its own consciousness is invariant for a local  
<br />
functional substitution.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or we could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Boltzmann Brains&quot;, produced by the random fluctuations of particles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in just the right way to produce the illusion of our current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences.
</em><br />
<br />Same remark. If we are machine, Boltzmann brain does not work, unless  
<br />
they have the right relative statistics, but then they are no more BBs.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given enough time, exactly our experience would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; produced, regardless of the underlying physics of the Boltzmann
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Universe that we actually inhabit, just through a brute random search
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the space of possibilities, combination and recombination of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible configurations.  OR (per Bruno) we could be mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithms existing only in some immaterial platonic sense.
</em><br />
<br />No we aren't. There are no such identifty thesis consistent with the  
<br />
comp hyp.
<br />
Comp makes consciosusness more fundamental, than usual identifty  
<br />
theses permit.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or identical experiences, plus all variations, of being Brent or Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be caused by each of the above mechanisms at different times and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in different places.  An infinite number of universes, or a universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of infinite size, or with an infinite amount of time, or a quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanical multiverse with infinite branches, or a platonic Plenitude
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; containing all possible mathematical/algorithmic structures, would all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem to be possibilities, and not even mutually exclusive ones.
</em><br />
<br />This is slightly less wrong, but consciousness is distributed on such  
<br />
multi-realities. It defines them in the limit.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BUT, I don't think so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All causal explanations for consciousness (even Bruno's) ultimately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rely on fiat assertions that &quot;this causes conscious experience&quot;,
</em><br />
<br />I permanently avoid the notion of causality in search of the  
<br />
fundamentals. Causlaity is like free-will, it is something which  
<br />
emerge at some high level, of description.
<br />
<br />Comp is not &quot;brain produces consciousness&quot;. It is the assertion of the  
<br />
existence of la level of description of my &quot;body&quot; such that I will not  
<br />
experience anything usual in the case my &quot;body&quot; is substituted by an  
<br />
equivalent , for that level, digital device.
<br />
That is the &quot;yes doctor&quot;. It does not presuppose that the brain causes  
<br />
consciousness or thing like that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without providing any convincing explanation for why this should be.
</em><br />
<br />With comp, such explanation cannot be given. If a doctor shows any  
<br />
such beliefs in the completeness of such an explanation, you better  
<br />
run away, and search for a more modest doctor.
<br />
But we can have convincing evidences that comp makes sense. Today's  
<br />
physics implies comp, today biology implies comp, today's  
<br />
neurophysiology implies comp. Non-comp needs to speculate about many  
<br />
things we have no evidences at all. But despite this, few realize that  
<br />
comp is incompatible with the aristotelian idea that there is a  
<br />
physical universe operating primitively. Comp shows that Plato's  
<br />
theory is more coherent than Aristotle theory.
<br />
Even yours is more coherent, yet quite vague.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's not so much causation as correlation, as far as I can see.
</em><br />
<br />Sure. And the point is that such a correlation cannot be one-one. You  
<br />
can attach consciousness to a body (your friend's body, for example),  
<br />
but if you say &quot;yes to the doctor&quot;, you can understand that you cannot  
<br />
attach your experience to any body (nor physical, mathematical, etc.).  
<br />
On the contrary, bodies should be said to be &quot;caused&quot; by, or emerging  
<br />
from,   consciousness.
<br />
<br />And then computer science suggest a definition of consciousness as a  
<br />
state of true belief in a reality.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I mentioned, I'm sure that the brain can be viewed as representing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the contents of my experience.  And I'm sure that a computer program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could also be written that would represent the contents of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious experience and whose representational state would evolve as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the program ran so that it continued to match what I experience over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time.  But this would not mean that the program was conscious, or that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my brain is conscious.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Exactly,  that is even a key point.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The living brain and the executing computer program both just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; represent the contents of my conscious experience, in the same way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that a map represents the actual terrain.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is ambiguous. If you agree that this does not force you to say  
<br />
&quot;no&quot; to the doctor, despite he will handle only those &quot;map-like&quot;  
<br />
representations, then I am OK with you.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I question the need to push the explanation down to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separate layer.
</em><br />
<br />Because to put consciousness as primitive does not explain neither  
<br />
consciousness, nor matter, nor their relation.
<br />
You may be right, but then we are waiting for the theory, and the  
<br />
explanation.
<br />
<br />By the way, what is the status of your theory with respect to comp?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So we are at the top of your ontological stack, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume.  And we look below us to see what supports us.  But then we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to look below that level to see what supports it, and below that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level to see what supports it, and so on.  Infinite regress.  Turtles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the way down.
</em><br />
<br />If you accept the structure (N, + x) we can use beautiful method to  
<br />
solve infinite regress. That is what does &quot;recursion theory&quot; all the  
<br />
times.
<br />
If you don't accept (N, +, x), how will you explain the fact that we  
<br />
are consciously talking about (N, +, x)?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But instead why not look at our own experience, which is the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing we know directly, as the foundation of the ontological stack.
</em><br />
<br />You can try. Good luck. I can agree that we know our experiences, and  
<br />
even better that anything else. But as such, those are the things we  
<br />
cannot communicate to others, at all. That is why only great artist,  
<br />
poet and musician dare to try.
<br />
That is why some scientist does the mistake of putting those  
<br />
incommunicable things under the rug. They are mistaken because they  
<br />
confuse &quot;non communicable&quot;, with &quot;non existence&quot;. Eventually they will  
<br />
eliminate the person.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything that exists rests on the foundation of our conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience?
</em><br />
<br />The problem is &quot;our&quot;. What do you mean by that? If by &quot;our&quot; you mean  
<br />
&quot;us&quot; the universal machine, I can interpret favorably (with respect to  
<br />
the comp theory) that everything that exists rests on the foundation  
<br />
of our consciousness.
<br />
And this includes &quot;consciousness&quot;, in a circular way, bur which  
<br />
circularity can be eliminated by theorems in computer science. Then  
<br />
consciousness appears to be a logical descendant of the instinctive  
<br />
bet that there is a reality. It provides a relative self-speeding  
<br />
power which has no bound.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this view, the stack goes up for as far as our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intellect can reach.  And as our intellectual capacity expands, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our view of the existential landscape above us also expands.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This, I think, makes more sense.
</em><br />
<br />You should appreciate comp and its consequences, because it is closer  
<br />
to this view than you seem to realize. But you have to tell us what  
<br />
you mean by &quot;our&quot; to evaluate the degree of adequation between your  
<br />
insight, and what can be derived from computer science and self- 
<br />
reference logics.
