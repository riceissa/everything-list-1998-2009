<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too a possible sequence in consciousness?
</em><br />
<br />Hypothetical situation, assuming an objectively existing physical
<br />
universe. All of the particles in the universe kick into reverse and
<br />
start going backwards. For some reason every particle in the universe
<br />
instantaneously reverses course. And also space begins contracting
<br />
instead of expanding. Everything in the universe hits a rubberwall and
<br />
bounces back 180 degrees.
<br />
<br />So now instead of expanding, everything is on an exact &quot;rewind&quot; mode,
<br />
and we're headed back to the &quot;Big Bang&quot;.
<br />
<br />The laws of physics work the same in both directions...if you solve
<br />
them forward in time, you can take your answers, reverse the equations
<br />
and get your starting values, right?  With the possible exception of
<br />
kaon decay, but we'll leave that aside for now.
<br />
<br />This is what they always go on about with the &quot;arrow of time&quot;. The
<br />
laws of physics work the same forwards and backwards in time. It's not
<br />
impossible for an egg to &quot;unscramble&quot;, it's just very very very very
<br />
very unlikely. But if it did so, no laws of physics would be broken.
<br />
And, in fact, if you wait long enough, it will eventually happen.
<br />
<br />Okay, so everything has reversed direction. The actual reversal
<br />
process is, of course, impossible. But after everything reverses,
<br />
everything just plays out by the normal laws of physics. Only that one
<br />
instant of reversal breaks the laws of physics.
<br />
<br />External time is still moving forward, in the same direction as
<br />
before. We didn't reverse time. We just reversed the direction of
<br />
every particle.
<br />
<br />So, now photons and neutrinos no longer shoot away from the sun -
<br />
instead now they shoot towards the sun, which when the photons and the
<br />
neutrinos and gamma rays hit helium atoms, the helium atoms split back
<br />
into individual hydrogen atoms, and absorb some energy in the process.
<br />
Again, no physical laws are broken, and time is moving forward.
<br />
<br />Now, back on earth, everything is playing out in reverse as well. You
<br />
breath in carbon dioxide and absorb heat from your surroundings and
<br />
use the heat to break the carbon dioxide into carbon and oxygen. You
<br />
exhale the oxygen, and you turn the carbon into sugars, which you
<br />
eventually return to your digestive track where it's reconstituted
<br />
into food, which you regurgitate onto your fork and place it back onto
<br />
your plate.
<br />
<br />Okay. So, still no physical laws broken. Entropy is decreasing, but
<br />
that's not impossible, just very unlikely under normal conditions.
<br />
<br />Now. Your brain is also working backwards. But exactly backwards from
<br />
before. Every thought that you had yesterday, you will have again
<br />
tomorrow, in reverse. You will unthink it.
<br />
<br />My question is, what would you experience in this case? What would it
<br />
be like to live in this universe where &quot;external&quot; time is still going
<br />
forward, but where all particles are retracing their steps precisely?
<br />
<br />The laws of phsyics are still working exactly as before, but because
<br />
all particle trajectories were perfectly reversed, everything is
<br />
rolling back towards the big bang.
<br />
<br />In my opinion, we wouldn't notice any difference. We would not
<br />
experience the universe moving in reverse, we would still experience
<br />
it moving forward exactly as we do now...we would still see the
<br />
universe as expanding even though it was contracting, we would still
<br />
see the sun giving off light and energy even though it was absorbing
<br />
both. In other words, we would still see a universe with increasing
<br />
entropy even though we actually would live in a universe with
<br />
decreasing entropy.
<br />
<br />And why would that be the case? Because our mental states determine
<br />
what is the past for us and what is the future. There is no &quot;external
<br />
arrow of time&quot;. The arrow of time is internal. The past is the past
<br />
because we remember it and because the neurons of our brains tell us
<br />
that it has already happened to us. The future is the future because
<br />
it's unknown, and because the neurons of our brains tell us that it
<br />
will happen to us soon.
<br />
<br />If there is an external arrow of time, it is irrelevant, because as
<br />
this thought experiment shows it doesn't affect the way we perceive
<br />
time. Our internal mental state at any given instant determines what
<br />
is the future and what is the past for us.
<br />
<br />In fact, you could run the universe forwards and backwards as many
<br />
times as you wanted like this. We would never notice anything. We
<br />
would always percieve increasing entropy. For us, time would always
<br />
move forward, never backwards.
<br />
<br />My point being, as always, that our experience of reality is always
<br />
entirely dependent on our brain state. We can't know anything about
<br />
the universe that is not represented in the information of our brain
<br />
state at any given instant.
<br />
<br />Forwards or backwards, it's all just particles moving around, assuming
<br />
various configurations, some of which give rise to consciousness.
<br />
<br />Again, assuming that there actually is an external physical world.  We
<br />
could, I think, apply the same idea to running a computer simulation
<br />
of a human brain in reverse where instead of computing the next state,
<br />
we compute the previous state.
