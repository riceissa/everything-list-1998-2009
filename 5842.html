<br /><br />No, I don't agree! Probability is based in a sense on ignorance, but you 
<br />
must make full use of such information as you do have. If you toss a fair 
<br />
coin, is Pr(heads)=0.5? According to your argument, it could actually be 
<br />
anything between zero and one, because it is possible I am lying about it 
<br />
being a fair coin!
<br />
<br />Here is another &quot;two envelope&quot; example:
<br />
<br />Two envelopes, A and B, contain two doses of the drug Lifesavium, the 
<br />
Correct Dose and the Half Dose. If you give the patient more than 1.5 times 
<br />
the Correct Dose you will certainly kill him, while if you give him the Half 
<br />
Dose you will save his life, although he won't make an immediate recovery as 
<br />
he would if you gave him the Correct Dose. If you don't give him any 
<br />
medication at all, again, he will surely die. Once you open an envelope, the 
<br />
medication in in such a form that you must give the full dose, or nothing.
<br />
<br />You are faced with the two envelopes, the above information and the sick 
<br />
patient, with no other help, on a desert island. There is one further 
<br />
complication: if you open the first envelope, and then decide to open the 
<br />
second envelope, you must destroy the contents of the first envelope in 
<br />
order to get to the second envelope.
<br />
<br />OK: so you open envelope A and find that it contains 10mg of Lifesavium. You 
<br />
don't know whether this is The Correct Dose or the Half Dose; so envelope B 
<br />
may have either 5mg or 20mg, right? And if 10mg is the Correct Dose, then if 
<br />
you discard envelope A in favour of envelope B, there is a 50% chance that 
<br />
envelope B will have double the Correct Dose and you will kill the patient - 
<br />
so you had better stick with envelope A, right?
<br />
<br />I think you can see the error in the above argument. You already know that 
<br />
the amount in each envelope is fixed, so even though you have no idea of the 
<br />
actual dosages involved, or which envelope contains which dose, even after 
<br />
opening the first envelope, there is NO WAY you can give the patient an 
<br />
overdose. There is no way envelope B can contain 20mg of Lifesavium, but 
<br />
even though you cannot know this, you can use the above reasoning to deduce 
<br />
that there is no expected benefit from choosing a strategy of switching or 
<br />
not switching - as you can also see intuitively from the symmetry of the 
<br />
situation, whether you choose envelope A or B first.
<br />
<br />In the game with the envelopes and the money, the analogous error is to 
<br />
think that there is a possibility of doubling your money when you have 
<br />
actually picked the envelope containing the larger sum first. As I said in 
<br />
my previous post, if this assumption is valid, then you are playing a 
<br />
different game in which our eccentric millionaire flips a coin to decide 
<br />
(without telling you which) if he will put double or half the sum you find 
<br />
on opening envelope A into envelope B. You would then certainly be better 
<br />
off, on average, if you switched envelopes.
