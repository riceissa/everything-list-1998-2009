it doesn't seem to make much sense to say that computations are

digital computers but not rocks or the mere existence of computations

to the measure of consciousness, as I understood Jesse Mazer's

<br />The distractions of language in this are so subtle. The word 'physical' is
<br />
so laden with preconceived notions. I wish I could think of a better word
<br />
but I can't. Perhaps a better way of couching it would help:
<br />
<br />*whatever the universe is we are part of it, made of it, not separably 'in
<br />
it'.
<br />
*the rest of the universe that is not 'us' behave in a way with respect to
<br />
us that we label 'physical'
<br />
*the entire thing could be called a computational domain but based on
<br />
computing done with 'objects' that are nothing like the idea of number we
<br />
are used to. A particular 'number' in our universe could be
<br />
colin.brain.cell.molecule.atom.proton.quark.a.s.d.f........etc. There need
<br />
be no 'next' or 'previous' number in the sense we are used to - that comes
<br />
from our thinking. The number is actually an organisational hierarchy
<br />
only.
<br />
<br />Pick up a pencil, hold it. Say to yourself &quot;The universe has computed a
<br />
pencil&quot;.
<br />
<br />These numbers interact with each other according to whatever is
<br />
computationally adjacent (this has nothing to do with space or what we
<br />
would call physically adjacent...space can be what it looks like when you
<br />
are in it).. for example 'adding' three of these (above) numbers involves
<br />
creating the right context of adjacency and voila... a 'proton' (plus some
<br />
remainder rubbish which can go away and do something else...) Basically
<br />
the gigantic cellular automata.
<br />
<br />The computations done with these 'numbers' is what we are. For the sake of
<br />
a name call the numbers 'entropy numbers'.
<br />
<br />'AS-IF' COMPUTATION
<br />
What we can do is arrange this 'intrinsic computation with entropy
<br />
numbers' to behave 'as-if' idealised numbers existed and obey rules
<br />
according to the idealised domain of those numbers, if it actually existed
<br />
(presumably in the legendary platonia). Nowhere in any of this 'as-if'
<br />
computation does any of the structural 'entropy numbers' have any clue as
<br />
to what it is doing. The manipuluated 'symbols' are just patterns in the
<br />
adjacency of the numbers.
<br />
<br />'VIRTUAL MATTER'
<br />
Imagine this huge cellular automata  - a computation performed by simple
<br />
adjacency of entities in an organisational hierarchy - the numbers in it
<br />
that represent the organisation of me and you is what we call matter. As
<br />
computation it is actually derived from an axiomatic initial conditions
<br />
and a set of logical rules, forming a massively parallel calculus.
<br />
<br />if 'number a' (a cell in the CA) is matter it is a proof in this calculus
<br />
if 'number b' (a cell in the CA) is matter it is a proof in this calculus
<br />
<br />then what is the status within the CA the 'difference' between two cells
<br />
in the CA? The difference has been computed just as exquisitely
<br />
accurately, but no computational proof exists in the sense that a and b
<br />
were proven. It is 'as if' the computation was performed...but it was not
<br />
actually performed. Therefore if a is matter, b is matter, then (a_to_b)
<br />
is 'as-if' matter - virtual matter.
<br />
<br />You can see this in any of the CAs Stephen Wolfram's book. Each cell is
<br />
actually computed. The _difference_ between any two cells is not computed
<br />
explicity but is as perfectly proven. These are godellian unproven truths
<br />
in their squintillions.
<br />
<br />Now ask yourself the one question Stephen Wolfram didn'k himself:
<br />
<br />Q. &quot;Under what conditions can it be like something to 'be' an object in a
<br />
CA?&quot;
<br />
<br />A. When the object in the CA behaves 'as-if' it is interacting with some
<br />
other part of the CA.
<br />
<br />Under these circumstances the unproven truths - the virtual matter
<br />
riddling the CA can be used to paint a computational picture of any other
<br />
part of the CA. The trick is that the numbers in the CA have to do it...
<br />
no act as-if'.
<br />
<br />But the machine that does the 'as-if' symbolic computation throws away all
<br />
the virtual matter in the process of manipulating symbols only meaningful
<br />
to a third person...
<br />
<br />does this smake any sense? It seems really obvious to me!
