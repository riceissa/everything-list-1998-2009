If it feels bafflement and confusion, then surely it is conscious :)
<br />
<br />An AI that takes information from books might experience similar qualia we
<br />
can experience. The AI will be programmed to do certain tasks and it must
<br />
thus have a notion of what it is doing is ok., not ok, or completely wrong.
<br />
<br />If things are going wrong and it has to revert what it has just done, it may
<br />
feel some sort of pain. Just like what happens to us if we pick up something
<br />
that is very hot.
<br />
<br />So, I think that there will be a mismatch between the qualia the AI
<br />
experiences and what &quot;it reads about that we experience&quot;. The AI won't read
<br />
the information like we read it. I think it will directly experience it as
<br />
some qualia, just like we experience information coming in via our senses
<br />
into our brain.
<br />
<br />The meaning we associate with the text would not be accessible to the AI,
<br />
because ultimately that is linked to the qualia we experience.
<br />
<br />Perhaps what the AI experiences when it is processing information is similar
<br />
to an animal that is moving in some landscape. Maybe when it reads something
<br />
then that manifests itself like some object it sees. If  it processes
<br />
information then that could be like picking up that object putting it next
<br />
to a similar looking object.
<br />
<br />But if  that object represents a text about consciousness then there is no
<br />
way for the AI to know that.

<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Part of what I wanted to get at in my thought experiment is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bafflement and confusion an AI should feel when exposed to human ideas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about consciousness.  Various people here have proffered their own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideas, and we might assume that the AI would read these suggestions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; along with many other ideas that contradict the ones offered here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems hard to escape the conclusion that the only logical response
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is for the AI to figuratively throw up its hands and say that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible to know if it is conscious, because even humans cannot agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on what consciousness is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In particular I don't think an AI could be expected to claim that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knows that it is conscious, that consciousness is a deep and intrinsic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; part of itself, that whatever else it might be mistaken about it could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not be mistaken about being conscious.  I don't see any logical way it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could reach this conclusion by studying the corpus of writings on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topic.  If anyone disagrees, I'd like to hear how it could happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And the corollary to this is that perhaps humans also cannot legitimately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make such claims, since logically their position is not so different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from that of the AI.  In that case the seemingly axiomatic question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether we are conscious may after all be something that we could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mistaken about.
