<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that illusion can be maintained, regardless of the underlying mechanisms of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, time, whether or not there exists a real world, and so on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think the reason the illusion is maintained is rather trivial, whenever
<br />
your brain has the
<br />
thought: &quot;How come I was born as Stathis Papaioannou, and only ever
<br />
remember being Stathis Papaioannou?&quot;  Your brain is limited to the
<br />
memories contained within it.  And since there is no way for your
<br />
brain to have integrated memories of what it is like to be other
<br />
observers, your illusion of personal identity is maintained.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Either I'm one of few or one of many. If everyone guesses that they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one of many, more are going to be right than if everyone guesses that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are one of few. Therefore, I should guess that I'm one of many. Is that what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are suggesting?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Yes, and once we assume we are probably one of many similar or identical
<br />
observer-moments, we should ask &quot;Why should there be many?&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />The argument has some appeal assuming we have no other reason to favour
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guessing that we are one of many or one of few. However, lack of evidence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against something does not necessarily mean that thing is likely or even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible. As it happens there is perhaps some evidence for MW from quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanics, but were it not for this, we could easily class MW along with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pink elephants as something very unlikely which cannot be rescued by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ASSA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />If many-worlds is true, consider for a second how many
<br />
histories lines (and copies of you) must have been created by now.  The
<br />
universe had been branching into untold numbers of copies, untold numbers of
<br />
times each second, for billions of years before you were born.  While not
<br />
every branch contains you, once you appeared in one history line, a new copy
<br />
of you has been created for every possible outcome of every quantum event
<br />
that happens anywhere in this universe.  I would be
<br />
astonished if many-worlds turned out to be false, not only because of ASSA,
<br />
but also due to due to the paradoxes that exist in other interpretations,
<br />
and David Deutsch's reasoning that the computations of a quantum computer
<br />
must be done somewhere, and single-world views cannot explain,
<br />
for example, how Shor's algorithm works.
<br />
<br />From a mathematical/computational perspective a many-world universe has only
<br />
marginally more complicated description (program) than a universe that has a
<br />
one-to-one mapping of states.
<br />
<br />For a simple example of how this is possible, consider the Fibonacci
<br />
sequence, defined as:
<br />
F(0) = 1
<br />
F(1) = 1
<br />
F(n&gt;1) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
<br />
<br />But a sequence that defines an exponentially growing number of
<br />
states can be made just by changing the + to a plus or minus:
<br />
F(0) = 1
<br />
F(1) = 1
<br />
F(n&gt;1) = F(n-1) ± F(n-2)
<br />
<br />Therefore mathematical descriptions of universes like our own should be
<br />
common, and only slightly rarer than universes that lack the property of
<br />
many-worlds.  However, many-worlds universes define so many more states, and
<br />
so many more observers that most of reality should be generated by short
<br />
programs that define massive numbers of states before halting.  An
<br />
interesting question: What about programs that loop, would
<br />
observers and states in such a universe have an infinite measure or should
<br />
looping be treated the same as halting?
