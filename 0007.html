<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even argue that most mathematical structures can not be described as

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formal systems, since the set of all mathematical structures is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; countable. (Isn't every real number a mathematical structure? How about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every function on the real numbers?)
</em><br />
<br />I think the meaning of &quot;mathematical structures&quot; is somewhat vague here.
<br />
I was suggesting an equivalence between mathematical structures as Tegmark
<br />
uses the term and TM programs.  He does not refer to a specific real number
<br />
as a mathematical structure.  Rather, the set of all reals along with the
<br />
rules for arithmetic on them forms a type of field, which is the kind of
<br />
structure he is talking about.  You can create a formal system which defines
<br />
this field, and you could write a TM program which would enumerate all
<br />
valid proofs within this system, in order of size.
<br />
<br />A single real number in isolation is not a mathematical structure in this
<br />
sense because there are no operations you can perform on it.
<br />
<br />Getting back to my original point, maybe a better way to relate Tegmark's
<br />
idea to the TM concept is to consider a subset of TM programs, those which
<br />
enumerate valid proofs of the formal systems which describe the various
<br />
mathematical structures.  These would then be the possible universes in
<br />
his model.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Using Schmidhuber's mapping, the universe states would be 0, 1, 10, 11,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 100, 101, 110, 111, ....  I don't see any simple mapping which would make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this look at all like the universe we live in.  For example, one of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; characteristics of this kind of counting is that there is a lot of change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at the right hand side and very little at the left, and we don't really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; see that kind of behavior in our universe, which is somewhat homogeneous.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This argument doesn't work because we can't directly observe the state of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe and its evolution, so we can't say that it is not changing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only at the right hand side. If we accept Schmidhuber's interpretation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is no way to rule out the possibility that we're living in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counting universe because everything eventually appears in it during its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolution, including us.  If we were living in the counting universe, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course all of our memories and perceptions would have no basis in reality. 
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure I follow you here.  Are you suggesting that our observations
<br />
of the universe's history might be in error, that we might be instantiated
<br />
for a single instant with all of our memories of the past being illusions?
<br />
We could write down the state of the universe at this instant as a long
<br />
string using a simple mapping, and at some point the counting TM will
<br />
emit this string.  At that instant we will all exist with our memories
<br />
of the past, but none of that past will actually have happened.  Is this
<br />
right?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So my problem with Schmidhuber's interpretation is even ignoring the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mapping problem, I don't see how it would assign a low probability to us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being in the counting universe. Perhaps he would comment if I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misunderstanding him.
</em><br />
<br />The problem then is not so much with the objective question of whether we
<br />
live in the counting universe, which an outside observer could easily
<br />
answer, but rather with the difficulty of us as residents in the universe
<br />
knowing the answer.
<br />
<br />A more extreme case occurs if the counting program works in trinary,
<br />
using the 0/1/comma alphabet.  Now it outputs not only all numbers, it
<br />
outputs all possible comma-separated sequences of numbers.  It eventually
<br />
outputs not only every possible state, but every possible sequence of
<br />
states, including the entire history of our universe.  This history would
<br />
be a subset of an enormously larger output string, all created with a very
<br />
short (and therefore a priori probable) input program.
<br />
<br />All I can suggest about these problems is that they would imply that the
<br />
universe will shortly cease to behave lawfully.  When we don't observe
<br />
this, we can reject this possibility.  Otherwise we are forced to say
<br />
that all our perceptions are illusions, that our memories are false,
<br />
that we ourselves may be simply memories of some future self.  Logically
<br />
we can't rule this out, but it does not seem reasonable.  If we lived in
<br />
the counting universe, there is no reason why the universe should seem
<br />
lawful in the sense we see.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the solution to the mapping problem is to assume no mapping. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turing machine is a universe, and its output given some region as input IS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the content of that region, not merely the encoding of the content of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; region. Otherwise, as you point out, you could hide arbitrary amount of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complexity in the encoding function.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The interpretation I gave earlier already implicitly assumes no mapping,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so I don't think it suffers from the mapping problem.
</em><br />
<br />You solution is somewhat different in nature from Schmidhuber's.
<br />
Your set of possible universes is more structured than his.  You have
<br />
a coordinate system, you have regions (which may imply a certain amount
<br />
of continuity in the coordinates).  He had binary strings to represent
<br />
the universe state, which would allow for a wider set of possible
<br />
universes.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure you can fully avoid the mapping problem with your approach.
<br />
There is still a mapping involved in the choice of coordinates.
<br />
With a sufficiently exotic coordinate system, I suspect we could map
<br />
our universe's state to the output of a trivial program.
