Interleaving...
<br />
<br />POINT 1
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;  For example, &quot;truth&quot; is defined in formal logic with respect to, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; again, formal models with an infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; number of formal symbols in them. It is not defined with respect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to some vague &quot;correspondence&quot; with external reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Actually, science is just about such correspondences with external 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I haven't argued that logic alone is a substitute for science, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; measurement, experimentation, refutation, correction, adjustment, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; model-building
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
All I was saying is that the semantics that define the meaning with 
<br />
respect to each
<br />
other of symbols and symbol-relationships is formal and, within each given
<br />
well-formed framework, inarguable.
<br />
<br />whereas the semantics of the mapping of formal models to their 
<br />
&quot;supposed&quot; subject is
<br />
not, itself, formal (yet anyway), and hence is suspect as to whether we 
<br />
understand it or
<br />
get it right all the time. With science, all we have is:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&quot;this formal symbol system (theory) A
<br />
seems to correspond better to our current observations than any competing
<br />
formal symbol system (theory) B (that we've conceived of so far), so we'll
<br />
consider A (as a whole) to be TRUE  i.e.
<br />
&quot;the best observation-corresponding theory&quot; (for now.)
<br />
<br />This scientific process works pretty well
<br />
but is somehow loosy-goosy and unsatisfying. Do theories which replace
<br />
other older, now discredited theories, keep getting better and better? 
<br />
Probably yes.
<br />
But what is the limit of that? Is there one? Or a limit in each domain 
<br />
about which
<br />
we theorize? But hold on, most of the scientific revolutions tell us 
<br />
that we had a nice
<br />
theory, but were theorizing about a badly-scoped, badly conceptualized 
<br />
idea of what
<br />
the &quot;domain&quot; was. A better theory is usually a better set of formal, 
<br />
interacting concepts
<br />
which map to a slightly (or greatly) differently defined and scoped 
<br />
external domain than the
<br />
last theory mapped to. None of this is very straightforward at all.
<br />
<br />For example, would you go out on a limb and say that Einstein's theories are
<br />
the &quot;best&quot; (and only &quot;true&quot;) way of modelling the aspects of physics he 
<br />
was concerned
<br />
with? If so, would you be equally confident that his theories cover 
<br />
&quot;essentially
<br />
all the important issues&quot; in that domain? Or might someone else, 
<br />
someday, re-conceptualize
<br />
a similar but not 100% overlapping domain, and create an even more 
<br />
explanatory
<br />
theory of fundamental physics than he came up with? Can we ever say for 
<br />
sure,
<br />
until that either happens or doesn't?
<br />
<br />You can interpret the history of science in two ways: either we were 
<br />
just really
<br />
bad at it back then (in Newton's day) and wouldn't make those kind of 
<br />
mistakes
<br />
in our theory formation today, or you can say, no we're about as good at 
<br />
it as always,
<br />
maybe a little more refined in method but not much, and we'll continue 
<br />
to get
<br />
fundamental scientific revolutions even in areas we see as sacrosanct 
<br />
theory today.
<br />
And the new theory will not so much &quot;disprove&quot; the existing one (as 
<br />
Einstein
<br />
didn't really &quot;disprove&quot; Newton) but rather will be  just relegating the 
<br />
old theory
<br />
to be an approximate description of a partially occluded view of reality.
<br />
And then one day, will the same thing happen again to that new theory? Is
<br />
there an endpoint? What would the definition of that endpoint be? 
<br />
<br /><br />(SILLY) POINT 2
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As far as I know, there is no good formulation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a formal connection between a formal system and &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;reality&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &lt;-unbalanced quotes, the secret
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cause of asymmetry in the universe. How's that for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;quining&quot; paragraph?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't understand your &quot;secret cause of asymmetry in the universe&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point. We understand some things about symmetry breaking in particle 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics theories, via gauge theories and the like. If you want more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than this, you'll have to expand on what you mean here.
</em><br />
<br />It is a Koan (kind of). A self-referential, absurd example of a notion 
<br />
that an imbalance in a formal symbol system (the words I'm using, and 
<br />
the quotes) could possibly be the cause of
<br />
asymmetry in the physical universe. It is an attempt to highlight the 
<br />
problems we get into
<br />
when we confuse the properties of a model with the properties of the 
<br />
thing we are
<br />
TRYING to model with it.
<br />
<br />&quot;Quining&quot; is the use of self-reference in sentences, often to achieve 
<br />
paradox. It is
<br />
a childish ploy. e.g. of a Quine:
<br />
<br /><br />&quot;Is not a sentence&quot; is not a sentence.
