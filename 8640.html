<br /><br />But there exists nonetheless a death event, even though it does not

lead to a cessation of consciousness and presumably life. Death  
<br />
represents the branching of the histories - it must count for at  
<br />
least that. As Bruno says, you cannot have a 1^ point of view on it  
<br />
so saying someone died is merely the statement that you have lost

them irrevocably
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Every time you come to a point where you might die, something will

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ageing treatment, or mind uploading is introduced just in time. Of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course, there is no guarantee that you will continue living in full  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical and mental vigour: you might just slowly deteriorate over  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time so that you end up spending centuries in a near-vegetative state.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sounds like the most fun you can have ;) But people who have already  
<br />
&quot;died&quot; (of natural causes) have *only* ever experienced near- 
<br />
vegetative conditions - in this universe surely, since we have not  
<br />
yet Nick Bostrom-ed ourselves into posthumans capable of mind- 
<br />
uploading. Unless posthumans capable of time travel who *have*  
<br />
invented Jupiter brains etc. can pluck us into their era
<br />
<br />Maybe it happens all the time!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question then arises, how close to a vegetable do you have to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be before you can be pronounced dead for the purposes of QTI?
</em><br />
<br /><br />How close to a vegetable would you want to be and still be alive???  
<br />
If true, it might therefore be a curse, a Hell that we all suffer  
<br />
eventually. Maybe the Church got it right after all in the middle  
<br />
ages......only joking! Hell was cancelled by the church a while back.  
<br />
Funny thing is - heaven's still there. I thought you couldn't have  
<br />
the one without the other...but I digress
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem of gradually fading away can be illustrated by another  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example. Suppose your body is destructively scanned and then  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconstituted in two separate locations, a1 and a2.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Happened to me on New Years Eve after several drinks
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; At a1, the reconstitution goes as intended, but at a2 something  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; goes wrong and you are reconstituted in a brain dead state. I think  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can say in this case that you can expect to find yourself alive  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at a1 with 100% certainty a moment after you undergo the scanning.
</em><br />
<br /><br />&quot;Yes Doctor&quot; :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Next, suppose that after the destructive scanning your body is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconstituted in 10 different locations, b1 to b10. As before, at  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; b1 the reconstitution is perfect and at b10 something goes wrong  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and you are reconstituted in a brain dead state. At locations b2 to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; b9, however, due to varying degrees of malfunction in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machinery, you are reconstituted with varying degrees of dementia:  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at b2 you are just a little bit more vague than usual, at b9 you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are still alive but have lost all your memories and sense of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identity, and in between are several variations with partial  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dementia. The question now is, when you undergo the scanning  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process, should you have an equal expectation of ending up at each  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the locations b1 to b10? If you exclude b10 because you are dead  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there, should you not also exclude b9, where you are no longer a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sentient being, let alone a particular sentient being? And does it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follow from these considerations that you are are somehow more  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely to find yourself at b2 than b8, for example?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;OK - so transferring this set of increasingly demented versions of  
<br />
me to a multiverse framework where they are all existing in parallel,  
<br />
you are saying that - as I age - I can expect a gradual fadeout to a  
<br />
near-vegetative twilight state due to the odds favoring my ending up  
<br />
in the highest achievable state of normality each time? This to me  
<br />
highlights my question then - wouldn't I be better off doing a James  
<br />
Dean or an Elvis; living fast, &quot;dying&quot; young and keeping up my  
<br />
probability measure of ending up in universes where I am similarly  
<br />
constituted with all my faculties intact? Like this I would expect to  
<br />
take advantage of the system and be a Cassanova or a Lothario for  
<br />
eternity. That's what I call &quot;continuity&quot;!
<br />
<br />Not entirely tongue-in-cheek I hope

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In QTI is there any difference between death by normal process of   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ageing and death by all other means? Assuming that consciousness   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; continues in a branch somewhere no matter what the manner of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; death,  what kind of (logical?) continuation could one expect  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; given that the  body's usefulness in the current branch has been  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; used up in the case  of death by normal age-related processes?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Doesn't QTI suggest that we should all try to die young?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
