<br /><br />You would be right if I'd have said that an ``observer moment&quot; is
<br />
a relative computational state of a sufficiently reflexive 
<br />
universal machine, *as known* by that machine, i.e. from the first
<br />
person point of view.
<br />
<br />But for the measure problem, it seems to me that we must find
<br />
a measure on the set of third person 'relative' descriptions of 
<br />
these 'relative' states. (Like Everett, as I interpret him).

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. What about a brain that is stuck for 10 years thinking the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thought, but at very high clockspeed - a navel-gazing Jupiterbrain? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is that one observer-moment or very many?
</em><br />
<br />Here you meet again the 1/3-person points of view dichotomy.
<br />
If you really mean *exactly* the same thought, then it is ONE 
<br />
observer-moment from the 1-person point of view of the observer.
<br />
<br />(or ONE little bunch observer-moments because it is hard to even 
<br />
talk of one 'train of thought'. I believe Russell Standish makes a 
<br />
relevant remark here concerning the fact that we deal with sort of infinitesimals). 
<br />
<br />And from the 1-person POV the clock-speed doesn't change anything.
<br />
(POV = Point Of View)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the 3-person POV there are very many 'relative incarnations'
</em><br />
of that observer-moment.
<br />
The question is: does it change the probability that that poor 
<br />
person will live that instant(°). I guess the answer is yes with ASSA 
<br />
and no with RSSA.
<br />
With RSSA only relative 'bi(multi)furcation' makes the probability 
<br />
higher. I 'd think.
<br />
<br />(°) Oliver Sacks describes real similar cerebro-pathological case in 
<br />
his book 'the man who took his wife for a hat'.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2. Are highly clear, intelligent, intense observer-moments to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;given more weight than dull ones? 
</em><br />
<br />I don't see any reason to give more weight to intelligent, intense observer-moments than dull ones. 
<br />
Nor do I think &quot;intelligent&quot; and &quot;intense&quot; are linked. A dull person
<br />
could change the intensity of &quot;consciousness&quot; with some mushrooms
<br />
without changing (maybe even lowering) his intelligence or his 
<br />
'clarity' of mind.
<br />
With RSSA weights are relative. I can imagine that the butterfly's
<br />
consciousness is very intense (from his 1-person POV). But the 
<br />
probability of its experience is linked to the space of its personal
<br />
possible (computational) histories.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Or is there a sharp cut-off where 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sentience goes from not having any observer-moments to having 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;full-blown obsever-moments? 
</em><br />
<br />I doubt very much there is such sharp cut-off.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Or does all sentience equally have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moments?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the 1-person point of view I guess it will depend on 
</em><br />
the 'moment'.
<br />
My own 'observer-moment' are different in the morning and in the 
<br />
evening. After or before coffee ...
<br />
These questions are like Nagel's &quot;what is like to be a bat?&quot;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From comp these are unsoluble problem, although we can make 
</em><br />
(hopefully correct) guesses.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;3. What about obsevers that are not readily separable? Human brains 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are quite distinct things so we might not be very familiar with this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;situation (though consider split-personalities and subconscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;processing, and persons who have had their corpus callosum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dissected), but could they not arise in artificial intellects? If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness need not always be unified, then how count the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moments?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From a 1-person point of view consciousness is unified. But a brain
</em><br />
in abnormal (or even perhaps usual) state can  vehiculated more than
<br />
one person with or without conflicts, with or without proper sharing 
<br />
of 'history' memories, with or without control of the body, etc.
<br />
<br />It is a theorem (with comp) that if we are machine we cannot know
<br />
which machine we are (we can only make bets on a level of substitution).
<br />
So, from a 1-person POV, there is no sense to try counting
<br />
the &quot;real relative&quot; observer-moment at that correct levels of 
<br />
substitution. We can only guess through observations, or (as I do)
<br />
deduce from philosophical principle the 'geometry' of 
<br />
the observer-moments.
<br />

<br />
<br /><br />PS My chapter 5 of my thesis (URL below) present a way (*the* way ?) 
<br />
to tackle formally (even arithmetically) such questions.
<br />
My chapter 5 = comp + the theetetical (platonic) definition of belief,
<br />
knowledge and my observation variants (the Z logics).
<br />
Of course (and unfortunately) the questions are transformed into
<br />
difficult mathematical questions :-(
<br />
Let us say it is a program for the next millenium :-)
