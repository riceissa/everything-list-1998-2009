<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris Maloney - the latest, and worst, addition to our little
<br />
group.  It's not exactly a pleasure to make your acquaintance.  I suspect
<br />
I will unsubscribe from this newsgroup before long.  I'm a scientist, not
<br />
a suicide counselor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much like many others on this list, you have no understanding of
<br />
issues that are really simple.  But then the human capacity for stupidity
<br />
never ceases to amaze me.  For example, I am currently in an email debate
<br />
with someone who claims to have a counterexample to Bell's theorem - a
<br />
non-MWI, local hidden variables model to explain Bell correlations.  The
<br />
only problem: the way he takes expectation values, with a funny
<br />
probability distribution, the average value of a certain quantity is 1
<br />
even though the probability that this quantity will be nonzero is zero.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me this is the very definition of reductio ad absurdum, but he
<br />
thinks it is just an insult to call his beliefs absurd!  This guy is not
<br />
kidding, he is an employed engineer and I still can't get my mind around
<br />
the fact that he is so incredibly stupid.  IT ... IS ... JUST ... NOT ...
<br />
POSSIBLE!  But, it is true.  %*^~$%(&amp;!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not atypical of my experiences on the internet of
<br />
trying to convince crackpots of their errors.  Be it magnetism,
<br />
thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, or quantum suicide, these people just
<br />
won't understand what I tell them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I really don't expect to convince you either.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But consider this:  Is the branch in which you win the lottery not
<br />
already occupied?  How will it profit this lottery winner if you, finding
<br />
yourself in another branch, kill yourself?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your belief that you will magically leap into the body of this
<br />
winner, at the same date and time as you die, is absurd.  You guys take
<br />
one true fact - that the effective probability of finding yourself to be
<br />
that winning guy, given that you find the date and time to be such and
<br />
such, and that your name is such and such, etc. - is nearly one.  But you
<br />
don't understand what it means and you sure as hell don't use it
<br />
correctly, and the result is this monstrous quantum cult of death.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are, and I've said this a million times by now:
<br />
-	There is only one reason to commit suicide and it is the same as
<br />
without QM: if your life is so bad that you would rather not exist, commit
<br />
suicide; otherwise don't.  For indeed, in those branches you would cease
<br />
to exist, while the branches with the lottery winner would gain nothing.
<br />
-	the effective probability of finding yourself to be that guy,
<br />
given that your name is such and such, is still very small.  If you did
<br />
follow though, most of the the observers with that name would find
<br />
themselves prior to that date.
<br />
-	The effective probability of having that name, given that you are
<br />
an observer after that date, would be greatly reduced by the suicide.
<br />
-	Your total measure would be reduced, so there would be less
<br />
observers with that name in the ensemble, and the total number of
<br />
observers would be less.
<br />
-	There is only one reason to commit suicide and it is the same as
<br />
without QM: if your life is so bad that you would rather not exist, commit
<br />
suicide; otherwise don't.  For indeed, in those branches you would cease
<br />
to exist, while the branches with the lottery winner would gain nothing.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I actually care too much about somebody else -- my wife.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; couldn't kill myself now, knowing how much it would hurt her.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So now I take my lumps as they come.  That sounds like maturity
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it sounds like you now have too much to lose.  A condition
<br />
which may not last.
