<br />Thats exactly what I mean by a creative process. And I also have a
<br />
fairly precise definition of complexity, but I certainly accept
<br />
proxies as these are usually easier to measure. For example
<br />
Bedau-Packard statistics...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This could be called creative if you like. Like Prigogine did. I'd caution

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against the tendency to use the word because it has so many loaded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meanings that are suggestive of much more then the previous para.
</em><br />
<br />Most scientific terms have common usage in sharp contrast to the
<br />
scientific meanings. Energy is a classic example eg &quot;I've run out of
<br />
energy&quot; when referring to motivation or tiredness. If the statement
<br />
were literally true, the speaker would be dead. This doesn't prevent
<br />
sensible scientific discussion using the term in a well defined way.
<br />
<br />I know of no other technical meanings of the word creative, so I don't
<br />
see a problem here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Scientifically the word could be left entirely out of any desciptions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the biosphere.
</em><br />
<br />Only by generating a new word that means the same thing (ie the well
<br />
defined concept we talked about before).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The bogus logic I detect in posts around this area...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Humans are complex and are conscious'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Humans were made by a complex biosphere'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'The biosphere is conscious'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps so, but not from me. 
<br />
<br />To return to your original claim:
<br />
<br />&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;Re: How would a computer know if it were conscious?
<br />
<br />&quot;Easy.
<br />
<br />&quot;The computer would be able to go head to head with a human in a competition.
<br />
The competition?
<br />
Do science on exquisite novelty that neither party had encountered.
<br />
(More interesting: Make their life depend on getting it right. The
<br />
survivors are conscious).&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Doing science on exquisite novelty&quot; is simply an example of a
<br />
creative process. Evolution produces exquisite novelty. Is it science
<br />
- well maybe not, but both science and evolution are search
<br />
processes. I think that taking the Popperian view of science would
<br />
imply that both science and biological evolution are exemplars of a
<br />
generic evolutionary process. There is variation (of hypotheses or
<br />
species), there is selection (falsification in the former or
<br />
extinction in the latter) and there is heritability (scientific
<br />
journal articles / genetic code).
<br />
<br />So it seems the only real difference between doing science and
<br />
evolving species is that one is performed by conscious entities, and
<br />
the other (pace IDers) is not. But this rather begs your answer in a
<br />
trivial way. What if I were to produce an evolutionary algorithm that
<br />
performs science in the convention everyday use of the term - lets say
<br />
by forming hypotheses and mining published datasets for testing
<br />
them. It is not too difficult to imagine this - after all John Koza
<br />
has produced several new patents in the area of electrical circuits
<br />
from an Evolutionary Programming algorithm. Is this evolutionary
<br />
algorithm conscious then?
<br />
<br />Cheers
