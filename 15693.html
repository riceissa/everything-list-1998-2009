Bruno,
<br />
<br /><br />things are starting to hang together in my new digital brain (bright  
<br />
yellow)
<br />
<br /><br />you wrote the plan:
<br />
<br /><br />-------------------
<br />
<br />A) UDA  (Universal Dovetailer Argument)
<br />
<br />1) I explain that if you are a machine, you are already immaterial.
<br />
<br />-------------------
<br />
<br />Fine. This thought is merely surprising and somewhat (strangely)  
<br />
satisfying. It doesn't affect the way I live my life, but it sure as  
<br />
hell gets me some funny looks from people when I try to explain it to  
<br />
them! Most people think I am identifying the &quot;self&quot; with the &quot;soul&quot; or  
<br />
the &quot;spirit&quot; or some other metaphysical conjecture that they have  
<br />
heard of from religion or from their grandmother. They simply do not  
<br />
buy it when I tell them that all of reality is like this - that the  
<br />
assumption of a primitive, primary material reality is probably a  
<br />
gross &quot;error of perception&quot; albeit quite an understandable one.
<br />
<br />People are so hoodwinked by appearances, by their senses. Somehow I  
<br />
still think we are *meant* to be fooled by appearances - although this  
<br />
thought may well be self-contradictory. It's a good thing I find most  
<br />
things quite unconvincing - including appearances and reality  
<br />
generally! I am always asking myself &quot;What is really going on here?  
<br />
Why are things THIS way, in particular? Why not some other way? I have  
<br />
always been like this. Some people find me quite annoying in this  
<br />
regard...
<br />
<br /><br />---------------------
<br />
<br />2) Mechanism entails the existence of a subjective or first person
<br />
indeterminacy or uncertainty.
<br />
<br />---------------------
<br />
<br />In the sense that I cannot know who or what I am, BEING who or what I  
<br />
am. Correct? I would necessarily have to step outside my existence to  
<br />
do so - manifestly impossible, given the laws of physics (or simply  
<br />
given MEC/COMP). I would have to reboot from a different system; be a  
<br />
different entity in fact.
<br />
<br />Paradox Alert: Without a first person perspective there could be no  
<br />
third person perspectives anyway, isn't that correct? Why then doesn't  
<br />
some part of the first person uncertainty (ie &quot;my&quot; uncertainty about  
<br />
&quot;me&quot;) translate into 3rd person perspectives? Anything I might say or  
<br />
merely perceive about something or someone else is surely contaminated  
<br />
by my uncertainties...so, in the quest to &quot;know myself&quot; how can I  
<br />
trust the veracity of any knowledge that comes to me from outside? All  
<br />
knowledge comes via brains (wet, messy ones) and all of these brains  
<br />
are suffering the same uncertainties about their identity as I. Note,  
<br />
I am not a solipsist.
<br />
<br />Also, you cannot experience the experience that I experience and vice  
<br />
versa. Which is why I think art and music in particular are important  
<br />
revelations of the first person perspective. Music is an ATTEMPT to  
<br />
overcome first person indeterminacy by &quot;universalising&quot; certain  
<br />
qualia. Tchaikowsky expects you to BECOME Tchaikowsky when you listen  
<br />
to the first movement of his 6th Symphony. You suffer and agonise and  
<br />
die with him. It's a VR experience. Madonna just doesn't do this for me.
<br />
<br />However,
<br />
<br />new research has shown that reading the mind is literally possible. We  
<br />
can now assemble an image seen via an optical system transmitted only  
<br />
via the electrical impulses read in a brain system (NewScientist last  
<br />
ed.)
<br />
<br />Perhaps it is not too far from here to the thought that you and I  
<br />
might &quot;swap instantiations&quot; for a short time? Maybe it would be fun to  
<br />
think, walk, talk and act like Bruno Marchal, if only for 5 minutes.  
<br />
In fact, I would pay a princely sum to have that experience. In an age  
<br />
when some people will spend gazillions on a &quot;space tourist&quot; (virtual)  
<br />
reality experience, I would go for the &quot;Be Bruno for Five Minutes&quot;  
<br />
option long before I would want to see the globe from orbit....
<br />
<br />-------------------------
<br />
<br />3) The Universal Machine, the Universal Dovetailer and the reversal
<br />
physics/bio-psycho-theo-whatever-logy.
<br />
<br /><br />--------------------------
<br />
<br /><br />OK - so Abram has been impatient on this point but I guess I am ready  
<br />
too:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All right. It is a normal tendency for scientist. It is like wanting

<br /><br />I always think of the Sydney Opera House as Platonia. You cannot  
<br />
predict how it looks on the outside if you are teleported into the  
<br />
foyer!
<br />
<br />Also, the Tardis of Doctor Who has a similar asymmetry between outside  
<br />
and inside view.
<br />
<br />Are you saying Platonia has no outside? The true inside of all  
<br />
outsides - just like the 1st person perspective, in fact.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is like deciding to believe only in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the third person description view, abstracting away our experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and subjectivity. Then the &quot;I&quot;, free-will, decisions, and eventually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;consciousness&quot; are explained  ... away.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes - and then, to make matters worse, we turn the whole morass of  
<br />
uncertainty over to the religionists who reify a metaphysical  
<br />
abstraction which just confounds the whole thing further.
