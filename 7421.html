<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; wrong with it.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's interesting how different people react to things.  I've actually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been through this (see previous post); it's not theoretical for me.  And

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would do it again, and wish my dentist could use this technique.
</em><br />
<br />I thought that you said that the pain wasn't all that terrible.
<br />
Moreover---and this is key---were there or were there not better
<br />
anesthetics available?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Of course, in my case, is was for a semi-surgical procedure that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could probably have withstood with conscious sedation; I don't think I'd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choose this for open heart surgery!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is a case where I voluntarily chose to undergo a mildly painful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience with the foreknowledge that I would have no recall of it.  I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am none the worse for it.  Did I &quot;experience&quot; pain?  Yes, so I am told. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Was that experience real?  Sure.  Can I relive that experience in my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory?  Not a chance.  And that's how I wanted it.  What is so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; revolting about it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What's behind the strong emotion here?  (You seem to have had a similar 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reaction to the events depicted in Brin's &quot;Kiln People.&quot;)
</em><br />
<br />The strong emotion is the mistaken idea that can come to people
<br />
that there is a free lunch here: namely, that anything goes so
<br />
long as it's not remembered. Where will this stop?  Can we at
<br />
once begin the horrific and gruesome experiments in the penal
<br />
institutions?  (After all, I am sure that a number of scientists
<br />
are truly interested in pain, and so if we conveniently remove
<br />
the moral element here---since the inmates don't remember the
<br />
pain it doesn't count---they can go for broke.)
<br />
<br />So would it be worth it to you to be awakened every night at 3am
<br />
and hideously tortured for an hour provided (1) you never remember
<br />
it the next day (2) there is no adverse ill effect (say, lack of
<br />
sleep), and (3) you are very well paid for it, say $1000 per day?
<br />
<br />If anyone wants to go for that, what then if subjectively the 
<br />
hour of torture is made to be a century?  So that during each
<br />
nightly century you realize over the decades and decades that
<br />
the fool that you are during the day has made and is making a
<br />
gross mistake. For you come to realize after the first few
<br />
years of some particular night that your real life is a life
<br />
of total pain and agony; that the mere days which interrupt
<br />
the centuries (the days that your day self can remember) are
<br />
relatively meaningless interludes, as nothing compared to
<br />
each night's torment.
<br />
<br />Or, on the other hand, since by the next morning you don't
<br />
remember it, what difference did it make????
<br />
