<br />
Any particular reason why you chose to PATENT your theory? And what do
<br />
propose to use the patent for? Are you going to sue the entire world
<br />
for patent infringement when it is approved? Has it not occurred to
<br />
you there might be around 10 billions years of prior art, or doesn't
<br />
that matter any more. Or are you doing it to show up the US patent
<br />
office like those recent Aussie wags who managed to get a US patent
<br />
for the wheel.
<br />
<br />Cheers

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ross Model of the Universe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [0008] I have proposed what I believe is the simplest yet model of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe. I call my model the &quot;The Ross Model of the Universe&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Processes described and claimed herein can be used to describe and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain all elements of the universe including photons, electrons,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; protons, neutrons, atomic nuclei, heat, temperature, magnetism and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gravity. A preferred embodiment of the invention is a model described
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; below. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tronnies, Entrons and Photons 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [0009] According to this model, the entire universe and everything in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it, from photons to electrons to protons to galaxies, is comprised of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing but a single type of elementary charged point particle. I call
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these point particles &quot;tronnies&quot;. These tronnies also carry the Coulomb
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; force that is the only force in the universe. A tronnie has no mass and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no volume but it has a charge equal to plus e or minus e. Also,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; according to this model the only forces in the universe are Coulomb
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forces produced by these tronnies. Each tronnie is repelled by the force
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fields of tronnies with like charges and attracted by the force fields
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of tronnies with opposite charges. Tronnies repel themselves so they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never travel more slowly than the speed of light. Tronnies tend to pair
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up with a plus tronnie and a minus tronnie in relatively stable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; configurations that I call &quot;entrons&quot;. An entron is a new addition to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ross Model. It is comprised of one plus tronnie and one minus tronnie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with each tronnie of the entron traveling in circles faster than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speed of light (typically .pi.c/2, in the entron's reference frame). An
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entron is the basic energy quantum in the universe. Entrons may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integral parts of particles such as protons, atoms, molecules and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high-energy electrons. Entrons trapped in matter represent the matter's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heat energy. Entrons released from matter continue to circle with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same frequency as when it was trapped; however it also speeds off at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speed of light. It cannot however travel in a straight line. To do so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; while circling at 1.57c would require it to go slower than the speed of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; light during part of each cycle. As a consequence it travels in circles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with diameters 160 time larger than its own circle and this double
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circling configuration does travel in a straight line at the speed of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; light. It is a photon. The circling tronnies provide the energy of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; photon, hc/.lambda., where h is Planck's constant and .lambda. is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; photon's wavelength which is related to the entron's diameter, d', by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; .lambda.=320d'. In my preferred photon model each photon is comprised of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one entron that orbits in a circle of diameter .lambda./2 at 1.57c in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the photon's reference frame, with the photon (and its reference frame)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traveling forward at a speed of c. The result is that the entron
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oscillates with a frequency of 160 times the frequency of the photon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the entron inhabits. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Neutrinos and Gravity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [0010] Neutrinos are very high-energy photons. Each neutrino comprises a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high-energy, high frequency entron. Neutrinos, like other photons,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; travel in substantially straight lines at the speed of light with its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entron circling within the photon in circles having a diameter of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; .lambda./2 where .lambda. is the neutrino's wavelength. Most neutrinos
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; illuminating the earth pass right through it. Neutrinos can pass right
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through the nuclei of atoms and even protons. Gravity results from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Coulomb force fields emanating from neutrinos as the neutrinos pass at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the speed of light through matter. These Coulomb force fields travel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rearward and sideways along the trail of neutrinos. The sideways
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; components cancel, but the rearward components add pushing the matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through which they are passing back toward the source of the neutrinos.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus, neutrinos from the sun passing through the earth (about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 100,000,000 per square centimeter per second) provide the &quot;gravity&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; holding the earth in its orbit around the sun. Neutrinos from the black
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hole in the center of the Milky Way hold all the stars of the Milky Way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (including our sun) and us in our positions in our galaxy. Neutrinos
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; captured in the earth and later released provide the earth its gravity. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Electrons 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [0011] Three entrons (together comprised of a total of three plus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tronnies and three minus tronnies), one of the entrons being a part of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high-energy photon and having a diameter smaller than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3.2.times.10.sup.-15 m, combine in pair production to produce a pair of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electrons (a negatron and a positron). The negatron is comprised of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plus tronnie orbiting in a tight circle of radius r at a speed of 1.57
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times the speed of light with two minus tronies orbiting around the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circular path of the plus tronnie, also at radius r, one-fourth period
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behind the plus tronnie. The positron is comprised of a minus tronnie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and two plus tronnies with their positions reversed from that of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; negatron. Although tronnies have no mass and as such provide no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resistance to any applied force, when a tronnie combines with two other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tronnies to form an electron, the resulting dynamic combination does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provide a resistance to applied forces. This is the creation of &quot;mass&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is substantially stationary &quot;energy&quot;. A plus or minus electrons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can capture the entron portion of a photon with the entron circling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behind the electron forming an equilateral cone. The entron propels the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electron at speeds of about one percent of the speed of light. These
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; captured entrons provide the electrons with its &quot;voltage&quot;. Electrons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (plus and minus) can capture the entron portions of neutrinos, greatly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increasing the electron's mass/energy. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Protons, Neutrons and Atoms 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [0012] Three very high-energy electrons (one negatron and two positrons,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each having captured the entron part of a neutrino to increase their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mass several hundred times) combine to form each proton (with mass 1800
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times the rest mass of an electron). A neutron is a proton with an extra
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; negatron with a captured entron propelling it at about one percent of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the speed of light. This entron has an energy of 0.74 mev (equivalent to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a mass of 0.0023055.times.10.sup.-27 kg the mass difference between a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neutron and a proton and an electron). The corresponding diameter of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entron is 5.25.times.10.sup.-15 m. In my preferred model of the neutron
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the two tronnies circling behind the negatron driving the negatron at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speeds of about one percent of the speed of light, also pass through the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; center of the proton part of the neutron. Inside the nucleus of an atom,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such the deuterium nucleus the two tronnies of the entron pass through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both protons in the nucleus, holding them together. (The reader should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; note here, no strong force is needed, just an electron and its captured
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entron.) So the nucleus of an atom is (according to my preferred model)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing more than a combination of protons and negatrons (along with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variety of entrons) all in dynamic equilibrium. Some specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; configurations are proposed. There is no &quot;strong&quot; force holding the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nuclei together. Coulomb forces hold them together. The Coulomb force is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the only force in the universe. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Heat, Temperature and Magnetism 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [0013] Heat is nothing more than entrons (circling tronnie pairs)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trapped in matter. Temperature is a measure of that heat. When entrons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; escape matter they do so as photons. Magnetism results when plus and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minus tronnies travel in large loops (such as through the earth to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; produce its magnetic field or out one pole and in the other pole or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through a bar magnet or through the center of a current carrying coil of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wire). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Light Speed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [0014] Photons in a light beam slow down when passing through a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Coulombic reference frame (such as a laboratory where light speed is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being made) moving opposite the beam. And they speed up when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference frame is moving in the same direction of the beam. Based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this preferred model, time does not slow down when you go fast and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things do not get shorter. Simultaneous events are simultaneous in all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference frames. Time is absolute. When an astronaut returns to earth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he and his twin brother can have their next birthday party together at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same time. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ross Model Consistent with Other Experimental Results 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [0015] These are merely examples. This basic model proposed here appears
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be consistent with all experimental results relating to particle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics, chemistry, optics, fusion and fission that I have considered.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This preferred model can be used to explain radio waves, electric
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current flow, the thermoelectric effects, and the beginning and end of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Evolving Model 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [0016] I admit that some of my explanations are speculative and I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure that people more familiar with particular technologies than I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; improve on my explanations. When they do I will just modify my model to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accommodate the better explanations. As is clearly obvious from a review
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the parent patent applications preceding this one, I have already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modified my model numerous times since I began developing it about four
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years ago. The model has gotten simpler with each modification. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primary difference between the model described in this application and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the models of the parent applications listed above is the &quot;entron&quot;. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; energy of the entron corresponds to the net Coulomb integrated forces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acting between the entron's circling tronnies and this energy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponds to the known photon energy hc/?. The entron also provides
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electrons with their electric energy (their voltage) which they easily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give up as heat in a resister or as photons in a radio transmitterer. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Einstein's Two Major Goofs 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [0017] The other important discovery disclosed in this application is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the vacuum speed of light is not constant, but slows down or speeds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up, when passing through a Coulombic reference frame, by an amount equal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the speed of the reference frame. For example if a Coulombic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference frame is moving at a speed of 0.1 c in a direction opposite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the direction of a light beam, the light beam will slow down to 0.9 c.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the reference frame is moving at a speed of 0.2 c in the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direction of a light beam passing through it, the light beam will speed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up to a speed of 1.2 c. So that someone measuring the speed of light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with equipment moving with the reference frame will measure the speed of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; light as the difference between the (1) the speed of the frame and (2)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the speed of light. In both cases the measured speed of light will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constant at c. Einstein's first major goof was to assume that the speed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of light was constant based on the results of the Michelson--Morley
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments that showed that the &quot;measured&quot; speed of light is always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constant. This discovery makes some of the most complicated features of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Special Theory of Relativity unnecessary. Einstein's second major
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; goof was not to recognize that matter-penetrating photons (neutrinos)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are responsible for gravity. My discovery that neutrinos &quot;carry&quot; gravity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes most of the complicated features of General Relativity unnecessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if not wrong. Certainly, masses do not curve space. Space is merely the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emptiness between things--you can't curve it. Space is also infinite in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all three dimensions and there are only three dimensions: up and down,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; left and right and forward and backwards. Time is not a forth dimension
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time is a measurable period between events. Time is absolute and is not
</em><br />
