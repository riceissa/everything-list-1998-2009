I was attempting to -invalidate- that argument against the existence of the
<br />
universe, actually, by saying that in three truth values, which the
<br />
Physicists can't rule out as being the more accurate logic of their
<br />
universe, the argument &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; is not a tautology and,
<br />
therefore, can't necessarily be applied.
<br />
<br />However, in binary logic, the Physicist's universe (or whatever Everything
<br />
means) can't exist.
<br />
<br />I doubt self-reference is inherently the problem in light of things like
<br />
Tarski's fixed point theorems which provide concrete examples of wffs that
<br />
are self-referencing, in terms of Godel numbers, if I recall.  That proof I
<br />
was exposed to was not an existence proof of self-referencing wffs merely by
<br />
&quot;logical flamboyancy&quot; but by the providing an example of an actual -class-
<br />
of self-referencing wffs.  Obviously, the above argument does not explicitly
<br />
involve wffs (it does, however, implicitly), and I am -only- making a case
<br />
for plausibility at this particular moment.
<br />
<br />I see no problems with the argument given that in binary logic, their
<br />
universe can't exist; this, to me, convinces me that the Physicist's
<br />
universe can't operate on binary logic by Occam's Razor as -none- of the
<br />
data in any experiment would fit the result that confirms their speculation
<br />
that their universe exists.
<br />
<br />Ergo, the Physicist's universe must operate on at least three truth values.
<br />
(Consequently, it exists.)  This to me is a more elegant solution to the
<br />
argument than citing self-referencing issues as automatically damning.  If
<br />
natural language can be used to prove the Heine-Borel theorem, without the
<br />
need for wffs, then why must a statement about Everything be formalized in
<br />
machine-level code with wffs?
<br />
<br />If there is further objection to my line of thinking, -please- point it out
<br />
to Everyone (which I hope is well-defined or else no one would know what I
<br />
mean, right?)  ;)
<br />
<br />Thank you for your remarks; I find all input extremely productive!!

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; until recently with Tegmark's MUH paper and related material (like by

David
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Wolpert of NASA).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The logical positivists were motivated to axiomatize in the predicate

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculus the laws of scientific theories in the early 20th century,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first because they believed that it would guarantee the cognitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significance of theoretical terms in the theory (such as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unphysical ether of maxwell's electromagnetism), and then later
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because it had evolved into an attempt to specify the proper form of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific theory. In practice this had too many problems and was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually abandoned. One of the consequences of this program was that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axiomatizing the laws of a theory in first order predicate calculus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with equality was that such a formulation of a theory always implied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various unintended interpretations. The amount of effort needed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; block these unintended interpretations was out of proportion with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; benefit received by axiomatization.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I was trying to answer Bruno's objections regarding set theory being too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rich to be the 'ultimate math' the MUH needs to propose what the
</em><br />
universe is
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and I quipped that that was because math is invented or discovered to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; further its own end by logicians, for the most part, and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; metamathematicians such as Cantor had no apparent interest in physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; things or furthering the pursuit of Physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Another question of Bruno's was my motivation.  I started this quest
</em><br />
hoping
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that three truth values were sufficient to develop a set theory with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universal set that was in a classical logic sense consistent to ZFC set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; theory.  Or, if not true, prove that and figure out why.  Perhaps more
</em><br />
truth
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; values would solve that.  My main motivation has definitely not been to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;rescue&quot; a major apparent shortcoming in the MUH as I started this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on-and-off quest in 2003 with no internet connection or resources such
</em><br />
as a
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; deluge of journals (ie, a good library).  How it started was that
</em><br />
someone
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; online in a place such as this used Russell-like arguments to -prove-
</em><br />
that
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the Physic's universe -does not exist- for essentially the same reasons
</em><br />
a
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universal set can't seem to be non-antimonious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Suppose Everything is well defined along with its partner, containment
</em><br />
(such
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as the earth is contained in the solar system by the definitions of
</em><br />
both).
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Then Everything does not exist.  Proof:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Consider the thing, call it &quot;this something,&quot; that is the qualia of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; things that do not contain themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Then this something contains itself if and only if this something does
</em><br />
not
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; contain itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am suspect of the claim that a logical argument such as the above,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which relies on a paradox of self-reference, could be used to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; demonstrate the non-existence of the so-called Everything. Also, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personally remain unconvinced that there is anything problematic about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the exitence of the universe of universes, or the ensemble of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible mathematical structures, thought it may not be well defined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at present. I don't believe that this is simply the union of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axiomatic systems. If trying to define the Everything as a set implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a contradiction, then fine -- it isn't a set, it's an ensemble, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't carry any of the connotations that are implied by the use of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;set&quot; in the mathematical sense. Therefore each entity in the ensemble
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a unique collection of n axioms that has no necessary relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to any other axiom collection. What happens in an axiom system stays
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in that axiom system, and can't bleed over to the next one on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list. Some of these may be equivalent to each other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A = The collection of all finite axiom systems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B = The collection of all consistent finite axiom systems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;cardinality&quot; of B is not greater than the &quot;cardinality&quot; of A.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Scare qutoes since cardinality is a property of sets and these may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not be sets if that would imply contradiction.) It is B that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting from the point of this discussion since it is believed (I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't know of any proof of this) that only systems in B could produce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the type of rational and orderly physical existence capable of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; containing observers who can think about their existence as we do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (SASs, or Self-Aware Substructures). The collection of all those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems capable of containing SASs is the most interesting from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point of view of the present discussion, and must have a &quot;cardinality&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not greater than that of B, since many axiom systems are too simple to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain SAS, and the ones with them are expected to predominate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The idea of this ensemble so propounded does not seem to entail an ad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absurdum paradox such as you gave above. Further, didn't I see you say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhere that you don't even believe in sets? I apologize if I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mistaken, but if that is true, I can't see how that statement would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconcile with sincere belief in the validity of the agument you gave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If there is some genuine logical inconsistency in the above, please
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point it out to me as to me this (which is Tegmark) seems like a good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direction to go in trying to formulate a proper definition of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; By a simple logical tautology (a variant of ad absurdum), this proves
</em><br />
that
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;Everything is well defined&quot; is a false statement.  It also raises
</em><br />
doubts as
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to the existence of this so called Everything.  Maybe this google group
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; should end?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't think so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My quip was something along the lines of, &quot;however, in any ternary
</em><br />
logic, ad
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; absurdum is not a tautology and therefore, can't be used here.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That discussion got me going and while mostly off task, I've been
</em><br />
thinking
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about this on and off since then.  Basically, my motivation to &quot;rescue&quot;
</em><br />
a
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universal set is so that Cantor's dream of formalizing in a mathematical
</em><br />
way
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; some type of deity could be realized.  The analogy would be Abraham
</em><br />
Robinson
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is to Issac Newton (on infinitesimals) as Quinne (et al) are to Cantor
</em><br />
(on a
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universal set).  Right idea, but never considered using fuzzy logic not
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be delved into much until Lukaseiwicz, Zadeh, and others revitalized
</em><br />
FL.  As
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it took an army of giants to &quot;rescue&quot; Newton's intuition which was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; criticized by another philosopher (Berkeley, akin to Russell) to develop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; enough tools (compactness theorem), it is taking an army of logicians to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;rescue&quot; Cantor's intuition about God which, and this may be apocrypha,
</em><br />
he
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; believed to be his maximally infinite set.  He thought infinity must be
</em><br />
an
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; attribute of God and therefore delved into infinite sets, hoping, I
</em><br />
assume,
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to reach some type of Omega set that contains all sets and would then be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; necessarily the &quot;biggest&quot; infinity.  Cantor proved that the power set of
</em><br />
any
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; set is &quot;larger,&quot; however, and settled his own quest in his own way
</em><br />
though
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm guessing he -desired- the opposite conclusion to have been reached.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Others in the FL army are trying to reach that conclusion which Cantor,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; chronologically, would have to have re-discovered much mathematics to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; realize in the way this army is doing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So the basic motivation is to find some type of thing with maximality in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; some important sense and study it.  With the MUH, now I suspect that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Everything would be a likely candidate for a literal God and atheism
</em><br />
might
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have to suddenly be the irrational side to be on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So on this note, the works of David Hawkins (a psychiatrist and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; spiritualist) inspired me to ponder the following question, along with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Tegmark's articulation of the MUH, of course.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Which mathematical structure -is- the universe in Physics?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I suspect it might already exist and has been studied.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree. We could exist in the Mandlebrot set for all we know.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Determining which mathematical structure is our own universe is likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practically impossible, though determining which classes of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical structures are more likely candidates may be doable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's like finding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the correct non-Euclidean Geometry applicable to the universe we
</em><br />
perceive
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; gets us to a GR that coincides with observation (for the most part?).  I
</em><br />
am
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; guessing that the universe must have an MV-algebra structure.
</em><br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV-algebra">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV-algebra</a>
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I was trying to rejoin Bruno's &quot;too rich&quot; -valid- (imho) objection to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Tegmark's approach in his MUH paper by concocting a theory that was far
</em><br />
less
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rich.  All I need are things and a notion of containment.  I was going
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; call it container theory.  Then there'd be no need to develop something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; strong enough to do numbers, infinite sets, and such, so with those
</em><br />
goals
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; gone, so much more is available to Physics without having to squeeze any
</em><br />
set
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; theory or logic into Physics.  It's there, I suspect, in -classical
</em><br />
logic-
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and recent -algebra- in the guise of MV-algebra.  This area is exactly
</em><br />
what
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I mean by thing and containment.  Now if you look at the wiki article
</em><br />
above,
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observe, firstly, how little there is reliance on sets or non-classical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Secondly, I could view all the letters that would normally be variables
</em><br />
as
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; things in the &quot;container theory&quot; I was trying to work on.  In
</em><br />
MV-algebras,
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the variables represent truth degrees and the carrier of the MV-algebra
</em><br />
is
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the truth set, the set of all truth values which has cardinality two in
</em><br />
all
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; classical logics.  But this seems promising for my 'container theory'
</em><br />
which
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I was assuming someone had done that I just had to find somewhere.  Now
</em><br />
if
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; each variable is now a worldline, one think of it that way.  The carrier
</em><br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the MV-algebra is the set of all worldlines in one parallel universe.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significance of theoretical terms in the theory (such as the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unphysical ether of maxwell's electromagnetism), and then later
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because it had evolved into an attempt to specify the proper form of a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific theory. In practice this had too many problems and was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually abandoned. One of the consequences of this program was that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axiomatizing the laws of a theory in first order predicate calculus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with equality was that such a formulation of a theory always implied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various unintended interpretations. The amount of effort needed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; block these unintended interpretations was out of proportion with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; benefit received by axiomatization.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I was trying to answer Bruno's objections regarding set theory being too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rich to be the 'ultimate math' the MUH needs to propose what the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and I quipped that that was because math is invented or discovered to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; further its own end by logicians, for the most part, and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; metamathematicians such as Cantor had no apparent interest in physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; things or furthering the pursuit of Physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Another question of Bruno's was my motivation.  I started this quest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hoping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that three truth values were sufficient to develop a set theory with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universal set that was in a classical logic sense consistent to ZFC set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; theory.  Or, if not true, prove that and figure out why.  Perhaps more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; values would solve that.  My main motivation has definitely not been to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;rescue&quot; a major apparent shortcoming in the MUH as I started this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on-and-off quest in 2003 with no internet connection or resources such as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; deluge of journals (ie, a good library).  How it started was that someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; online in a place such as this used Russell-like arguments to -prove-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the Physic's universe -does not exist- for essentially the same reasons a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universal set can't seem to be non-antimonious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Suppose Everything is well defined along with its partner, containment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as the earth is contained in the solar system by the definitions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Then Everything does not exist.  Proof:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Consider the thing, call it &quot;this something,&quot; that is the qualia of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; things that do not contain themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Then this something contains itself if and only if this something does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; contain itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am suspect of the claim that a logical argument such as the above,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which relies on a paradox of self-reference, could be used to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; demonstrate the non-existence of the so-called Everything. Also, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personally remain unconvinced that there is anything problematic about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the exitence of the universe of universes, or the ensemble of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible mathematical structures, thought it may not be well defined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at present. I don't believe that this is simply the union of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axiomatic systems. If trying to define the Everything as a set implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a contradiction, then fine -- it isn't a set, it's an ensemble, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't carry any of the connotations that are implied by the use of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;set&quot; in the mathematical sense. Therefore each entity in the ensemble
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a unique collection of n axioms that has no necessary relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to any other axiom collection. What happens in an axiom system stays
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in that axiom system, and can't bleed over to the next one on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list. Some of these may be equivalent to each other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A = The collection of all finite axiom systems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B = The collection of all consistent finite axiom systems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;cardinality&quot; of B is not greater than the &quot;cardinality&quot; of A.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Scare qutoes since cardinality is a property of sets and these may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not be sets if that would imply contradiction.) It is B that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting from the point of this discussion since it is believed (I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't know of any proof of this) that only systems in B could produce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the type of rational and orderly physical existence capable of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; containing observers who can think about their existence as we do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (SASs, or Self-Aware Substructures). The collection of all those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems capable of containing SASs is the most interesting from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point of view of the present discussion, and must have a &quot;cardinality&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not greater than that of B, since many axiom systems are too simple to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain SAS, and the ones with them are expected to predominate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The idea of this ensemble so propounded does not seem to entail an ad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absurdum paradox such as you gave above. Further, didn't I see you say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhere that you don't even believe in sets? I apologize if I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mistaken, but if that is true, I can't see how that statement would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconcile with sincere belief in the validity of the agument you gave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If there is some genuine logical inconsistency in the above, please
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point it out to me as to me this (which is Tegmark) seems like a good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direction to go in trying to formulate a proper definition of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; By a simple logical tautology (a variant of ad absurdum), this proves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;Everything is well defined&quot; is a false statement.  It also raises doubts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to the existence of this so called Everything.  Maybe this google group
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; should end?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't think so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My quip was something along the lines of, &quot;however, in any ternary logic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; absurdum is not a tautology and therefore, can't be used here.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That discussion got me going and while mostly off task, I've been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about this on and off since then.  Basically, my motivation to &quot;rescue&quot; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universal set is so that Cantor's dream of formalizing in a mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; some type of deity could be realized.  The analogy would be Abraham
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Robinson
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is to Issac Newton (on infinitesimals) as Quinne (et al) are to Cantor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universal set).  Right idea, but never considered using fuzzy logic not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be delved into much until Lukaseiwicz, Zadeh, and others revitalized FL.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it took an army of giants to &quot;rescue&quot; Newton's intuition which was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; criticized by another philosopher (Berkeley, akin to Russell) to develop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; enough tools (compactness theorem), it is taking an army of logicians to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;rescue&quot; Cantor's intuition about God which, and this may be apocrypha,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; believed to be his maximally infinite set.  He thought infinity must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; attribute of God and therefore delved into infinite sets, hoping, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to reach some type of Omega set that contains all sets and would then be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; necessarily the &quot;biggest&quot; infinity.  Cantor proved that the power set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; set is &quot;larger,&quot; however, and settled his own quest in his own way though
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm guessing he -desired- the opposite conclusion to have been reached.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Others in the FL army are trying to reach that conclusion which Cantor,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; chronologically, would have to have re-discovered much mathematics to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; realize in the way this army is doing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So the basic motivation is to find some type of thing with maximality in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; some important sense and study it.  With the MUH, now I suspect that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Everything would be a likely candidate for a literal God and atheism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have to suddenly be the irrational side to be on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So on this note, the works of David Hawkins (a psychiatrist and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; spiritualist) inspired me to ponder the following question, along with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Tegmark's articulation of the MUH, of course.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Which mathematical structure -is- the universe in Physics?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I suspect it might already exist and has been studied.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree. We could exist in the Mandlebrot set for all we know.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Determining which mathematical structure is our own universe is likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practically impossible, though determining which classes of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical structures are more likely candidates may be doable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's like finding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the correct non-Euclidean Geometry applicable to the universe we perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; gets us to a GR that coincides with observation (for the most part?).  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; guessing that the universe must have an MV-algebra structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV-algebra">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV-algebra</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I was trying to rejoin Bruno's &quot;too rich&quot; -valid- (imho) objection to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Tegmark's approach in his MUH paper by concocting a theory that was far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rich.  All I need are things and a notion of containment.  I was going to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; call it container theory.  Then there'd be no need to develop something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; strong enough to do numbers, infinite sets, and such, so with those goals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; gone, so much more is available to Physics without having to squeeze any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; theory or logic into Physics.  It's there, I suspect, in -classical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and recent -algebra- in the guise of MV-algebra.  This area is exactly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I mean by thing and containment.  Now if you look at the wiki article
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observe, firstly, how little there is reliance on sets or non-classical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Secondly, I could view all the letters that would normally be variables
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; things in the &quot;container theory&quot; I was trying to work on.  In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MV-algebras,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the variables represent truth degrees and the carrier of the MV-algebra
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the truth set, the set of all truth values which has cardinality two in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; classical logics.  But this seems promising for my 'container theory'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I was assuming someone had done that I just had to find somewhere.  Now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; each variable is now a worldline, one think of it that way.  The carrier
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the MV-algebra is the set of all worldlines in one parallel universe.  An
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ideal could be a sub-universe that isn't parallel.  The circle-plus is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; notion of joining and the circle-times is the notion of intersecting or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; meeting (to use Boolean terminology which is much more compatible with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; natural languages).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The 0 in the MV-algebra could be intuitively compared to that which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; nothing or the empty container.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The notion of containment is given by the ordering induced by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; circle-plus and negation operator, listed in detail in Siegfried
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gottwald's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;A Treatise on Many-Valued Logics&quot; in section 9.2.1 on pages 215-234.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So if each variable represents a world-line consistent with -some- laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; some Physics, which vary from parallel to parallel (a parallel would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ideal of an MV-algebra), then maybe this way to view MV-algebras would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; interesting to a Physicist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; To glue MV-algebras together into what the multiverse might be, not much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; more complex than a simple union would suffice, I think (not having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; along those lines yet)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
