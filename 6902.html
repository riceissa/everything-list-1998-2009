Subject: Observer-Moment Measure from Universe Measure
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To apply Wei's method, first we need to get serious about what is an OM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We need a formal model and description of a particular OM.  Consider, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, someone's brain when he is having a particular experience.  He is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eating chocolate ice cream while listening to Beethoven's 5th symphony,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on his 30th birthday.  Imagine that we could scan his brain with advanced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technology and record his neural activity.  Imagine further that with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aid of an advanced brain model we are able to prune out the unnecessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information and distill this to the essence of the experience.  We come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up with a pattern that represents that observer moment.  Any system which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiates that pattern genuinely creates an experience of that observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment.  This pattern is something that can be specified, recorded and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written down in some form.  It probably involves a huge volume of data.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, now that we have a handle on what a particular OM is, we can more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasonably ask whether a universe instantiates it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Wouldn't it be better to think of OMs as programs just like we think of
<br />
universes? If you only look at patterns then you get the problem which you
<br />
later mention like crystals that can represent an OM of a person etc. The
<br />
patterns one is looking for should be capable of doing computations....
<br />
<br /><br />If I define OMs as a programs (in a particular computational state), then
<br />
that is the same as saying that OMs are universes in particular states. One
<br />
can then argue that these universes are very complex and have high measures
<br />
and are thus likely to be found embedded in simple, low measure, universes.
<br />
Then one can also address the problem of what qualia actually are. They are
<br />
'events' that occur in an OM's universe.
<br />
<br /><br />In case of persons one can think of the neural network formed by the brain.
<br />
The events that take place in the universe defined by the neural network are
<br />
the qualia we experience. So, I think that Wei's interpretation program has
<br />
to do more than just spot certain patterns localized in time.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Similarly if I simulate the solar system on a pc, then this defines a
<br />
universe in which an event could be that jupiter is at a certain position at
<br />
a certain time. To 'see' this in terms of the electrons moving through the
<br />
transistors one has to first 'see' the program. Seeing the program requires
<br />
one to study the way the object interacts with its environment which means
<br />
that you have to take it out of the universe and study how it behaves when
<br />
you expose it to alternative inputs.
<br />
