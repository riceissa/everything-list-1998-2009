<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Thanks to all who replied to my question.  This question has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bothered me for years, and I have hopes that some progress can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be made towards an answer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I've heard some interesting concepts, including:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (1) &quot;Numbers must exist, therefore 'something' must exist.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (2) &quot;Something exists because Nothingness cannot non-Exist.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Perhaps the above two are equivalent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; With respect to (1) above, why must numbers exist?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure that any definitive answer can be given to this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question. A possible argument is that the existence of numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by themselves is much easier to accept than the existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;usual material things&quot; in a classical sense. Of course, even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if it was really a weakest assumption, it is not granted.
</em><br />
<br /><br />What can be said about numbers is that it is impossible to explain what 
<br />
numbers are to someone who does not already knows what they are.
<br />
If a TOE does not implicitly or explicitly presupposes the existetnce 
<br />
of natural numbers, then the natural numbers will not be definable in 
<br />
that TOE, and for this reason that TOE will not be a plausible TOE, 
<br />
although Hartree Field, if I remember correctly, makes a case for a 
<br />
science without number. (Of course such a science will be aristotelian 
<br />
and un-platonist automatically).
<br />
That is why I put &quot;arithmetical realism&quot; explicitly in the definition 
<br />
of comp (&quot;yes doctor&quot; + &quot;Church thesis + Arithmetical realism).
<br />
<br />Once you accept the existence of natural numbers, and of addition, 
<br />
multiplication; you get freely universal dovetailing, and thus you get 
<br />
enough for comp-like kind of TOE.
<br />
For the notion of observer or lobian entities, you need the belief in 
<br />
numbers, addition and multiplication; but also of some amount of 
<br />
induction, that is, the axioms saying, for any formula A(x) already 
<br />
definable, that :
<br />
<br />{A(0) and for all n [A(n) -&gt; A(n+1)]}  implies that for all n A(n).
<br />
<br />(In english, the induction axioms say that if some property is true for 
<br />
the number 0, and remains true when going from any number n to the 
<br />
successor of n, then the property will be true for all number n. Think 
<br />
about an infinite range of dominoes).
<br />
<br />Those induction axioms are enough to explain why lobian machine will 
<br />
have enough introspection ability to discover their ignorance and to 
<br />
reflect about.
<br />
<br />So numbers are needed. Are numbers enough? Ontologically: perhaps (and 
<br />
even surely with some Occam razor in case comp is accepted). 
<br />
Epistemologically: No. By incompleteness a lot of apparently simple 
<br />
problems needs theories far more powerful than Peano Arithmetic (say) 
<br />
to find solution. The use of analytical tools (complex analysis) in 
<br />
number theory is a symptom of that phenomenon.
<br />
<br />Just to explain the behavior of natural numbers you need the whole 
<br />
mathematics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The idea behind &quot;numbers must exist&quot; is that &quot;God Himself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot make that two plus two equates something different of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; four&quot;. Another way to say it is that &quot;even if there were nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or no thing) there would remain that whenever/wherever there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be something in which natural numbers could be thought of,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Fermat conjecture should be true&quot;. If natural numbers did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not exist, this necessity would immediately apply to them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whenever and wherever they appear. I would say that the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such necessities is not different from natural numbers themselves.
</em><br />
<br />I agree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, it is too strong to claim that natural numbers exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individually and one independently of another. The arguement is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that &quot;arithmetics&quot; as a whole exists by itself (and as something).
</em><br />
<br />Yes. It would be ridiculous and actually inconsistent to believe that 
<br />
the number 13 can be suppressed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. It should even forbid the existence of a &quot;Fermat theorem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constraint&quot; and it is hard to imagine (at leat for me) that such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a constraint could not exist. So it is not so puzzling (at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to me) that something exist.
</em><br />
<br />Mmmhhh... By accepting the numbers I would agree. Nevertheless, our 
<br />
very ability to &quot;understand&quot; numbers is, for me, as mysterious as the 
<br />
understanding of a word like &quot;consciousness&quot; itself.
<br />
I feel a little bit like Colin McGuin and tend to feel that numbers are 
<br />
sort of a necessary mystery.
