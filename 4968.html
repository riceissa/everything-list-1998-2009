<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How do we define (de)coherence? What makes interference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happen or be lost?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
First, these are two separate questions. 
<br />
<br />Decoherence is said to occur when two waves (or wavefunctions) which 
<br />
were initially in phase (or having a constant or well-defined phase 
<br />
difference) are no longer in phase.  This can be for a variety of 
<br />
reasons.  Typically, this is cited as occurring due to interactions with 
<br />
large numbers of particles (or a single interaction with one particle 
<br />
that goes on to affect a large number of particles).   In this case the 
<br />
fact that these particles have a large number of internal states means 
<br />
that it is unlikely that the two waves remain in phase. 
<br />
<br />Another example of decoherence would be in light from a regular 
<br />
light-bulb.  The polarization of the light is subject to rapid and 
<br />
random changes in direction (due to emission of individual photons by 
<br />
the bulb), so that while the horizontal and vertical components of the 
<br />
light are instantaneously coherent, they rapidly decohere from each 
<br />
other to give some other value of polarization.  The fact that at any 
<br />
particular instant there is a well defined but random value of 
<br />
polarization for regular light is what allows us to do Young's Double 
<br />
Slits with unpolarized light, as at any point on the screen the light 
<br />
arriving from either slit shares the same polarization, even though the 
<br />
value of this polarization is subject to rapid fluctuations.
<br />
<br />In answer to your second question, the loss of interference (at least in 
<br />
the Copenhagen Interpretation) is due to the collapse of the 
<br />
wavefunction, from a superposition of different possibilities to one 
<br />
actuality.  The Copenhagen Interpretation really does not say anything 
<br />
about what causes this collapse (apart from the nebulously defined 
<br />
notion of observation).  Decoherence has been invoked as one possible 
<br />
explanation for this loss of interference, specifically that once a 
<br />
large number of particles are involved in the quantum system, it is 
<br />
unlikely that any of them will be in phase enough for us to be able to 
<br />
see interference in practice.
<br />
<br />In the Many Worlds Interpretation, it is not necessarily decoherence, 
<br />
but the linearity of the Schroedinger Wave Equation that makes 
<br />
interference disappear.  Specifically, once an observer (or any other 
<br />
system for that matter) interacts with a superposed wavefunction, that 
<br />
system's wavefunction is also put into a superposition of relative 
<br />
states.  The relative states are all separately solutions of the SWE, so 
<br />
linearity prevents them from directly interacting ( = exchanging energy) 
<br />
or subjectively noticing each other through interference, in the same 
<br />
way as ripples on a pond are capable of moving through each other.
<br />
<br />Decoherence comes into the MWI explanation of (apparent) wavefunction 
<br />
collapse once a second observer (or system) interacts with the 
<br />
superposed system.  Let's say our first observer/system has interacted 
<br />
with the particle on its way from the double slits to the screen in such 
<br />
a way that that observer/system knows (or has an unambiguous record of) 
<br />
which slit the particle went through.  Now a second observer is going to 
<br />
record the position the photon strikes the screen.  Under MWI, the 
<br />
particle is *still* in a superposition of states when it reaches the 
<br />
screen.  However, it has also interacted with the first observer system, 
<br />
which for the sake of argument we shall assume consists of a large 
<br />
number of particles.  Because of the interaction with the first 
<br />
observer, the second observer is not just interacting with the 
<br />
wavefunction of the particle that went through the slits, but also with 
<br />
the superposed relative state wavefunctions of the first observer(s).  
<br />
These two relative states are highly unlikely to be in phase because of 
<br />
the large number of particles involved.  Therefore, the second observer 
<br />
is also highly unlikely to observe an interference pattern at the screen 
<br />
when the experiment is repeated many times.
<br />
<br />Note that in MWI the second observer's wavefunction is also split into 
<br />
two relative states by watching the screen, and so she may obtain a 
<br />
result indicating that the particle went through either slit regardless 
<br />
of the first observer's result (who is actually in a superposition of 
<br />
having got both results).  Linearity of the SWE ensures that the second 
<br />
observer's result will always agree with the first observer's result 
<br />
should they compare notes later in that particular branch of the multiverse.
<br />
<br />This is also how the MWI preserves locality in the EPR paradox/Aspect 
<br />
experiments, which I think is an important experimental vindication of MWI.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Take the a double-slit-like experiment. A particle can take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;two paths, A and B. We can in principle detect which path
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the particle went through.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose we can make the detecting apparatus 'non-interfering'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;enough so that the particle is not grossly deflected by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;detection, but can still reach the screen. We know that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;result of this thought-experiment is that interference does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The first answer is that the paths have 'decohered'. But what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exactly does that mean? In a MWI perspective, I like the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explanation that the two universes A and B are different by a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;large number of particles: the electrons in a wire, which carry
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the amplified pulse of the detector, which then reach a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computer, and such and such. Something of the order of 10^23
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;particles have changed state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now suppose we use some kind of very slow detector. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;detection is made by, say, a very slow process such that not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;many particles (suppose only one particle, even though I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;know how to make that detector) change their state before the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interfering particle reaches the screen. After that, we can amplify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this information and know which path the particle went through.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Again, I believe interference would not be possible. But it is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;little harder to say why.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I'm not sure I can answer this question with certainty.  I think it 
<br />
depends on how many possible internal states the recording 
<br />
particle/system may have; the more states, the more decoherence, and the 
<br />
less likely it is that interference will be seen by the second 
<br />
observer.  If the detector had only two possible internal states, I 
<br />
think it is indeed possible for the screen observer to see some 
<br />
interference if the experiment were repeated many times.
<br />
<br />I don't think the Copenhagen Interpretation was designed to include 
<br />
single particles as observers; rather one would include them in the 
<br />
wavefunction of the total system.  Consider as an example Helium.  You 
<br />
could think of one electron as being the observer of the other electron; 
<br />
under CI both are included in the wavefunction nonetheless.  I think 
<br />
that the CI would therefore make different predictions whether or not 
<br />
one assumes that the recording particle qualifies as an observer.  I'm 
<br />
not aware of anything in the CI framework which would help you choose 
<br />
which assumption to make; rather you'd do this retroactively depending 
<br />
on which results you got.   I know that the logical inconsistencies in 
<br />
the CI when more than one observer are included are exactly what led 
<br />
Everett to develop MWI in the first place; if anyone has any specific 
<br />
information about what these inconsistencies were, I'd be very excited 
<br />
to hear about it.
<br />
<br />In the MWI, there is no distinction between observers and other systems, 
<br />
even single particles, and I'm pretty sure that it would predict that 
<br />
the second observer would see some interference in this case, with the 
<br />
amount of interference smoothly (and exponentially rapidly) decreasing 
<br />
with increasing number of internal states of the first observing system 
<br />
(due to decoherence).
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt.
