James, Doug, Bruno, Gilles: 
<br />
<br />thanks for your recent messages!
<br />
I apologize for being such a slow responder.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Although most real numbers are not describable at all, we can easily =

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talk about the set of all real numbers. Now, the Great Programmer (my =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Universal Dovetailer UD) not only dovetails on all computations but =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dovetails on all computations with all real (complex, quaternionic, =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...) oracles. It does so by generating all finite initial segments of =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all reals. 
</em><br />
<br />One should be careful here. Discussions of sets of noncomputable numbers
<br />
and proofs of certain theorems concerning their properties are computable.
<br />
Such computable aspects of R, however, should not distract from the
<br />
fundamental difference between N and R. Most of what's in R is completely
<br />
beyond computation.
<br />
<br />Note that all your initial segments of reals simultaneously are initial
<br />
segments of some of the few computable reals (e.g., fractions).  There are
<br />
countable computable reals but uncountable others. Hence most reals
<br />
are beyond dovetailing. From an information-oriented perspective, reals
<br />
tend to complicate things.  Most reals don't fit the Great Programmer
<br />
religion, which is a simple one.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; At each state of the computation of the UD, there is =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed no place for a real number, BUT, I show below that from the =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first person perspective of an &quot;observer&quot;, the set of all real number =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does play an important role. In fact our prediction will depend on =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the measure on all infinite computationnal histories. More below. 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What do you mean by &quot;an observer inhabits U_k&quot; ?
</em><br />
<br />It means the string sequence E_k is being interpreted as representing
<br />
(among other things) some observer's life in U_k.  The interpreter
<br />
(another observer, possibly a Great Programmer himself) may or may not
<br />
be part of E_k.
<br />
<br />Abstract concepts such as recognition, interpretation, observation
<br />
(popular in our particular universe, not necessarily in others) are
<br />
vague.  Apparently they refer to establishing a relationship between
<br />
an observed thing and the observer's previous knowledge. To repeat,
<br />
any non-trivial relationship of this kind implies that observation
<br />
and previous knowledge share mutual algorithmic information: there is
<br />
a comparatively short algorithm computing observation from knowledge.
<br />
Otherwise the observation will seem random or irregular (like noise)
<br />
from the observer's point of view.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I believe such an expression has no =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (non-ambiguous) meaning once we take seriously the comp hypothesis. =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An observer cannot so easily be said inhabiting a precise U_k. The =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer cannot be localized in a unique computation. He can only be =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; associate with an infinity of &quot;sufficiently similar&quot; computations =
</em><br />
<br />Why? It all can happen in a particular computable world - no obvious
<br />
need to sum over &quot;an infinity of sufficiently similar&quot; computations.&quot;
<br />
Vague concepts such as &quot;sufficiently similar&quot; complicate things: making
<br />
them precise requires additional bits of information.
<br />
<br />This reminds me of my brother (a theoretical physicist) who also used to
<br />
insist on summing over all computations. I guess it's the way physicists
<br />
get trained. But &quot;summing over everything&quot; basically seems covered by the
<br />
universal Solomonoff-Levin distribution (whose properties tend to remind
<br />
physicists of more familiar path integrals):  most of the probability
<br />
of a given universe is in its simplest (shortest) program. So we may
<br />
basically ignore most of the many ways a particular universe can be
<br />
computed. Essentially we need to focus on just one program, not many.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is necessary to concentrate ourself on the following thought =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments (PE, PE1, PE2, PE3, PE4, PE-omega).
</em><br />
<br />I guess I have to admit you lost me here. You mention abstract high-level
<br />
concepts such as teletransport experiments, reconstitution, time-delays,
<br />
expectations, undeterminism, average robots.  True, some of the Great
<br />
Programmer's universes may be interpretable (by appropriate computable
<br />
interpreters) as being inhabited by people who write messages about such
<br />
things. But I was not quite able to see how this affects the contents of
<br />
my little paper, whose main objective is to keep things simple, probably
<br />
because I am just a simple mind myself.
<br />
<br />Gilles writes:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you are basically saying: the Universe is N. But why not R, P(R) or any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more complicated set?
</em><br />
<br />Because R is not the simplest thing compatible with what we know.
<br />
In absence of evidence that R is indispensable, Occam's razor leaves
<br />
us with N.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is not surprising that the people of the last XX century imagine the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world based on a computation, just like Greeks have imagined it as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; combination of four elements, or theologist have imagined it as driven by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God (it confirms that consciouness can only produce ideas from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interaction with an outer world!) 
</em><br />
<br />Very true! People always try to come up with explanations that are
<br />
simple, given current knowledge. I often tried to ponder whether the
<br />
Great Programmer religion is just another example. I found comfort though
<br />
in the fact that it does encompass everything we will ever be able to
<br />
talk about (the noncomputable stuff is beyond description). So I like
<br />
to think it's the final example ... %^)
