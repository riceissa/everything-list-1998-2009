<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;refutation of the concept, by reductio-ad-absurdum?  I don't think so.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This shows very clearly the absurdity of identifying two copies as the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual and divide the &quot;value&quot; of each copy by two. As I argued already,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two instantaneous copies will immediately diverge because they are not at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same physical place, and must be considered as two persons capable of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different future histories (although sharing the same past), exactly like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two twins. In Wei's argument, we need an external factor (color of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; screen) to differentiate jane 1 from Jane2 : they are different since they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a different memory of what happened after the duplication. Jacques, do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you mean that it is less crual to kill 5 quins than 5 children from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different families?
</em><br />
<br />Well, a few people seem to be arguing from a &quot;common sense&quot; point of view,
<br />
which immediately makes the arguments suspect.  Let me say a few words about
<br />
this case.  You're asking about the value of an individual conscious being,
<br />
and asking an ethical question about killing that being.  I'd agree that the
<br />
value is tied up with the ethical question.
<br />
<br />But it seems that you are jumping to the conclusion that the value of one of
<br />
two copies must be the same as the value of the original, based on &quot;common
<br />
sense&quot;.  But is it?  If we have such a thing as a copy machine, I agree that
<br />
each of the copies will begin to diverge from the other instantly.  They will
<br />
become different.  I'd assume that the amount of difference between the copies
<br />
would vary according to time, tending to increase.  This is true whether or
<br />
not they are subject to different stimuli.
<br />
<br />So maybe after one second, the copies are slightly different, and have just
<br />
begun to have a thought with some slight different quality than the other
<br />
copy.  Now, if one of those copies is killed, have we committed a crime
<br />
equal to killing an original, unique person, who has never been involved in
<br />
our dastardly experiments?  From the bird perspective, all that is lost to
<br />
our universe is a small amount of information, representing the delta 
<br />
between that copy and the other.  For the most part, the memories of the
<br />
copies are identical, as are the personality, the shape of the face, etc.
<br />
So if you equate the value of a human with the information content, then
<br />
clearly killing a copy is not as bad as killing a non-copied original.
<br />
<br />In more human terminology, when we kill that copy, all we are wiping out
<br />
are the experiences of one second, not those of a lifetime.  The experiences
<br />
of the lifetime persist in the other copy.
<br />
<br />That sounds pretty scary, and of course the average person's reaction to
<br />
such an argument would be to condemn the whole line of reasoning.  That 
<br />
doesn't make it wrong.
<br />
<br />But note that this whole question is backwards.  I've been saying that
<br />
each person's measure (I'd definitely hesitate to use the word &quot;value&quot;) is
<br />
related to that person's chances of surviving into the infinite future.  
<br />
So in the copy situation, I would still say that each of the copies has
<br />
half the measure of the original, but then I'd say that each has (roughly)
<br />
an equal measure to any other human.  So the original, before the copy
<br />
process, had twice the measure of an average human.
