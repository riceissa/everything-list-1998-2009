<em class="quotelev1">&gt; synchronous simulation &quot;when&quot; the simulation diverges ?
</em><br />
<br />I'll make two points.  First, you're right that there are other ways of
<br />
computing a universe than simply starting with some initial conditions
<br />
and evolving &quot;time&quot; forward step by step, computing the state of the
<br />
universe at each subsequent instant.  You list several ways this might
<br />
happen and I agree that this concept makes sense.  We might call this
<br />
&quot;non-sequential&quot; or &quot;non-temporal&quot; simulation.
<br />
<br />But, given the specific temporal structures that exist in our universe,
<br />
there are limitations to how this computation can be done.  Specifically,
<br />
we are able to construct physical computers in this universe which perform
<br />
complex calculations.  And among these calculations are those which are
<br />
believed to be inherently sequential and lengthy, calculations for which
<br />
the answer cannot be computed without spending a great deal of time from
<br />
the initial values.
<br />
<br />Given that our universe contains systems like this, it constrains the
<br />
amount of computation which must be done in any kind of non-sequential
<br />
simulation.  Specifically, the non-sequential simulation must do at
<br />
least as much computation in order to produce our universe as the more
<br />
traditional kind of sequential simulation.  This demonstrates a limit
<br />
on the power of non-sequential simulation.
<br />
<br />My second point is with regard to your specific question, what would
<br />
happen if we tried to simulate a universe which diverged in some
<br />
space-time region from the conventional physical laws?  This is our
<br />
often-discussed &quot;flying rabbit&quot; paradox (we have other names as well),
<br />
where it seems that if all universes exist, we might as well be living
<br />
in a universe which was lawful everywhere except in some small region,
<br />
or up until a certain time, as in one where the laws are truly universal.
<br />
<br />Your question is whether this concept makes sense in a non-sequential
<br />
simulation, or whether it assumes sequential simulation.
<br />
<br />I think it makes just as much sense in the context of non-sequential
<br />
simulation.  The non-sequential simulator is trying to find or create a
<br />
universe which satisfies certain physical laws.  It may be iteratively
<br />
solving a differential equation or using some other non-temporal method,
<br />
but that is its goal, its mechanism.  The case at hand is simply
<br />
a matter of defining the physical laws to be different in different
<br />
regions of space-time.
<br />
<br />We could define the physical laws which the non-sequential simulator is
<br />
trying to solve in some such terms.  We'd say, observe these laws in this
<br />
region, but these other laws in that region.  For example, we might say
<br />
to observe the true laws of our universe (whatever they turn out to be)
<br />
up to simulated time T, and then to observe other laws after time T.
<br />
Or similarly we could have one set of laws up to spatial coordiate X,
<br />
and another set of laws on the other side of X.
<br />
<br />The non-sequential simulator would have no more difficulty in creating
<br />
a universe which satisfied such non-uniform physical laws than in one
<br />
where the laws were the same everywhere.  So I'd say that the issue of
<br />
sequential vs non-sequential simulation is irrelevant to the question
<br />
of the existence of &quot;flying rabbit&quot; universes and does not shed light
<br />
on the issue.
