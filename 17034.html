Hi Marty, Kim, and all those who need some math revision (for the  
<br />
seventh step of the Universal Dovetailer Argument).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I think, from the preceding post, that it is a good time to recall  
<br />
some basic definitions. And to introduce new one.
<br />
<br />The set of natural numbers, or positive integers is N = {0, 1, 2,  
<br />
3, ...}
<br />
<br />New and important definition: a set is said to be closed for an  
<br />
operation, when the operation, applied to elements of the set, does  
<br />
not lead outside the set.
<br />
<br />The set of natural numbers N is said to be close for the operation of  
<br />
addition and multiplication.
<br />
<br />The set of integers, Z = {... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
<br />
<br />Z is closed for the operation of addition, multiplication, and  
<br />
subtraction. But not closed for division.
<br />
<br /><br />The set of rational numbers Q = {n/m such that n and m belong to Z}.
<br />
Here we mean by &quot;n/m&quot; the value of the division of n by m. I mean that  
<br />
1000/500, and 4/2, and 66/33, all represent the same rational number 2.
<br />
<br />The set of rational numbers is closed for addition, multiplication,  
<br />
subtraction, and division.
<br />
<br />We have seen that the rational numbers can always been written under  
<br />
the form of periodic decimal. For example
<br />
<br />2 is 1.999999....   (exercise prove this!)
<br />
<br />I will not allow you to write 02 = 2,00000.... (why? because it is ugly  
<br />
and it will make our life harder later). Some mathematicians allow  
<br />
this, though.
<br />
<br />1/3 = 0.3333333...
<br />
<br />Alas the square root of two, which is also the length of the diagonal  
<br />
of square with side 1, cannot be written as n/m (I will prove this  
<br />
soon), so we have to extend the notion of number if we want that all  
<br />
length are measurable by numbers. We will just add all all infinite  
<br />
decimal numbers to Q. We get
<br />
<br />R the set of (so-called) real numbers. R is the set of all numbers  
<br />
measuring possible distance (length) between any points of the usual  
<br />
geometrical line.
<br />
I will perhaps provide cleaner definition later.
<br />
<br />I hope that you see that the set N is included in Z, which is included  
<br />
in Q which is included in R.
<br />
<br />R is of course closed for addition, multiplication, subtraction and  
<br />
division, like Q, but is closed for the operation of limit. This will  
<br />
be explained later.
<br />
<br />We will not need to go beyond the real numbers, for the seventh step  
<br />
of UDA. So, what follow is purely for education and entertainment.
<br />
<br /><br />Entertainment:
<br />
<br />To do quantum mechanics, or just electricity theory, we would need the  
<br />
complex numbers C. They extend into the plane. The 2-dimensional  
<br />
geometry. They make it possible to define the Mandelbrot set very  
<br />
quickly too. I may talk on them later.
<br />
<br />But if C extends R, it means obviously that R is included in C. Note  
<br />
that N, Z, Q, R, can be seen as subsets of the so called &quot;real line&quot;,  
<br />
or one dimensional space. But with C, the numbers extend into the  
<br />
plane (the two dimensional space)
<br />
<br />Do we need still some other numbers?
<br />
<br />Hamilton sought to find numbers  extending into the three dimensional  
<br />
space, for a long time, and realize there are none! But he discovered,  
<br />
in 1843, the numbers which are extending in the four dimensional  
<br />
space, called the quaternions. They are used to compute rotations in  
<br />
three dimensional spaces, and most algorithms used to rotate real  
<br />
objects (like a satellite in space, or a spaceship in a video game)  
<br />
are using quaternions (or rational approximations 'course).
<br />
<br />Graves, in 1843,  and Cayley, published in 1845, independently  
<br />
discovered the &quot;next sort&quot; of numbers: the octonions, which lives in  
<br />
eight-dimensional spaces. Some pure mathematician were proud of having  
<br />
at last find the beautiful Number that no applied mathematicians would  
<br />
ever find a use for! But they did recently found applications in the  
<br />
attempt to marry General relativity with Quantum mechanics.
<br />
<br />Are we finished yet?
<br />
<br />A case could be made for the sedenions, which lives in the 16- 
<br />
dimensional space. Sedenions have still an entry in Wikipedia, for  
<br />
example. I don't know if they have found some concrete application,  
<br />
except for a vague souvenir of a reference I read sometimes ago.
<br />
<br />We have N included-in Z included-in Q included-in R included-in C  
<br />
included-in H included-in O included-in S, where H is the set of  
<br />
quaternions, O the set of octonions, and S the set of sedenions.
<br />
<br />Yet, you see again the power of 2. The dimensional geometry of the  
<br />
type of numbers seems to follow the sequence
<br />
<br />1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ....   (that is power of 2: 2^n for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
<br />
<br />Have you all seen the many apparitions of that that sequence in the  
<br />
Mandelbrot set zooms?
<br />
<br />Of course the sequences 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... appears in all bifurcation  
<br />
diagrams, like those from the theory of chaos. See a picture here:
