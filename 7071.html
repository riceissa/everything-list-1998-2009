<br />
I have been arguing in recent posts that the absolute measure of an observer 
<br />
moment (or observer, if you prefer) makes no possible difference at the 
<br />
first person level. A counterargument has been that, even if an observer 
<br />
cannot know how many instantiations of him are being run, it is still 
<br />
important in principle to take the absolute measure into account, for 
<br />
example when considering the total amount of suffering in the world. The 
<br />
following thought experiment shows how, counterintuitively, sticking to this 
<br />
principle may actually be doing the victims a disservice:
<br />
<br />You are one of 10 copies who are being tortured. The copies are all being 
<br />
run in lockstep with each other, as would occur if 10 identical computers 
<br />
were running 10 identical sentient programs. Assume that the torture is so 
<br />
bad that death is preferable, and so bad that escaping it with your life is 
<br />
only marginally preferable to escaping it by dying (eg., given the option of 
<br />
a 50% chance of dying or a 49% chance of escaping the torture and living, 
<br />
you would take the 50%). The torture will continue for a year, but you are 
<br />
allowed one of 3 choices as to how things will proceed:
<br />
<br />(a) 9 of the 10 copies will be chosen at random and painlessly killed, while 
<br />
the remaining copy will continue to be tortured.
<br />
<br />(b) For one minute, the torture will cease and the number of copies will 
<br />
increase to 10^100. Once the minute is up, the number of copies will be 
<br />
reduced to 10 again and the torture will resume as before.
<br />
<br />(c) the torture will be stopped for 8 randomly chosen copies, and continue 
<br />
for the other 2.
<br />
<br />Which would you choose? To me, it seems clear that there is an 80% chance of 
<br />
escaping the torture if you pick (c), while with (a) it is certain that the 
<br />
torture will continue, and with (b) it is certain that the torture will 
<br />
continue with only one minute of respite.
<br />
<br />Are there other ways to look at the choices? It might be argued that in (a) 
<br />
there is a 90% chance that you will be one of the copies who is killed, and 
<br />
thus a 90% chance that you will escape the torture, better than your chances 
<br />
in (c). However, even if you are one of the ones killed, this does not help 
<br />
you at all. If there is a successor observer moment at the moment of death, 
<br />
subjectively, your consciousness will continue. The successor OM in this 
<br />
case comes from the one remaining copy who is being tortured, hence 
<br />
guaranteeing that you will continue to suffer.
<br />
<br />What about looking at it from an altruistic rather than selfish viewpoint: 
<br />
isn't it is better to decrease the total suffering in the world by 90% as in 
<br />
(a) rather than by 80% as in (c)? Before making plans to decrease suffering, 
<br />
ask the victims. All 10 copies will plead with you to choose (c).
<br />
<br />What about (b)? ASSA enthusiasts might argue that with this choice, an OM 
<br />
sampled randomly from the set of all possible OM's will almost certainly be 
<br />
from the one minute torture-free interval. What would this mean for the 
<br />
victims? If you interview each of the 10 copies before the minute starts, 
<br />
they will tell you that they are currently being tortured and they expect 
<br />
that they will get one minute respite, then start suffering again, so they 
<br />
wish the choice had been (c). Next, if you interview each of the 10^100 
<br />
copies they will tell you that the torture has stopped for exactly one 
<br />
minute by the torture chambre's clock, but they know that it is going to 
<br />
start again and they wish you had chosen (c). Finally, if you interview each 
<br />
of the 10 copies for whom the torture has recommenced, they will report that 
<br />
they remember the minute of respite, but that's no good to them now, and 
<br />
they wish you had chosen (c).
