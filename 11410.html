<br />The fact that conscious experience is intrinsically privately
<br />
presented/delivered can be regarded as key evidence in any proposition as
<br />
to its physics. Any real solution must, by definition, explain why that is
<br />
so.
<br />
<br />Indeed if you imagine a world where consciousness is mundane they would
<br />
expect it to be so. If this possibility exists what it means is that the
<br />
attitude to scientific evidence has to change to suit the real world of
<br />
scientific evidence... especially if consciousness in the form of
<br />
observation by a scientist is to be demanded as the source of evidence on
<br />
pain of being declared unscientific (which is what we currently do -
<br />
unless you can eyeball it you're not being scientific).
<br />
<br />The subtlety with 'objective scientific evidence' is that ultimately it is
<br />
delivered into the private experiences of indiividual scientists. Only
<br />
agreement as to what is evidenced makes it 'objective'. So the privacy of
<br />
the experience individuals is and always will be an intrinsic and
<br />
unavoidable part of the whole process.
<br />
<br />If this is the case then there's a way around it - because in saying the
<br />
last sentence I have been implicitly assuming that a human is doing the
<br />
observing and therefore accepting tacitly all the limitations of that
<br />
circumstance. Relax that constraint and what do you get? Either another
<br />
biological life form is supplying evidence or a non-biological life-form
<br />
is giving evidence of consciousness somehow.
<br />
<br />A non-biological life-form offers the only really flexible and fully
<br />
controllable and ethical option. How can this do the job, you ask? Isn't
<br />
this a circular arument? You have to know you;ve built a conscious life
<br />
form in oder that you get evidence to prove its consciousness?
<br />
<br />Not really... what it does is open up new options. In another world where
<br />
ethics are different you'd experiment by grafting scientist's heads
<br />
together so they could verify each other's experiences in some way. Plenty
<br />
of scientists! Why not?! ... erm...welll...not really gonna fly is it?
<br />
<br />So the viable alternative is 'grafting' putative artifiacts together in
<br />
'cancellation bridges' of one form or another and configure them in such a
<br />
way as to report unambiguously the presence or absense of the results of
<br />
the physics of experience doing its stuff. Merge 4 artificial scientists
<br />
and get them to compare/contrast... and report....
<br />
<br />In other words we _humans_ relinquish the act of role of observation but
<br />
continue to be scientists. Then we can do it. We have to let go of a
<br />
seriously long term darling in order that we (humans and artifacts)
<br />
collectively have 'proof'. It's just that humans don't get to experience
<br />
all the evidence.
<br />
<br />This, I believe is the cultural angst we have to endure in order that a
<br />
science of consciousness happen. Bitter medicine. We can eather sit around
<br />
and bitch about not solving it or we can take the medicine, solve the
<br />
problem, but not get all the thrills of the observation involved.
<br />
<br />When I become a Dr that is the bitter pill I'll be prescribing for science.
<br />
