Open question here:  What is mathematics? ;)
<br />
<br />A series of intuitions I've been having have started to suggest to me that
<br />
mathematics may not at all be what we think it is!
<br />
<br />The idea of 'cognitive closure' (Colin McGinn) looms large here.  The human
<br />
brain is not capable of direct perception of mathematical entities.  We
<br />
cannot 'see' mathematics directly in the same way we 'see' a table for
<br />
instance.  This of course may not say much about the nature of mathematics,
<br />
but more about the limitations of the human brain.  Suppose then, that
<br />
some variant of platonism is true and mathematical entities exist 'out
<br />
there' and there is *in principle* a modality ( a method of sensory
<br />
perception like hearing, sight, taste) for direct perception of
<br />
mathematics.  We could imagine some super-intelligence that possessed this
<br />
ability to directly perceive mathematics.  What would this
<br />
super-intelligence 'see' ?
<br />
<br />Perhaps there's something of enormous importance about the nature of
<br />
mathematics that every one has over-looked so far, something that would be
<br />
obvious to the super-intelligence with the mathematical modality?  Are we
<br />
all over-looking some incredible truths here?  Again, McGinn's idea of
<br />
cognitive closure is that the human brain may be 'cognitively closed' with
<br />
respect to some truths because the physical equipment is not up to the job -
<br />
like the way a dog cannot learn Chinese for instance.
<br />
<br />For one thing:  Are platonic mathematical entities really static and
<br />
timeless like platonist philosophers say?  What if platonic mathematical
<br />
entities can 'change state' somehow ?  What if they're dynamic?  And what if
<br />
the *movement* of platonic mathematics entities *are* Qualia (conscious
<br />
experiences).  Are there any mathematical truths which may be time indexed
<br />
(time dependent)?  Or are all mathematical truths really fixed?
<br />
<br />The Platonists says that mathematics under-pins reality, but what is the
<br />
*relationship* between mathematical, mental (teleological) and physical
<br />
properties?  How do mental (teleological/volitional) and physical
<br />
properties *emerge* from mathematics?  That's what every one is missing and
<br />
what has not been explained.
<br />
<br />So... think on my questions.  Is there something HUGE we all missing as
<br />
regards the nature of mathematics?  Is mathematics really what you think it
<br />
is? ;)
<br />
