<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I have to say that Hal's post was a rather good one by the
<br />
standards of what shows up on this list.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with Jacques that Chalmers' biggest problem is his simplistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption that physical subsystems must occupy specific regions of space.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This would rule out people as conscious entities, since we move around.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You could patch this up but it is still far too limited.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not quite as bad as that, the regions of space could be a
<br />
function of time.  But the elements could never pass through each other,
<br />
which rules out some possible computers.  Also, in QM wavefunctions always
<br />
overlap and positions are not well defined.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that Chalmers' basic strategy of looking at substructure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the mathematical process which is being instantiated, and trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; map them to physical substates of the physical system which claims to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiate it, still works even with inputless systems.  So I think his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole discussion of the need for input is in the end a red herring, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not ultimately detract from his basic argument.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not actually require input but does waste a lot of time
<br />
talking about it.  I agree that input is irrelevant, but it could be
<br />
useful at some later stage as a way of talking about only part of a
<br />
system.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This approach includes Chalmers' as a subcase, where the SMA would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply choose a fixed location for each substate.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not quite.  I operate in phase space.  (For QM, that would be the
<br />
space of all possible wavefunctions.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main problem that I see with this approach is that Jacques proposes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to use Kolmogorov complexity to judge the simplicity of the SMA.  We want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the SMA to be uniquely defined, and in fact he has to add a few ad hoc
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules to deal with some possible ambiguities in order to get uniqueness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We therefore need a measure over algorithms which describes simplicity,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so that we can take the simplest algorithm which satisfies the mapping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constraints.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [...non-problem snipped]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However I think there is a worse problem.  That is that K. complexity is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not uniquely defined.  K. complexity is defined only with regard to some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specific universal Turing machine (UTM).  Two different UTMs will give a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different answer for what the K. complexity is of a string or program.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact, given any particular string, you can construct a UTM which gives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it an arbitrarily large or small K. complexity as measured by that UTM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this objection is probably fatal to Jacques' idea.  We need the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SMA to be uniquely defined.  But this cannot be true if there exist UTMs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which disagree about which mapping algorithm is simplest.  Within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical framework of K. complexity, all UTMs are equally valid.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So there is no objective preference of one over the other, hence there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be no objective meaning to the SMA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In order to fix this, we have to identify a particular UTM which we will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use to measure the K. complexity.  There has to be some particular Turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine which is preferred by the universe.  You could choose one and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; produce an &quot;objective theory of consciousness&quot;, but this would be yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another ad hoc rule which would make the theory less persuasive.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think it's as bad as that!  I do agree that the ambiguity
<br />
is a problem, and this is the main reason I say it needs to be made more
<br />
precise.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, some UTMs are more complex than others.  There are various
<br />
different ways to measure this, but two possible choices are to use the
<br />
'standard numbering' (see Li &amp; Vitanyi), or to use a machine which
<br />
mimimizes a criterion such as number of head x tape states.  I'm not
<br />
looking at the book right now so this may not be exactly right but there
<br />
are criteria that are not completely arbritrary if one is looking for
<br />
simplicity.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing one might do is to try to average the complexity
<br />
over all possible Turing machines.  The problem is that since there are
<br />
infinitely many the result may not be unique - order can matter.  If so 
<br />
it's possible that an iterative criterion might help, i.e. choose the
<br />
distribution of UTMs (if there is such a unique distribution) which when
<br />
operated to name all Turing machines, produces the same distribution.
<br />
BTW does anyone know if this is the case, or know someone who might?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK so I just named two or three possible ways, but that's the
<br />
problem, isn't it?  Too many possibilities?  Well, the averaging idea may
<br />
or may not work depending on the math.  I think if it does work, use it,
<br />
if not, that helps narrow it down :-)
