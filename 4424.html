<br />I cannot understand why you would say &quot;contra to your comments below&quot; 
<br />
when in several places I discussed this issue of how common life is:
<br />
<br />&quot;... estimates of likelihood of advanced civilizations elsewhere. If we 
<br />
are the only form of life in our timelike region of the universe, i.e., 
<br />
within a few billion light-years, then of course this makes the odds of 
<br />
another receiver-builder nil.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;My hunch is that alien civilizations may well exist, but are not 
<br />
abundant &quot;
<br />
<br />I made no assumptions of nondifficulty (to use your phrasing).
<br />
<br />This is in fact why I picked the Thogians a few hundred million 
<br />
light-years from us. Now perhaps you think advanced civilizations are 
<br />
even rarer than in this example, there have not yet been any 
<br />
civilizations reaching our level, except ourselves, anywhere within a 
<br />
billion light-years or so of us. Arguing this one way or another was 
<br />
not my point.
<br />
<br />Rather, it is that the effects of MWI communication (or time travel) 
<br />
would likely be enormous and that such a civilization would be expected 
<br />
to expand and show themselves in the (likely) billion or more years 
<br />
they would have had to expand, build Dyson spheres and other cosmic 
<br />
artifacts, send signals, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This also implies that such technological civilisations are also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather diffuse within the Multiverse, _excepting_ of course those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which share part of their history with ours (eg the Nazis which won
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; WWII). We have some predictive power as to what those people would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like, since they will be similar to us.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not following this at all. Why do you think that communication with 
<br />
(or actual travel to) worlds is dependent on our ability to _predict_ 
<br />
things about them?
<br />
<br />I can see an argument to be made that only close worlds can be 
<br />
communicated with, and some folks have argued this, but this argument 
<br />
was not made by you here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, I for one, would not discount Hal Finney's point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />What I said was that the point that we have not yet built a receiver or 
<br />
portal says nothing about what others have done. And if there are other 
<br />
civilizations out there and building such receivers or portals is 
<br />
possible, one would expect a fair number of them to have done so. Since 
<br />
the implications of building such portals are, I think, enormous, I 
<br />
would expect a civilization which has built such things to have 
<br />
expanded even more rapidly through their part of the universe than 
<br />
without such things.
