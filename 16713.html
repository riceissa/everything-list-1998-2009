Hi Kim, Hi Marty and others,
<br />
<br />So it is perhaps time to do some math. Obviously, once we are open to  
<br />
the idea that the fundamental reality could be mathematical, it is  
<br />
normal to take some time to do some mathematics. Many people seems  
<br />
also to agree here that the computationalist hypothesis could be  
<br />
interesting, and this should motivate for some amount of theoretical  
<br />
computer science, or recursion theory. This is a branch of mathematics  
<br />
which study computability, and mainly uncomputability, as opposed to  
<br />
computation theory which study all aspect of computation.
<br />
<br />You can easily show that something is computable, by giving an  
<br />
explicit procedure to compute it. But to show that something is NOT  
<br />
computable, you need a very solid notion of computability. Now,  
<br />
computationalism suggest that the interesting and fundamental things,  
<br />
like life, consciousness, even matter, &quot;lives&quot; somehow on the border  
<br />
of the computable and the non computable, so that it is perhaps time  
<br />
to dig a little bit deeper in those direction.
<br />
<br />I have already explain this on this list, but never from scratch,  
<br />
having in mind those who are, for whatever reason, the mathematical  
<br />
basis.
<br />
<br />So I guess that many of view will find those preliminaries a bit too  
<br />
much simple. yet, by experience, I know that difficulties will appear,  
<br />
and it is frequent that I met people with very big baggages in  
<br />
mathematics who have some difficulties to understand the final point.  
<br />
So I would encourage everyone to be sure everything is clear. For  
<br />
those who have already a thorough understanding of UDA1-7, and in  
<br />
particular have grasped the difference between a computation and a  
<br />
description of a computation, I ask them to just be patient with the  
<br />
list. There will be nothing new here, nothing really original, and  
<br />
nothing controversial. All what I will explain has been anticipate by  
<br />
Emil Post in the 1920, and found or rediscovered by many  
<br />
mathematicians independently in USA, and in the ex USSR.
<br />
<br />The present post just give a preview, and the beginning . I intent to  
<br />
send only short posts, or the shorter as possible. So here is the plan.
<br />
<br />1) Set (probably a dozen of posts)
<br />
2) Function (I don't know how many posts, could depend on the replies.  
<br />
It is the key notion of math)
<br />
3) Language, machine and computable function
<br />
4) Universal machine, universal language, universal function,  
<br />
universal dovetailer, universal number ...
<br />
<br />How will I proceed?
<br />
<br />By exercise only. I will ask question, and I will wait for either the  
<br />
answer. I expect that those &quot;who know&quot; wait for Kim's answer, or for  
<br />
answer by those who are not supposed to &quot;know&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim seems to courageously accept the role of the candid, but if  
<br />
someone else want to answer it is OK for me.
<br />
<br />I will give only VERY SIMPLE exercise. The goal is to be short and  
<br />
simple, and as informal as possible. I will explain by examples, and I  
<br />
will avoid as much as possible tedious definitions. And when we will  
<br />
meet a more difficult question, I will just solve it myself, and even  
<br />
explain why it is difficult. So, those preliminaries will not be very  
<br />
funny. I will of course adapt myself to the possible replies, and fell  
<br />
free to comment or even metacomment.
<br />
<br />Obviously this is a not a course in math, but it is an explanation  
<br />
from scratch of the seven step of the universal dovetailer argument.  
<br />
It is a shortcut, and most probably we will make some digression from  
<br />
time to time, but let us try not to digress too much.
<br />
<br />Kim, you are OK with this? I have to take into account the problem you  
<br />
did have with math, and which makes this lesson a bit challenging for  
<br />
me, and I guess for you too.
<br />
<br />I begin with the very useful and elementary notion of set, as  
<br />
explained in what is called &quot;naive set theory&quot;, and which is the base  
<br />
of almost all part of math.
<br />
<br />============================================= begin  
<br />
===============================
<br />
<br />1) SET
<br />
<br />Informal definition: a set is a collection of object, called elements,  
<br />
with the idea that it, the collection or set, can be considered itself  
<br />
as an object. It is a many seen as a one, if you want. If the set is  
<br />
not to big, we can describe it exhaustively by listing the elements,  
<br />
if the set is bigger, we can describe it by some other way. Usually we  
<br />
use accolades &quot;{&quot;, followed by the elements, separated by commas, and  
<br />
then &quot;}&quot;, in the exhaustive description of a set.
<br />
<br />Example/exercise:
<br />
<br />1) The set of odd natural numbers which are little than 10. This is a  
<br />
well defined, and not to big set, so we can describe it exhaustively by
<br />
{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. In this case we say that 07 belongs to  {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.
<br />
Exercise 1: does the number 24 belongs to the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}?
<br />
<br />2) the set of even natural number  which are little than 13. It is {0,  
<br />
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}. OK? Some people can have a difficulty which is  
<br />
not related to the notion of set, for example they can ask themselves  
<br />
if zero (0) is really an even number. We will come back to this.
<br />
<br />3) The set of odd natural numbers which are little than 100. This set  
<br />
is already too big to describe exhaustively. We will freely describe  
<br />
such a set by a quasi exhaustion like {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ... 95, 97,  
<br />
99}.
<br />
Exercise 2: does the number 93 belongs to the set of odd natural  
<br />
numbers which are little than 100, that is: does 93 belongs to {1, 3,  
<br />
5, 7, 9, 11, ... 95, 97, 99}?
<br />
<br />4) The set of all natural numbers. This set is hard to define, yet I  
<br />
hope you agree we can describe it by the infinite quasi exhaustion by  
<br />
{0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.
<br />
Exercise 3: does the number 666 belongs to the set of natural numbers,  
<br />
that is does 666 belongs to {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.
<br />
Exercice 4: does the real number square-root(2) belongs to {0, 1, 2,  
<br />
3, ...}?
<br />
<br /><br />5) When a set is too big or cumbersome, mathematician like to give  
<br />
them a name. They will usually say: let S be the set {14, 345, 78}.  
<br />
Then we can say that 14 belongs to S, for example.
<br />
Exercise 5: does 345 belongs to S?
<br />
<br />A set is entirely defined by its elements. Put in another way, we will  
<br />
say that two sets are equal if they have the same elements.
<br />
Exercise 6. Let S be the set {0, 1, 45} and let M be the set described  
<br />
by {45, 0, 1}. Is it true or false that S is equal to M?
<br />
Exercise 7. Let S be the set {666} and M be the set {6, 6, 6}. Is is  
<br />
true or false that S is equal to M?
<br />
<br />Seven exercises are enough. Are you ready to answer them. I hope you  
<br />
don't find them too much easy, because I intend to proceed in a way  
<br />
such that all exercise will be as easy, despite we will climb toward  
<br />
very much deeper notion. Feel free to ask question, comments, etc. I  
<br />
will try to adapt myself.
<br />
<br />Next: we will see some operation on sets (union, intersection), and  
<br />
the notion of subset. If all this work, I will build a latex document,  
<br />
and make it the standard reference for the seventh step for the non  
<br />
mathematician, or for the beginners in mathematics.
<br />
<br />Bruno
