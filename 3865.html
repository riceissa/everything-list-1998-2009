<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Pearl favors carefully constructing diagrams, specifically directed 
<br />
acyclic graphs, DAGs, to explicate the exceptions and causal connections 
<br />
more clearly. Ordinary natural language is of such coarse granularity 
<br />
that all sorts of mischief arises.
<br />
<br />He gives a funny example, attributed to Suppes, of a situation where a 
<br />
golfer was hitting a drive. The ball went wide, but struck a tree branch 
<br />
and bounced into the hole. Almost everyone when asked what the &quot;cause&quot; 
<br />
of the hole-in-one was says the tree branch &quot;caused&quot; it. (Not in an 
<br />
agency sense, but in terms of it being the important causal link.)
<br />
<br />Now of course in nearly all possible worlds, a golf ball hitting a tree 
<br />
branch is a _scattering_ event, essentially an entropy-increasing, 
<br />
dissipative event. No golfer tries to hit into some trees in the hope 
<br />
that a tree branch will _cause_ a hole in one.
<br />
<br />Pearl's book has many such examples illustrating his points.
<br />
<br />However, nothing in it has profoundly changed my world view. Most of 
<br />
this stuff is just common sense to anyone trained even a little bit in 
<br />
the sciences. The main usefulness is in formalizing certain models for 
<br />
use in cognitive systems, diagnosis, and even some legal areas (where 
<br />
weird causality inversions are all too common, as with the jury award 
<br />
for the woman who claimed a CAT scan caused her to lose her psychic 
<br />
powers).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think what is necessary is to go from the specific and concrete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events to an abstraction which represents an entire category of events.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In any given instance of flooding, everything contributes in a sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If a particular stone were located somewhere else, the details of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the flooding would be different.  But if we look at flooding as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstraction, then we can identify other aspects which are associated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the set of events that the abstraction covers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You still have the problem of distinguishing correlation from causation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but at least this allows you to identify possible causative factors.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And in general there will be more than one.
</em><br />
<br />This is the main thrust of Pearl's book. Lots of discusson of Bayesian 
<br />
networks, DAGs, and &quot;d-separation criteria.&quot; (&quot;A path p is said to be 
<br />
d-separated (or blocked) by a set of nodes Z if and only if 1. p 
<br />
contains a chain i --&gt; m --&gt; j or a fork i &lt;-- m --&gt; j such that the 
<br />
middle node m is in Z or 2. p contains an inverted fork (or collider) 
<br />
i --&gt; m &lt;-- j such that the middle node m is not in Z and such that no 
<br />
desecendant of m is in Z.&quot;
<br />
<br />If this stuff appeals to you, take a look at Pearl.
<br />
<br />(The notation is not as dense as it looks here, as this is a definition 
<br />
to be used many times. And the formal notation is vastly more useful 
<br />
than &quot;word problem&quot; language, IMO.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe the Huw Price book I mentioned argued that this arrow of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time is not really fundamental, but rather is due to the low entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the initial conditions.  Particularly if you look at it from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MWI perspective, in equilibrium there will be as many merges of worlds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or &quot;branches&quot;) as splits.
</em><br />
<br />There have been some computer simulations of reversed-billiard ball or 
<br />
gas expansion experiments. One I looked at recently is &quot;Does 
<br />
Indeterminism Give Rise to an Intrinsic Time Arrow?,&quot; Dolev, Elitzur, 
<br />
Hemmo.  quant-ph/0101088
<br />
<br />The results are what I would have expected: if the positions and 
<br />
velocities of the balls are known exactly, then a time-reversed &quot;break&quot; 
<br />
certainly reverses the motions back to an initial configuration. If, 
<br />
however, the positions and velocities are altered by even a small 
<br />
epsilon, the reversal doesn't restore the initial configuration.
<br />
<br />(Several related names for this: Feigenbaum's weather model results 
<br />
which partly led to chaos theory, sensitive dependence on initial 
<br />
conditions, and the important difference between numbers with finite 
<br />
base expansions and the &quot;reals.&quot; On this last point, even in the balls 
<br />
were round to one part in 10^25, and their positions and velocities 
<br />
known to the same precision, the &quot;differences&quot; that are 26 or 35 or 50 
<br />
decimal places out will eventually &quot;come marching in&quot; and give big 
<br />
changes in the first few decimal places, which will utterly &quot;change&quot; the 
<br />
table configuration. Time reversal may not work with the &quot;reals.&quot;)
<br />
<br />((Ultra-speculative, hand-waving intuition: Strong links between this 
<br />
notion and two other areas: Smale's observation that many things would 
<br />
be computable instead of incomputable if computers used real numbers 
<br />
(somehow!). And the issue that if points are replaced by open sets (or 
<br />
neighborhoods), mathematics changes in interesting ways. I surmise these 
<br />
are duals to each other,))
<br />
<br />Needless to add, but I should anyway: given the Uncertainty Principle, 
<br />
if in fact it really is part of the Universe and is not an artifact of a 
<br />
determistic &quot;absolute precision&quot; model, then h throws a monkeywrench 
<br />
into any kind of &quot;run the billiard table backwards&quot; model.
<br />
<br />In large systems with objects whose positions and velocities are only 
<br />
determined to finite precision, reversibility is impossible even in 
<br />
principle. Running the reversal many times would lead to many past 
<br />
configurations.
<br />
<br />Price's &quot;block universe&quot; is not compelling to me, except in very simple 
<br />
universes/systems looked at for periods where the differences don't show 
<br />
up. (I see some role for &quot;epsilon-delta&quot; proofs here, which ties in with 
<br />
the posets and latttices of the Markopoulou/Smolin/Isham views.)
<br />
<br />This makes me intensely skeptical of the idea that if the universe were 
<br />
to start contracting back to a Big Crunch that organisms would begin to 
<br />
age backwards at some point, that billiard tables would return to the 
<br />
initial triangle, and so on.
