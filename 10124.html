<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At this stage you should try to be specific about the reasons why an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hardware independent isomorphism cannot exist, or perhaps you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just saying that &quot;first person feeling&quot; would not be genuine if they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were not related to some 'physical reality' in which case I could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree
</em><br />
<br />I feel we're getting quite close to any genuine difference between us
<br />
on these issues, so I'll try my best to clarify. I still believe
<br />
there are some vocabulary problems, so first I'll have another go at
<br />
pinning these down (sorry, but please be patient!). One thing that
<br />
strikes me is that there are (at least) two distinctly different
<br />
usages of the term `first person':
<br />
<br />`First person 1' (FP1) is used when I mean to indicate my own internal
<br />
centred perspective, `looking out', as it were, on the world. It is
<br />
the word `I' exclusively as used reflexively by a first person about
<br />
him/ herself. As such, it can't be reported in third person narrative,
<br />
only directly *uttered* by some FP1-centred individual. I will call it
<br />
'FP1-I'.
<br />
<br />`First person 2' (FP2) is used to describe a point-of-view within a
<br />
third person narrative. For example:
<br />
<br />David thought about the problem and realised - &quot;I am confused again!&quot;
<br />
<br />The narrative contains the *description* of a first person
<br />
characterised as `David', whose point-of-view we would call a `first
<br />
person position'. The use of `I' here is understood to be this
<br />
*narrative* David's reference to himself. As such it's 'FP2-I'
<br />
<br />Throughout these discussions, when I have used terms such as `first
<br />
person, `personal, or `presence' to describe the context within which
<br />
`individual first persons' IMO could arise, I have meant the sense
<br />
given in FP1. The intuition that I have is that even when you `strip
<br />
away' the structuring that provides the perceptual mechanism and its
<br />
experiential content, what remains must be an FP1-type context - the
<br />
`Big `I', if you like, the `arena' within which all else takes place.
<br />
And this 'Big I' could only be 'directly uttered' - metaphorically in
<br />
this case - by a 'Big FP1'. It is *not* an FP2-type description in
<br />
a third person narrative.
<br />
<br />The intuition at the heart of this is that if what I'm calling an
<br />
FP1-type context is the fundamental ontology, then there is no
<br />
requirement for the 'FP1-I' to suddenly `spring into existence' when
<br />
FP2-describable points-of-view subsequently emerge as a consequence of
<br />
third-person structuring. The idea of such an otherwise completely
<br />
novel ontology `springing into being' in this way has always struck me
<br />
as fundamentally incoherent.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From this perspective, the discourses of QM, MW, mathematics, comp
</em><br />
etc. take place in terms of `third person' structuring of an FP1-type
<br />
context. Direct FP1-type experience is derived from the global
<br />
`self-intimacy' of this context with a particular sort of structural
<br />
content (what I have termed `perceiver/ percept' dyads). Why
<br />
`self'-intimacy? To eliminate any notion of `observers'. By
<br />
`self-intimacy I mean to say that such knowledge is an immediate
<br />
apprehension by the context of its own content, which is why I've
<br />
termed it an `equivalence', not a `property'. Consequently, individual
<br />
FP1-type content (`experience') is the direct, immediate acquaintance
<br />
of demarcated perceivers with aspects of their own structure.
<br />
<br />`Third person' is then just a narrative or description of this same
<br />
structure. The world outside the individual, containing other first
<br />
persons and all manner of additional paraphernalia, is likewise `third
<br />
person' when read as narrative by first persons (including, of course,
<br />
their individual representations of shared interpersonal discourse).
<br />
Notwithstanding this, all of it exists fundamentally `in its own
<br />
right' as FP1-type context+content (i.e. not just the regions of it
<br />
that happen to be demarcated `first persons').  In this larger sense,
<br />
reality itself is that which can only be 'directly uttered'.  What is
<br />
captured in what we call third person discourse - our 'shared reality -
<br />
are our continued empirical strivings to map these narratives and
<br />
models to distant regions of 'directly uttered' reality.  Because we
<br />
comprise such nodes within a network of structure-read-as-information,
<br />
we are each of us able to represent and 'directly utter' our personal
<br />
versions of 'consensual reality'.  If this condemns us to 'solipsism',
<br />
at least we're justified in the belief that our private worlds are at
<br />
least partially synchronised by such 'energetic coupling' with the
<br />
other parts of the forest.
<br />
<br />I think I'm also able to clarify here why I believe that a certain
<br />
kind of `structural isomorphism' is the underlying basis of our own
<br />
phenomenal experience. Since the FP1-type context is, as it were, a
<br />
superposition of all activity (including that activity read as
<br />
`experience' by perceivers), we must hypothesise within it organising
<br />
schemas that demarcate different functional levels. Within the
<br />
`physical' domain, such schemas are supported by the physical `laws of
<br />
form'. Consequently, IMO, such `laws of form' must be established (and
<br />
within the comp hypothesis, this could be by `physical substrate
<br />
emulation') to mediate the structural relationships which are read by
<br />
the 'perceiver' component of the structure as `experiential content'.
<br />
By contrast, if the behaviour of the `substrate' at this level is
<br />
unconstrained (e.g. because the `code' can be run on an arbitrary set
<br />
of hardwares conforming to a common syntactical rule-set), the
<br />
`semantic coherence' at this level of the FP1-type context would IMO be
<br />
undefined.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure. Feel free to dig in that direction, but it seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me it is easier to accept some sharable part of 3-mathematics and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; build from that. Especially when we have an unavoidable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-reference for a vast class of machines. Thanks to Turing &amp; Co.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can see, like Godel already saw in 1933, that godelian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-reference cannot describe a knower, but then, using some math
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trick we can define a knower in term of self-reference+ truth which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provides a good candidate for a notion of first person (even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unameable by the machine). Somehow a &quot;physical reality&quot; is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Number-Nature needs for entangling closely enough the many possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independent computations, so as to made first person stable and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; partially sharable. *many*-worlds prevent such approaches against
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solipsism. Perhaps I agree that the context in which particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personhood arises is first person (plural), but the context in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personhood per se arise is eventually &quot;reducible&quot; to the behavior of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the roots of a universal diophantine polynomial (or choose your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; favorite turing universal systems).
</em><br />
<br />We appear to be more or less agreeing here, especially what you say
<br />
about '&quot;physical reality&quot; is what Number-Nature needs for entangling
<br />
closely enough the many possible independent computations, so as to
<br />
made first person stable and partially sharable' - which is more or
<br />
less what I meant by 'organising schemas' necessary for 'semantic
<br />
coherence' above. However, again based on my 'FP1-type' idea above, I
<br />
would have to say that 'the behavior of the roots of a universal
<br />
diophantine polynomial' would be an aspect of a fundamentally
<br />
FP1-type context - perhaps what you so delightfully term
<br />
'Number-Nature' - the 'ultimate FP1'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That eventually there is a duality making it possible to choose the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first person point of view as the most basic one cannot yet be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entirely ruled out for sure, but comp and the quantum without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collapse makes it as unlikely imo.
</em><br />
<br />Do you still feel this notwithstanding my FP1/ FP2 distinction? We
<br />
would be saying that whatever we take to be basic must be an 'FP1-type
<br />
context', for the reasons I argue above.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, but do you see this moves invite you to provide a definition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;first person&quot; in third person term. Comp succeeds partially, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then justified completely why its success cannot be but partial.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed eventually the physical appearances emerges from the never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely specifiable border of the person. The platonic number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not emerge, and I agree they are mysterious, but here too we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can understand that we cannot infer our beliefs in them from any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weaker beliefs.
</em><br />
<br />I agree that 'first person' (i.e. FP2 according to my schema) can be
<br />
defined in third person terms. However IMO FP1 cannot be so 'defined'
<br />
but only 'directly uttered'. This means that the manifest existence
<br />
of FP1 entails that we assign primacy to something that is capable of
<br />
such 'direct utterance'. I agree that (per comp) the Platonic number
<br />
'does not emerge' - i.e. has primacy - and that consequently its basic
<br />
ontology in my terms must be FP1.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If this is wishful thinking, then this an example of recursion. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then that's not wishful thinking, so it is not an example of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recursion. But then it is wishful thinking ... ... and then it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly an example of meta-recursion
</em><br />
<br />Mmmm..
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... (I will stop here ;)
</em><br />
<br />Ah! Does this prove you're not a TM?
