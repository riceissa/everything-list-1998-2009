<br />
I've been considering time travel in the context of quantum mechanics and 
<br />
parallel universes, and have come up with some thoughts and ideas about the 
<br />
subject.  This might be a little off-topic, but it does have to do with the 
<br />
theory of parallel universes, which seems to be a large part of the 
<br />
discussion on this newsgroup.  I'm interested to know what you think of my 
<br />
thoughts/ideas.
<br />
<br />Most scientists agree that time travel is theoretically possible.  Although 
<br />
the task seems monumentous, many scientists also agree that it will 
<br />
eventually be possible.  Using MW theory, the paradoxes are resolved.  Here 
<br />
are some of my observations/ideas/theories behind quantum time travel.
<br />
<br />I know from some of the research I did (and some reasonable assumptions) 
<br />
that travelling back in time would put you back to the branch in which you 
<br />
set your &quot;time machine&quot; to travel back to, and from there you would branch 
<br />
into a universe in which you suddenly appear from the future.  From there, 
<br />
probability would remain as you expect it to using the SE, but since things 
<br />
are initially different in this branch (you are there), things would turn 
<br />
out differently in that universe than in one in which you didn't appear.  
<br />
But how exactly is probability affected during time travel?  I assume one of 
<br />
two possibilities:
<br />
<br />1.  Travelling back in time actually affects the probability of the people 
<br />
from that time suddenly seeing you appear from the future.  So, if normally 
<br />
the probability of you appearing would be nil, then because in the future 
<br />
you decided to travel back to that time, you actually made their probability 
<br />
of seeing you appear significant.  Perhaps those people actually have a 
<br />
50/50 chance of seeing you appear.  Those who end up in the universe in 
<br />
which you didn't appear would eventually end up at the point in which you 
<br />
decide to go back in time.  Those who end up in the universe in which you 
<br />
did appear would probably follow an entirely different path.
<br />
<br />2.  Travelling back in time does not affect the probability of the people 
<br />
from that time suddenly seeing you appear from the future.  The only way 
<br />
they would see you appearing is if molecules from their universe suddenly, 
<br />
by pure chance, arranged themselves to create you.  Of course, you know that 
<br />
this universe was very likely to be YOUR universe, but at the same time you 
<br />
know that everyone else you see in it is in a universe that they had an 
<br />
absolutely nil chance of being in.  They are justified in claiming that you 
<br />
appearing in their universe was an absolute miracle and fluke of nature, 
<br />
while at the same time you are justified in claiming that this universe was 
<br />
very likely for you, and was not a miracle or a fluke of nature at all.  In 
<br />
other words, by time travelling you have managed to put yourself with 
<br />
virtual certainty into a virtually impossible universe.  If this was the 
<br />
case, then for us to see beings from the future visiting us would be no more 
<br />
special, and in fact no different, than me suddenly appearing on the moon by 
<br />
pure chance.  This would give an answer to Stephen Hawking's argument 
<br />
against time travel, which was that if time travel were possible, we should 
<br />
be seeing visitors from the future.
<br />
<br />If proposition #1 was true, there would have to be some sort of relationship 
<br />
between the measure of a certain universe and the probability of seeing 
<br />
visitors that went back in time from that universe, otherwise we'd see 
<br />
visitors from every possible future universe that sent visitors back in 
<br />
time, and we'd constantly be seeing an infinite number of visitors coming 
<br />
from the future.  It is most reasonable to assume that we will see visitors 
<br />
from a likely future universe, so the relationship would probably be the 
<br />
greater the measure of a future universe, the more likely we are to see 
<br />
visitors from that universe.
<br />
<br />This brings me to one potential downfall of proposition #1.  Let us suppose 
<br />
this scenario: we continue through time (without any visitors from the 
<br />
future) and eventually achieve the ability to time travel.  We travel back 
<br />
to a certain point in our past, not once, but many, many hundreds of 
<br />
millions of times.  Because travelling back in time changes the probability 
<br />
of what happened, then because we travelled back in time hundreds of 
<br />
millions of times, the probability that the people from that time won't see 
<br />
visitors from the future is very, very small.  The chance of not seeing 
<br />
visitors from the future becomes insignificant compared to the probability 
<br />
of seeing visitors from the future.  Because it is so insignificant, it is 
<br />
unlikely that the people will see visitors from that universe due to the 
<br />
relationship I mentioned earlier.  But if we are unlikely to see visitors 
<br />
from the future, then the original universe becomes very likely again.  So, 
<br />
we have a paradox.  For this reason I believe that proposition #1 is 
<br />
impossible.
<br />
<br />This leaves proposition #2, which is not very attractive to people who 
<br />
believe we are being visited by beings from the future, or people who dream 
<br />
of one day being visited.  However, just in case I have erred in my logic of 
<br />
proving proposition #1 wrong, I have come up with some interesting 
<br />
possibilities that proposition #1 provides, besides a paradox.  Below I 
<br />
present a way in which to test, right now, whether time travel - and, 
<br />
specifically, proposition #1, exists.
<br />
<br />The experiment is simple: organize an international decree that when we 
<br />
discover time travel, we should travel back to this very day, month, and 
<br />
year.  The hope is that when we do discover time travel, we will go back to 
<br />
the year 2000 because of the decree, and show everyone in this time that 
<br />
time travel is indeed possible, and hopefully even give these people 
<br />
advanced technology.  If part of the decree is that we go back many, many 
<br />
times, then the chance the people from this time don't see any visitors from 
<br />
the future is very small (we are pretending that the original universe is 
<br />
still signinficant).  In other words, by simply issuing a decree right now, 
<br />
we can possibly discover whether time travel is possible, right now.  Of 
<br />
course, proposition #1 would have to be correct, and even if it was, there 
<br />
are plenty of reasons that our future selves wouldn't visit us.  They might 
<br />
not do it for moral or economic reasons, or they might have forgotten or 
<br />
just don't care about the decree anymore.  Or, time travel might be 
<br />
theoretically possible, but not practical in any way.  A disaster might have 
<br />
even befallen our descendants, wiping them out before they could develop 
<br />
time travel.  However, all of these potential problems aside, I believe that 
<br />
if proposition #1 was a possibility, then by issuing this decree we would be 
<br />
siginificantly increasing the chances of seeing visitors from the future 
<br />
right now.  Of course, the sooner we do the experiment, the more likely it 
<br />
is that we won't see visitors from the future, because there is more time 
<br />
for something to go wrong before we develop time travel technology.
