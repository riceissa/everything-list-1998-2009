<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could they not just be illusions? Is there a deeper reason why dynamics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and decisions are necessary for consciousness?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of things are illusions, but you need to start out with
<br />
something that is not too trivial either.  Strings seem too trivial;
<br />
dynamics and decisions seem to supply the missing ingredient.  Of course
<br />
there are plenty of people who would object at this point and say that
<br />
even computations are too trivial.  I know what my intuition has to say
<br />
about where to draw the line.  I think there is a deep reason, but I am
<br />
not able to explain it in words.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course your way has rather counterintuitive consequences which
<br />
computationalism avoids.  The recently dead, for example, could have about
<br />
as much measure in your scheme as the living, since the brain would have
<br />
about the same chemical structure but would no longer compute.  What do
<br />
you think it would feel like to be such a consciousness?  I doubt it would
<br />
feel like anything, but that's just a restatement of my above position.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	No, that's not what I said.  For the shortest program, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simulated environment would no doubt be vastly simplified compared to what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we observe.  But the basic elements of competition for survival and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the advantages of communication would be there.  It will take many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; generations to evolve intelligence, of course.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But there is no reason to think that intelligence will easily evolve in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any competitive environment. Neural networks have been in existence a lot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; longer than intelligence. Some people even argue that the evolution of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence on earth is a pure coincidence. I wouldn't go that far, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the evolution of intelligence clearly depends on a fairly small set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environments.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt that.  Remember, in these artificial neural nets, brain
<br />
size is already present (easy to make em' big).  All that remains is for
<br />
them to start exploiting the niche of intelligence, and since it would
<br />
have advantages, it should be a fairly steady and stable progression,
<br />
with plenty of time to let it happen.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think your approach is an interesting one, and not hopeless (as far as I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can see). But then it's quite difficult to discuss an approach that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is missing the definition for a basic concept.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are uncharted waters.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, an implementation is like pornography vs. art: you know
<br />
it when you see it, but it's hard to define precisely.  I think the
<br />
approach described on my home page is a step in the right direction.
<br />
Implementations are a way of characterizing a system, of quantifying the
<br />
structure of the dynamics in terms of structures (computations) thought to
<br />
be conscious, and therefore of quantifying the consciousness in the
<br />
original dynamics.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	Just that it would take a big program.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ok, you have your estimate, and I have mine.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is why we could use a neutral and authoritative estimate.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	On the contrary.  Some programs will just rewrite the same part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the tape, and those we can neglect for now.  But some will keep printing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; out copies of the same string end on end, and the ones that halt will have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; zero measure compared to those, since more copies means more measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This gives a slight advantage to short strings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No I assume that each tape only contributes to the measure of the entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; string on the tape, not to the measures of substrings. (I.e., you can only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be an entire tape, not part of a tape, if you want to think of it that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn't make much sense to me.  If there's something that
<br />
it's like to be a string, why should that be ruined just because it's
<br />
surrounded by other strings?  There are no external observers here, just 
<br />
internal observers.  Is your idea that the concious part of the tape must
<br />
be printed out at the beginning of the tape?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compuations would not be ruined just because they're surrounded by
<br />
other computations, that's for sure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Otherwise the measure will be completely dominated by simple counting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programs that write out 0's and 1's as fast as they can. 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Je ne comprende pas aussi!  Most strings that counting programs
<br />
would print would not be conscious, and the fraction that are would be
<br />
negligable compared to what the repeat printers of the same string would
<br />
print out.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	Here is a serious problem for you.  The Turing machines start out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; will all possible programs, that is, with all possible infinite strings on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the tapes.  At any finite time, no matter how large [and therefore in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; limit], the fraction of the tape that even the repeat printers have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; covered is equal to zero.  So the printed strings have zero measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; compared to the infinity of random strings on the as yet untouched part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the tape, even though the fraction of those that are conscious is small.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is not the model I have in mind. It doesn't seem sensible to think of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a universe with a continuous infinity of Turing machines.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not?  The set of all possible programs - what could be more
<br />
natural than that?  It seems closest to Max's 'everything' idea as well.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Instead I assume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the universe starts with one Turing machine with a blank (read-only) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; input tape, then before each clock cycle each existing Turing machine is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cloned, with 0 appended to the input tape of one copy, and 1 appended to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the input tape of the other. 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should nature do it that way?  That's just one particular
<br />
model of physics, and far from the most natural.  It sounds like you've
<br />
concocted it specifically to avoid the problem I mentioned above, with no 
<br />
other justification.  That's what gives free parameters a bad name.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that with the set of all possible programs, the random
<br />
strings on the untouched parts of the tapes would be completely harmless
<br />
with computationalism, since they don't implement computations.  Most of
<br />
the measure would be in the shortest programs that implement conscious
<br />
computations (and presumably restart if need be should they stop doing so,
<br />
e.g. due to heat death of the simulated universe).  Such programs would
<br />
not have to find any brain states, just run the simulation, so would be
<br />
shorter than with your proposal.  The artificial neural net programs would
<br />
still compete, but against a shorter competitor (those estimates would
<br />
still come in handy so we can try to rule this idea out).
