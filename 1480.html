<em class="quotelev1">&gt; More relevantly, it is posulated as highly likely that, starting with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a random Life formation, SAS's will evolve of their own accord. One
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proves this by showing that our UTM is also a universal constructor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (can take a coded blueprint and build out of it a machine at least as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complex as itself). UTM is also a universal destructor and therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mobile. Eventually you get evolution and SAS's.
</em><br />
<br />There are difficulties with this, due to the difficulty of a formation
<br />
defending itself against noise from outside.  The Life universe does not
<br />
seem to lend itself to constructing barriers.  No one has ever built a
<br />
wall that could withstand random Life noise.
<br />
<br />Of course, the same thing is true in our universe.  There is no wall
<br />
that can withstand everything that can be thrown at it (ultra-high
<br />
temperatures, relativistic collisions, etc.).  Life has evolved in
<br />
special regions which are relatively gentle.
<br />
<br />Now, perhaps if the Life universe was big enough there would be regions
<br />
that just happened to be formed of islands large enough to form living
<br />
entities, surrounded by empty spaces so that these entities would not
<br />
be destroyed from the outside.  But these would be very rare, without
<br />
any systematic large-scale phenomena to self-organize biospheres as we
<br />
have in our universe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Such 'Life' evolution raises an interesting question: These SAS's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would build universities and study mathematics, computer science and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics. Some J.H.Conway of the Life universe would discover the amusing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and diverting Life game, and start discovering gliders, glider guns,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space rakes etc. Sooner or later a physicists would hear about this new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; development and the realisation would be made that their universe *is*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a Life simulation. Such a discovery would of course revolutionise the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; study of physics for these SAS's.
</em><br />
<br />This is simply an analog to what is happening in our own universe,
<br />
as we discover regularities and create models of fundamental physics.
<br />
Newtonian mathematics was found to apply with tremendous accuracy to
<br />
the basic behavior of physical objects, and this has provided insight
<br />
into the possible nature of the universe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; More interestingly still: when are *we* going to discover some CA or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar which turns out to be *our* universe? In my lifetime I hope.
</em><br />
<br />There is nothing special about a CA; any set of mathematical laws which
<br />
fully describe our universe.  What you are really asking is when or
<br />
whether we will find a fully unified and universal physical theory.
<br />
<br />Whether this theory can be expressed in a formulation based on CAs is
<br />
insignificant in my opinion.  In particular this would shed no light
<br />
whatsoever on the likelihood that we are in some sense actually part
<br />
of a computer simulation.  Computers can simulate any mathematical or
<br />
logical structure, and there is nothing special and CAs.
