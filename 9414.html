I read the remark of Russell and Satathis's reply with
<br />
great interest. 
<br />
Russell wrote (among others):
<br />
*
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ...The change into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Napoleon is a difference in kind, not degree, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;one would have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; pass through non-functional brain structures in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;order to change from me to him.&lt; &lt;
</em><br />
*
<br />
reflecting a rather mechanistic-physicalist view of a
<br />
mentality in 'degrees' followable by (not
<br />
substantial?) alterations from a (nonfunctioning, but
<br />
assumed?) prior state, I would suggest: in
<br />
infinitesimal steps as in the well esstablished qualia
<br />
of calculus. Russell seems to disagree, taking the
<br />
analog view (in kind).
<br />
Let me return to this after 2 quotes from Stathis's
<br />
reply:
<br />
*
<br />
1. &gt; However, technical feasibility is not the &gt;point.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The point is that *if*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (let's say magically) your mind were gradually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transformed, so that your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thoughts became more and more Napoleonic and less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and less Standishian,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then by this process, you would become Napoleon.
</em><br />
*
<br />
2. &gt;...the old man remembers being a young
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; man, the young man
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remembers being a child, but the old man does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remember being a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; child. Although the old man has no recollection of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being a child, he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still identifies as being the same person as that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; child because there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a continuous series of intermediates each of whom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recalls the one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immediately prior, if not the ones several stages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; earlier.
</em><br />
*
<br />
Comparing the two I find Russell's position more
<br />
mentality-oriented than Stathis' (more mechanistic),
<br />
however he mentions Parfit's &quot;personal identity&quot;
<br />
tested  in thought-experiments. (I dislike thought
<br />
experiments as artefacts composed to rationalize upon
<br />
one's not so rational ideas into a fabricated sci-fi
<br />
situation.)
<br />
<br />The personal identity (I call it: SELF?) is an open
<br />
question. The old man identifies himself with all
<br />
stages of his earlier life even if episodes emerge he
<br />
did not actively remember. (I know, I do). It is more
<br />
than stepping backwards in phases. It transcends time,
<br />
particular qualia-attributes, rationale and approval. 
<br />
I identify (an arthritic octagenerian) with the teen
<br />
youngster who made that memorable ski-jump. I feel
<br />
it... also the frustration when at school I was not
<br />
prepared and could not recite the poem which I now
<br />
know quite well. 
<br />
Self is more than 'degrees of bodily, emotionally or
<br />
mentally experienced states', it is &quot;myself in total
<br />
ambiance&quot; (a situation psych cannot handle and physics
<br />
has no units to measure). It does not end by the skin
<br />
and not by personal thoughts. It includes a complexity
<br />
of the 'situations' without transition of &quot;yesterday's
<br />
me&quot; into Napoleon. Triggered? yes. Explained? not yet.
<br />
<br />(My problem with MWI transitions of Q-suicide ideas: 
<br />
what part of 'SELF' are we talking about? it includes
<br />
the totality as e/affecting us (and vice versa), very
<br />
much as THIS universe circumstances and in another
<br />
ambiance the same 'self' is not identifiable. Same
<br />
question as in reincarnation: who is &quot;I&quot;
<br />
reincarnated?) Self is a mentally interrelated part of
<br />
the totality with some inside reflection to itself (no
<br />
good words available). Sort of a duality? Relational
<br />
compolsition?
<br />
It works in all of us, I have no idea if less neuronic
<br />
animals have it (never asked them) or plants,
<br />
galaxies?
<br />
<br />Besides: 'self' related things go atemporal -
<br />
aspatial.
<br />
Not followable in time-series or state-space series.
<br />
It is not analysably changing details from A-C through
<br />
B.
<br />
It is - well, who knows? - a (complex) quality-jump in
<br />
some 'analog'(?) manner, if we think comp.
<br />
I still do not know HOW to think about it.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; me-yesterday into Napoleon. The point is that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this type of radical

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; change would be different in *degree*, not

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different in kind from

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Sure, but that's exactly where I'm in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disagreement. The change into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Napoleon is a difference in kind, not degree, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one would have to

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order to change from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; him. Whereas to change from me to me as I was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; twenty years ago can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; achieved by passing through functional brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures (all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; instances of me over the last twenty years).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see why you are so sure about the necessity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of passing through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-functional brain structures going from you to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Napoleon. After all,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a continuous sequence of intermediates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between you and a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fertilized ovum, and on the face of it you have much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more in common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mentally and physically with Napoleon than with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fertilized ovum.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, technical feasibility is not the point. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point is that *if*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (let's say magically) your mind were gradually
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and less Standishian,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then by this process, you would become Napoleon. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is analogous to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situation where the old man remembers being a young
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; man, the young man
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remembers being a child, but the old man does not
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; child. Although the old man has no recollection of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people actually believe and act on, for example if a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person is found
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guilty of a crime which he has since genuinely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forgotten committing. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole thrust of Parfit's philosophizing involves

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taking such normative

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitions of personal identity and, by trying them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out in various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irregular situations and thought experiments,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; showing up their
