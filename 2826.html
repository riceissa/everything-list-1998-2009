<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; From a mystic standpoint, this can't be. To know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; something is closer to the analogy of a subscriber
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; line. When one *knows* something, anything, they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; subscribe this pattern.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but the usual definition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge is:
</em><br />
<br />Usual? Are you trying to arrive at a destination or
<br />
make your destination come to you?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A true belief that has a casual connection with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact that makes it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true.
</em><br />
<br />That's not my def of knowing. Understanding has to be
<br />
able to transcend common definition. If it is
<br />
constrained, one can never see outside of the box.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The standard example is that I may believe that Tom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has bought a blue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; car because I saw him drive up in it.  And Tom has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bought a blue car -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so the belief is true.  But it isn't knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the car I saw
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; him drive up in is a rental car, not the one he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bought.  So in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example there is no casual connection between my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief and the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that Tom bought a blue care, and hence my true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief is not knowledge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brent Meeker
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />This is sequential thinking.
<br />
<br />One can know all about Tom before Tom is ever born.
<br />
<br />What you're describing to me looks like the mechanics
<br />
of sequential thinking.
<br />
<br />People might generate models to describe their
<br />
observations and if those models jive with those
<br />
models of others, we say it's factual because we can
<br />
all agree on what we're talking about. In effect, all
<br />
we've done is find a way to cooperate in thinking. A
<br />
very limited thinking I might add.
<br />
<br />At one level, our whole world seems to be built upon
<br />
common languages which imply thought processes that
<br />
yield consistent reproducible results. By language I
<br />
mean any common mode of interrelating, not necessarily
<br />
the spoken word.
<br />
<br />You take your def of *knowledge* or *knowing*, it's
<br />
simply a best guess agreed upon by a large enough body
<br />
of people to secure that definition  in common usage.
<br />
The spoken and written languages were not manufactured
<br />
by scientists, they evolved with humanity. It is only
<br />
since the advent of scientific thought that we have
<br />
attempted to constrain meanings of things to make the
<br />
easy to analyze. 
<br />
<br />One must realize in the attempt to constrain common
<br />
everyday experience to a finite conceptual space, that
<br />
something will be lost in the translation.
<br />
<br />If you are constraining your arguments to a conceptual
<br />
space that you all have agreed upon and are happy in
<br />
throwing away what you could not translate, then there
<br />
should be no contention.
<br />
<br />But if you are taking this constrained conceptual and
<br />
thought space and then trying to impose it on others,
<br />
I foresee a problem.
<br />
<br />These discussions seem to delve into various realms of
<br />
understanding and belief systems. If one is attempting
<br />
to translate these belief systems into your sterilized
<br />
conceptual and thought space, one will obviously only
<br />
see what the rules of this concept space will allow
<br />
him to see.
<br />
<br />If however, one attempts to force the conceptual
<br />
spaces of others to obey *this* analytical conceptual
<br />
space, not only will something be lost, but free
<br />
thinking will suffer.
<br />
<br />I mention this not because I see it as a problem here
<br />
so much as I see it as a general clash between
<br />
scientific thinking types and others. This issue and
<br />
it's ramifications in translating observables from one
<br />
conceptual space to another could be the subject of a
<br />
lengthy debate all by itself. I mention it here
<br />
because there doesn't seem to be a declared line of
<br />
definition between common meanings and scientific
<br />
definitions of common meanings.
<br />
<br />I also mention it because it seems that much of the
<br />
dicussion here is forcing understanding through
<br />
symbolic logic. Doesn't this present the problem of
<br />
the excluded middle concept?
