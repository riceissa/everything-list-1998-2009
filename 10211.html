<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be sure I have some problem to interpret this.
</em><br />
<br />I'll try to nail this here.  I take 'ontology' to refer to issues of
<br />
existence or being, where 'epistemology' refers to knowledge, or 'what
<br />
and how we know'.  When I say that our 'ontology' is manifest, I'm
<br />
saying (a little more cautiously than Descartes) that *I experience* is
<br />
my primary evidence that 'I am' - indeed, is the manifest 'way in which
<br />
I am'.  From this basic ontological status, I can then proceed to
<br />
epistemological issues of what and how 'I know', which I discuss below.
<br />
However, the 'individual I' established by this basic move IMO is in a
<br />
sense illusory, unless we are prepared to settle for solipsism.  If we
<br />
wish to believe in the reality of something larger than what we can see
<br />
from our perspective, we need to understand our position as delimited
<br />
by the local availability of information.
<br />
<br />To me this is very consistent with MWI, where the superposition of the
<br />
totality of information is nevertheless discriminated into multiple
<br />
perspectives by limitations of access from any locale.  It has always
<br />
seemed to me that there can be no 'preferred basis' for the assembly of
<br />
'personal histories' other than localised structuring of information.
<br />
Is it the function of the 'dovetailer' within your comp hypothesis to
<br />
establish the localisation basis used in assembling such
<br />
'points-of-view' into 'coherent personal histories'?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That looks like a description of emergence of 1-person from 3-persons,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless you define &quot;context&quot; and 'differentiation&quot; exclusively from your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primary 1-person notion.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I do define these exclusively in this way.  This is perhaps a key
<br />
point. My sense is that the context and the differentiation are both
<br />
primitive (irreducible).  That is why I say that I'm agnostic as to the
<br />
details of the differentiation at this logical level.  I take the
<br />
'context' to be primitive - a primary 'FP1' field, for the reasons
<br />
given above.  Further, however we decide to schematise the
<br />
differentiation of this field, at root we have to accept that *somehow*
<br />
parts are separable from the whole - which so far as I can see is
<br />
semantically paradoxical (without introjection from 'outside', what
<br />
could penetrate a 'seamless' whole?) - but in a sense this is a test of
<br />
true primitivity.  Consequently, in my schema, we have a primitive
<br />
field (context) with primitive differentiation (content).  These
<br />
together constitute the global first person FP1g.
<br />
<br />My point about third person is that this is simply terminological.
<br />
Since everything is uniquely constituted in terms of some aspect of the
<br />
FP1g context+content, this also applies to the totality of our
<br />
representations of the world, what I've termed the shared knowledge
<br />
base (SKB).  Within the SKB, such representations are what we refer to
<br />
as third person - the word at arm's length as it were - but this is
<br />
merely an epithet since the ontological status of the SKB in itself
<br />
must be FP1.  The very term 'third person' is literally an FP1 'object'
<br />
within the SKB that refers to a logical category we wish to apply to
<br />
certain aspects of the SKB and its presumed referents in 'externality'.
<br />
But, notwithstanding these internal categorisations, both the SKB and
<br />
its distant referents remain alike - and uniquely - constituents of the
<br />
FP1 context+content.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can talk in a third person manner about first person notions. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some care is needed for not falling  in &quot;Chalmers delusion&quot; who forces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; him to accept some universal first person telepathy, so as to be able
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be at two places at once from a first person point of view. With
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp this is just impossible.
</em><br />
<br />I find this 'Chalmers delusion' just that - deluded.  I've said above
<br />
(and in my 'PC' analogy) that questions of knowledge and identity can
<br />
only be resolved by a person from what is available locally at their
<br />
point-of-view (however this is 'assembled').  This means both whatever
<br />
capability they have, and whatever information is available.  IMO, to
<br />
make intelligible the notion of being in two places at once, one would
<br />
need to posit some non-local (as you say telepathic) transmission of
<br />
information on the presumed basis of these two points-of-view being the
<br />
'same' person.  To me, this is mysticism.  IMO, what constitutes
<br />
'sameness' vis-a-vis persons is the history of points-of-view (which
<br />
from the individual first person point-of-view is a function of
<br />
memory).  At the point of any 'splitting' or duplication of persons,
<br />
there is a split in histories, after which they are no longer the
<br />
'same'.  This is I suppose somewhat analogous to splitting in MWI,
<br />
which sometimes causes similar confusion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here I prefer to simplify and to treat sentences like  &quot;I experience p&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by &quot;I know p&quot;. And keeping added nuances only when it is obligatory.
</em><br />
<br />If you mean that 'I know in virtue that I experience', we could agree,
<br />
although this use of 'know' can be confusing.  As I've said above, my
<br />
primary 'ontological' evidence is that 'I experience'.  This gives me
<br />
my purchase on reality, and with this purchase - this 'grasp' - I gain
<br />
access to information, in the form of what I've termed the SKB.  Within
<br />
the SKB, I can claim 'I know p' (with the above sense), and crucially
<br />
IMO this establishes the claim that the proposition 'I know p' is
<br />
itself directly a graspable 'FP1 object'.  However, the consequence 'p
<br />
is true' does not yet follow, since this must be a function of the
<br />
correspondence of p (per Tarski) with 'facts' located elsewhere in the
<br />
SKB (and, under presumption, in the co-varying distant parts of FP1g to
<br />
which it refers).  So IMO the truth-value of p, if p is a proposition,
<br />
is demonstrated in terms of the 'third person' relations of the SKB,
<br />
standing in place of its 'external' FP1g referents.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; This is because experience is 'incorrigible', and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consequently is not open to falsification.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So at least we agree on the main axiom of standard &quot;knowledge theory&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is capture by a formula like &quot;Kp -&gt;  p&quot;: meaning If I know p then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; p is true. We can know only true proposition. It is conform with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traditional use of the verb &quot;to know&quot;. Nobody says &quot;John knew that (5 +
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4)^2 = 5^2 + 4^2, until he realized his error. We say instead &quot;John
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believed (5 + 4)^2 = 5^2 + 4^2, until he realized his error.
</em><br />
<br />OK, in that case I can't agree that 'I experience' is equivalent to 'I
<br />
know' in this sense.  John in your example 'experiences' both when he
<br />
'knows' or when he merely 'believes'.  Further, he always 'believes'
<br />
whether it can be demonstrated that he 'knows' or not.  The ascription
<br />
of knowledge is here dependent on the truth-value of the proposition in
<br />
which he believes, which may at any given point be provisional.  In any
<br />
case, my use of the term 'I experience' as the primary 'purchase' on
<br />
reality seems logically prior to 'I know', from the above example.  'I
<br />
know' in the above sense is dependent on the truth-relations within the
<br />
SKB and its referents, which 'I experience' is not.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  'Knowing' is then an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emergent aspect of the 'third' person - experience read as information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A key point is that this applies equally to the 'self' as it does to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; others, since both are in the same position vis-a-vis the 'shareable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; knowledge base' (SKB) that IMO is the basis of 'consensual reality'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My point here is that the relation of both 'self' and 'others' to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'knowledge' consists of indicating and manipulating parts of the SKB.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'Experience' is the 'means whereby' we grasp this communicable base,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and is consequently itself not communicable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure what you mean. As far as I understand it, it seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contradict what you say above.
</em><br />
<br />It isn't IMO contradictory, since the sense of 'I know' here, as
<br />
discussed above, is 'I know in virtue of the truth-values and other
<br />
relations within the SKB'.  But my (ontologically and epistemologically
<br />
prior) *purchase* on this 'knowledge' is my FP1 *experience*, the
<br />
medium and means whereby I am able to 'grasp' what is available to be
<br />
known.  Since knowledge in this sense is mediated by the SKB, it puts
<br />
'self' and 'other' on the same footing vis-a-vis the 'third person
<br />
world' represented by the SKB.  This IMO is crucial to understanding
<br />
third person discourse and the way it refers to FP1 reality.  The
<br />
reason all our discourse is 'third person' (including our own internal
<br />
discourse) is that it is forced to take place entirely in terms of the
<br />
SKB.  This makes it all too easy to forget (as the fish ignores the
<br />
water) that the SKB (and the linked 'nodes' to which it 'refers') are
<br />
all within the global FP1 domain.  Were it not so, neither we nor they
<br />
would be present to 'grasp' or be grasped.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will describe the comp theory and it will be nice to see if it will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fit with your notion of persons.
</em><br />
<br />Bring it on!

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Hi Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think you're right about the complexity.  It's because at this stage
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm just trying to discover whether this is a distinction that any of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; us think is true or useful, so I'm deliberately (but perhaps not always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; helpfully alas) using a variety of terms in the attempt to get my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; meaning across (you will recall the difficulties this caused in the FOR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; group).  However, even 'vaguely' is a start, so I'll count it as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; success!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All right. (I hope you realize that you are very ambitious, but then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is how we learn).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; To make my own summary, I think my key points are:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1) I take some sort of 'first person', in the direct sense I've termed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'FP1', to be primitive because IMO this establishes our 'manifest'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ontology (i.e. that given to us in direct experience)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My terminological problem here is that &quot;experience&quot;  and &quot;knowledge&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are usually put in the &quot;epistemology&quot; instead of ontology. Of course I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know that you (and George, perhaps Stephen and Lee) would like to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primitive the first person notion(s) ... or the first persons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be sure I have some problem to interpret this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; without either
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dualism, or 'emergence' from the third person (which IMO is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; incoherent).  This amounts to saying that any situation or context
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which is able to manifest the direct experience of 'I' is in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fundamental sense 'I all the way down'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This could make sense, but in many more than one way given the point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2) However, I don't by this token believe that such a 'global I' (FP1g)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is a 'person' with individual experiential content.  The reason is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; FP1g is undifferentiated, and such differentiation is what IMO
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; demarcates 'perceivers' and their 'perceptual models'.  A conceptual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; model might be a network where 'persons' are nodes that co-vary, by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sharing information, with other parts of the network to which they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; energetically connected.  These nodes are then what I have termed FP1i.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This makes sense, except that with comp, by UDA, you will have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (re)define entirely &quot;energetically connected&quot; by the coherence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conditions on the notions of person. Perhaps you could wait  I say more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on this in my own future summary-roadmap which I have promise to Tom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and George.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 3) About the details of differentiation schemas (comp, physics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; whatever) I'm deliberately agnostic, because my key point is simply to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; propose the emergence of 'persons' from the contrast between a seamless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'context' and its differentiated 'content'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That looks like a description of emergence of 1-person from 3-persons,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless you define &quot;context&quot; and 'differentiation&quot; exclusively from your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primary 1-person notion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  I take such persons to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have a 'dyadic' structure ('perceiver' + 'perceptual model') that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; directly experienced, and elements of such direct experience are also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what we call 'third person' when 'read' as information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can talk in a third person manner about first person notions. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some care is needed for not falling  in &quot;Chalmers delusion&quot; who forces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; him to accept some universal first person telepathy, so as to be able
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be at two places at once from a first person point of view. With
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp this is just impossible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  I do, as you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; know, hold certain opinions about the equivalence properties of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience, but they are not IMO critical in establishing this more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fundamental point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 4) A consequence of the foregoing is that such experiential content can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be 'experienced' (or *is* experience) but not 'known', in the sense of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'if p is true'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here I prefer to simplify and to treat sentences like  &quot;I experience p&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by &quot;I know p&quot;. And keeping added nuances only when it is obligatory.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is because experience is 'incorrigible', and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consequently is not open to falsification.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So at least we agree on the main axiom of standard &quot;knowledge theory&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is capture by a formula like &quot;Kp -&gt;  p&quot;: meaning If I know p then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; p is true. We can know only true proposition. It is conform with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traditional use of the verb &quot;to know&quot;. Nobody says &quot;John knew that (5 +
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4)^2 = 5^2 + 4^2, until he realized his error. We say instead &quot;John
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believed (5 + 4)^2 = 5^2 + 4^2, until he realized his error.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  'Knowing' is then an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emergent aspect of the 'third' person - experience read as information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A key point is that this applies equally to the 'self' as it does to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; others, since both are in the same position vis-a-vis the 'shareable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; knowledge base' (SKB) that IMO is the basis of 'consensual reality'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My point here is that the relation of both 'self' and 'others' to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'knowledge' consists of indicating and manipulating parts of the SKB.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'Experience' is the 'means whereby' we grasp this communicable base,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and is consequently itself not communicable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure what you mean. As far as I understand it, it seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contradict what you say above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 5) Finally, I think that many conceptual problems come from confusing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the SKB with the referents from which it derives.  In 'everyday life'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we tend to act from the belief that the world *itself* is 'third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person' - because its analogs in the SKB are read in that way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think this summarises the distinctions I'm trying to make, in a non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rigorous way.  If you or George feel inclined to take it further that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would be great, but I guess it would depend on whether, as I've said,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this seems to add anything useful to the enterprise.  I could certainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; use some help in any attempt to axiomatise the above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will describe the comp theory and it will be nice to see if it will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fit with your notion of persons.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I think I see, albeit vaguely,  what you mean by your distinction, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; it seems to me more and more complex and based on many non trivial

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; notion &quot;objective&quot;, &quot;context&quot;, &quot;boudaries&quot; . It would be interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; George and you were able to converge to a &quot;sharable&quot; notion of first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; person. I am interested because the first person notion plays a key
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; role, both in the UDA reasoning (the first part of my thesis which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; shows that comp forces a reversal between physics and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;bio/psych/theology of numbers&quot;) and in the beginning of the partial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; but &quot;explicit&quot; part of (propositional) physics we can already extract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (and compare with quantum logic) when we translate the UDA in purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; number-theoretical tools (the second part of my thesis).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; To be sure, David, there are too many implicit assumptions, in your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; person distinction in your last posts, which, even in the case you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; would make them clear, would still be too precise so that I cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; currently make the comparison. I will say more in the roadmap asap.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I think before commenting on the axioms you present I would want to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; place them within something more inclusive along the following lines:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ('FP1' and 'FP2' are used in the senses I have previously given, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 'TP' as 'third person' in the sense of any schema whatsoever for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; differentiating the 'directly uttered' FP1 subjective context.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; intention is to present an 'outsideless' approach to reality that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; nevertheless allows for the definition of boundaries that delimit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; information flow and representation, and consequently 'knowing',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 'knowability' and 'knowledge', in the ways characteristic of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 'individual first persons'.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   1) Global FP1 (FP1g) = 'subjective context'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   2) TP  = 'objective content'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   3) Individual FP1 (FP1i) : perceiver/ model = FP1g + TP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   4) FP2 : shareable model of FP1i = FP1g + TP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Then:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   5) If p is knowable then p is TP in context of FP1g
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   6) If k1 is a knower then k1 is FP1i in context of FP1g
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   7) If p is known then p is TP in context of FP1i
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   8) If k2 is knowable then k2 is FP2 in context of FP1g
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   9) If k2 is known then k2 is FP2 in context of FP1i
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  10) If k2 is shared then k2 is FP2 in context of more than one FP1i
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; This further implies that:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 11) FP1g is not knowable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 12) FP1i is knowable but not shareable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 13) FP2 is knowable and shareable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 14) FP2 may in fact be known and in fact be shared
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In consequence of the foregoing, third person discourse relating to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 'first person' necessarily takes place in terms of FP2, but in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; context of a community of FP1i 'knowers'. The content of FP1i is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; indescribable but 'shareable' - on the analogy of a shareable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; distribution - 'downloadable'.  As directly uttered or manifested,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; it's sui generis, not 'like anything'.  As FP1i, 'I' can narrate my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 'experience' - including my own 'self-reporting' - only in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ostensive TP terms that map to the 'shareable distribution'.  Hence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; for example, 'red' is indicated by 'pointing' to 'that' - both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; for 'me' and in my report to 'you' via the shareable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; distribution.  In this way we can jointly develop common mappings and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; organising schemas within 'shared reality'.  This symmetry of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; limitation puts us on an equal footing within a community of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; shareable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; discourse.
