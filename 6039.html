<br />Dear Russell,
<br />
since you e-mail without words (only an attachment) I copy your text here to give my reply to it - interspaced, if you don't mind :

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Russell seems to restrict 'observerhood' to timed worlds (maybe: humans?)  (&quot;there's nobody in them to observe them&quot;). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I leave 'observation' open to ANY absorption of information, in &gt;&gt;'our' sense or otherwise. I don't 'deny' existence to formats we &gt;&gt;have no idea about. We just don't know. (JM  ) 
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ( R St  now )  :
</em><br />
It is an assumption (or perhaps postulate: the Time postulate). It is
<br />
amenable to debate, just as Euclid's axioms are. I offer the following points in its favour:
<br />
<br />1) Observation is the process of creating information, by
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distinguishing differences between things (aka bits).
<br />
<br />JM: IMO observation does NOT CREATE information, it collects it. Information is the acknowledged difference and I agree with point 2: there must be at least 1 mutual dimension for a comparison (to have an acknowledgeable difference) aka information. Two dimensionally unconnected 'facts' do not constitute a difference, nor provide information on the two together. Desultory knowledge is irrelevant in this case. 
<br />
(Bits: I may not understand it right, but IMO a 'bit' does not disclose a meaning - it is applicable in any context applied. 
<br />
So I would reverse Wheeler's 'it from bit' into 'bit from it'. We do not 'create' the world according to the computer bits - but in the contrary, the bits represent (stand for) the &quot;its&quot;.) 
<br />
<br />2) To have a difference, obviously requires at least one dimension.
<br />
<br />3) To compare two different entities requires that the properties of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the two entities be brought together (inside the observer's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;mind&quot;). Thus the one required dimension must be &quot;timelike&quot;,           with the observer passing from point to point.
<br />
<br />JM: I don't see the conclusion about &quot;timelike&quot;: observation can compare e.g. overlapping pictures atemporarily, in one. 
<br />
But this, again, is the reflection of human habits (logic and capabilities). 
<br />
If we consider 'information' as I propose in generalization: 
<br />
acknowledged difference, not restricted how and by what acknowledged, &quot;our&quot; time concept does not enter the picture. 
<br />
<br />4) For those who believe in Computationalism, the Turing model of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computation implicitly requires this Time postulate.
<br />
<br />JM: I don't. It is a human representational way of OUR world model. Even if we try to 'apply' it to &quot;other&quot; worlds.
<br />
<br />5) It appears to be a necessary ingredient to obtain Quantum Mechanics  from first principles (see my &quot;Why Occams Razor&quot; paper)
<br />
<br />JM: ditto, see my remark to #4
<br />
<br />None of this is a proof. However, it is very persuasive and
<br />
general. For someone to claim that this postulate is invalid, they
<br />
would probably need to show a model of observation that invalidates it, just as Gauss showed Euclid's 5th axiom was not necessary by showing a consistent geometry in which he axiom was invalid. And that would be a very interesting development.
<br />
<br />JM: Nobody has to show an unproven idea as invalid. The idea must be verified first for argumentation. Furthermore: it is nice to show an alternative, however an unlikely idea can be deemed unlikely without providing an alternative. 
<br />
Ideas are 'persuasive' within the belief system they fit into. Comp and QM are &quot;general&quot; chapters within the (limited) model we have in contemporary science about THIS world. Not valid in an openminded multiverse of no restrictions.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers
<br />
