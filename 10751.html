Stathis:
<br />
I am not 'debating' your position, just musing about expressions.
<br />
You made a very interesting passage below:
<br />
SP:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;...Perhaps there is a difference between intelligence and consciousness.
</em><br />
Intelligence must be defined operationally, as you have suggested, which
<br />
involves the intelligent agent interacting with the environment. A computer
<br />
hardwired with &quot;input&quot; is not a very useful device from the point of view of
<br />
an observer, displaying no more intelligence than a film of the screen
<br />
would....&lt;
<br />
JM:
<br />
What I sense in your discussion with Peter, a certain group of qualia has
<br />
been picked (computer input) and argued about it being consciousness.
<br />
Irrespective of other qualia findable in systems outside that circle, which
<br />
e.g. in 'human consciousness have their input. A limited model quality is
<br />
matched to a wider background of interactions and assigned to the
<br />
generalized concept.
<br />
<br />Speaking about intelligence may be an improvement: in my wording it requires
<br />
(beside considerable knowledge-base - memory) an &quot;elasticity&quot; of the mind,
<br />
to ponder the features according to (counterfactual? I am not so familiar
<br />
with the term) contradictory 'arguments' and finding one outcome, not
<br />
necessarily the obvious. In this activity the 'mind' includes 'more' than
<br />
just the 'data fed into a computer' and may provide a different entailment
<br />
from a (limitedly) 'conscious' (Turing?) machine.
<br />
<br />In your earlier post you wrote:
<br />
SP:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;.There are those who argue that human cognition is fundamentally different
</em><br />
from classical computers due to quantum randomness, but even if this is the
<br />
case there is no reason to believe that it is necessarily the case. Brains
<br />
would have evolved to give rise to appropriate survival-enhancing behaviour,
<br />
which precludes random or erratic behaviour. A degree of unpredictability
<br />
would have to be present in order to avoid predators or catch prey, but
<br />
unpredictable does not necessarily mean random: it just has to be beyond the
<br />
capabilities of the predators or prey to predict. The unpredictability could
<br />
result from the effect of classical chaos, or simply from the complexity of
<br />
the behaviour which is in fact perfectly deterministic. No true randomness
<br />
is needed....&lt;
<br />
JM:
<br />
I dislike the term 'Q-randomness' for 2 reasons:
<br />
1. randomness is not part of a totally interconnected deterministic world in
<br />
which every change is triggered by the movement of the totality (my vision),
<br />
and
<br />
2. the &quot;quantum&quot; refers to a linear reductionist mathematical science in
<br />
which no randomness is feasible and nonlinear counterfactuals are not
<br />
contemplated (In My Unprofessional Opinion) as ARE included in the (live?)
<br />
human cognition.
<br />
Unpredictability by whom?  you mention the participants, but it may be a
<br />
characteristic theoretically noted. Read on.
<br />
(Classical?) chaos IMO is a feature not (yet?) explained by our cognition in
<br />
the reductionist sciences.  Like :emergence. Once we learn more, it becomes
<br />
unchaos. (Or: the emergence: a regular result).
<br />
So some &quot;model&quot;-terms we use are ambiguous and incomplete, yet we draw
<br />
'definite' (generalized) conclusions from them.
<br />
(cf my previous post to Brent about 'model').
<br />
<br />The best

<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What I meant was, if a computer program can be associated with

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness, then a rigid and deterministic computer program can also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be associated with consciousness - leaving aside the question of how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; exactly the association occurs. For example, suppose I have a
</em><br />
conversation
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with a putatively conscious computer program as part of a Turing test,
</em><br />
and
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the program passes, convincing me and everyone else that it has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conscious during the test. Then, I start up the program again with no
</em><br />
memory
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; saved from the first run, but this time I play it a recording of my
</em><br />
voice from
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the first test. The program will go through exactly the same resposes as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; during the first run, but this time to an external observer who saw the
</em><br />
first
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; run the program's responses will be no more surprising that my questions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on the recording of my voice. The program itself won't know what's
</em><br />
coming
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and it might even think it is being clever by throwing is some
</em><br />
&quot;unpredictable&quot;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; answers to prove how free and human-like it really is. I don't think
</em><br />
there is any
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; basis for saying it is conscious during the first run but not during the
</em><br />
second. I
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; also don't think it helps to say that its responses *would* have been
</em><br />
different
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; even on the second run had its input been different, because that is
</em><br />
true of
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any record player or automaton.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think it does help; or at least it makes a difference.  I think you
</em><br />
illegitmately
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; move the boundary between the thing supposed to be conscious (I'd prefer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;intelligent&quot;, because I think intelligence requires counterfactuals, but
</em><br />
I'm not
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure about consciousness) and its environment in drawing that conclusion.
</em><br />
The
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question is whether the *recording* is conscious.  It has no input.  But
</em><br />
then you say
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it has counterfactuals because the output of a *record player* would be
</em><br />
different
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with a different input.  One might well say that a record player has
</em><br />
intelligence -
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a very low level.   But a record does not.
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps there is a difference between intelligence and consciousness.
<br />
Intelligence
<br />
must be defined operationally, as you have suggested, which involves the
<br />
intelligent
<br />
agent interacting with the environment. A computer hardwired with &quot;input&quot; is
<br />
not a
<br />
very useful device from the point of view of an observer, displaying no more
<br />
intelligence
<br />
than a film of the screen would. However, useless though it might be, I
<br />
don't see why
<br />
the computer should not be conscious with the hardwired input if it is
<br />
conscious with the
<br />
same input on a particular run from a variable environment. If the
<br />
experiment were set
<br />
up properly, it would be impossible for the computer to know where the input
<br />
was
<br />
coming from. Another way to look at it would be to say that intelligence is
<br />
relative to
<br />
an environment but consciousness is absolute. This is in keeping with the
<br />
fact that
<br />
intelligent behaviour is third person observable but consciousness is not.
