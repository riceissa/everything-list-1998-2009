<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I was being too poetic ;)  By &quot;despair&quot; I meant nihilism, the belief
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that there ultimately is no meaning.  I am arguing that the ultimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; source of meaning has to be personal.  I'm just saything that my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; argument is of the form, &quot;If meaning is not ultimately based on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; personal God, then there is no true meaning, because...&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I realised when I was about 12 or 13 years old that there could not be any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ultimate meaning. I was very pleased and excited with this discovery, and ran
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; around trying to explain it to people (mostly drawing blank looks, as I remember).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seemed to me just another interesting fact about the world, like scientific and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; historical facts. It inspired me to start reading philosophy, looking up words like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;nihilism&quot; in the local library. It also encouraged me to question rules, laws and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moral edicts handed down with no justification other than tradition or authority,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where these were in conflict with my own developing value system. Overall, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think the realisation that there was no ultimate meaning was one of the more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; positive experiences in my life. But even if it hadn't been, and threw me into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deep depression, does that have any bearing on whether or not it is true?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />It's interesting that in my observations quite a lot of people have an
<br />
eye-opening experience around the age of 12 regarding the meaning of
<br />
life.  Perhaps it has to do with entering puberty and forming our own
<br />
sense of purpose.  I guess you might know something about this from
<br />
your background, Stathis.  For me it was when I was eleven, I think
<br />
triggered by starting to go to a boarding school and living away from
<br />
my parents.  One night I had this overwhelming sense of God's presence,
<br />
a sense of ultimate love surround me and reassure me that everything
<br />
was going to be all right.  And I felt a deep sense of gratitude just
<br />
for being alive.  It was a strict boarding school (religious!), and
<br />
there was a real sense of competition, but when my mom asked me in a
<br />
letter how I was doing, I said, &quot;I'm just fine, as long as they don't
<br />
cut my head off!&quot;  Anyway, from then on I felt &quot;centered&quot;, or at least
<br />
I had a &quot;center&quot; that I could go back to, because I knew that I was
<br />
loved by the One from whom Everything/Everyone comes from.
<br />
<br />My view of this is that we form our view of meaning as a process of
<br />
thought about whatever resources we have.  For instance, someone could
<br />
look around them at the options for defining meaning, and choose not to
<br />
base their meaning on any so-called &quot;ultimate&quot; source.  However, this
<br />
general process in an of itself doesn't seem to actually prove one way
<br />
or other that a particular basis of meaning is the &quot;real&quot; basis of
<br />
meaning, if such a thing actually exists.
<br />
<br />How does this relate to the Everything List?  That's a good question,
<br />
and is one of the questions I want to pose on this thread.  Does the
<br />
Everything idea, or discussions at the Everything &quot;level&quot; have anything
<br />
to do with the meaning of life?  Does it shed any light on the meaning
<br />
of life, or meaning in general; or vice versa: does the meaning of
<br />
life, or one's view of meaning, have any significant effect on the
<br />
Everything issues, and if so how?
<br />
<br />Certainly in the view of many big thinkers, the meaning of life is the
<br />
central question of philosophy, and it seems that philosophy has a
<br />
central bearing on the topic of this List.    For example Albert Camus,
<br />
in his The Myth of Sisyphus says:
<br />
<br />&quot;There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is
<br />
suicide.  Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to
<br />
answering the fundamental question of philosophy.  All the
<br />
rest--whether the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine
<br />
categories or twelve categories--come afterward.  These are games; one
<br />
must first answer...  If I ask myself how to judge that this question
<br />
is more urgent than that, I reply that one judges by the actions it
<br />
entails.  I have never seen anyone die for the ontological argument
<br />
[for the existence of a god].  Galileo, who held a scientific truth of
<br />
great importance, abjured it with the greatest of ease as soon as it
<br />
endangered his life.  In a certain sense he did right.  That truth was
<br />
not worth the stake.  Whether the earth or the sun revolved around the
<br />
other is a matter of profound indifference.  To tell the truth, it is a
<br />
futile question.  On the other hand, I see many people die because they
<br />
judge that life is not worth living.  I see others paradoxically
<br />
getting killed for the ideas or illusions that give them a reason for
<br />
living (what is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason
<br />
for dying).  I therefore conclude that the meaning of life is the most
<br />
urgent of questions.&quot;
<br />
<br />Besides the question of how meaning relates to this List, the question
<br />
of meaning itself can be asked at several different levels, so I'll
<br />
list a few:
<br />
<br />1) Why does the universe exist?  Why is there something rather than
<br />
nothing?
<br />
2) Why do human beings in general exist?
<br />
3) Why do I exist?
<br />
<br />The purpose of listing these three questions is not to deal with all of
<br />
them on this thread necessarily, but to show that the question of the
<br />
meaning of life really is connected to the universal questions that
<br />
this list tries to address.  One's answer to any one of these questions
<br />
can affect his/her answer to the other questions.
<br />
<br />It seems that we all have to eventually come to the question of the end
<br />
of our lives.  (Even if immortality, quantum or other kinds, is a
<br />
reality, the question of the end of our lives is a topic addressed even
<br />
on this List.)  So as one man on United Flight 93 said before giving
<br />
his life to save others, &quot;Let's roll!&quot;
<br />
<br />Tom
<br />
<br />&quot;You ask me about the meaning of life?  Good Lord, I don't even know my
<br />
way around Chinatown!&quot; - Woody Allen
