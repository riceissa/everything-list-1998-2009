<br />I guess what I'm saying is that in trying to solve the paradoxes we can't
<br />
just look at probability theory. Instead we should look at decision
<br />
theory, and try to come up with one that is compatible with AUH. The new
<br />
decision theory may not even have to do with the traditional concepts of
<br />
probability.
<br />
<br />(I take back my earlier suggestion that we fix probability theory first
<br />
and then worry about decision theory. That doesn't work because
<br />
probability theory by itself is just a mathematical structure. It is
<br />
decision theory that makes use of probability theory and connects it with
<br />
the real world.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you can still look at evolution and see what kinds of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision theory and probability theory will evolve.  We know that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are replicators and have developed our instinctive understanding of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability over a long period of time.  This should be able to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analyzed and understood.  You might be able to create a toy universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of evolving replicators and see what kinds of probability theories are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most useful and successful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The fact that we may apply probabilistic reasoning in understanding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolution does not seem circular or paradoxical to me.  Probability and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic are tools which are applied successfully in a wide range of areas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may be that in some of our discussions we are extending them into areas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where they don't work so well (like your copying paradoxes).  But that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not mean that they are useless in general.  Sticking to well defined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and explored areas, like evaluating the behavior of evolutionary systems,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can confidently use probability theory, logic, and other tools to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; develop our theories and understanding.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but you can't use probability theory to decide which decision theory
<br />
to accept as a normative theory, because by using probabilities you've
<br />
already accepted a normative decision theory.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't really understand this.  Assuming that we are like other people,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and if we have a theory that tells us how we should act, and we actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follow the theory, then this same theory should tell how other people do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; act.  Maybe I'm missing the point here.
</em><br />
<br />I agree that normative and positive decision theories will tend to be
<br />
similar. The point is that they serve different roles, and are judged on
<br />
different bases.
