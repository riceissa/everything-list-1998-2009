</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A lot of the dialog below is a mismatch of ideas which indicates that I

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have underestimated the degree of difficulty to be expected in getting the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea of hierarchical structures across. Nevetheless..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I think you are assuming a separateness of structure that does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It obviously does exist , up to a point. I am separate form this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; keyboard.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (and let's not confuse separateness and difference...)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If space and matter (have a look at the cover of this weeks NewScientist)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are different expressions of a single structure then you and space are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unified.
</em><br />
<br />If they are different substructures within a further (different)
<br />
struture,
<br />
they are also unified, in that sense and to that extent.
<br />
<br />The contentious claims here are:
<br />
a) That being multiple instances of the same structure is the only
<br />
way things can be &quot;unified&quot;.
<br />
<br />b) Things unified in that sense are devoid of any difference or
<br />
separaration
<br />
whatsoever.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It is that unification that is at the heart of qualia production,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for qualia result as another feature of the underlying structure.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; There is one and one only structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If you want ot look at it that way. But it is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; undifferentiated within itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Looking at it like that is the only way that makes any sense.
</em><br />
<br />So you say. You have not said anythign at all about what
<br />
makes the alternatives nonsensical.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; We are all part of it. There is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; concept of 'separate' to be had.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; yes there is: spatial separation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; See above.
</em><br />
<br />Doesn't address the point.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Absolutely everything is included in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; structure. No exceptions. Space, atoms, scientists, qualia. All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; interactions at all 'scales' (scale itself) are all interactions between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; different parts of the one structure. To interact at all is to interact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; with another part of the structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;another&quot; in what sense ? You just said there is *no* concept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of separation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eg. Matter passes through space. It is interacting with itself. Matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'looks' separate to space, but deep down its not. The appearance of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separateness is how it is presented to us.
</em><br />
<br />It is entirely possible that they are unified deep down and
<br />
separate on the surface. Separation need not be dismissed
<br />
as appearance.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;  The idea of there being anything else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; ('not' the structure) is meaningless. If there is any 'thing' in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; structure then the balance of the structure expressed a perfect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; un-thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; There is nothing else. That is the coincept I am exploring.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; None of that has anything to do with your claim that there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a single *type* of structure, and that everything is composed of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; recursive combinations of its instances.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It may be the case that everything is ultimately part of one strucutre,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that does not imply that everything within the Great Strucutre is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; self-similar.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The structure is hierarchical layers of organisation only. Members of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; layer share morphological invariance to some characteristics of layer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; layer. Properties are inherited by child layers from paretn layers. All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the layers are contained by each other.
</em><br />
<br />How very c++-ey.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Do you have any evidence, or are you appelaing to the comfort
<br />
zone of Sofware Engineers ?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Their presentation bestows intrinsic knowledge as a measurement to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; embedded structure member called the scientist. This is knowledge as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; intrinsic intentionality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Are yu saying that qualia are marked by intentionality ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That would be novel.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;,, qualia are intrinsic, consciously accessible, NON-INTENTIONAL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; features of sense-data and other non-physical phenomenal objects that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are responsible for their phenomenal character.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When we experience redness it is painted onto some'thing'.
</em><br />
<br />Not if it is adream or hallucination ,
<br />
or the
<br />
result of pressing your eyeball.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In _use_ it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic 'aboutness'.
</em><br />
<br />Then that comes from the use, not the quale.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In themselves they have none. At the instance of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their creation they acquire intentionality _because_ they are meant for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that very purpose - to inform 'aboutness'...That is the distinction I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think useful.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; S.E.P, my emphasis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Within the experiences is regularity which can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; then be characterised as knowledge attributed to some identified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; behaviour
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; in the structure. This attribution is only an attribution as to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; behaviour
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; of the structure, not the structure. These attributions can be used by a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; another  scientist in their 'first person' world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I still think &quot;strcuture&quot; is an unhappy term for soemthign which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cannot be reduced to abstract relations and behaviour.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The structure can be abstracted and studied. But what you do is simulate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it, not abstract it in the traditional sense, except to characterise the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules of the simulation and let them run. For example, one of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structural statistics that will fall out of analyses of the structure is G
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (graviatational const), another is the speed of light.and so on. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural constants are statistics of the underlying structure. They are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulataneously constants in empirical laws of the apparent behaviour of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the structure.
</em><br />
<br />You could just as well say the apparaent behaviour of the universe.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; All of this is derived from a first person presentation of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; measurement.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Ergo science is entirely first operson based.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The fact that science happens to be performed by persons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; doesn't make it irreducibly first-personal. That would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; depend on whether persons can remove themselves from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; scientific descriptions. As it happens they can. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is still true with much-misunderstood issue of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; quantum &quot;observer&quot; involvement, since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that is really apparatus-involvement. No observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ever influenced an experiment without changing the settings of some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; apparatus.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we are at odds here. The mere presence of a human involing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves in observation means that a direct causal impact is established
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the observer and the observed.
</em><br />
<br />No it doesn't. All &quot;observer influence&quot; is mediated
<br />
by apparatus, as I have said. There is zero evidence
<br />
of direct influence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only quation is the magnitude
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the disturbance thus invoked. Clearly until we start to look at very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fine detail the magnitude of the disturbance is trivial. That's when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disturbances make things look quantum mechanical. At all times, however,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deep down those disturbances are always there resolving the structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; options. I hope that makes sense.
</em><br />
<br />You seem to be leaning heavily on the disturbance interpretation
<br />
of the HUP
<br />
<br /><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~Glove_r/Folse4.html">http://members.tripod.com/~Glove_r/Folse4.html</a>
<br />
<br />The Disturbance Principle
<br />
<br />Though it forms no part of complementarity, the disturbance principle
<br />
was frequently defended as part of the Copenhagen Interpretation and
<br />
often identified with Bohr's view in the years following Heisenberg's
<br />
discovery. From the perspective of Heisenberg, it appeared that the
<br />
basis of the disturbance principle lay in the fact that the instruments
<br />
doing the observing &quot;disturbed&quot; the observed system such that its state
<br />
after observation is no longer what was determined in the measurement.
<br />
This interpretation compares observation of atomic systems to
<br />
measuring, for example, the inner workings of a wrist watch using a
<br />
yardstick.
<br />
<br />However, the disturbance interpretation plays havoc with the facts
<br />
behind the genesis of the uncertainty principle and its status within
<br />
the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics. The principle is a
<br />
straight forward deductive consequence of the quantum theoretical
<br />
formalism which provides a highly confirmed means of predicting the
<br />
outcome of interaction between radiation and matter. There is no
<br />
mention of disturbance in the derivation of the principle itself, nor
<br />
of how to go about determining the relevant parameters.
<br />
<br />The design of experiments is relevant only to interpreting the physical
<br />
significance of the principle. The assumption that the classical system
<br />
really exists in a classical mechanical state supposes the question of
<br />
whether an experiment could be designed which will yield greater
<br />
knowledge about the state of the atomic system than the uncertainty
<br />
principle allows. If this could be done, the theory would be properly
<br />
judged incomplete.
<br />
<br />The disturbance interpretation mistake becomes apparent when we
<br />
realize, that according to it, we could only approach classical ideals
<br />
of strict determinism if our measuring instruments were the size of
<br />
atoms. However, it is only an immense difference between the dimensions
<br />
of ordinary human experience and those involved in atomic processes
<br />
that made strict determinism a nearly obtainable goal. If our
<br />
instruments were the same size as atoms, then the role of the quantum
<br />
in an interaction would be ever increasing rather than decreasing, as
<br />
the disturbance interpretation suggest.
<br />
<br />In classical mechanics, the observation also &quot;disturbs&quot; the observed,
<br />
but the disturbance is either negligible or &quot;controllable&quot; and so can
<br />
be accounted for in defining the state of an isolated system after the
<br />
observation interaction. In quantum theory, ordinarily the effect of
<br />
the interaction cannot be considered negligible nor &quot;controllable&quot;.
<br />
Since the disturbance interpretation makes it appear that the
<br />
uncertainty principle is a empirical generalization, it's unable to
<br />
explain why this alleged disturbance cannot be determined in the
<br />
quantum framework, and allows a return to classical deterministic
<br />
formalism.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;  Epistemic and Ontic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; characters are smatter throughout this description. I could label them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; but you already know and the process adds nothing to the message or to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; sorting out how it all works.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  I'd say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; we formulate abstractions that correlate with agreed appearances
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; first person view. However, the correspo0ndence between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; structure and the formulate abstractions is only that - a correlation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; models are not the structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; *Could* they be the structure ? if it necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the case that the &quot;structure&quot; cannot be modelled, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it is perhaps no strcuture at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Which is the simpler and more reasonable basis upon which to explore the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; universe:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 1) The universe is literally constructed by some sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 'empirical_law_in_ a_certain_context embodiment machine' by means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; unknown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that has appearances that cannot be predicted by empirical laws.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (logically equivalent to &quot;the laws of nature are invoked by the purple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; baloon people of the horsehead nebula&quot;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ????
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Too hard basket thrshold has been reached! :-)
</em><br />
<br />????
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 2) The universe is a structure of which we are a part and which also has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the property of delivering appearances of itself to us within which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; regularity that can be captured mathematically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is a combination of two claims:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  2a) The universe is a structure properly-so-called of which we are a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; part and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  which also has the property of delivering appearances of itself to us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; within which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; regularity that can be captured mathematically, with no residue, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; everything is full expressible in mathematical, structural and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; terms. (ie eliminative physicalism)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  2b) The universe is a &quot;structure&quot;  which we are a part and, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; contains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; irreducibly non-relational and non-functional aspects (and is therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not a structure in the strict sense of the term)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  which also has the property of delivering appearances of itself to us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; within which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; regularity that can be captured mathematically and also aspects that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be so capture, leading to a Hard Problem. (property dualism)

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The point is that science is stuck on 1).
</em><br />
<br />Frankly, I found that unintelligible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Trying to shoehorn the situation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into philosophical 'ism buckets is of no value.
</em><br />
<br />It is a rare day when someone thinks of something
<br />
no-one has thought before. The overwhelming
<br />
likelihood
<br />
is that there is an pre-existing ism for hwat you
<br />
are saying.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I'm after a real practical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outcome.
</em><br />
<br />So why is there nothing quantitative or predictive in what
<br />
you say ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A recognition that science is mis-structured and we have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change.
</em><br />
<br />That is a bold claim. Science is an extremely succesful enterprise.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And sooner rather than later!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I recently had an article on dual-aspect science published in IEEE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Intelligence Systems journal... have a look.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cheers
