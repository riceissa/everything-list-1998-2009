<br /><br />I have always read books in this way (except courses and novels).
<br />
In each field I'm interested in I have master books I read and reread
<br />
and satellites I consult and reconsult.
<br />
Sometimes I am not sure if I exist only but as a slave of dormant ideas
<br />
in books manipulating me for spreading in some ways ...
<br />
My books are like butterflies jumping from tables to sofas, following
<br />
me everywhere trying to exchange ideas, linking notions, etc. I am
<br />
only an humble servitor ... :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And much of what Tegmark outlines in his large chart can be

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dramatically simplified and abstracted.
</em><br />
<br /><br />And we need to do that! because we are distributed in the tegmark
<br />
big structure in such a way that from our local views, the global
<br />
accessible view is mathematically more rich than the big structure!
<br />
(well more on that later).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;applying thoughts/concepts/morphisms/etc. from one area to another.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps category theory will push AI in new ways.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Part of it, sure. Most &quot;explanations&quot; are morphism in known structures.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Everything seemed directly related to problems which had fascinated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;me for decades. Some of these issues I hope I have hinted at here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It was almost as if category and topos theory had been invented just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for me....an exaggeration, but it captures my sense of wonder. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;haven't been this excited about a new area in more than a decade. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;expect I'll be doing something in this area for at least the _next_ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;decade.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My apologies if this explanation of enthusiasm is too personal for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you the reader, but I think enthusiasm is a good thing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Me too. Now, I feel almost like you about ... knot theory.
<br />
And this fit well with your cat-enthusiasm, for knot theory is
<br />
a reservoir of beautiful and TOE-relevant categories
<br />
(the monoidal one). I've just
<br />
ordered Yetter's book: functorial(*) knot theory. It is the number 24
<br />
of Kauffman series on Knots and Everything (sic) at World
<br />
Scient. Publ Co.  A series  which could be a royal series for this list ...
<br />
May I recommand the n° 1, by Louis Kauffman himself: knots and physics?
<br />
A must for the (quantum) toes, and (I speculate now) the comp toe too!
<br />
<br />I knew Yetter's work a long time ago when I read his paper on
<br />
the semantics on non commutative girard linear logic.
<br />
Unfortunately, later, the Z logics gave me a (weakening) of
<br />
quantum logic (the von neumann one), which
<br />
Yetter dismisses in that paper, so I did dismiss Yetter ...
<br />
Now I know the z logics really should have &quot;tensorial semantics&quot;,
<br />
sort of many related (glued) von neumann type of logics (which are
<br />
themselves atlases of boolean logics).
<br />
But where (in Zs logic) those damned tensorial categories come from???
<br />
Knots gives hints!!! This would explain the geometrical appearance
<br />
of realities.
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br />(*) For the other: &quot;functorial&quot; really means categorial. Functors are
<br />
the morphisms between categories. The first chapter of Yetter's book
<br />
is an intro to category theory, the second one, on Knot theory, ...
