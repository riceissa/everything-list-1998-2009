The word 'dynamic' is relative.  
<br />
We, as creatures in time,  see things as dynamic.  
<br />
<br />The block universe itself is unchanging and everlasting.  
<br />
There are many relationships - 
<br />
in fact, there are all possible relationships. 
<br />
<br />Everything possible exists.  
<br />
One relationship is what we call 'time', 
<br />
which is a relationship between 'snapshots' 
<br />
in the block universe or 'multiverse'. 
<br />
<br />As we are creatures in time,
<br />
we can do no other 
<br />
than see this relationship 
<br />
as a dynamic flow.  
<br />
<br />Now we get on 
<br />
to the weak anthropic principle.  
<br />
<br />We see this 'flow of time' because
<br />
and only because it is 
<br />
a prerequisite for the evolution of consciousness.  
<br />
Every physical feature of our environment 
<br />
is uncannily precisely tuned 
<br />
to the emergence of consciousness. 
<br />
<br />All environments exist, 
<br />
so if we find ourselves existing, 
<br />
then it's pretty bloody obvious 
<br />
that we will be in a universe 
<br />
that is capable of supporting us.  
<br />
<br />And in those universes 
<br />
which are more finely tuned to support us, 
<br />
there is a higher incidence of conscious life. 
<br />
<br />Golly, gosh! so we should expect to find ourselves in an enviornment 
<br />
arbitrarily finely-tined to be hospitable to us.
<br />
And one that has all these fine features,
<br />
such as a dynamic flow of time.  
<br />
<br />But of course, from the Archimedian perspective, 
<br />
outside the block universe, 
<br />
all relationships exist, 
<br />
they are unchanging and everlasting.  
<br />
No one enviornment is to be preferred to another.  
<br />
The enviornment that we all inhabit so happily 
<br />
is infinitely tiny.  
<br />
<br />The word 'dynamic' is subjective.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	Stalemate.  We may never agree on this one.  I think more people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would support my position than yours, but that's not saying much.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's see if there isn't a reasonable way out of this stalemate. First of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all it's obvious that consciousness must have something to do with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information. Now a binary string is the simplest kind of object that can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain information, but any discrete structure that can contain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information can also be encoded as binary strings. Therefore binary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strings are a universal container of information. If pure structure can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sustain consciousness, then binaries strings can sustain consciousness. Do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you agree so far?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You don't seem to think that pure structure is sufficient for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness. Why? Clearly we experience dynamics and decisions, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could they not just be illusions? Is there a deeper reason why dynamics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and decisions are necessary for consciousness?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	No, that's not what I said.  For the shortest program, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simulated environment would no doubt be vastly simplified compared to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we observe.  But the basic elements of competition for survival and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the advantages of communication would be there.  It will take many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; generations to evolve intelligence, of course.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But there is no reason to think that intelligence will easily evolve in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any competitive environment. Neural networks have been in existence a lot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; longer than intelligence. Some people even argue that the evolution of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence on earth is a pure coincidence. I wouldn't go that far, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the evolution of intelligence clearly depends on a fairly small set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	You know as well as I do that an approximate solution is good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; enough for our purposes and much easier to find.  To be fair, the length
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of both the form you proposed (and which I had earlier rejected), and of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the competitors such as the neural nets in the simple environment,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be estimated.  Maybe a good (and neutral) computer scientist could give
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; those estimates without too much work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	My proposal to find a definition of implementation of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computation is much more conservative than your approach, since it also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; applies to regular theories of physics, and is in the established
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; tradition of computationalism.  I admit it requires more work but I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; think it's hopeless; and if it is, that's just as important to know.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think your approach is an interesting one, and not hopeless (as far as I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can see). But then it's quite difficult to discuss an approach that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is missing the definition for a basic concept.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	Just that it would take a big program.  Of course the neurons must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; also be numbered in some sensible way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ok, you have your estimate, and I have mine. The numbering of course can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be based on spatial position.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	On the contrary.  Some programs will just rewrite the same part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the tape, and those we can neglect for now.  But some will keep printing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; out copies of the same string end on end, and the ones that halt will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; zero measure compared to those, since more copies means more measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This gives a slight advantage to short strings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No I assume that each tape only contributes to the measure of the entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; string on the tape, not to the measures of substrings. (I.e., you can only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be an entire tape, not part of a tape, if you want to think of it that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way) Otherwise the measure will be completely dominated by simple counting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programs that write out 0's and 1's as fast as they can. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	Here is a serious problem for you.  The Turing machines start out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; will all possible programs, that is, with all possible infinite strings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the tapes.  At any finite time, no matter how large [and therefore in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; limit], the fraction of the tape that even the repeat printers have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; covered is equal to zero.  So the printed strings have zero measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; compared to the infinity of random strings on the as yet untouched part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the tape, even though the fraction of those that are conscious is small.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is not the model I have in mind. It doesn't seem sensible to think of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a universe with a continuous infinity of Turing machines. Instead I assume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the universe starts with one Turing machine with a blank (read-only) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; input tape, then before each clock cycle each existing Turing machine is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cloned, with 0 appended to the input tape of one copy, and 1 appended to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the input tape of the other.
