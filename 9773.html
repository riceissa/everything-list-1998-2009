<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Quentin et al,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I keep reading this claim that &quot;only the existence of the algorithm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself is necessary&quot; and I am still mystified as to how it is reasoned for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mere existence of a representation of a process, such as an implementation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in terms of some Platonic Number, is sufficient to give a model of that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be used to derive anything like the world of appearences that we have.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     AFAIK, this claim is that mere existence necessarily entails any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; property, including properties that involve some notion of chance.

<br />
The existence of some (abstract, theoretical, hypothetical)
<br />
thing involves all the properties associated (theoretically)
<br />
with it. The existence of a camel entails the existence
<br />
if a hump. The existence of a unicorn would entail the
<br />
existence of a horn.
<br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humm, are you not using semantic inferences here? The notion of a 
<br />
&quot;camel&quot; entails the notion of a &quot;hump&quot;, as well as the relation between 
<br />
&quot;unicorn&quot; and &quot;horn&quot;, along with all of the other traits/properties that go 
<br />
into the &quot;meaning&quot; of the thing. I liken this to the meaning of words in a 
<br />
dictionary: every word's meaning is given as its relationship with other 
<br />
words, a *word* that has no relation with any other is by definition thus 
<br />
meaningless! (This may relate to the notion of &quot;mutual information...)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to think of this in terms of graph theory, where each word is a 
<br />
vertex and a &quot;definition&quot; (the meaning) is given by the graph of edges that 
<br />
connect any one to some other. Note that there is Dominance but no 
<br />
convexity...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I was not considering the particularities of 
<br />
&quot;properties&quot;, I am trying to drill down a bit deeper into the notion of 
<br />
existence itself. Whether or not a Camel or Unicorn exist does not add 
<br />
anything to its properties other than the obvious: The fact that a graph of 
<br />
relations can be constructed that &quot;identifies&quot; a thing is not necessitated 
<br />
by Existence. Meaning is not the same as existence, or is it...???

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Lee,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I have no qualms with your point here, but it seems that we have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; skipped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; past the question that I am trying to pose: Where does distinguishability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and individuation follow from the mere existence of Platonic Forms, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;process&quot; is merely a &quot;relation&quot; between Forms (as Bruno et al claim)?!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     In my previous post I tried to point out that *existence* is not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first-order (or n-th order) predicate and thus does nothing to distinguish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one Form, Number, Algorithm, or what-have-you from another.
</em><br />

<br />
Things that physically exist , exist in specific spatio-temporal
<br />
locations. the fact that something exists in this place rather
<br />
than that place is indeed a fact over and above the intrinisc
<br />
properties of the thing.
<br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to understand the origin of the idea that &quot;things&quot; have 
<br />
&quot;intrinsic properties&quot;! It seems to me that we are assuming with this idea 
<br />
that the particularity of properties of things has nothing at all to do this 
<br />
any relationships that some given thing/object has with other object/thing! 
<br />
As I try to show with the idea of a dictionary, a word has no meaning if and 
<br />
unless it has some set of relations with other words. The notion of 
<br />
&quot;intrinsic&quot; seems to me to be wholly contradictory of this idea and thus I 
<br />
am frankly baffled as to how it is that this notion has survived without 
<br />
inquiry for so long!
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire discussion of the notion of Numbers as Platonic Forms tacitly 
<br />
includes this notion that I am arguing is deeply flawed unless we explicitly 
<br />
reference to the relationships between Numbers from which flows their 
<br />
particular values. What I am arguing is that the mere *existence* of Object 
<br />
is insufficient to necessitate relationships between those objects. The 
<br />
relations are of a different type. I strongly suspect that this claim is 
<br />
deeply embedded in Bruno's theory but has not yet been explored. For 
<br />
example, all of the references to Gödel's incompleteness point to an 
<br />
infinite hierarchy of types of relations, a hierarchy mirrored in the 
<br />
infinity of different infinities.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Onward!
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Stephen
