<br />I don't know about proof, but personally it's down to an intense dislike
<br />
of random numbers; more to the point, I think there is absolutely no need
<br />
to have any concept of random, just a concept of branching.
<br />
<br />The following example should explain what I mean.  Consider the following
<br />
universe.  In the universe, all that happens is that a fair coin is tossed
<br />
at time 1,2,3,4,.....
<br />
<br />That is, you could imagine this universe being part of our own.  You're
<br />
sitting there watching, say, some wave function collapse performed over
<br />
and over, and each outcome is equally likely.  Practically we can't wait
<br />
forever, but lets not worry about that for now huh?
<br />
<br />Anyway; we can record such a universe a right-infinite sequence of H's and
<br />
T's where H denotes a head and T a tail, or *whatever*.
<br />
eg you might see
<br />
<br />HTTHTHTHHTHTHHTHHTHTHTH...
<br />
or
<br />
TTHTHTTHTHHHTHHHTHTHTTH....
<br />
or even:
<br />
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH....HHHH.....
<br />
<br />We can even say things about such sequences; indeed, we'd never expect to
<br />
see the sequence HHHHH... going on for ever.  Now there's another way of
<br />
imagining this universe, in terms of a multiverse, ie a much bigger
<br />
universe in which any instance of the smaller universes are just 'pieces'
<br />
of the overall structure.  The structure looks like this
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H		T
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H      T        H      T
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;H  T   H  T     H  T    H T
<br />
.
<br />
.
<br />
etc...  Err I can't draw it very well, but basicaly imagine the multiverse
<br />
to consist of a tree; from each node theres a left branch to H and a right
<br />
branch to T.
<br />
<br />Now we think of time in this universe as doing a depth first search in
<br />
this universe;
<br />
ie something like
<br />
0 
<br />
1 (H,T)
<br />
2 (H(H,T),T(H,T))
<br />
3 (H(H(H,T),T(H,T)),T(H(H,T),T(H,T)))
<br />
.
<br />
.
<br />
so asking about probabilities is asking about the relative density of
<br />
sequences in the depth-first search.  eg saying that we'd expect to see
<br />
about as many h's as t's in the long run amounts to noting that most
<br />
sequences of H's and T's have this property; their relative density in the
<br />
depth first search is quite high.  Kinda thing.  The beatiful about this
<br />
way of doing things is that even though the depth-first-search
<br />
'multiverse' is completely deterministic, if you live inside this
<br />
multiverse you only ever see *one* of the branches, which makes it look
<br />
random.  This happens because, since your mind records what's occuring
<br />
during this depth first search, you also end up with a depth first search
<br />
of your mind experiencing ever possibility.  Some consious experiences,
<br />
there for (such as seeing a sequence with about as many H's as T's) are
<br />
more common - more 'probable', whilst seeing nothing but H's is rare to
<br />
say the least.
<br />
<br />Did that make any sense?
<br />
<br />Actually, any sane person who starts tossing coins and finds nothing but
<br />
heads occuring would start to get very worried indeed, and probably stop
<br />
tossing the coin and start praying.  ;)
<br />
<br />Chris Simmons.
<br />
Don't bother, the web page is crap ;)
