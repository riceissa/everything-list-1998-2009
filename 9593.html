Stathis writes
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps it would help if I spoke about my computer rather 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than myself. Clearly, its physical state changes from moment 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to moment: the phosphors on the screen, the position of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hard disk, the electrical activity in the CPU...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changing the CPU or the hard disk or the operating system may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or may not matter, changing the CPU AND the hard disk AND the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operating system probably does matter and I would then say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have a new computer, even if the monitor and some of my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; files are the same. The point is, these criteria are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *necessarily* vague, and it is always possible to come up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with examples that will defeat any attempt to pin down 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is &quot;my computer&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />So yes, then it's not possible to say that it's the same computer
<br />
from nanosecond to nanosecond.
<br />
<br />But then, perhaps we are using language wrong! While we've
<br />
known since Hericlitus in 500 B.C. first pointed it out, that
<br />
you can't step in the same river twice, people do not *mean*
<br />
river in that overly precise sense. They in fact do *mean* the
<br />
broad set of phenomena that flow through the valley over time.
<br />
<br />It is the same with us, or your computer. When someone says
<br />
&quot;you&quot;, they do not mean the instantaneous version. So, 
<br />
since when they say &quot;you&quot; and you say &quot;I&quot;, it's almost
<br />
never meant in such a pedantic and way over-specified way,
<br />
we should talk about what we and they *mean* instead. And!
<br />
Let's also, while we are at it, let the word stand for what
<br />
we mean.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; By what I have said above, I know that the person waking up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in my bed tomorrow is not me, but I behave as if it is me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because this convenient and sanctioned-by-evolution view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is as deeply ingrained as is breathing.
</em><br />
<br />You seem to be after what the word really means. But
<br />
actually, it only means what we use it to refer to. When
<br />
he say &quot;you just got a parking ticket for that, pal&quot;,
<br />
the officer is talking about the Stathis phenomena over
<br />
time and space.  And he *should* be.  It would be just
<br />
terrible if he had to consciously recite what he means
<br />
in detail.  Instead, you actually know what he means
<br />
already.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Moreover, although this working sense of continuity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identity is vague and arbitrary, I have never thus far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been in a real world situation where there is ambiguity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as to whether it is or isn't me.
</em><br />
<br />Right. But except in mathematics, I don't believe it 
<br />
possible to have perfect definitions. Eternal Truth
<br />
Number Two: every statement must be further modified.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When I am copied with one duplicate missing a third of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memories while the other duplicate has all of my memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but in addition has acquired half of your memories and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; George Bush's sense of personal identity, then I will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confused.
</em><br />
<br />Yes  :-)  and so will we all. Cryonics patients who are
<br />
revived one day may be missing lots of memory.  Are then
<br />
then &quot;the same person&quot; is a sensible question! It is not
<br />
arcane like wondering whether they are the same person
<br />
they were last week (of course they are), or whether they
<br />
would be the same person if the phone had just rung.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes, but is it more deeply wired than your conviction 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that you are only in the here and now in a single world,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and that the OMs over time and space and dovetailers is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a stretch?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My conviction that I am a series of transient beings is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intellectual conviction only. The illusion that I am not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not something I can overcome intellectually.
</em><br />
<br />But what is reality?  :-)  Why not let the words &quot;me&quot;, &quot;I&quot;,
<br />
&quot;you&quot;, etc., refer to what we actually use them to refer to
<br />
in daily life?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or, I can put it somewhat differently, amounting to the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing: I know I exist only transiently, but I don't let this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; affect my behaviour, which is determined by the view that am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a single entity persisting through time.
</em><br />
<br />You *know* that you only exist transiently?  Actually, you
<br />
only acquired this 'understanding' after a lot of reading.
<br />
Most people are spared this.  :-)  The &quot;you&quot; that they mean
<br />
and the one that you used to mean (before the protracted
<br />
discussions and thought) *does* exist over time.
<br />
<br />Naturally, there are meaningful discussions still: namely,
<br />
is a Nazi war-criminal who killed a lot of people when
<br />
he was 18 still the same person as the 84 year old whose
<br />
been tending sweet potatoes in his garden ever since?  Am
<br />
I really the same person that I was when I was ten? Clearly,
<br />
these are difficult questions, like the difficult ones that
<br />
you brought up about your memories being distributed among
<br />
George Bush and others.
<br />
<br />So as a rough guide, what about this?  What people ordinarily
<br />
mean---and what we and they should continue to mean---is 
<br />
percent fidelity of memories? That is, if by some measure (?)
<br />
my memories overlap only 50% with who I was when I was a
<br />
teenager, then perhaps that teen would be 50% me. But
<br />
even more difficult questions abound, as I'm sure that
<br />
you well know.
