Ah, but human thinking is a resource-bounded, real-time computational activity.
<br />
Despite the massive parallelism of brain computation, we are of necessity
<br />
&quot;lazy evaluators&quot; of thoughts. If we weren't, we'd all go mad or become
<br />
successful zen practitioners. Sure, we do some free-form associative thought,
<br />
and ponder connections subconsciously in the background, but if there's one thing
<br />
my AI and philosophy studies have taught me, it is that prioritization
<br />
and pruning of reasoning are fundamental keys. There are an infinite
<br />
number of implications and probability updates that could be explored, given our
<br />
present knowledge. But clearly we're only going to do task-directed, motivationally
<br />
directed, sense-data-related subsets of those inferences, and a finite amount 
<br />
of related associative inference in the background to support those. 
<br />
<br />Therefore, if nothing else, we can't imagine what it is like to be a bat
<br />
because we would have to have the reasoning time and resources to explore all of a bat's
<br />
experience to get there. And it would also be difficult and probably impossible, 
<br />
because the bat's mind at birth would be preloaded with different &quot;firmware&quot; instinctive 
<br />
behaviours than ours is. Also, the bat's mind would be connected to a different
<br />
though analogous set of nerves, sense organs, and motor control systems, 
<br />
and to a differently balanced neurochemical emotional (reasoning prioritization) system. 
<br />
<br />Regarding emulating another person's experience. The trouble is, again, that you'd
<br />
have to emulate all of it from (before) birth, because clearly our minds are built 
<br />
up of our individual experiences and responses to our environment, and our own 
<br />
particularly skewed generalizations from those, as much as from anything else.
<br />
And again, you'd have to compensate (emulate) for the subtle but vast differences in the firmware
<br />
of each person's brain as it came out of the womb. It's an impossible project in
<br />
practical terms, even if the brains are Turing equivalent, which they are.
<br />
<br />You don't need to resort to QM to explain the difficulty of emulating other minds.
<br />
It's simply a question of combinatorics and vast complexity and subtlety of firmware, 
<br />
experience and knowledge. 
<br />
<br />Remember on the other hand that human linguistic communication only communicates
<br />
&quot;tips of icebergs&quot; of meaning explicitly in the words, and assumes that the utterer
<br />
and the reader/listener share a vast knowledge, belief and experience base, and
<br />
have similar tendencies toward conjuring up thinking contexts in response to the
<br />
prodding of words. (Words are to mentally stored concepts as URLs are to documents).
<br />
<br />In order to communicate, we do have to emulate (imagine) our target audience's 
<br />
thought patterns and current thinking context and emotional state, so that we can know 
<br />
which sequence of words is likely to direct their thoughts and
<br />
feelings thus and so as we wish to direct them.
<br />
