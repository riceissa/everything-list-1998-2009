<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It seems that there are two ways to increase the measure of copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and near-copies of yourself which have favorable experiences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One is to try to make good decisions.  Some people say that in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;many-worlds model decisions are irrelevant, since everything will happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However this ignores the fact that different branches have different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measures.  Even though we know that all things will happen, by making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;good decisions we increase the fraction which have good outcomes, thereby
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;increasing the measure of those instances of ourselves which are having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;favorable experiences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The other method is by killing yourself when things go wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This approach is more controversial, but many people seem to have an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instinctive understanding of its value.  People often do kill themselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;when things get sufficiently bad.  By doing so they are increasing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fraction of their near-copies which have good experiences.  They are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thinking in those terms, but that is the effect of their actions.
</em><br />

<br />I propose a new game based on the same idea as quantum suicide, but much
<br />
more awarding. It can make you for sure the richest guy in the world. The
<br />
only condition is to find enough players who are convinced by MWI. Each one
<br />
gives say 10000 euros (let's be modern). In fact he can give his whole
<br />
fortune. The total amount of money is gathered in one single pot. Each
<br />
player is assigned a different binary number, and the game can start. Each
<br />
bit is tested at turn by measuring the spin of an unpolarized electron on a
<br />
z-axis. The +1/2 value corresponds to 1, the -1/2 to 0. All players whose
<br />
bit does not correspond to the measured value  are killed. Of course
<br />
following the MWI, each player ends up in the world where his own number
<br />
has been drawn, and he (or she) takes the jackpot for himself. It is
<br />
perfectly fair since all the other players keep on living in another world.
<br />
If you can convince maybe 1 million persons (?), this makes a lot of
<br />
money...
<br />
<br />Some drawbacks:
<br />
<br />1)You are also sure that the (N-1) other  players will have been killed in
<br />
your world. So it's better not to play with friends.
<br />
<br />2)You must accept  the idea that all your relatives and friends will loose
<br />
you in all the worlds where you lost the game (although of course they
<br />
continue to live with you in your world). This could be a good reason not
<br />
to play by compassion with the other worlds...
<br />
<br />3)But it is not worse that the simple suicide! So the game could be played
<br />
with all guys ready to commit suicide (with the hope that in the world
<br />
where there are winning, they are happy enough to keep on living ! Although
<br />
as we say in French &quot;l'argent ne fait pas le bonheur...&quot;).
<br />
&nbsp;A (less moral ? but much more effective ) way to win is to organize the
<br />
game without taking part in it, but sharing the money with the winner. You
<br />
may have to convince a tribunal that the (N-1) killed persons are living
<br />
and happy in some world..
<br />
<br />Ready to play?
<br />
<br /><br />Gilles
