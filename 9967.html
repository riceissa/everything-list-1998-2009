John,
<br />
<br /><br />Le 19-juil.-06, à 18:01, John M a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; George wrote an admirably wise note and you picked positively on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; roadmap with the fruitful mind of a logician.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It looks like you both start out from &quot;not agreeing because of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-understanding math sufficiently&quot; - which may be true, but not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily the &quot;real&quot; root.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think many of us have the wrong information about 'math' in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question. You called &quot;numbers&quot; the series of '1,2,3...many' and &quot;we&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think 'math' is a manipulation of such, even if many substitute and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functional symbols are used.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My question (and I asked it several times here and on diverse other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lists and got no satisfactory answer) - still prevails:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What are (in the new meaning) NUMBERS - how can we handle the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-number concepts by numbers - (whatever they are)? Rephrased: What 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the 'new' meaning of &quot;math&quot; and how can non-math concepts be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; handled by math?
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, OK, but this is a difficult question, John. Let me give you a 
<br />
standard answer, which should be simple, and then add a comp nuance, 
<br />
which is probably a little bit more subtle.
<br />
First I don't think there is new meaning of math. Just new branch of 
<br />
math like mathematical logics, philosophical logics, metamathematics, 
<br />
computer science, etc.
<br />
Since Euler I think mathematician are more and more aware that the 
<br />
numbers are mysterious, and since Godel we have results which somehow 
<br />
explain why numbers are necessarily mysterious. Such limitation results 
<br />
are made *general* (machine or formalism independent) with Church 
<br />
thesis. And then with comp above, those results will bear on the 
<br />
limitation of *humans*: in that sense we can say that we begin to 
<br />
understand why the numbers are mysterious, why we cannot find unifying 
<br />
theory for the numbers, etc.
<br />
<br />Now for the question &quot;How can non-math concept be handled by math?&quot;
<br />
The standard answer goes trough the label &quot;applied mathematics&quot;. You 
<br />
just need to make a correspondence between some term of the theory and 
<br />
some element of the &quot;reality&quot; you want to modelize with the math 
<br />
theory. This is what physicists do all the time, and this what 
<br />
theologians have done during one millenia (before &quot;religion&quot; has been 
<br />
used as a political power (say)(*))
<br />
It just applied mathematics.
<br />
Unfortunately with comp there is a big nuance here.
<br />
Indeed, when you are using some theory (model in the physicist sense) 
<br />
to predict the whether (say), it is clear that the &quot;model&quot; is a 
<br />
thorough simplification of &quot;reality&quot;. In the case of whether 
<br />
prediction, we have no &quot;exact equations&quot;, and worst, the few equation 
<br />
we have are not analytically soluble, so that a computer simulation is 
<br />
in need. Similarly you can *apply* math to simulate neural networks and 
<br />
(perhaps) learn something about the brain.
<br />
OK, but now, when you are willing to say &quot;yes&quot; to a doctor when he 
<br />
proposes to you an artificial digital brain body things are 
<br />
fundamentally different. The artificial brain is no more supposed to 
<br />
*modelize* you brain, like in the whether case, but to save your 
<br />
&quot;soul&quot;.  In this case the &quot;model&quot; is supposed to be the reality. That 
<br />
is obviously quite a jump, but it is made reasonable through the 
<br />
computer scientist distinction between &quot;emulation&quot; and &quot;simulation&quot;. It 
<br />
is known that universal machine can not only simulate many things, but 
<br />
can also emulate exactly all digital processes (thanks to Church 
<br />
thesis). Eventually this can be explained through diagonalization and 
<br />
&quot;semantical fixed points&quot;, but I don't want to be technical here.  So 
<br />
with comp (= mainly &quot;yes doctor&quot;) you apply math to a part of pure 
<br />
math, like in metamathematics or theoretical computer science, which, 
<br />
through comp, describe the living realm we are inhabiting.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />(*) See perhaps the following PDF on &quot;Mathematics and Theology&quot; Note 
<br />
that I disagree with the main conclusion.
<br />
<a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/www_common/hmnj/davis2brieflook1and2.pdf">http://www2.hmc.edu/www_common/hmnj/davis2brieflook1and2.pdf</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Norman touched it, 1Z goes around it, David Bohm even went that far as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to state: numbers (and so math) are human inventions, probably based 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on Plato, who made the biggest (philosophical) argument - as the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; product  of HIS mind.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Bohm is even more coherent with respect to the comp consequence than 
<br />
Chalmers in the sense that he explictly postulate non-comp (in its 
<br />
&quot;intricate order&quot; book).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Words are loaded with different meanings and people tend to use their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; favorite - mostly from the mother tongue.  I admire George's open mind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accepting the diverse positions and I am also no missionary who wants 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to convert people, but even if I think differently, I like to follow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the mental ways of others. It may add usefully to my own thinking.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Note, and this is a key point, I am not defending any position at all. 
<br />
I try not to insist too much because it could look pretentious, but I 
<br />
do think even just the UDA (including the Movie-Graph) does not leave 
<br />
any choice in the matter. In a nutshell I believe the UDA shows that IF 
<br />
comp is taken sufficiently seriously (as to say purposefully yes to a 
<br />
doctor for example) then Plato's conception of reality is correct and 
<br />
Aristotle's one is incorrect.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I propose a 'starting' point to the 'roadmap':
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How may one consider the new version(s) of number and math instead of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the arithmetic-based and binary computer founded conventional 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ignorance? (It is not a 101 course what this list should be above, it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may draw in 'more-sided' opinions into the discussion - which is now 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pretty much on the math - physics base only. Extending to other planes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of 'everything'.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then we may proceed in understanding the 'stuffy' matter (as e.g.. a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; photon - ha ha) and the physicists' concepts mostly based on some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical application, including the most esoteric 'everything' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After all that I may try to speak about my ways how I am not in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; controversy with all that - only regarding it as a partial view of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; totality (which is hard to talk about). Not for converting you or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others, just for proving to myself some (Levy-type) sanity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So how should I include the validity of a legal opinion into the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here I am not sure I follow you. When I talk about (natural) numbers I 
<br />
am really talking about those (non definable) entities that every 
<br />
schoolchild learn about through table of addition, multiplication, etc. 
<br />
They are the same as Euclid's one in the sense that all what Euclid 
<br />
proved about them is still valid today.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How should I 'comp'(?) the feeling of love?
</em><br />
<br /><br />In principle there will no be problem for that, although I still cannot 
<br />
explain this without explaining more about the G-G* gap. Later perhaps. 
<br />
Note that such a question is more difficult for a physicalist who 
<br />
believes only in atoms or strings (or quantum gravity loops ...) 
<br />
because they don't have (yet) the equivalent of the G-G* gap (akin to 
<br />
the explanation gap of the philosopher of mind). Try to explain why you 
<br />
like potatoes using only terms from string theory, for example.
<br />
But comp provides an explanation why anything describable in a 
<br />
seemingly third person way, will automatically be extended into a math 
<br />
structure divided in two parts: a 3-communicable part (deriving from 
<br />
G), and a non-3-communicable part (deriving from the corona G* minus 
<br />
G).
<br />
I recall that G is a mathematical theory describing completely the 
<br />
(skeleton) of what a correct machine can prove about itself, and G* 
<br />
describes the (skeleton) of all the truth---including the non provable 
<br />
one---concerning what a machine can (and cannot) prove about itself.
<br />
<br />For those who have read a bit on the difference between programmable 
<br />
function Fi and the total computable function fi could perhaps already 
<br />
smell the mathematical justification of that &quot;explanatory&quot; gap.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How should I 'materialize' (physically?) the beauty of a sunset?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (all without flattening those qualia into a quantitative plane)?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is exactly here that it is hard for me non going technical because I 
<br />
find it is worth. Indeed it can be proved that when a universal machine 
<br />
M1 introspects herself, she will discover both sharable (provable) 
<br />
quantitative truth and non sharable qualitative (non quantitative, nor 
<br />
even 3-describable) truth. Actually any much stronger (in term of its 
<br />
set of beliefs) universal machine, M2 say, will be able to show that 
<br />
those non quantitative truth are really disguised form of quantitative 
<br />
truth, but M2 can understand why, from the many points of view of M1 
<br />
itself (including both the 1 and 3 povs), although quantitative, those 
<br />
truth cannot *appear* to be quantitative. M1 can grasp those personal 
<br />
truth only in a qualitative way. This will explain qualia, but also why 
<br />
in some sense a universal machine cannot know she is a machine, nor 
<br />
even any 3-entity.
<br />
<br />Later I will come back on the &quot;arithmetical notion of persons&quot; we 
<br />
encounter through the self-reference theories (G and G*) in computer 
<br />
science. I call them &quot;hypostases&quot; so that people who read Plotinus can 
<br />
see how close we are, with comp, to Plato, and even to Plotinus' 
<br />
critics of Aristotle &quot;misunderstanding&quot; of Plato.
<br />
<br />But that is probably on the last point of the roadmap, so I stop, 
<br />
momentarily here. If I have already been too technical just tell me or 
<br />
ask questions. Hope this helps a bit,
<br />
<br />Bruno
