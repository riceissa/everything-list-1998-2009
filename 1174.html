<em class="quotelev1">&gt;finding a theory that answers anything. If you imagine a thought experiment

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;capable of simulating the quantum state of a brain (which requires indeed a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;huge computer!), you can as well imagine an experiment testing quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;gravity and interfaced with a brain - and no known theory could compute the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;result. You MAY postulate that this computation exists, and that it is of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discrete nature, but this is a postulate.
</em><br />
<br />Exactly.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I know that you present comp as a working hypothesis- I just insist that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comp is indeed the very strong hypothesis that there is a computable TOE.
</em><br />
<br />This is a misleading way to tell it. Remember that there are no computable
<br />
theory of the 'computerland'. Machine's fate, viewed from the 1-person but
<br />
also from the 3-person point of view, is 'the' non computable. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But there is another problem. Indeed I should have added a word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to my (GH) definition:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;For me digital systems are systems whose some OBSERVABLE characteristics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;(description and evolution of their &quot;state&quot;) are EXACTLY equivalent to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; TM.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Recalling that the quantum state of a single particle is not observable ( a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fact that seems to have been neglected by some computer scientists...) ,
</em><br />
<br />Remember that the 1-person point of view (of a machine) is also
<br />
not 'observable'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;...unlike for example the magnetic moment of a computer memory cell, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;maintain that there is an objective distinction between digital systems and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;analogical ones, and that the brain is not obviously digital : 
</em><br />
<br />Sure. That is an important point. The brain is not obviously digital.
<br />
One of the reason I am insisting on the 'crazy' consequence of comp
<br />
(like the disparition of substance) is to help people to realize that, 
<br />
indeed, comp is a highly non trivial hypothesis. It implies a total
<br />
reversal of the common 'naturalistic' and materialistic view of the 
<br />
world.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;the clearest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difference between an analogical system and its digitized computation is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the relevant information (quantum state) is fundamentally hidden in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the first case, but is known in the second one. This is as fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physically as Church thesis for computability!
</em><br />
<br />Be careful, I suspect you suppose some interpretation of QM. Remember that
<br />
comp entails that any machines looking at itself below its level of 
<br />
substitution, will be force to infer the existence of unobservable 
<br />
'quantum' information. (I call it here 'the comp-quantum-principle' 
<br />
for reference below).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I see no reason why this fundamental physical difference would not have any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;influence on the existence of consciousness. 
</em><br />
<br />It has ! Provably with comp.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact all proposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;simulated brains&quot;, Chinese room, Mauldlin experiment and so on imply the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;use of classical systems whose state IS measurable - i.e. are digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;following the definition I propose. 
</em><br />
<br />The PE-omega (UD argument) does NOT depend on it. The thought experiment
<br />
are more easy with it, but clearly, even if my 'brain-state' is an 
<br />
unobservable and non measurable state, the UD will duplicate it for ever,
<br />
and that is the point I need for my proof.
<br />
In fact QM is 'very' computable, even linear ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may be why (as we tend to think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intuitively) they can't be able to think.
</em><br />
<br />About 'thinking' intuition is particularly delusional. 
<br />
For Descartes animal have *obviously* no consciousness,
<br />
for Spanish conquistadors Indian have no souls,
<br />
Unless you explain PRECISELY in what sense 'quantum gravity' 
<br />
(a-la-Penrose)
<br />
put light on the consciousness problem, I will think that it is
<br />
just the older trick of hidding an unsolved problem in an
<br />
ununderstandable heavy speculation.
<br />
At least comp + the theetetic definition of knowledge and 
<br />
observation gives 'refutable' light on the 'intuitionnistic
<br />
subject, the qualia, the quantum, etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Only the duplication of quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state would then be able to duplicate a consciousness....
</em><br />
<br />This is quite compatible with comp, and probably even a 
<br />
consequence of comp. See the 'comp-quantum-principle' above.
<br />
<br />To use the phenomenological quantum weirdness as a argument against 
<br />
comp will not work with me because I take the QUANTUM as the most
<br />
convincing (a posteriori, I confess) confirmation of the DIGITAL ultimate
<br />
nature of reality.
<br />
Of course a confirmation is not a proof, and computerland would
<br />
be a sad country if all machines are betting comp :-)
