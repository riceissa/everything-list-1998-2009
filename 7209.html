<br /><br />Many good answers has been given. And my comment will overlap some of 
<br />
them.
<br />
<br />The most physicalist one is to referindeed  to Tegmark's paper where he 
<br />
justifies by Everett/decoherence that the evidence is that our brain, 
<br />
when seen as an information handling computing machine, acts as a 
<br />
classical machine. But comp makes physicalism wrong, and Tegmark's 
<br />
answer cannot be &quot;fundamentally&quot; genuine.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of quantum decoherence in brain processes
<br />
M Tegmark 2000, quant-ph/9907009,  Phys. Rev. E 61, 4194-4206
<br />

<br />
M Tegmark 2000,  Information Sciences 128, 155-179
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Then, concerning the comp 1-person indeterminacy, even if my 
<br />
computational state is a quantum states, the Universal Dovetailer 
<br />
Argument (UDA) is still going through. This is a consequence of the 
<br />
fact that quantum computation does not violate Church's thesis. That 
<br />
entails that you can simulate a quantum computer with a classical 
<br />
computer. Sure, there is a relative exponential slow-down of the 
<br />
computation, but this is not relevant because the universal dovetailer 
<br />
is naturally slow down by its heavy dovetailing behavior, and then the 
<br />
first person cannot be aware of that slow down.
<br />
<br />And then I recall I gave an exercise: show that with comp the 
<br />
no-cloning theorem can easily be justified a priori from comp. As I 
<br />
said this follows easily from the Universal dovetailer Argument. The 
<br />
argument shows that physical observable reality (relatively to what you 
<br />
decide to measure here and now) emerges as an average on all 
<br />
computations (generated by the UD) going through your actual state. 
<br />
Suppose now that you decide to observe yourself with at a finer and 
<br />
finer level of description. At some moment you will begin to observe 
<br />
yourself at a level below you substitution level (which I recall is the 
<br />
level where you survive through copy). Below that level comp predict 
<br />
you will be confronted with the 1-comp indeterminacy, that is you will 
<br />
&quot;see&quot; the many computation/histories. Now that is strictly speaking an 
<br />
infinite set , and there is no reason at all, a priori, that this set 
<br />
is a computational object, so there is no reason at all you could 
<br />
duplicate exactly.
<br />
<br />Here you can appreciate the difference between Schmidhuber's comp and 
<br />
&quot;my&quot; comp. In Schmidhuber's comp the &quot;physical&quot; universe is a 
<br />
computational object and there is no 1-indeterminacy, and non-cloning 
<br />
is rather mysterious. &quot;My&quot; comp is the more humble bet that &quot;I&quot; am a 
<br />
computational object. With &quot;my&quot; comp, I (first person) bet on the 
<br />
existence of a level of substitution for some 3 description of my body  
<br />
(that is a first person says &quot;yes&quot; to its doctor when the doctor 
<br />
proposes a substitution of his body by *some* digital machine). Then, 
<br />
what the UDA shows is that the universe, whatever it is, cannot be a 
<br />
computational object, and no piece of &quot;real (observable)&quot; matter can be 
<br />
cloned, a priori.
<br />
<br />Logically, it is still logically possible that the theoretical computer 
<br />
science constraints makes this reasoning invalid, but this would be a 
<br />
consequence of a sort of an arithmetical conspiracy. (Given that the 
<br />
logic of observable proposition *is* already proved to be highly NOT 
<br />
boolean and even quantum-like, but ok here I am in the arithmetical 
<br />
translation of the UDA: note that I am introducing the combinators to 
<br />
just been able to interview the Lobian machine on the non-cloning 
<br />
question, and also on the complete reversibility of the laws of 
<br />
physics).
<br />
<br />The easy (not quite rigorous) proof of the non-cloning theorem from 
<br />
comp shows that the QM non cloning can be seen (retrospectively, sure) 
<br />
as a confirmation of comp. Here is another exercise (a little bit less 
<br />
easy): show that the fact we can test experimentally and share with 
<br />
each other such non-cloning behavior would confirm, not only comp, but 
<br />
would vindicate the differentiation between the 1-person point of view, 
<br />
and the 1-person plural point of view (I just mention it in my post to 
<br />
Jonathan): for a computationalist the observability of non cloning is 
<br />
an evidence against solipsism!  (well the observability of QM 
<br />
indeterminacy also, and is perhaps more easy to use). It is also an 
<br />
evidence that we share the level of substitution.
