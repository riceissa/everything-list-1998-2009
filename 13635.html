<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RS: I don't think I ever really found myself in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disagreement with you. Rather, what is happening is symptomatic of us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to reach across the divide of JP Snow's two cultures. You are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obviously comfortable with the world of literary criticism, and your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; style of writing reflects this. The trouble is that to someone brought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up on a diet of scientific and technical writing, the literary paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may as well be written in ancient greek. Gibberish doesn't mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rubbish or nonsense, just unintelligible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DN: It's interesting that you should perceive it in this way: I hadn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought about it like this, but I suspect you're not wrong.  I haven't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consumed very much of your 'diet', and I have indeed read quite a lot of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stuff in the style you refer to, although I often find it rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indigestible!  But on the other hand, much of my professional experience has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been in the world of computer programming, right back to machine code days,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so I'm very aware of the difference between 'syntax' and 'semantics', and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know too well how consequences can diverge wildly from a difference of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single bit.  How often have I heard the beleaguered self-tester wail &quot;I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; didn't *mean* that!&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Interesting indeed. I wouldn't have guessed you to have been a
<br />
programmer. Perhaps you are one of those rare souls with a foot in
<br />
each camp. That could be be very productive!
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, in the spirit of the original topic of the thread, I would prefer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to ask you directly about the plausibility (which, unless I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misunderstood, you support?) of an AI-program being in principle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'conscious'.  I take this to entail that instantiating such a program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thereby implements an 'observer' that can respond to and share a reality, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; broadly the same terms, with human 'observers'.  (I apologise in advance if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any paraphrase or short-hand I adopt misrepresents what you say in TON):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />It seems plausible, certainly.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; TON, as you comment in the book, takes the 'idealist' stance that 'concrete'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notions emerge from observation.  Our own relative status as observers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; participating in 'worlds' is then dependent on computational 'emergence'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the plenitude of all possible bit-strings.  Let's say that I'm such an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer and I observe a 'computer' like the one I'm using now.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'computer' is a 3-person 'concrete emergent' in my 1-person world, and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the 'plurality' of observers with whom I'm in relation: we can 'interact'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with it. Now, we collectively *impute* that some aspect of its 3-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour (e.g. EM phenomena in its internal circuitry) is to be regarded as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'running an AI program' (i.e. ISTM that this is what happens when we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'compile and run' a program).  In what way does such imputation entail the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evocation - despite the myriad possible 'concrete' instantiations that might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; represent it - of a *stable* observer capable of participating in our shared
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; '1-person plural' context?  IOW, I'm concerned that two different categories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are being conflated here: the 'world' at the 'observer level' that includes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me and the computer, and the 'world' of the program, which is 'nested'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inside this.  How can this 'nested' world get any purchase on 'observables'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that are 'external' to it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />It is no different to a conscious being instantiated in a new-born
<br />
baby (or 18 month old, or whenever babies actually become
<br />
conscious). In some Platonic sense, all possible observers are already
<br />
out there, but by physically instantiating it in our world, we are in
<br />
effect opening up a communication channel between ourselves and the
<br />
new consciousness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I re-read this question, I wonder whether I've already willy-nilly fallen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into the '2-cultures' gap again.  But what I've asked seems to be directly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related to the issues raised by 'Olympia and Klara', and by the substitution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level dilemma posed by 'yes doctor'.  Could you show me where - or if - I go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong, or does the 'language game' make our views forever mutually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unintelligible?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<br />This last post is perfectly lucid to me. I hope I've answered it
<br />
adequately.
<br />
<br />Cheers
