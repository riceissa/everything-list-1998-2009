&nbsp;&nbsp;Not meet them so much in my experience. Positive Religious (like

Muslim, Catholic, ...) have build-in solution. It is most of the time 
<br />
tabu to question them. Negative Religious (like Atheist) have build-in

solution, but are generally not aware of the religiosity of their

solutions. Only (serious) philosopher of mind/cognitive scientists are 
<br />
aware of the problem.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I would leave the &quot;soul&quot; out of my statements. The soul-body problem

<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well OK. I guess you make the difference between solipsism and 
<br />
idealism which can be realist or platonist. The mind stuff is just 
<br />
numbers and their dreams ...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;What do numbers dream about? And do the name sheep to go to sleep?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; You do however
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; invoke a favorite classical physicalist hypothesis in the form of &gt; 
</em><br />
YD and than you &quot;turn the tables&quot; on it, so to speak, no?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;YD has nothing with classical physicalism, unless you assume 
<br />
physicalism at the start. YD does not assume a universe physically 
<br />
exist, only that &quot;I&quot; exists and that I am supported by a relatively 
<br />
stable (sheaf) of computations. Actually the use of the YD in the UD 
<br />
reasoning is accompanied by an explicit postulation of a physical 
<br />
universe for making the reasoning easier, but that hypothesis is 
<br />
explicitly eliminated toward the end of the reasoning.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that most of your statements mention assumptions that 
<br />
you accept as starting points only to show that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;they are not needed in the end! If you assume that the I is &quot;only 
<br />
supported by a stable sheaf of computations&quot; aren't
<br />
&nbsp;you already assuming what you mean to prove?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I think that the YD motivation is the weakest link in your chain &gt; 
</em><br />
(a real Trojan horse because it is physically untenable)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I really don't understand. To make YD false you must associate 
<br />
yourself to something non-turing emulable. Nobody has ever found a non, 
<br />
turing emulable process. Recall that quantum-like indeterminacy can be 
<br />
retrieved in the self-discourse of self-duplicating machine. Also, with 
<br />
some notable exception like Penrose, everybody accept YD. I teach about 
<br />
it since more than 30 years, and only strict dualists (with assumes 
<br />
explicit substancial soul) criticize it. I told you that those who get 
<br />
my point (of the UD Argument) and still soes not accept the conclusion 
<br />
prefer to abandon Arithmetical Realism. It is an empirical discovery in 
<br />
the sense that (I think we agree here), it is almost nonsense for me to 
<br />
abandon arithmetical realism.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is patently false and even more so in your much loved platonic 
<br />
realm which is quite infested with non-digitally computable
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;entities. Turing was careful to provide an example called the Halting 
<br />
problem and he also proved that most real numbers are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;incomputable but there are many others problems that have been proved 
<br />
Turing un-computable over the years and mathematicians keep finding 
<br />
such instances (tilling problems are one big source of examples). 
<br />
Furthermore people that work in neural network Learning Theory have 
<br />
began to show that there are by-example methods for leaning 
<br />
uncomputable problems which I think are very relevant to this question.
<br />
&nbsp;Read for example:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;<a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/lathrop96learnability.html">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/lathrop96learnability.html</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In physics it is a bit more dificult to argue the uncomputability of 
<br />
natural processes whose phenomenology one has not studied
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;fully but there are surely instances of uncomputable within physical 
<br />
theories that we already know. A classical paper on these
<br />
&nbsp;issues in cosmology is by Hartle and Geroch. You will find it at:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
www.cs.columbia.edu/~library/TR-repository/reports/reports-1997/cucs-012-
<br />
97.ps.gz
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a recent book on the subject (which I have not seen) by 
<br />
Barry Cooper and Piergiorgio Onifreddi.
<br />
&nbsp;You can read a review of it at
<br />
<br />&nbsp;<a href="http://fgc.math.ist.utl.pt/in.pdf">http://fgc.math.ist.utl.pt/in.pdf</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;About QM the problem is not simulating indeterminancy but simulating 
<br />
quantum correlations by local mecanistic means which
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is how Turing machines compute! Failed attempts to produce such 
<br />
emulations by Wolfram are what makes his book well...
<br />
&nbsp;ridiculous!!!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;About AR I think you also have a misconception of it: AR is the 
<br />
believe that numbers exist, not the ONLY number exist!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be more like pythagorianism, I believe. In any case I am 
<br />
not suggesting you abandon it...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; to so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; if you use just to demolish it later, why use it at all?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the eleventh time you confuse &quot;p -&gt; q&quot; with &quot;q -&gt; p&quot;. Unless 
<br />
(here) you mean by &quot;demolish YD&quot;, the non use of YD in the translation 
<br />
of UDA in arithmetic.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;So, you don't demolish it, you just abandon it. OK.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Why not proceed to that interview directly?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can. But this is like going from physics to the study of 
<br />
differential equation. Here it would consist to go from cognitive 
<br />
science to pure mathematics. Actually if you justify that probability 
<br />
*must* obey to the Bp -&gt; Dp rule (probability one of p entails the 
<br />
probability of ~p is not one), then OK, you can extract the 
<br />
comp-physics from math alone. But how will you explain the Bp -&gt; Dp 
<br />
rule in that context? Why suppress a motivation which also makes the 
<br />
link with theology: the fact that the comp-doctor cannot pretend that 
<br />
&quot;science&quot; has show that you can survive with an artificial brain (in 
<br />
case comp is true).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, but I don't follow here! You get physics but you loose 
<br />
theology!!! Why do you need the theology?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Can that be done and leave your argument intact? That would make it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a lot more interesting in my opinion...
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;You are in minority here, but this is just because most people agree 
<br />
with YD (or at least it makes sense as an hypothesis in the cognitive 
<br />
science).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Bruno
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;Ditto.
