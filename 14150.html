<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wei, your examples are convincing, although other decision models have

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar problems. If your two examples were the only problems that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDASSA had, I would have few qualms about adopting it over the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision models I've seen. Note that even if you adopt a decision
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model, you still in practice (as a human being) can keep an all-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purpose &quot;escape hatch&quot; where you can go against your formal model if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are edge cases where you dislike its results.
</em><br />
<br />For me, this line of thought started with the question &quot;what does 
<br />
probability mean if everything exists?&quot; (Actually, before that I had thought 
<br />
about &quot;what does probability mean if brain copying is possible?&quot;) I've 
<br />
entertained many different possible answers. I looked at decision theories 
<br />
not because I'm looking for a decision procedure to adopt, but because that 
<br />
is one way probability is interpreted and justified. I'm actually more 
<br />
interested in the philosophical issues rather than the practical ones.
<br />
<br />Besides, if you program a decision procedure into an AI, it had better be 
<br />
flawless because there may be no &quot;escape hatches&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words, I would prioritize &quot;UDASSA doesn't yet make many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; falsifiable predictions&quot; and &quot;We don't see a total ordering of points
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in spacetime, so UDASSA probably doesn't run on a typical Turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Machine&quot; as larger problems. But sure, if UDASSA can be improved to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solve the morality edge-cases that you gave, I'm all for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; improvements.
</em><br />
<br />I consider UD+ASSA to be a theory of how people reason, or how they ought to 
<br />
reason, and as such, it does make falsifiable predictions. In fact, as I 
<br />
showed in several examples, the predictions have been falsified.
<br />
<br />About your comment &quot;We don't see a total ordering of points in spacetime, so 
<br />
UDASSA probably doesn't run on a typical Turing Machine&quot;. I don't follow 
<br />
your reasoning here as to why UD+ASSA+typical TM implies that we should see 
<br />
a total ordering of points in spacetime. Isn't it possible that such an 
<br />
ordering exists internal to the TM's program, but it's not visible to the 
<br />
people inside the universe that the TM simulates?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As far as our observations of the Universe, I don't quite follow: how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can you go from &quot;in terms of morality, probability is imperfect&quot; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;there's no such thing as probability, therefore there's no measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem?&quot;
</em><br />
<br />My reasoning goes like this:
<br />
<br />1. We need to reinterpret probability, from &quot;subjective degree of belief&quot; to 
<br />
&quot;how much do I care about something&quot; in order to fix counterintuitive 
<br />
implications of decision theory.
<br />
2. Once we do that, we no longer seem to have a solution to the &quot;measure 
<br />
problem&quot;.
<br />
3. Let's look closer at the nature of the problem. It seems to consist of 
<br />
two parts:
<br />
(A) Why am I living in an apparently lawful universe?
<br />
(B) Why should I expect the future to continue to be lawful?
<br />
4. I think (B) is the easier question, and I answered it in a previous post 
<br />
in this thread. (A) is more problematic, but my tentative answer is that, as 
<br />
Brent Meeker stated it, &quot;among all possible worlds, somebody has to live in 
<br />
law-like ones; so it might as well be us.&quot;
<br />
<br />I'm out of time today, and will respond to your other post tomorrow.
