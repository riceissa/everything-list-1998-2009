<br />
<br />xxxx_
<br />
<br /><br />xxxxx proposes a radical, new space for artistic exploration, with
<br />
essential contributions from a diverse range of artists, theorists,
<br />
and scientists. Combining intense background material, code listings,
<br />
screenshots, new translation, [the] xxxxx [reader] functions as both
<br />
guide and manifesto for a thought movement which is radically opposed
<br />
to entropic contemporary economies.
<br />
<br />xxxxx traces a clear line across eccentric and wide ranging texts
<br />
under the rubric of life coding which can well be contrasted with the
<br />
death drive of cynical economy with roots in rationalism and
<br />
enlightenment thought. Such philosophy, world as machine, informs its
<br />
own deadly flipside embedded within language and technology. xxxxx
<br />
totally unpicks this Hiroshimic engraving, offering a dandyish
<br />
alternative by way of the deep examination of software and substance.
<br />
<br />Life coding is primarily active, subsuming deprecated psychogeography
<br />
in favour of acute wonderland technology, wary of any assumed
<br />
transparency. Texts such as Endonomadology, a transcript from
<br />
celebrated biochemist and chaos theory pioneer Otto E. Roessler who
<br />
features heavily throughout this intense volume, make plain the
<br />
sadistic nature and active legacy of rationalist thought. At the same
<br />
time, through the science of endophysics, a physics from the inside
<br />
rigorously examined here, a delicate theory of the world as interface
<br />
is proposed.
<br />
<br />xxxxx is very much concerned with the joyful elaboration of a new
<br />
real; software-led propositions which are active and constructive in
<br />
eviscerating contemporary culture. xxxxx embeds Perl Routines to
<br />
Manipulate London, by way of software artist and Mongrel Graham
<br />
Harwood, a Universal Dovetailer in the Lisp programming language from
<br />
AI researcher Bruno Marchal rewriting the universe as code, and self
<br />
explanatory Pornographic Coding from plagiarist and author Stewart
<br />
Home and code art guru Florian Cramer. Software is treated as magical,
<br />
electromystical, contrasting with the tedious GUI desktop applications
<br />
and user-led drudgery expressed within a vast ghost-authored
<br />
literature which merely serves to repeat over and again the demands of
<br />
industry and economy. Key texts, which well explain the magic and
<br />
sheer art of programming for the absolute beginner are published here.
<br />
<br />Software subjugation is made plain within the very title of media
<br />
theorist Friedrich Kittler's essay Protected Mode, published in this
<br />
volume. Media, technology and destruction are further elaborated
<br />
across the work in texts such as War.pl, Media and Drugs in Pynchon's
<br />
Second World War, again from Kittler, and Simon Ford's elegant take on
<br />
J.G Ballard's crashed cars exhibition of 1970, A Psychopathic Hymn.
<br />
<br />Software and its expansion stand in obvious relation to
<br />
language. Attacking transparency means examining the prison cell or
<br />
virus of language; life coding as William S. Burrough's style cutup or
<br />
riot playback (Stewart Home). And perhaps the most substantial and
<br />
thorough-going examination is put forward by daring Vienna actionist
<br />
Oswald Wiener in his Notes on the Concept of the Bio-adapter which has
<br />
been thankfully unearthed here. Equally, Olga Goriunova's extensive
<br />
examination of a new Russian literary trend, the online male
<br />
literature of udaff.com provides both a reexamination of culture and
<br />
language, and an example of the diversity of xxxxx; a diversity well
<br />
reflected in background texts ranging across subjects such as Leibniz'
<br />
monadology, the ur-crash of supreme flaneur Thomas de Quincey and
<br />
several rewritings of the forensic model of Jack the Ripper thanks to
<br />
Stewart Home and Martin Howse.
<br />
<br />xxxxx liberates software from the machinic, and questions the
<br />
transparency of language, proposing a new world view, a sheer
<br />
electromysticism which is well explained with reference to the works
<br />
of Thomas Pynchon in Friedrich Kittler's essay, translated for the
<br />
first time into English, which closes xxxxx.
