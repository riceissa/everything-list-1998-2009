<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Thank you for this post. It gives me a chance to reintroduce one

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem that I have with your model. Like you, I am very interested in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comments from others, as it could very well be that I am misunderstanding

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some subtle detail of your thesis.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     You wrote:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;... remembering the comp 1-indeterminacy, that is that if you are duplicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;into an exemplary at Sidney and another at Pekin, your actual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;expectation is indeterminate and can be captured by some measure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;let us say P = 1/2,  and this (capital point) independently of the time

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chosen for any of each reconstitution (at Pekin or Sidney), giving that the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;delays of reconstitution cannot be perceived (recorded by the first person)).&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Now my problem is that IF there is any aspect of perception and/or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;observers&quot; that involves a quantum mechanical state there will be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need to take the &quot;no-cloning&quot; theorem into account. For example, we find 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the following paper a discussion of this theorem and its consequences 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for teleportation:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&lt;<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012121">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012121</a>&gt;<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012121">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012121</a>
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />This is a question people ask me often. But not only the cloning theorem is 
<br />
not a problem with the comp hyp, but actually it is highly plausible the 
<br />
non-cloning theorem is a direct consequence of comp. Remember that, with 
<br />
comp, physicalities emerges from an average of an infinity of 
<br />
computationnal histories: it is a priori hard to imagine how we could clone 
<br />
that. This is no more amazing than the fact the white rabbit. remember that 
<br />
with comp, from inside things look a priori not computable. The apparant 
<br />
computability of the laws of physics is what is in need to be explain with 
<br />
comp. We should perhaps come back when you have accept all the steps in uda 
<br />
step by step.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     As a possible way to exploit a potential loop hole in this, I point 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you to the following:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&lt;<a href="http://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/buzek/mypapers/96pra1844.pdf">http://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/buzek/mypapers/96pra1844.pdf</a>&gt;<a href="http://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/buzek/mypapers/96pra1844.pdf">http://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/buzek/mypapers/96pra1844.pdf</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     My main question boils down to this: Does Comp 1-determinacy require 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this duplication to be exact? Is it sufficient that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;approximately similar copies could be generated and not exact duplicates?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />It must be exact if the duplication is done exactly at the right level of 
<br />
substitution (which exits by hypothesis), and can be approximate if some 
<br />
lower level of duplication is chosen instead.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     How would this affect your ideas about measures, if at all?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I understand that you are trying to derive QM from Comp and thus 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might not see the applicability of my question, but as a reply to this I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will again point your to the various papers that have been written 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; showing that it is impossible to embed or describe completely a QM system 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and its logics)  using only a classical system (and its logics), if that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; QM system has more that two Hilbert space dimensions associated. Start 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the Kochen-Specker theorem...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<br /><br /><br /><br />I'm afraid you make a confusion of level here. What KS showed is that you 
<br />
cannot put a boolean algebra of values to quantum observable pertaining to 
<br />
some systems. But this is exactly what comp predict for matter and time 
<br />
notion. That is why we get quantum logics for the first person verifiable 
<br />
proposition. Nowhere I pretend to recover a classical logic in which 
<br />
quantum measurement value can be embedded, quite the contrary with comp 
<br />
classical logic is plainly false for all verifiable 1-notion right at the 
<br />
beginning. BTW, even if KS was a threat, your argument does not follow 
<br />
because KS is a theorem in quantum mechanics, and as you say, I just show 
<br />
that the physics is derivable from comp; if KS is false in the physics 
<br />
derived from comp then KS would indeed be a problem, but I insist it is 
<br />
not. It is only the apparent computability of the universe which still 
<br />
remains the miracle.
<br />
<br />My feeling Stephen is just that you don't like comp, and I have no problem 
<br />
with that. Some people takes my work to be a beginning of refutation of 
<br />
comp, and perhaps they are right. I want just illustrate that this is not 
<br />
obvious, and the tiny part of physics I have
<br />
extracted from comp is for me just very weird (and no more so I estimate we 
<br />
are still far from a real reductio ad absurde of comp).
<br />
The weirdness is the many world like feature of any comp reality, the non 
<br />
computability of the physical processes in any reality compatible with 
<br />
comp, and a sort of quantum logic weaker than usual quantum logic. Is that 
<br />
so weird? Certainly no more weird than quantum weirdness.
<br />
<br />If you are really interested in my reasoning, I would dare to insist going 
<br />
from step to step. If you prefer not studying the consequences of comp 
<br />
because you don't have the taste for it, I will not insist at all. My point 
<br />
is just that comp (that is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) there is level of description of me such that I cannot be 
<br />
aware of functional digital substitution made at that level.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Church thesis
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Arithmetical Realism)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;makes the physical science eventually secondary with respect to number 
<br />
theory/computer science/machine psychology/theology
<br />
whatever we decide to call that fundamental field ...
