<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course they describe things - they aren't the things themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the question is whether the description is complete.  Is there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything about EM fields that is not described by QED?
</em><br />
<br />Absolutely HEAPS! Everything that they are made of and how the components
<br />
inteact to make something that naturally appears to us to look QEDish.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you can find it you'll be famous by morning.
</em><br />
<br />Can you throw moiney instead? Much more useful!
<br />
-------------------- seriously....
<br />
<br />Consider your statement:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is there anything about EM fields that is not described by QED?
</em><br />
<br />No. And there's nothing more about quantum mechanical behaviour that us
<br />
not described by quantum mechanics. There is nothing more about
<br />
gravitational motion  that is not described by the laws of gravitation and
<br />
so on and so on. It's not that they are incomplete. They are irrelevant!
<br />
It's that none of them depict underlying causality - only 'apparent
<br />
causality' when viewed with our phenomenal consciousness. They were
<br />
created grounded in our phenomenal fields.
<br />
<br />The killer assumption is that the descriptions of appearances that are our
<br />
empirical laws contain all that is needed to describe our 'appearance
<br />
generator' (which includes pain).
<br />
<br />Consider that our entire way of viewing the universe was through
<br />
oil-paintings. Everything we know has been concocted through correlating
<br />
the contents of oil paintings. Cows. Sunsets. Trees. :-) There is
<br />
absolutely nothing in any 'law of correlated oil painting contents' that
<br />
would predict the existence of oil paintings or the nature of paint. One
<br />
day you decide to go look at what is producing the oil paintings...via an
<br />
oil painting, of course....what do you see? An oil painting of a painter.
<br />
You still know nothing about paint. But by god you know what the painter
<br />
looks like, so you have a clue - a place to start.
<br />
<br />The problem is that you need to have a completely separate set of
<br />
desriptions of a universe made of candidate 'something' that is capable of
<br />
making perceivers to whom the universe appears like it does and therefore
<br />
appears to be run by all the empirical laws we have.
<br />
<br />The descriptions of an underlying reality will look nothing like our
<br />
current empirical laws. I would predict that the only exploration of the
<br />
detail of such a system is computationally using cellular automata and
<br />
some simple basic relationships between instances of candidate
<br />
'something'.
<br />
<br />This is dual aspect science. Note that all it does is move the mystery
<br />
back a bit!
<br />
<br />Say I am successful. I have 'assumed something' which behaves QMly, QEDly,
<br />
ATOMly and QUALIAly....in a CA-noumenon of interacting 'assumed
<br />
something'.... at the end of the day I still have a mystery of a similar
<br />
kind... what is the &quot;assumed something&quot; made of? It may be we never know
<br />
that, but at least we have a better grip on the natural world that is
<br />
_sane_! Currently we either think the universe is literally made of
<br />
appearances (nuts) or that there is a 'natural laws computer' running our
<br />
empirical laws underneath run by whom? Aliens? (even more nuts).
<br />
<br />Personally I'd rather have a CA-noumenon/Empirical law science that is
<br />
compatible with all empirical laws and that moves the mystery to a well
<br />
defined place for others to work on...than these rather odd assumptions.
<br />
<br />So it's not that laws of science are wrong or inadequate or &quot;complete&quot;, as
<br />
you say above - it's that they are completely irrelevant in the context of
<br />
a description of the universe inclusive of a perceiver of it, in it, made
<br />
of it.
