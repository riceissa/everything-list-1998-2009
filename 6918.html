Lee Corbin writes (quoting Stathis):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I believe that tomorrow I will become one of the people in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multiverse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; who believe they are me and share my memories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What if you have just taken Midazolam, and so won't remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any of this tomorrow? (I contend that you'll be them anyway.)
</em><br />
<br />[Good stuff, midazolam. If the patient shows evidence of the Helpful Hand 
<br />
Syndrome in the middle of an operation, the anaesthetist yells, &quot;Quick, the 
<br />
midazolam!&quot; It has saved many an anaesthetist from the medicolegal 
<br />
consequences of underdoing the gas.]
<br />
<br />That's a matter of definition. What if tomorrow all my memories are replaced 
<br />
with different memories, perhaps those of a made up person? This is the main 
<br />
reason for using the OM concept: there is then no ambiguity. An analogy 
<br />
could be made with buildings and bricks, which all come sequentially 
<br />
numbered from the same brick factory. Suppose the building suffers damage 
<br />
from an earthquake, and is rebuilt to the same plans (almost) such that 80% 
<br />
of the bricks have been replaced. Is it the same building or a different 
<br />
one? Philosophers could scratch their heads and write papers in the learned 
<br />
journals for years to come debating this. The builder, on the other hand, 
<br />
can simply say, &quot;Whether you call it the same building or not is a matter of 
<br />
taste; I can tell you that the new building has brick no. 231451 in position 
<br />
no. 8761 where the old building had brick no. 50231, brick no. 45987 remains 
<br />
unchanged at position 2349...&quot;, and so on for every brick.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; When I think about this, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hope that my future selves will have good experiences, and I fear that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; might have bad experiences. Once tomorrow comes, I no longer care about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; other versions, because they aren't me even though they think they are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We have agreed that some of your innate animalistic instincts aren't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;necessarily *correct*. That is, even though you may continue to feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a certain way, it can also happen that you succumb to some reason and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logic that force you to believe otherwise. IN this case, your choices
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of whom to identify with should be consistent, and the easiest way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(I think) to make them so is to identify with all duplicates close
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and far, future and past, modulated only by similarity of structure.
</em><br />
<br />We are getting to the heart of the disagreement here. There is *no* correct 
<br />
answer! You could probably come up with a definition to cover all 
<br />
eventualities, but even if it actually did this consistently (which I think 
<br />
would be very, very difficult), in the final analysis, it would have to be 
<br />
an arbitrary one. For example, you could say that the building is the same 
<br />
if 50% of the bricks are the original ones, and no more than 5% of the 
<br />
bricks have shifted more than 10% from their original position. But what if 
<br />
I came along and said that was obviously absurd, and the numbers should be 
<br />
10%, 1% and 2% respectively?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Looking back, also, I believe that I was only one of the possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;versions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in the multiverse, and I no longer care about bad experiences that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; might have had in the same way that I care about bad experiences I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at present or one of the versions of me might have in the future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We normally take all this for granted, but if you think about it, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; quite arbitrary. Why should I believe I will &quot;become&quot; another person who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; thinks he is me? Why should I identify with multiple versions of me in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; future, but not the present or the past? Why should I worry about what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; happen to my future self but not my past self? The answer is, because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is the way human minds have evolved. But that is the only reason.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, exactly!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It would be no logical contradiction to imagine a person whose mind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;functioned very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; differently; for example, a person who had no fear of the future because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; considered the idea absurd that he could &quot;become&quot; someone with different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; spacetime coordinates to his present ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, I take as more inescapable the assertion that I am the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person I was yesterday, and will be the same person tomorrow. Further,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics seems to grab me by the throat and FORCE me to accept that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my duplicate across the room and I don't differ significantly.
</em><br />
<br />Do you mean duplicate as in identical twin?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is the failure to take into account this rather complex scheme we use 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; create individuals that leads to mistakes in the application of OM 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for example in criticising the QTI.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Could you expand on that?  Part of my weakness has to do with QTI.
</em><br />
<br />Briefly, you can't pull OM's at random out of the plenitude to construct 
<br />
individuals, because that isn't how it happens in real life. See my 
<br />
discussions with Saibal Mitra on this topic, eg. the thread &quot;objections to 
<br />
QTI&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; To be precise let's say that tomorrow you will split into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the ten copies, one of which will be tortured. Then one *year* from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; now merging is scheduled to occur. Therefore you behave differently?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think you should.  (You may *have* to because that's how we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; are built, but you still shouldn't.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Given this information before the split occurs, it makes it more likely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I will experience torture: the 1/10 chance initially, then the certainty 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; merging in a year - although the merging may result in memory of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;torture
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rather than the first hand experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But still up for grabs is how widely the concept *I* should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;taken. I've extended it so that even the duplicate across the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;room is you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I have to disagree with you here. Why should I care about the suffering 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; some guy in another universe who thinks he is me, and whom I can never 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meet?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I would be more concerned about the suffering of strangers in third 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; countries in my own universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course, if you can't affect it, that's a reason for non-concern.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But if you could, then, I contend, one intervenes to prevent one's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;duplicate from suffering for entirely *selfish* reasons.
</em><br />
<br />How do I stop my duplicate from suffering in another universe? It makes a 
<br />
*big* difference if you are talking about the past, present or future. I 
<br />
will do everything I can to prevent my duplicate in the future fom 
<br />
suffering, because I may actually *become* that duplicate (I won't really, 
<br />
but I can't get rid of this feeling). But come the future, I don't really 
<br />
care what happens to my duplicates, because I can only be one person at once 
<br />
(that isn't really consistent, but I can't shake that feeling either).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I got here this way: to be consistent, I must use all my knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to arrive at a class of events and processes that I approve of, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;classes that I disapprove of.  I decided that it was bad for me to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suffer.  Then since by physics, I seem to be any sufficiently similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical process, it is bad for any of them to suffer.  (That one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;me ends up being prejudiced as regards his own special skin seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be an unfortunate legacy of evolution, but one that doesn't support
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;much consistency.)
</em><br />
<br />You're looking for sense and consistency where there isn't any. My moment of 
<br />
enlightenment was when I realised the whole thing is a crazy mess. But I can 
<br />
no more ignore the effects of the crazy mess on my psychological processes 
<br />
than I can command my body to grow an extra head.
