<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I haven't read Joyce's book, but it sounds similar to Judea Pearl's 
<br />
excellent &quot;Causality&quot; book, which I have read much of. Pearl's focus is 
<br />
on Bayesian-type models of contributing factors, with some interesting 
<br />
excursions into Kripke's &quot;possible worlds&quot; (in the &quot;counterfactual&quot; 
<br />
sense of talking about things that did not actually happen, but which 
<br />
might or could happen...of obvious interest in AI. linguistics, etc.). 
<br />
Pearl, by the way, the UCLA professor who is the father of the murdered 
<br />
journalist Danny Pearl (in Pakistan).
<br />
<br />On the subject of &quot;being inside a universe,&quot; there are some exciting 
<br />
papers by Fotini Markopoulou and others on a &quot;category theory&quot; (more 
<br />
precisely, &quot;topos theory&quot;) outlook on this. One of her papers is &quot;The 
<br />
internal description of a causal set; What the universe looks like from 
<br />
the inside,&quot; 1999. Available at the xxx.lanl.gov arXiv site as paper 
<br />
gr-qc/9811053. (Henceforth, to cut down on giving URLs or arXiv numbers, 
<br />
I'll stick to giving author names and either exact paper names or at 
<br />
least enough keywords to allow recovery via Google (which is better than 
<br />
giving transient URLs in many case) or from persistent archive sites 
<br />
like arXiv.
<br />
<br />I'm not ready, yet, to write up my &quot;first posting to the everything 
<br />
list&quot; about category and topos theory, which are my current main 
<br />
interests. Well, I guess this obviously _is_ going to be my first post, 
<br />
by way of Markopoulou's paper dovetailing so directly with Wei Dai's 
<br />
&quot;being inside a universe&quot; point. So I'll at least say what category 
<br />
theory is about. (The book I recommend is Lawvere and Schanuel's 
<br />
&quot;Conceptual Mathematics: A first introduction to categories.&quot;)
<br />
<br />In a nutshell, too small a nutshell to really educate you if you don't 
<br />
already know about it, categories are collections of objects and arrows 
<br />
going from one to another. For example, in the category of SET, the 
<br />
objects are elements of sets and the arrows (also called morphisms) are 
<br />
the functions mapping one element into another element of another set. 
<br />
In other words, all that &quot;function box&quot; and &quot;bijection&quot; and &quot;injection&quot; 
<br />
stuff of New Math. However, the use of categories unifies a lot of 
<br />
mathematics and the field has expanded dramatically since Eilenberg and 
<br />
Mac Lane developed the ideas for use in algebraic topology. The idea is 
<br />
that theorems developed in category-theoretic language in one domain can 
<br />
be &quot;carried over&quot; (with those arrows, between categories, and even 
<br />
between other sets of arrows, in ascending levels of abstraction). And 
<br />
in the 1960s the work of Grothendieck and Lawvere led to a category 
<br />
imbued with certain &quot;notions of truth.&quot; This was dubbed a &quot;topos.&quot; 
<br />
What's fascinating is that a topos is a kind of &quot;micro universe.' Not in 
<br />
a physical sense, a la Egan or Tegmark, but in the sense of generating a 
<br />
consistent reality. More on this later.
<br />
<br />A popular treatment of the &quot;what it means to be inside a universe&quot; point 
<br />
of view is in the cosmologist Lee Smolin's book, &quot;Three Roads to Quantum 
<br />
Gravity,&quot; less than a couple of years old. Smolin collaborates with 
<br />
Markopoulou, Chris Isham, C. Rovelli, and others, and he's associated 
<br />
with the &quot;loop gravity&quot; and &quot;spin foam&quot; schools of quantum gravity/TOE. 
<br />
By the way, Greg Egan is doing some work with some of these folks, 
<br />
including John Baez.
<br />
<br />(The John Baez site (he's the younger cousin of Joan) is a wonderful 
<br />
resource for pointers. His papers are relentlessly clear. Find it with 
<br />
Google. Or, here it is: <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/README.html">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/README.html</a>)
<br />
<br />The Isham and Markopoulou work is oriented toward replacing what I'll 
<br />
call &quot;the manifold with a Boolean algebra&quot; with a more general view 
<br />
which I'll call &quot;a lattice with a Heyting algebra.&quot; The smooth spacetime 
<br />
of conventional relativity goes away, perhaps, at Planck-scale distances 
<br />
and energies (10^-33 cm, or near/inside event horizons, perhaps). 
<br />
Perhaps more strangely, the conventional Boolean algebra and logic get 
<br />
superceded by time-varying sets where the law of the excluded middle (A 
<br />
or not-A, not-not-A is A) is replaced by a richer logical system: 
<br />
Heyting algebra and logic. I'll get into this stuff more in future posts.
<br />
<br />In particular, Isham has a topos perspective on &quot;consistent histories&quot; 
<br />
(MWI) which is quite interesting. A streaming video lecture on &quot;Quantum 
<br />
theory and reality&quot; is available at 
<br />
<a href="http://www.newton.cam.ac.uk/webseminars/hartle60/1-isham/">http://www.newton.cam.ac.uk/webseminars/hartle60/1-isham/</a>
<br />
<br />This is not easy going, but watching it a couple of times may get across 
<br />
some of the ideas. And he and his main collaborator, Butterfield, have 
<br />
written several papers.
<br />
<br />My last comment will be that I am not really a Tegmarkian. Frankly, I 
<br />
thought Greg Egan treated the same ideas better than Tegmark did. In 
<br />
&quot;Distress&quot; we find the &quot;all topologies model,&quot; yet another overloading 
<br />
of the acronym ATM. (AOL, acronym overload.) &quot;Distress&quot; was published in 
<br />
hardback in June 1997. Tegmark's TOE preprint appears in April 1997. So 
<br />
roughly simultaneous publication. Anyway, Tegmark is a professional 
<br />
physicist, and has done much good work on conventional cosmology, so I'm 
<br />
not dissing him. More on this later.
