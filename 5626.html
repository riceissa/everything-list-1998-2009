OK. That is very large. You know there are borderline. Bohr
<br />
has dismiss the EPR paper as metaphysics, and he did that
<br />
by imposing its own metaphysics, etc.
<br />
And of course such a definition is a &quot;user-description&quot;, it is not
<br />
an attempt to define it for a deeper epistemological study.
<br />
What *is* science, is also a object of inquiry.

<br /><br /><br />CMR:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I find its not uncommon for those who may chafe at the &quot;inconvenient&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constraints of &quot;science&quot; as defined above to be somewhat dismissive of its

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;special utility in generating knowledge about our world(s). The creationists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;often leverage this tactic, for instance. Just as often the label science is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;co-opted by occultists to lend credibility to otherwise incredible claims
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;They'd all like to cast it as just another world view intrinsically no more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;valuable than any other. But it's not.. It's not because science as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;methodology ignores that which is by necessity matters of faith, be it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;religion, mysticism, metaphysics (or Platonism?).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />BM:
<br />
Absolutely. Science as a methodology ignores that which is by necessity
<br />
matters of faith. But how many scientist are aware that the existence of
<br />
a *physical* universe is a matter of faith?
<br />
Many scientist quickly consider (like Bohr) question which they cannot solve
<br />
or formulate in the language of their field as metaphysical, but in general
<br />
the frontier between science and metaphysics are either methodological or
<br />
metaphysical, or historical.
<br />
Also, why do you put platonism along with faith. The level of clarity and 
<br />
seriousness
<br />
of a text like the &quot;Thaetetus&quot; is rarely met these days. And Plato has less
<br />
ontological commitment than Aristotle, and many scientists today keep
<br />
some Aristotelian act of faith without ever mentionning it, apparently they are
<br />
not aware of their act of faith. *This* is unscientific attitude, no?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />CMR:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is science sometimes (often?) malpracticed by agenda driven egos? Certainly,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but that doesn't diminish the utility or validity of science well executed.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
Surely John  and me were a little ambiguous in our discussion on science.
<br />
I thought we were discussing what science *is*, not the shape of actual human
<br />
science. That's why I say science is merely the product of inquiry, 
<br />
humility, and
<br />
curisosity. In front of unsolved hard problem, it is also the ability to 
<br />
recognize
<br />
our prejudice, and to keep an open mind.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />CMR:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Any and all philosophers, mystics and mathemiticians can and are welcome
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to minimize, reject and even appropriate science as they will. And so it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;should be in a free society. But  if and when they claim their faith-based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;musings are scientific or as good as same, then they are charlatans in deed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as well as name, IMHO.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
I agree 100% (if you add physicists, biologists, ...  in your list).
<br />
The pity, today, is that most scientist are specialized, and their keep their
<br />
scientific attitude only in their discipline, and lack it completely
<br />
once they talk about anything outside (except perhaps on soccer).
<br />
In particular a lot of naturalist (materialist, physicalist), like 
<br />
Changeux, are
<br />
just totally UNscientific when they pretend that all honest scientist should
<br />
be naturalist, or materialist, ...
<br />
The same for the platonist. Platonism is unscientifical only when it is 
<br />
presented as
<br />
being the only way science should be.
<br />
But naturalism or platonism per se are quite respectable views or departure
<br />
point. Now the UDA shows that the first is logically incompatible with the
<br />
computationalist hyp., the other is not. Have you see this?
<br />
<br />Also, you said that your are not platonist. Could you tell me how you 
<br />
understand
<br />
the proposition that the number seventeen is prime. (I want just be sure I 
<br />
understand
<br />
your own philosophical hypothesis).
