</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that is probably true about the Church Thesis, which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would paraphrase as saying that there are no physical processes more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationally powerful than a Turing machine, or in other words that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe could in principle be simulated on a TM.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here I disagree completely. Church Thesis (CT) has nothing to do with  
<br />
physical processes. Note that this is a point where I think David  
<br />
Deutsch is confused with his new version he called Church Turing  
<br />
principle, and which I call &quot;Deutsch's Thesis&quot;, and which is  
<br />
completely independent of Church Thesis. Church's thesis is just the  
<br />
thesis that all computable function are captured by LISP (or &lt;add  
<br />
your favorite universal computer language&gt;. It identifies an  
<br />
intuitive notion of computability with a formal one.
<br />
<br />Now if comp is true, that is: if I am a turing-emulable (LISP- 
<br />
emulable, ALGOL-emulable, etc.) THEN the universe is not Turing  
<br />
emulable a priori. We can come back on this.
<br />
Note that Nielsen's  e^i*omega*t can be considered as a non turing  
<br />
emulable physical process which is physically possible.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wouldn't be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surprised if most people who believe that minds can be simulated on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; TMs also believe that everything can be simulated on a TM.
</em><br />
<br />They are wrong. If minds are turing-emulable then indeed minds cannot  
<br />
perceive something as being provably non-turing-emulable, but minds  
<br />
can prove that 99,999...% of comp-Platonia is not turing-emulable.  
<br />
And the UDA shows that physics emerge from that comp-Platonia  
<br />
(arithmetical truth).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I don't see the two philosophical questions as absolutely linked,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I could imagine someone who accepts that minds can be simulated on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; TMs,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but who believes that naked singularities or some other exotic  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenon might allow for super-Turing computation.)
</em><br />
<br />Absolutely. And the UD generates complex things which from the first  
<br />
point of view of machine will be non-turing emulable.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But isn't AR the notion that abstract mathematical and computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects exist, to the extent that the mere potential existence of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation means that we have to consider the possibility that we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presently experiencing and living within that computation?  I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think that is nearly as widely believed.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are right. But this is exactly the point which follows from the  
<br />
Movie-Graph-Argument (or Maudlin's Olympia).
<br />
It is highly not obvious at all!!!
<br />
It is not AR. AR is so obvious that people (who are not professional  
<br />
logician) take time to understand it needs to be assumed. But AR is  
<br />
just the belief that the arithmetical truth is independent of us.  
<br />
Would an asteroid hit Earth and destroy all life on it, would not  
<br />
change the fact that 17 is a prime number, or that Goldbach  
<br />
conjecture is true or false.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That simple mathematical objects have a sort of existence is probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unobjectionable,
</em><br />
<br />That's AR.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but most people probably don't give it too much thought.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For most, it's a question analogous to whether a falling tree makes a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; noise when there's no one there to hear it.  Whether the number 3  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before people thought about it is an abstract philosophical question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without much importance or connection to reality, in most people's  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minds,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; including computationalists and AI researchers.
</em><br />
<br />Because most ignore the difference between first and third, singular  
<br />
and plural, point of views.
<br />
Mathematically they confused p, Bp, Bp &amp; p, Bp &amp; Dp, etc. But Godel's  
<br />
B provide counterexamples.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To then elevate this question of arithmetical realism to the point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where it has actual implications for our own perceptions and our  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of reality would, I think, be a new idea for most computationalists.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. But they ignore UDA. They ignore the first person indeterminacy.  
<br />
They are bounded by they Aristotelian idea that computationalism and  
<br />
mechanism are allied to materialism, naturalism, physicalism. My work  
<br />
shows comp is incompatible with materialism, naturalism, physicalism.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Right here on this list I believe we've had people who would accept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the basic doctrines of computationalism, who would believe that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible for a human mind to be &quot;uploaded&quot; into a computer, but who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would insist that the computer must be physical!
</em><br />
<br /><br />I will come back on this when I will comment your post where you  
<br />
point us to Maudlin's paper.
<br />
I could also ask you what you mean by &quot;physical&quot; and then what are  
<br />
you assuming precisely. I do not assume anything physical.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A mere potential or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstractly existing computer would not be good enough.  I suspect that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such views would not be particularly rare among computationalists.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are right, but they are wrong. I can have an intuition with UDA +  
<br />
AUDA + OCCAM. But the proof is given by UDA + Movie-graph.
<br />
UDA does use a physicalist base (a concrete running of a concrete  
<br />
UD), and the Movie-Graph does eliminates that assumption.
<br />
Somehow the movie-graph shows that not only a machine cannot  
<br />
distinguish a physical reality from a virtual reality, but a machine  
<br />
cannot distinguish a physical reality from an arithmetical reality.
