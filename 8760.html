<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; My belief is that in matters of faith, you can choose to believe or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not believe based on whether it suits your personal preferences.  Your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; example of the Nazis  would not apply because there is overwhelming 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; evidence that the Nazis existed.  Perhaps it can be argued that there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is meaningful evidence that the God described in Sunday school class 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exists as well, however I don't think anyone would argue that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; evidence for that God is nearly as strong as evidence of the Nazis.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As you say, religion, by necessity, is based on faith and therefore 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; little to no objective evidence.  I guess your point was that if you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; already have the faith in something without evidence, the fact that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you are then taught as part of the belief system that there are some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; aspects not very appealing should not have any bearing on whether you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; still have your faith?  I would disagree with that in that you can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have faith in something because the concept is attractive to you, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; then lose your faith when the concept is shown to be less attractive. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (this was not really my situation as a child- I was never really 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; presented the opportunity to examine the faith until presented with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the teachings described in the original post).  This is not entirely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; unrelated to the sciences.  Science has pushed into many areas into 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; realms that can only tangentially, at best, be proven with objective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; evidence.  The MWI is a good example.  I believe in it, because I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; think it provides the most explanatory power over competing ideas. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; However, it would be difficult to fault someone for demanding more in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the way of direct evidence.  In a sense, there is an element of faith 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in such theories.  String theory is another example.  I'm not saying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; these things are not science, just that they are theories beyond our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reach to prove or disprove at the present time.  Many scientists are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; quoted as endorsing string theory in part due to the elegance of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theory.  This goes with what I was saying above about accepting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something on faith as long as it appears to be the most attractive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; idea, even if it is not supported by much objective evidence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I doubt the beliefs of fundementalist Christianity will ever be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; absolutely proven or disproven, and as a faith belief I reserve the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; right to discard it at my choosing!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you are referring to that aspect of belief which has little to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do with whether or not the belief is in accordance with reality. This is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very common in everyday life, but it is also probably common in science 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or other supposedly objective fields of enquiry. One could even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speculate that having &quot;faith&quot; in a scientific theory in its nascent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phase - that is, believing it to be true with greater certainty than the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; available evidence warrants - is important in motivating the theorist to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do the experimental work which will ultimately validate the theory to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the satisfaction of the rest of the scientific community. This is fine, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as long as we are clear that there is a distinction between the utility 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a belief and the truth value of that belief. An interesting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; illustration of this distinction in philosophy of religion is &quot;Pascal's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wager&quot;. Pascal aknowledged that it is not possible to decide with any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainty whether God exists, but continued to ask the question, should 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we believe that God exists? If we believe that he does and it turns out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we are right, we gain eternal life in Heaven, while if it turns out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are wrong, we gain or lose nothing as a result of our false belief. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand, if we declare ourselves atheists and are right, we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gain or lose nothing, but if we are wrong, we end up in Hell. Therefore, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are better off believing that God does exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem with almost all people with fundamentalist-type religious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convictions that I have met, however, is that they are not as honest as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Pascal was. They claim that their belief is certainly or almost 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly correct, and that it is based on empirical evidence, such as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the historical record contained in the Bible. Pressed further, they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might describe &quot;faith&quot; as a kind of religious experience which allows no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more doubt about the existence of God than ordinary sensory experience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allows doubt about the existence of the world - &quot;and if you had this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience, you would understand&quot;. If I suggest to them that they only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe because they were brought up that way, or because they want it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be true (and I think these two reasons account for the vast majority 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of people with religious belief in the world), they deny this vehemently.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Returning to the point in my original post, I should have clarified it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by saying that when it comes to the *truth* value of a belief, our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attitude towards that belief is irrelevant. If some far future historian 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; studying the legend of the Nazis in the 20th century decides that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; legend is true simply because it would further his career if it were 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true, he would deserve the contempt of his peers. If the evidence does 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not allow a conclusion one way or the other, the correct answer is that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the evidence does not allow a conclusion one way or the other; it is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a license to choose whatever conclusion takes your fancy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Incidently, can you see the logical flaw in Pascal's Wager as described 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above?]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<br />I largely agree with Stathis.  I note a subtle difference in language between 
<br />
Danny and Stathis.  Danny refers to &quot;believe in&quot;.  I don't think a scientist 
<br />
ever &quot;believes in&quot; a theory.  That implies taking the theory as the foundation 
<br />
of all further beliefs.  In fact most scientists don't &quot;believe&quot; any theory, 
<br />
except in the provisional sense of thinking them likely, or worth entertaining, 
<br />
or suggestive.  Religious faith differs from ordinary belief and scientific 
<br />
hypothesizing not only by the lack of evidence but even more in the assertion of 
<br />
certainity.
