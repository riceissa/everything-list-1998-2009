Bruno: 'To be honest I always fear a bit those who want to help me or 
<br />
others,
<br />
but thanks anyway for the good intentions (which pave the way to hell 
<br />
... :) '
<br />
<br />MP: yes, I can relate to that. Be reassured then that as I understand it 
<br />
[AIUI], helping you and others is very much in my own interest. I must 
<br />
feel that my life has meaning. Without this, getting up in the morning 
<br />
would become a terrible effort never mind going to work in the 
<br />
oxymoronic, Sisyphus-world of bureaucracy. Amongst other things this 
<br />
entails belief that the things I do contribute to the well being and 
<br />
survival prospects of those I love and also to the benefit of those upon 
<br />
whom my children and their children will depend in the future. As I like 
<br />
to say: the human universe is always potentially infinite, so long as it 
<br />
exists and we believe it to be so. However I have not met anyone who can 
<br />
reassure me that the human species has anything much more than a 50% 
<br />
chance of surviving beyond the next 200 years.
<br />
<br />I can see how all the pieces necessary to create sustainable and 
<br />
enduring social and cultural networks and systems already exist; the 
<br />
technology has already been invented, the theory has all been written 
<br />
down. What is not clear to me however is how to ensure that everybody 
<br />
with the need [effectively everybody on the planet] can access the 
<br />
information they need to make fully informed decisions about the crucial 
<br />
issues which affect us. I am pretty much convinced that the answer/s 
<br />
involves person to person dialogue rather than propaganda and oratory, 
<br />
and the empowerment of individuals to undertake human sized projects 
<br />
rather than the regimenting of industrial clone armies in massive 
<br />
organisations. AIUI the practice of sceptical inquiry is fundamental to 
<br />
getting things right. In this vein, we all need to help each other to 
<br />
see on the one hand the formidable danger which affects absolutely ALL 
<br />
of us, and on the other hand to see the utterly amazing potential for 
<br />
creatively solving all the practical problems that confront us. Such is 
<br />
the nature of the modern world as it is transformed again and again by 
<br />
the fruits of the application of scientific method.
<br />
<br />Bruno: 'Then I can explain you with all details why the proposition &quot;we 
<br />
will all 1-die&quot; is provably &quot;put in doubt&quot; once we assume either just 
<br />
comp or even just quantum mechanics. With QM this is not wishful 
<br />
thinking but &quot;terrorful&quot; thinking: a priori the QM immortality is not 
<br />
fun: each time we die clinically (in a relative third person way), from 
<br />
our personal point of view we survive in the closer normal comp. 
<br />
history. A case can been made that this entails a sort of eternal agony. 
<br />
Of course this can be nuanced too. With comp some weird gap seems to 
<br />
exist ... '
<br />
<br />MP: I do not understand this. I am surprised to notice, however, a faint 
<br />
resemblance to something I read once concerning the teachings of George 
<br />
Gurdjieff, an ethnic Armenian who became a teacher of 'esoteric 
<br />
religion' and some very deep insights into how humans function, in the 
<br />
early 20 Century. He died in 1952 in France. Gurdjieff was asked what 
<br />
was the truth about reincarnation, and the reply was along the lines of: 
<br />
talk of souls transmigrating from body to body over millennia was 
<br />
misleading, it is more like that if a person could not see what they 
<br />
were really doing, and what they are, then they [we] are condemned to 
<br />
live and relive that same life - until we realise what is happening [I 
<br />
suppose, or some such ... ].
<br />
Well once upon a time I was very enthusiastic about George Gurdjieff's 
<br />
teachings but now I think just that his psychological insights and 
<br />
practical methods were good but too much of his metaphysics, for want of 
<br />
a better word, is pre-scientific in origin.
<br />
<br />Bruno: 'Have you an opinion on QM interpretation?'
<br />
<br />MP: Well, from my particular style of ignorance, I take it that QM is a 
<br />
descriptive system that allows predictions and explanations to be made 
<br />
about how things do or will occur at the smallest scales of measurement 
<br />
that scientists can currently observe. I take with a grain of salt all 
<br />
statements that the noumenal world, or even parts of it, cannot exist 
<br />
without an observer. That world - 'The Great It' - I like to call it, 
<br />
exists whether we know about it or not. We participate and make things 
<br />
happen, but usually without being very aware of it. Our awareness is 
<br />
what it is like to be the updating of the brain's model of self in the 
<br />
world, and this model is a cryptic, or encrypted, analogue system. It is 
<br />
complex and subtle but classical as opposed to Quantum in nature, in 
<br />
that the dynamic logical entities which mental objects and so forth are 
<br />
aggregate effects of literally millions of neuron interactions. I take 
<br />
it that harmonic resonance and all manner of standing wave effects are 
<br />
essential to the spatia-temporal structure of perceptions and other 
<br />
mental objects. So, AIUI, clearly the world described by QM is very 
<br />
weird from our classical and naive experience view point, but it is so 
<br />
whether we know about it or not. The world we are normally aware of, or 
<br />
our experience of it if you like, is our brain's analogue description of 
<br />
the emergent properties of space-time, energy and matter at our bodies' 
<br />
order of magnitude.
<br />
<br />Bruno: 'Worst, I do believe this assumption is contrary to both 
<br />
logic+arithmetic (and comp) and with the empirical data'
<br />
<br />MP: What data?
<br />
<br />MP: Existence entails being somewhere and IMO, except possibly for the 
<br />
smallest conceivable distances of Planck length, whatever it is that IS 
<br />
somewhere ENDURES while other things change around it. I have written 
<br />
before about my Process Physics inspired conception of connections 
<br />
[called Janus] being ultimately all that is and that particles of matter 
<br />
and energy are knot-like, self-entangled concentrations of the every 
<br />
collapsing plenitude of simplifying connections. It just seems to me to 
<br />
be logically necessary that existence and location are prerequisites for 
<br />
anything else. Perhaps that should be existence, location and 
<br />
separation. But anyway, words fail and something like the Chinese Yin 
<br />
and Yang conception actually makes a lot of sense [thinks: the 
<br />
interpenetration and eternal separation of two branes might be just that!]
<br />
<br />Numbers are written and imagined as existing in their own right
