<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One of the initial gripes I had with the turing approach to the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a finite resolution lattice and finite resolution calculations. And I

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find it very hard to believe that we will ever actually detect an

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'absolute' lattice. And it's even harder to believe that we will ever

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notice that nature uses a finite number of decimals. This issue has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussed before and some of you found that a turing machine won't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properly handle true 'reals'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The answer is, of course, that the number of computations in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schmidhuber plenitude using an insanely high number of decimals is a lot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; higher than the ones that use a specific measurable but life-permitting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precision. The measure of a computation using 10^10^10 decimals is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; roughly the same as one using 10^10^10^10 decimals. And the computations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves will most likely remain virtually identical throughout the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history of the universe and the observer-moments will be identical. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same goes for grid spacing (and grid extent, for that matter). Therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moments in a universe using precision indistinguishable from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'reals' and a lattice indistinguishable from a continuum seem to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; favoured.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure that the number of high-decimal calculations will inherently
<br />
be much greater than the number of low-decimal calculations.  Here is
<br />
my reasoning.
<br />
<br />Your overall idea seems correct, that you could imagine a universe
<br />
simulator which is performing a real-number calculation to finite
<br />
precision.  This is of course what our computers do all the time.  And
<br />
further, the size of the program is not very sensitive to the precision
<br />
of the real numbers.  Crudely, a Fortran program using single precision
<br />
reals is about the same size as the same program using double precision.
<br />
<br />In the case of a TM emulating a real-number based universe, the precision
<br />
it uses could be thought of as a parameter to the program, something which
<br />
is entered once and is then used throughout the program as a sort of loop
<br />
counter to tell how far to extend each calculation.  Since this value is
<br />
only entered once, its size is only counted once, and it so it does not
<br />
contribute very much to the overall size of the program.
<br />
<br />However there is of course a limit to the size of the parameter, since
<br />
the overall program itself has a finite size.  We can't take a great
<br />
deal more space to specify the precision parameter than the size of the
<br />
program itself, without reducing the measure significantly.
<br />
<br />Now, the question is, given this much space to specify the bits of precision
<br />
for the calculation, what will be the probability distribution of the
<br />
actual precision values?  Suppose we say that the precision is specified
<br />
by a program which will calculate and write the actual precision value,
<br />
in unary, onto a specific region of the TM tape.  This value will then be
<br />
referred to in all of the real-number calculations to determine how much
<br />
precision to use.
<br />
<br />So, looking at all programs of a certain size which produce well-formed
<br />
numeric precision outputs, what is the probability distribution of the
<br />
output values?  I think Niclas' point comes down to the question of
<br />
whether the majority of these values will be very large (in some sense).
<br />
<br />Certainly there are programs which will produce very large values.
<br />
As Niklas writes, something like 10^10^10^10^...^10 is astronomically
<br />
large but specified by a very short string.  We could imagine this
<br />
number being produced by having the precision-specifying region consist
<br />
of a short arithmetic interpreter which can handle numbers and operators
<br />
(like *, +, ^), and produce the numeric output given this input string.
<br />
<br />However such programs will be in the minority; most programs will not
<br />
produce well formed output, and of those that do, few will be busy-beaver
<br />
programs that produce vastly huge output, as I understand it.  I don't
<br />
have a strong understanding of these issues, but my sense is that a
<br />
program chosen randomly from the set that produce well-formed output
<br />
will probably not produce a very large number.  There will be a great
<br />
many programs that just flail around and produce a number like 1, or
<br />
2, as the output.  Some will go forever and never stop (and hence not
<br />
produce well formed output).  Only a few will be the clever ones that
<br />
can unfold some tight internal representation into a super-large number
<br />
like Niklas' examples.
<br />
<br />On this basis I would claim that the number of universe simulators that
<br />
calculate real numbers to small or moderate precision would be greater
<br />
than the number that calculate real numbers to very high precision.
<br />
Hence I would think that a Schmidhuber ensemble theory would predict that
<br />
our universe has only as much precision as it needs for life to evolve.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From what I understand, this does not seem to match very well with what
</em><br />
we observe, but our theories are still incomplete and it may turn out
<br />
that they can be expressed in some form consistent with this prediction.
