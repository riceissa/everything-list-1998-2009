<br />Wei, you have been asking about a decision theory for a long time.  
<br />
<br />It seems to me that if utility function is defined as your own
<br />
probability (or possibly measure) of existence then all decision process
<br />
becomes based on conditional probability given your own existence. Your
<br />
decision theory is just based on conditional probabilities. Most of the
<br />
time you assume that the probability of the continuation of your own
<br />
existence is one. In these cases the conditional probability approach
<br />
reverts to plain probability. 
<br />
<br />Thus if you consider your own measure only, the probability that (you
<br />
continue living AND that (you shoot yourself if you don't win the
<br />
lottery) given that (you continue living) is one... and leading a life
<br />
of leisure and quantum suicide are justified; working overtime is not. 
<br />
<br />On the other hand, if you consider the measure of, and utility to your
<br />
family, the probability that (their measure and utility is not
<br />
decreased) AND that (you shoot yourself if you don't win the lottery) is
<br />
definitely smaller than one... and you should buy a life insurance and
<br />
work overtime to make the payments. Leading a life of leisure is not
<br />
justified. So depending on the point of view you reach different and
<br />
sometimes opposite results.
<br />
<br />I have been superficially following your discussion with Juergens, Hal
<br />
and Russell. I assume that  by &quot;prior&quot; you mean prior probability
<br />
distribution of universal states as defined by some universal algorithm
<br />
or machine. It seems to me that such distributions are totally
<br />
irrelevent because what actually matters TO AN OBSERVER is the specific
<br />
subsets of disconnected state vectors necessary to make that OBSERVER
<br />
conscious. The state vector in that subset could be widely separated and
<br />
therefore not at all related or ordered according to the originating
<br />
prior. Their ordering and/or relationship to each other depends on the
<br />
physical and mental processes governing that OBSERVER consciousness. The
<br />
linkage from state vector to state vector that gives rise to
<br />
consciousness is purely subjective in a relativistic way to the
<br />
observer.
