<em class="quotelev1">&gt; careful that we take into account the configuration of the experiment

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself. This implies that the lattice of relations or poset aspect of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causality is a posteriori and not a priori to the specifics of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment. This implies, at least to me, that it is a mistake to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a priori existence of a space-time (with a unique light cone 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure).
</em><br />
<br />I agree that imposing a space-time structure for quantum events is a 
<br />
problem. In fact, this is one of the motivations of quantum gravity 
<br />
work, to get rid of the &quot;events on a background of space and time&quot; 
<br />
which most QM has been using.
<br />
<br />However, assuming a space-time and with local light cones seems very 
<br />
reasonable to me. We have no particular evidence that the light cone 
<br />
formalism isn't still applicable to quantum kinds of events (whatever 
<br />
EPR &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; may be, there is certainly no 
<br />
evidence that faster than light travel of particles or photons is 
<br />
involved, so there's no reason to throw out the speed of light as a 
<br />
maximum speed).
<br />
<br />You may be interested in Smolin's &quot;Three Roads to Quantum Gravity.&quot; He 
<br />
argues for the _relational_ view of space-time as being more suitable 
<br />
than the absolute space-time coordinates in Newtonian and (ironically) 
<br />
most quantum theories. Relativity of course uses the less absolute 
<br />
scheme.
<br />
<br />However--and this is very important!--there are no theories given 
<br />
experimental support today which show real violations of causality. (We 
<br />
could debate for a few days whether delayed-choice experiments, 
<br />
Aharonov-Bohm experiments, etc. show violations of causality. While 
<br />
entangled states show behaviors not found in the macroscopic, 
<br />
classical, human-scale world, they don't violate causality.)
<br />
<br />This argues for the emphasis placed on causal sets and causal 
<br />
relations. And hence on posets and lattices. (In my opinion, following 
<br />
the lead of the several authors I've mentioned a few times here.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     One possible solution is to consider space-times strictly from an a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; posteriori point of view. You had mentioned Greg Egan's novels and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Topologies model&quot; (for instance in the novel Distress) in previous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; posts. Do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you think that the ideas of the character Mosala could be used to &quot;make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense&quot; of this?
</em><br />
<br />Well, I try not to get too many of my theories out of science fiction!
<br />
<br />Not to sound flip or dismissive, but Egan's novels and short stories 
<br />
are best seen as romps through a landscape of strange and stimulating 
<br />
ideas. I like his stuff a lot because he's one of the few writers today 
<br />
able to (or interested in) keep up with modern physics and modern math. 
<br />
There was a time when SF writers were engineers or scientists (Asimov, 
<br />
Heinlein, Clarke, Hal Clement, even Larry Niven, who was at Caltech for 
<br />
a while). Their editors were also science-oriented people, like Hugo 
<br />
Gernsback and John Campbell, who wanted hard science in the science 
<br />
ficiton they bought.
<br />
<br />In their day, these authors wrote stories and novels involving the 
<br />
then-weird ideas of hypercubes, Mobius bands, planets with extremely 
<br />
high gravity, time travel, neutron stars, and black holes. (Larry Niven 
<br />
was the Greg Egan of his day. Niven still writes, but his recent novels 
<br />
are less compelling and certainly no longer are exploring cutting-edge 
<br />
stuff.)
<br />
<br />As SF spread in popularity to the Baby Boom generation, more and more 
<br />
non-scientists and non-engineers started writing. So we got more 
<br />
&quot;sociological&quot; SF (some of it very good, like Ursula LeGuin's stuff). 
<br />
And more of the &quot;palace intrigue&quot; kind of novels (&quot;The planet Cthwox 
<br />
has been ruled by the Klanring for 2000 years. A spaceship from the 
<br />
Vegan Federation has arrived...&quot;). And then there is fantasy...dragons, 
<br />
magic, etc.
<br />
<br />A few writers have stuck to hard science themes. Vernor Vinge is a good 
<br />
example. And some of the &quot;cyberpunk&quot; themes have been more or less 
<br />
based on plausible science, including Gibson, Walter Jon Williams, 
<br />
Bruce Sterling, Dan Simmons, etc. (I also like a less popular author, 
<br />
David Zindell, and his quartet of novels set on the planet &quot;Neverness.&quot; 
<br />
Mathematics plays an unusual role.)
<br />
<br />Steven Baxter also writes Stapletonian novels about the distant future 
<br />
and the end of time, though his themes are often depressing (to me at 
<br />
least).
<br />
<br />Greg Egan is one of the few writers today actually _using_ the latest 
<br />
developments in physics and even math to explore ideas about the nature 
<br />
of our reality, the anthropic principle, and the colonization of 
<br />
cyberspaces.
<br />
<br />It also turns out that Egan has been doing some Java and Mathematica 
<br />
programming for some of the spin foam papers by Baez and others. This 
<br />
doesn't mean that any particular idea he explores, whether in 
<br />
&quot;Distress&quot; or &quot;Diaspora&quot; or &quot;Schild's Ladder,&quot; is &quot;right,&quot; just that 
<br />
Egan is obvious technically competent to write about these ideas.
<br />
<br />What fired me up about &quot;Distress&quot; in particular was the several-page 
<br />
synopsis of the &quot;All Topologies Model.&quot; For some reason, this got my 
<br />
juices flowing. (The rest of the novel just sort of plodded along to a 
<br />
fairly predictable conclusion.)
<br />
<br />I hope this explains why I don't look to Egan's fictional character for 
<br />
actual theories, just stimulation.
<br />
