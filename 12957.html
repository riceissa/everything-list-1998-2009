<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP: .....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That is one thing. Another thing is that no entity or set of entities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could know if their 'simulation' attempt was doing what they wanted 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; every detail because to attempt to find this out would interfere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; irreversibly with the unfolding of the world.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Brent:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  This assumes that the simulation must be quantum mechanical - but I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think that would defeat the whole point of assuming a simulation. If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world can be simulated classically, then it can be monitored 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without interference.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I disagree, or I agree. The multi-words, or multi-computations, can be 
<br />
simulated classically. Then the interference between world/computations 
<br />
appears from the fact that we are ourselves in the simulations, and 
<br />
that we cannot know in which computational histories we are, and that 
<br />
we suffer from unavoidable self-limitations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP: well actually I wasn't thinking about QM at all; I guess most of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my thinking is 'classical' although I realise of course that QM 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principles impose minimum sizes for basic components of all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information processing systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  My concern is much more a pronounced sceptical disbelief in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ability of sentient creatures at any order of magnitude to be able to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; control all the variables in a system they wish to impose.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I think the basic condition is always going to be that we and they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CANNOT. My usual expression of this, said in the context of working at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a low level in a bureaucracy, is that in any given situation there are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always more things which can occur than we want to occur, and usually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are more things which can occur than we can possibly know about. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a long winded way of expressing 'Murphy's Law', but it is also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a precise way of stating in plain-English how entropy manifests at the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level of our work-a-day lives.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. And a reading of Godel's second incompleteness theorem is exactly 
<br />
that &quot;Murphy law&quot;: Shit happens of may happen&quot; (is it english?).
<br />
Well modally: Bf v DBf, i.e. the false is provable or it is consistent 
<br />
that the false my be provable. We are insane or, if we are sane, we may 
<br />
well loose sanity.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The thing is, setting up a simulation or emulation of something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; requires giving up some degree of control over the process.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes, and that is why, in the spirit of this list, we never consider the 
<br />
problem of emulating something, which is indeed near the impossible, 
<br />
but we simulate everything. With comp, there is a notion of 
<br />
&quot;everything&quot; completely captured by Church thesis. If comp is true, 
<br />
although you cannot and will never been able to emulate a particular 
<br />
individual and, at the same time, knowing that your emulation is 
<br />
correct, you can trivially emulate all individuals, by running the 
<br />
Universal Dovetailer, for example.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I mean that's what we have machines for isn't it,to do the work for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us?
</em><br />
<br />Err... locally yes, but most machine introduced in this list are run 
<br />
for theoretical purpose only.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And as far as I can see, despite what Bruno says, the numbers have got 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to BE somewhere.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think you are doing a category error. A particle can be somewhere 
<br />
(and even this is only relative to some other particles). I don't see 
<br />
at all why a number should be somewhere, except when the number 
<br />
manifests itself to you in some context, but even here I would take 
<br />
such localization as not being entirely serious. If your bank account 
<br />
is empty, saying zero is in your bank would only be a way to speak. 
<br />
Numbers are not the type of entity capable of being somewhere. You will 
<br />
never say: guess who I met in Tokyo last week, the number 666!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the cosmic Boffins have got to have systems which are at least to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some degree autonomous. [As I write this it seems to me I am cutting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the root of Bishop Berkeley's concept of being in the mind of God, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or some such.] In fact considering the scale of what is being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contemplated I would assume that at least some parts of the system 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be interacting in recursive self-referential ways that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guaranteed unpredictability. And if it is unpredictable then you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not controlling it; it is simply happening, and it is non-QM 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; randomness.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. I think it is a fundamental point. But we have to distinguish 
<br />
between
<br />
1) simulating everything (easy with comp, in Platonia (by which I mean 
<br />
with no bounded time nor bounded space or memory).
<br />
2) simulating a thing (and not necessarily knowing it): possible, by 
<br />
chance.
<br />
3) simulating a thing and knowing it (most of the time impossible with 
<br />
comp)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I can see I have rambled on here a bit too much, but I have to say I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think the issue of testing to see if what you predicted is really 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happening, must involve some interference in the simulation process 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself, either that or the measurement is estimation with significant 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; error margins.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think so. In a nutshell, this is how I try to extract physics 
<br />
(interference and non classical logic) from comp (classical 
<br />
truth/logic).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I also think there is a strong argument from ethics that we are NOT 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a simulation and furthermore that that sort of thing just doesn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen. My argument is very presumptuous of course but, what the heck, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if there IS a conspiracy of ET, pan-dimensional experimenters out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there somewhere tweaking their coding to make our world ever more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'realistic', well they NOW have a moral duty to show themselves and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give account for what they have done. Why? Because if they are smart 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough to do such a thing then they are also smart enough to realise 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they are causing avoidable harm and suffering to people here on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Earth and this has been going on for a long time. [and it's gotta 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stop!]
</em><br />
<br /><br />Most probably we are not in *such* a simulation, desired by other 
<br />
person-being. If we are in such a simulation then we can know it, soon 
<br />
or late. But with comp, we are in a natural simulation handled by the 
<br />
usual (but very rich) relation among numbers. Like in Plotinus, the 
<br />
ultimate simulator is not a thinking person.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If they don't show themselves and give account then they are just a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bunch of moral wimps who do not deserve our respect, let alone 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adoration. This will be true even only if there is only The One.    It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the question that has to be directed at all those who wield power: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you are so smart, why aren't you kind?
</em><br />
<br />There is no sense to say the One is smart or whatever quality you want 
<br />
attribute to It/Him/her.
<br />
True, Plotinus and Plato call it &quot;Good&quot;, but it means only that it acts 
<br />
as a universal attractor for all soul.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It's like Terry Pratchett says: There is only one sin, and that is to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; treat another person like a thing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree completely, as I have already told you. But this is a reason 
<br />
for appreciating comp, if only to understand (either intuitively 
<br />
through thought experiments, or formally by listening to a 
<br />
self-observing universal machine) why most machine are lead to the 
<br />
distinction between third-person notions and first person notions. Of 
<br />
course the person that you describe as not being a thing is the *first* 
<br />
person. The one who can have pleasure and pain. Even Peano Arithmetic 
<br />
can prove that a first person is not a thing.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Bruno
