<br />
Thanks very much Jesse!
<br />
<br />You answered the question I *would have* asked had I rememberd my quantum
<br />
physics better ;-)
<br />
<br />I think your answer is related to a paradox a friend mentioned to me.
<br />
<br />The paradox is as follows:
<br />
<br />&quot;One does the EPR thing of creating two particles with opposite spin. Send
<br />
one far away to Alpha Centauri and send the other through a
<br />
Stern-Gerlach magnet and let the spin up and spin down outputs
<br />
interfere to form a double slit. If the far away particle is measured
<br />
up vs. down, our local particle must definitely go through the up hole
<br />
or the down hole and we get no interference pattern. If he measures
<br />
the far away particle sideways we get a superposition of states and we
<br />
get interference. Thus by rotating his measurement he should be able
<br />
to communicate to us faster than the speed of light. We should see our
<br />
pattern blinking between interference and not. What's wrong with that
<br />
argument?&quot;
<br />
<br />Along the lines of your solution to my other, related puzzle, I'll try to
<br />
analogize a solution to this puzzle.
<br />
<br />I guess the idea must be: there is no &quot;change&quot; to what a particular particle
<br />
does
<br />
when you observe its faraway coupled pair in a certain way.  Its individual
<br />
results do not visibly
<br />
change from non-interference to interference.  (If that did happen,
<br />
you'd have the basis for a faster than light communicator, as you say.)
<br />
<br />Instead, when you observe some of the particles sideways and some
<br />
vertically,
<br />
you must be creating &quot;correlational information&quot; that exists only
<br />
statistically
<br />
as a correlation between that's happening in Alpha Centauri and what's
<br />
happening locally.
<br />
<br />So, maybe there is some weird cancellation here, like in the case you
<br />
described in your email.
<br />
Perhaps, if one restricts attention to the cases where
<br />
the faraway particle is measured &quot;right&quot; then interference is seen, and if
<br />
one restricts
<br />
attention to the cases where the faraway particle is measured &quot;left&quot; then
<br />
interference
<br />
is seen; but if one looks across all cases where the faraway particle is
<br />
measured
<br />
sideways, then the peaks and troughs of the different cases might cancel out
<br />
and
<br />
you'd get no interference?
<br />
<br />-- Ben
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think Ben's question here does make sense. See below...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The point is, there is no change to the s photon when we put the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;polarizer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over by p.  Its results do not visibly change from non-interference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to interference, as the web page might imply.  (If that did happen,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we'd have the basis for a faster than light communicator.)  No, all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is happening is that we are choosing to throw out half
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the data,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the half we keep does show interference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes but we are choosing which half to throw out in a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; peculiar way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;--
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; i.e. we are throwing it out by &quot;un-happening&quot; it after it happened,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; by destroying some records that were only gathered after the events
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; recorded in the data already happened...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;You have to try to stop thinking of this in mystical terms.  IMO people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;present a rather prosaic phenomenon in a misleading and confusing way,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;and this is giving you an incorrect idea.  Nothing is un-happening.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;No records are destroyed after they were gathered.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Although it may be true that no records are destroyed after they're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gathered, what is true is that an *opportunity* to find out retroactively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which path the &quot;signal&quot; photon took is eliminated when you choose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to combine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the paths of the &quot;idler&quot; photons instead of measuring them. For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; look at the diagram of the setup in fig. 1 of this paper:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/PS_cache/quant-ph/pdf/9903/9903047.pdf">http://xxx.lanl.gov/PS_cache/quant-ph/pdf/9903/9903047.pdf</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this figure, pairs of entangled photons are emitted by one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two atoms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at different positions, A and B. The signal photons move to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diagram, and are detected at D0--you can think of the two atoms as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding to the two slits in the double-slit experiment, while D0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponds to the screen. Meanwhile, the idler photons move to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the left on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the diagram. If the idler is detected at D3, then you know that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it came from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atom A, and thus that the signal photon came from there also; so when you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; look at the subset of trials where the idler was detected at D3, you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not see any interference in the distribution of positions where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the signal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; photon was detected at D0, just as you see no interference on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; screen in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the double-slit experiment when you measure which slit the particle went
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through. Likewise, if the idler is detected at D4, then you know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both it and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the signal photon came from atom B, and you won't see any interference in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the signal photon's distribution. But if the idler is detected at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either D1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or D2, then this is equally consistent with a path where it came
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from atom A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and was reflected by the beam-splitter BSA or a path where it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; came from atom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B and was reflected from beam-splitter BSB, thus you have no information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about which atom the signal photon came from and will get interference in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the signal photon's distribution, just like in the double-slit experiment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when you don't measure which slit the particle came through. Note that if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you removed the beam-splitters BSA and BSB you could guarantee that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idler would be detected at D3 or D4 and thus that the path of the signal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; photon would be known; likewise, if you replaced the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beam-splitters BSA and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BSB with mirrors, then you could guarantee that the idler would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be detected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at D1 or D2 and thus that the path of the signal photon would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unknown. By
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making the distances large enough you could even choose whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to make sure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the idlers go to D3&amp;D4 or to go to D1&amp;D2 *after* you have already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the position that the signal photon was detected, so in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the choice whether or not to retroactively &quot;erase&quot; your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opportunity to know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which atom the signal photon came from, after the signal photon's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has already been detected.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This confused me for a while since it seemed like this would imply your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; later choice determines whether or not you observe interference in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; signal photons earlier, until I got into a discussion about it online and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone showed me the &quot;trick&quot;.  In the same paper, look at the graphs in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, Fig. 3 showing the interference pattern in the signal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; photons in the subset of cases where the idler was detected at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; D1, and Fig.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4 showing the interference pattern in the signal photons in the subset of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cases where the idler was detected at D2 (the two cases where the idler's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'which-path' information is lost). They do both show interference, but if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you line the graphs up you see that the peaks of one interference pattern
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; line up with the troughs of the other--so the &quot;trick&quot; here is that if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; add the two patterns together, you get a non-interference pattern
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if the idlers had ended up at D3 or D4. This means that even if you did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; replace the beam-splitters BSA and BSB with mirrors, guaranteeing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idlers would always be detected at D1 or D2 and that their which-path
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information would always be erased, you still wouldn't see any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the total pattern of the signal photons; only after the idlers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; detected at D1 or D2, and you look at the *subset* of signal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; photons whose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding idlers were detected at one or the other, do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see any kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of interference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, my guess is that something similar would be true if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; created a more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complicated type of quantum-eraser experiment along the lines of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what Ben is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggesting. For example, imagine something like the double-slit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with an electron, except that the slits are on one side of a closed box
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whose insides resemble a cloud chamber, with the electron gun on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the inside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the box on the opposite side. Imagine that this box is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idealized one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that can perfectly isolate the inside from any interactions with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the outside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world, along the lines of the box in the Schrodinger's cat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought-experiment (perhaps the only way to realize this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practically would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be to simulate the insides of the box on a quantum computer). Now, if an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electron comes out of the slits and hits a screen, then if we immediately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; open the box and look inside, we'll probably still be able to see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the path
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the electron took through the cloud chamber, and thus we'll know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which slit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it went through. On the other hand, if we wait for a long time before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opening the box, the insides will have gone back to equilibrium and we'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have no way of telling which slit the electron went through. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analogy with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the quantum-eraser experiment, no matter which we do, I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think you'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see an interference pattern in the total pattern of electrons on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the screen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, again in analogy with the quantum-eraser experiment, if you were to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; look at all possible outcomes of measuring the exact quantum state of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inside of the box in the case where you wait a large time t to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; open it (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the number of possible distinct quantum states would be huge,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of particles making up a cloud chamber), and then you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; performed the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment an equally huge number of times so you could look at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the subset
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of trials where the box was found in a particular quantum state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; X, then in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that subset, my guess is that you'd see an interference pattern in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; position that the electron was detected on the screen. But if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; add up all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the different subsets involving each possible quantum state for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the inside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the box, my guess is that just as in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the peaks and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; troughs of all the various subsets would add together so the total
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distribution of the electron's position would show no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interference. And on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the other hand, if you opened the box immediately instead of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; waiting a large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amount of time, then most of the exact states you would find when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you open
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the box would show clearly which path the electron took, so that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looked at a subset of trials where the box was found in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state Y, you'd still see no interference pattern in the electron,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you don't see an interference pattern in Fig. 5 of the paper which looks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only at the subset of trials where the idler ended up at D3 and thus was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; known to have come from atom A.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And of course, instead of just having the inside of the box
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain a cloud
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chamber, you could have it contain some even more complicated macroscopic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recording device, like a cloud chamber *and* a little man who can see the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; condensation track in the cloud chamber and remember it, and then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choose whether to open the box and measure the state of the system inside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; while the man's memory was still intact, or after a bomb had gone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; off inside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the box and made the information impossible to recover even in principle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from a measurement of the state. The basic idea here should be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same--you'll never see interference in the total pattern of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electrons, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you repeat this experiment some vast amount of times and look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subset of trials where the inside of the box was found in a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precise quantum state, then you may see interference in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subset, in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cases where the information has been erased (in this example, the cases
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where you wait until after the bomb has blown the man and his memories to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; smithereens).
