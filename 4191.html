<br />
hi all. re the term &quot;algorithmic revolution&quot; here are a few
<br />
more ideas along this thread Id like to point out.
<br />
<br />TCM wrote
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My belief is that basic mathematics is much more important than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computer use, in terms of understanding the cosmos and the nature of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality.
</em><br />
<br />ok, fair disclosure, I have a BS software engr, writing code
<br />
since age ~10, and it affects my worldview bigtime. or, one could
<br />
say, I really know how to pick a winning horse, haha.. seriously,
<br />
I recognized &amp; planned my life around the &quot;algorithmic revolution&quot; 
<br />
from a young age.
<br />
<br />at an early point I realized that software is like 
<br />
&quot;animated mathematics&quot;.
<br />
<br />this is a very,very deep &amp; cosmic way of looking at algorithmics. it
<br />
captures some of the revolutionary flavor. we can suggest that
<br />
mathematics has previously attempted to grasp the concept of
<br />
change, via calculus, differential eqns etc. 
<br />
<br />but something is fundamentally new about simulation. it captures
<br />
worlds that cannot be expressed via mathematical generalities. there
<br />
are no equations we can write down that describe the outcome of,
<br />
say, a climate simulation-- its all locally defined &amp; then globally
<br />
simulated &amp; the outcome is &quot;emergent&quot;. &amp; what are the differential
<br />
equations that describe the game of life??
<br />
<br />imho algorithmics captures the extraordinary, currently very poorly
<br />
understood property of &quot;emergence&quot;. just as
<br />
in the game of life there are thousands of glider types, none of
<br />
which one would expect/anticipate from the simple rules.
<br />
<br />we can argue that algorithmics is a fundamentally new way to
<br />
look at mathematics. and one could argue, all mathematics up until
<br />
now has been transformed. at this point, it seems much more correct
<br />
to classify mathematics as a subbranch of algorithmics than vice
<br />
versa. I believe much mathematics of the future will be taught
<br />
from the &quot;algorithmic point of view&quot; instead.
<br />
<br />imho, the invention &amp; harnessing of the algorithm is roughly as significant
<br />
in human intellectual development as pythagoras's original
<br />
realization about how mathematics modelled nature. its easily on that
<br />
order of magnitude as far as a milestone in human thought, possibly
<br />
surpassing it. it seems to me, fundamentally, algorithmics entails
<br />
and surpasses mathematics as a new simultaneously conceptual and physical
<br />
tool for analyzing the universe
<br />
and its variegated phenomena.
<br />
<br />so think. we've basically got several millenia of mathematical
<br />
thought, dating all the way back to the babylonians (who played
<br />
with perfect triangles, fractions etc), and quite well
<br />
developed in greece 2000 years ago. reaching heights of sophistication
<br />
with calculus, or the abstraction in the 20th century.
<br />
Im saying to some degree, all that
<br />
is childs play compared to the new universe of algorithmics.
<br />
<br /><br />re: TCMs questions about some of my points.
<br />
<br /><br />1st, I believe that we will eventually get the math for a TOE
<br />
that matches accelerator/particle physics 
<br />
so perfectly that it will be considered
<br />
redundant or wasteful to do the expensive supercollider experiments, because
<br />
the accelerators will never find anything that does not match the 
<br />
comprehensive theory.
<br />
<br />that is, after all, one of the big 
<br />
reasons to look for a TOE.  but I agree, until that point, 
<br />
physicists are not going to give up the &quot;big science&quot;..
<br />
<br />a crazy thought? perhaps. but lets look at atomic weaponry testing--
<br />
thats essentially whats happened. the US has been simulating atomic
<br />
weapons testing for many years now with powerful supercomputers. and
<br />
obviously the results are considered ***extremely*** accurate.  it
<br />
can indeed be done on some level.
<br />
<br /><br />2nd-- alas, I wish I could cite a reference. but software is
<br />
used extremely heavily in particle physics experiments to 
<br />
automatically analyze particles and classify them &amp; find
<br />
anomalous events. its basically
<br />
AI-like software, extremely sophisticated. it can look at 
<br />
very complicated particle tracks &amp; collisions and name
<br />
all the particle tracks based on analyzing the &quot;big picture&quot;.
<br />
<br />this used to be done by humans &amp; by hand, and (as I understand it)
<br />
the discovery of many
<br />
particles from the last decade or around that range could
<br />
not have been done with this highly sophisticated sorting
<br />
software that can run through millions of events very quickly.
<br />
<br />so there is a hidden story behind massive particle accelerators.
<br />
the software infrastructure for them is all invisible and
<br />
mostly unknown to the public, but its a vast edifice at
<br />
the core of the analysis, and has gone through revolutionary
<br />
changes in a short amount of time, mirroring the algorithmic
<br />
revolution elsewhere.
<br />
<br />how much is that software worth?? I cant really estimate, but
<br />
I wouldnt be surprised if a significant percent of supercollider
<br />
budgets was spent on developing it.
<br />
<br />if anyone knows references on software used in particle physics
<br />
analysis, I would really like to know myself.
<br />
<br />a nice reference on the culture behind accelerators is 
<br />
&quot;beamtimes &amp; lifetimes&quot; by sharon traweek.
