<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Would this experimental result actually be predicted by the quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formalism, though? It sounds like they had a setup similar to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; double-slit experiment and found a small amount of interference even when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they measured which hole the particle traveled through, but I thought the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum formalism predicts that interference would be completely destroyed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by such a measurement.
</em><br />
<br />There is a lot of confusion about all that.
<br />
I hope I do not make more damages here!
<br />
<br />There are also many different versions of Bohr's complementarity
<br />
principle. Complementarity of what? Waves (there are no waves in
<br />
matrix mechanics!) and particles? Interference pattern and &quot;which
<br />
way&quot;? Continuous and discontinuous? Localization and superposition?
<br />
Separability and unitarity? Reversibility and irreversibility?
<br />
<br />The modern view says that ...
<br />
<br />&quot;The superposition of amplitudes is only valid if there
<br />
is no way to know, even in principle, which path the particle
<br />
took. It is important to realize that this does not imply
<br />
that an observer actually takes note of what happens.
<br />
It is sufficient to destroy the interference pattern,
<br />
if the path information is accessible in principle from
<br />
the experiment or even if it is dispersed in the environment
<br />
and beyond any technical possibility to be recovered, but
<br />
in principle 'still out there'&quot;.
<br />
Anton Zeilinger, Rev. Mod. Phys., 1999, page S-288
<br />
<br />&quot;In an experiment the state reflects not what is actually
<br />
known about the system, but rather what is knowable, in principle,
<br />
with the help of auxiliary measurements that do not disturb
<br />
the original experiment. By focusing on what is knowable in
<br />
principle, and treating what is known as largely irrelevant,
<br />
one completely avoids the anthropomorphism and any reference
<br />
to consciousness that some physicists have tried to inject
<br />
into quantum mechanics&quot;
<br />
Leonard Mandel, Rev. Mod. Phys., 1999, p. S-274.
<br />
<br />So, the key word now is &quot;indistinguishability&quot;. Must this
<br />
&quot;indistinguishability&quot; be absolute? What does it happen in case of
<br />
partial &quot;indistinguishability&quot;? (Anticipated answer: there is a smooth
<br />
transition between particle-like and wave-like behaviour).
<br />
<br />In 1979, Wootters and Zurek (Complementarity in the double-slit
<br />
experiment: Quantum nonseparability and a quantitative statement of
<br />
Bohr's principle, PR, D-19, 1979, p. 473-484) presented a famous
<br />
gedanken experiment, showing that photons still have a wave-like
<br />
behaviour even if their paths are predicted almost (say: 99%)
<br />
certainly. The set-up, in the gedanken, was essentially a single-slit
<br />
plus a double-slit; and also a double-slit plus a specific
<br />
'textured' screen capable of detect and record both the interference
<br />
pattern and the 'which way'. Yes this is possible.
<br />
<br />Coupling Wheeler's 'delayed choice' and the above gedanken experiment,
<br />
Wim Rietdijk wrote (circa 1982) an interesting paper. Very shortly,
<br />
QM explains the two-slit interference via Heisenberg principle.
<br />
Hence the slits measure the position of the 'object'; because of this
<br />
measurement there is a scattering; |&lt;p(y)|psi|^2 gives the probability
<br />
function for the 'object' emerging from the slits with momentum
<br />
p(y); this probability function causes the interference pattern.
<br />
Thus - that is important - after the 'object' has passed through
<br />
the two-slit, the probability function |&lt;p(y)|psi|^2 is fixed.
<br />
And - second important point - there is a principle of conservation
<br />
of momentum. Thus, nothing can change that fixed momentum (rectius:
<br />
that fixed probability function). Now comes the weirdness. After
<br />
the 'object' has passed the two-slit, we have *still* some time to
<br />
choose if we wish to detect the 'welcher weg' (wich way, which path)
<br />
the 'object' took, or if we wish to record just the 'impact' of the
<br />
'object' on the screen or, in general, if we wish to get both,
<br />
the 'welcher weg' and the 'interference pattern' at the same time
<br />
(this is technically possible, provided we use a screen with a special
<br />
'texture'). Here is the weirdness: does QM say that any knowledge
<br />
of the 'welcher weg' causes the loss of the interference pattern? Yes?
<br />
Does Feynman say this in his Lectures? Ok. Thus QM says that the
<br />
the probability function |&lt;p(y)|psi|^2, already fixed at the two-slit
<br />
level, is a function of our later, delayed, free choice of a specific
<br />
detector (of the interference pattern only; of the interference pattern
<br />
and the 'wich path' at the same time).
<br />
<br />Coming back to the point of that &quot;absolute&quot; indistinuishability.
<br />
<br />Greenberger and Yasin wrote down the relation, P^2 + V^2 = 1,
<br />
where P is the probability for the electron (or photon)
<br />
taking one of the two possible paths, and V the visibility
<br />
of the fringes (interference pattern).
<br />
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9908072">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9908072</a>
<br />
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311179">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311179</a>
<br />
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201026">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201026</a>
<br />
In other words, the Greenberger and Yasin relation states that
<br />
the &quot;entity&quot; (electron, photon, etc.) has a double nature (wave-like,
<br />
particle-like) and there is a &quot;smooth&quot; transition between one and the
<br />
other nature.
<br />
<br />So, the &quot;indistinuishability&quot; is not an absolute, by experiment.
<br />
See this specific new test <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph?0404013">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph?0404013</a>
<br />
<br />Of course there are interesting perspectives using &quot;weak&quot;
<br />
measurements <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph?0310081">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph?0310081</a>
<br />
and photons of different energy (wave-lenght)
<br />
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304086">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304086</a> and so on
<br />
(non-local two-slit interferometers, interference
<br />
between two correlated sources, interference between
<br />
two uncorrelated sources, interference in time of any kind,
<br />
quantum beats, etc.).
<br />
<br />In summa. There is no new at all.
<br />
<br />After all Bohr even incorporated Chinese traditional Yin-Yang Symbol, and
<br />
related smooth transition, into his Coat of Arms.
