&nbsp;Hi Bruno,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for indulging my skepticism. I think I am getting a clearer 
<br />
picture of what you are up to. There is only one
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;point in our exchange below to which I would like to respond and than 
<br />
I have some unrelated comments. I will
<br />
&nbsp;erase the rest of the conversation to which I don't have much to add.

<br /><br />&nbsp;Hi Godfrey,

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really, as far as you agree that classical physics can be 
<br />
extracted from quantum physics. My favorite unrigorous way: Feynman 
<br />
integral (see my paper:
<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/CC&amp;Q.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/CC&amp;Q.pdf</a>
<br />
&nbsp;for a little summary.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Bruno
<br />

<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not say, nor do I believe, that one can extract the &quot;classical 
<br />
world&quot; from QM, as I pointed out to Lee, but one can surely object to a 
<br />
&quot;third party&quot; theory from the fact that it does not reproduce a 
<br />
classical world any better than quantum
<br />
&nbsp;mechanics. This is a complicated issue because:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Classical physics does not explain the &quot;classical world&quot; either as 
<br />
it cannot account for the stability of matter, for instance,
<br />
&nbsp;which only QM explains.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Quantum mechanics predicts some entirely macroscopic phenomena 
<br />
that we do observe as part of the &quot;classical world&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;i.e. superfluidity of He, superconductivity, stability of the vaccuum 
<br />
etc...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words: if I found a way of shooting down your theory in a way 
<br />
that would not obviously violate the correspondence
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;limit of QM , it would shot down! That is what I am suggesting above. 
<br />
But do not worry because I think you are a lot better
<br />
&nbsp;shot by QM.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Now my logistic COMPlaints about your COMP:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I have searched through your web site to see whether I could find a 
<br />
full statement of your hypothesis since you were not
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;kind enough to reproduce it in the previous exchange. I don't read 
<br />
French that well and your English paper is somewhat
<br />
&nbsp;sketchy on this, so I can only refer to what you state in the page :
<br />
<br />&nbsp;<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.htm">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.htm</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;where I found what looks like a definition. My first objection is to 
<br />
the following sentence:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Definition: Classical Digital mechanism, or Classical 
<br />
Computationalism, or just comp, is the conjunction of the following 
<br />
three sub-hypotheses:&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;after which you list three items which I will not reproduce here and 
<br />
will just short as 1) YD for &quot;Yes-doctor&quot;, 2) CT for
<br />
&nbsp;Church Thesis and 3) AR for Arithmetic Realism.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My objection is that of these three only the first can genuinely be 
<br />
called an hypothesis! CT, as the name indicates,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is a Thesis which is most likely unprovable but favored by 
<br />
overwhelming heuristic support. I know that there are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;some people in the southern hemisphere who think that QComputation 
<br />
could produce a counterexample to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;shoot it down (and perhaps it could) but you and I agree that it is 
<br />
unlikely. And AR is a metaphysical position which I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;happen to subscribe but which I would never fathom to try and prove or 
<br />
empirically test (nor do I have any idea
<br />
&nbsp;on how to do it! Do you?)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I suppose that you need for these three things to be true for the 
<br />
rest of your argument to go. But I find that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;it is extremely unfair to force your most excellent hypothesis YD to 
<br />
have to stand in company of the other two to assert
<br />
&nbsp;its merits!!! In other words as
<br />
<br />&nbsp;(1) YD is obviously independent from CT and AR
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) CT and AR stand no chance of being falsified empirically (or we 
<br />
both like them that way, which is the same).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) No one that we know has been able to extract conclusions such as 
<br />
yours from CT &amp; AR without YD (right)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;would you have any objections to us concentrating, from here on, on 
<br />
your &quot;YD hypothesis&quot;?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I am saying this because I actually think that it is the real 
<br />
interesting and original part of your proposal and it does not
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;need those two other huge &quot;body guards&quot; which I happen to be friends 
<br />
with. OK?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;If you agree with this I may have something interesting to tell you 
<br />
about your idea that you have not anticipated!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Please,don't COMP out! Say &quot;yes&quot;, Doctor Bruno!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;-Godfrey
