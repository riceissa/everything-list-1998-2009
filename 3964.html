<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Tim, Hi All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I got indeed the Yetter's book. I promise to you, Tim, some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; commentaries. Here they are. It is for me an opportunity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to write my last long post, before I try to write that english
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; text as Wei gently insists I do. Yetter's book interests me for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two related reasons, both linked to my thesis, and even to the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; advanced part of it---in some sense you arrive, in the list, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; little to early with your toposes! :-).
</em><br />
<br />Many thanks for remembering my current main interest, but I still have a 
<br />
long, long way to go before I can understand your logic points. (I have 
<br />
several &quot;advanced&quot; books on logic, but mainly for inspiration and 
<br />
direction. Have recently picked up more introductory books by Tarski, 
<br />
Boolos, Smullyan, etc. My focus is more on the lattice/Heyting algebra 
<br />
side, so a lot of logic has not yet been needed.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; About the mind I am a conservative sort of logician, and I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonist about positive integers, so by mind I take first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; boolean arithmetical truth. Did not George Boole entitled his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; book &quot;The Laws of Thought&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but the conventional logic point of view has not proved to be 
<br />
especially useful for understanding mind and AI, as I'm sure you know 
<br />
very well. I actually used to be in the AI business, when I was still at 
<br />
Intel in the mid-80s, and I mostly lost interest in using logic and 
<br />
algorithmic reasoning in AI. Did a bit of work on the emerging neural 
<br />
net/connectionist approach, and also realized how lacking that was.
<br />
<br />So while I think the IL/Brouwer/Heyting/topos stuff will _eventually_ be 
<br />
of use in epistemology and ontology aspects of AI, I'm not expecting 
<br />
quick progress.
<br />
<br />As for mind-body issues, I've never understood what the big deal is.
<br />
<br />....
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is not a too big exaggeration to say that the work by Everett,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Graham, Hartle, Zeh Joos, Kiefer (and others) gives an explanation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of BITS from QUBITS. That is, how classical observers/worlds emerge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from a quantum reality.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Quantum theory is of much more current interest to me. Hence the work of 
<br />
Chris Isham and others. (Ironically, as I may have mentioned, I took GR 
<br />
from Jim Hartle back in 1973. Then it was all stuff about Killing 
<br />
vectors and rotating black holes and all, and none of the math I was 
<br />
also taking in a seminar on analysis and topology was then recognized by 
<br />
me as being effective. (Though one seminar I was in was using the 
<br />
just-published Hawking and Ellis, &quot;Large-Scale Structure of Spacetime&quot; 
<br />
book. I wasn't mentally prepared, I assume, to see the connections I am 
<br />
now seeing, nearly 30 years later! The seminar leader was Terry 
<br />
Sejnowski, who later switched to connectionist AI and was the force 
<br />
behind the &quot;Boltzmann Machine&quot; in the early 80s, ironically enough.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And it is not at all an exaggeration to say my work is an attempt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to explain QUBITS from BITS. Actually I show more and less:
</em><br />
<br />This interests me a lot more than dealing with the mind-body 
<br />
problem...perhaps because I only think about things I can &quot;sort of&quot; 
<br />
grasp. The problem of mind is just too large a problem at this time, I 
<br />
think.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  -More: because my work provides a proof that, IF we take the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp hyp seriously enough, THEN qubits *must* follow from bits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is basically done by the Universal Dovetailer Argument UDA (+
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Movie Graph Argument if you don't like explicit reference to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OCCAM razor).
</em><br />
<br />I hope to spend more time looking at your LISP programs.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [much logic elided]
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And more: It is natural to define S4Grz* (which correspond to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; G* as S4Grz correspond to G). But surprise: S4Grz = S4Grz*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first person is his own guardian angel! Even Boolos remarks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in his second 1993 book on provability that this phenomenon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is &quot;shades of the intuitionists' doctrine that mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth is to be identified with provability.
</em><br />
<br />And this point of view is also consistent with Greg Chaitin's notions of 
<br />
the provable truths being a tiny fraction of the &quot;uncharted territory,&quot; 
<br />
with &quot;experimental math&quot; playing a more important role in the future 
<br />
(though it can be argued that nearly all of our math is motivated by 
<br />
either experimental or physics or other &quot;sociological&quot; considerations: 
<br />
mathematicians tend to work on problems linked to other problems or 
<br />
motivated by physics and other observations.
<br />
<br />The &quot;constructivist&quot; motivation is not all that strange.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So it is not exactly my last long post, but it is among them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps such more detailled explanations will help me in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; planning a longer paper. Thanks for your patience.
</em><br />
<br />In my own way, I find that writing articles helps me to think through 
<br />
complex arguments.
<br />
<br />BTW, the most exciting recent thread for me was the one about the 
<br />
&quot;reversability of time&quot; arguements, raised initially by Wei Dai and then 
<br />
argued by Hal Finney. Writing the &quot;Professor Ludwig&quot; piece, in which an 
<br />
1860 Prof. Ludwig (Boltzmann, obviously) predicts that the simplest 
<br />
time-reversed pocket of the universe means telescopes will likely see 
<br />
nothing but chaos outside the local region, helped me to clarify my 
<br />
thinking on anthropic arguments. And motivated me to finish reading Huw 
<br />
Price's book.
<br />
<br />This is the real blessing of mailing lists like this one! I may now be 
<br />
motivated to understand the kinds of logic you discuss if only to try to 
<br />
refute you! (no offense intended)
