<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Only Bruno thinks computation trancends matter.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The notion of computation and computability have been discovered by

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Mathematicians working around the foundation crisis of math after the

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The idea is that computation should be redefined as physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computation is a very recent one, and is due to people like David
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Deustch and Landauer. And it does not really work as such. Deutsch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;reconstruction&quot; of the Post-Church-Turing thesis is really a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; different thesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course you can have theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truths about computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But show me something that has been computed by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an immaterial computer.
</em><br />
<br />A Schmidhuberian computationalist would probably answer: look around  
<br />
you. But I have explained why this is not enough, and why a prori comp  
<br />
makes the observable reality not the output of one program (but a view  
<br />
from inside from all execution of all programs).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only hope you will work on the UDA+MGA, and understand that  
<br />
&quot;non-theoretical&quot; truth have to be redefined as theoretical  
<br />
possibilities (consistencies) observed from inside (from some first  
<br />
person point of view).
<br />
<br />Comp, or CTM, leads to a &quot;many types no token&quot; view of reality. Token  
<br />
are seen as such by being appearances from the point of view of an  
<br />
abstract subject coupled to an (infinity of) abstract computations.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; CTM *implies* materialism, and the MGA doesn't work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; CTM is neutral on materialism, even if many materialist use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; incorrectly comp to put the mind body problem under the rug. UDA,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; including MGA, shows why this fails.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What is in MGA which does not work?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's a reductio of the idea that mental states
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervene on computational states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CTM must be cast as the claim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that mental activity supervenes on computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity.
</em><br />
<br />I agree. Consciousness is attached to computation (and not to  
<br />
computational states), even at the starting of the reasoning, and also  
<br />
when the physical supervenience is introduced in MGA for the reductio  
<br />
ad absurdum.
<br />
Then, eventually, keeping CTM, and thus abandoning (weak) materialism,  
<br />
consciousness is related to, well not just a computation, but to an  
<br />
infinite sheaves of computations. Consciousness is a first person  
<br />
notion, and as such, is dependent on the first person uncertainty  
<br />
measure brought by the first person indeterminacy.
<br />
This is why I take time to explain what is a computation, or a  
<br />
computational activity, in purely arithmetical terms. A computation is  
<br />
not &quot;just&quot; a sequence of computational states, it is a sequence of  
<br />
computational states related by at least one universal machine (and  
<br />
then an infinity of them, from the point of view of the conscious  
<br />
being, observably so when he/she looks below its substitution level).  
<br />
Classical physics become the study of our most probable computations,  
<br />
which emerge from the statistical interference of all computations  
<br />
going through my relevant states (the relevance being dependent of the  
<br />
observer's comp-substitution level).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Thanks for quoting my sane2004 definition of comp, and showing that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; indeed platonism is not part of it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;It is a version of Platonism&quot;
</em><br />
<br />The wording is not important. The point is that in the assumption of  
<br />
CTM, (CT+ the theological act of faith),  I am using that &quot;version of  
<br />
platonism&quot; only, which is just the idea that classical logic can be  
<br />
applied to arithmetical sentences, and in the conclusion, only, we  
<br />
have to abandon weak materialism or CTM.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Just arithmetical realism without which CT has no meaning at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The CT thesis requires some mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claims to be true. it doesn't require numbers to actually exist
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have never asserted that numbers actually exist. Just that they  
<br />
exist in the sense of the usual interpretation of existential  
<br />
arithmetical statement are independent of me, you, or the existence or  
<br />
not of a material world.
<br />
<br />Would the two cosmic branes never have collided, and the big bang  
<br />
never occurred, the Rieman hypothesis would still be atemporally and  
<br />
aspatially true or false.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Get the feeling you have change your mind on AR. You believe that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; proposition like the statement that there is no biggest prime number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; has something to do with physics. In which physical theory you prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that statement, and how?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Its truth is not  a physical truth. The existence or non-existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; asserted is not any kind of real existence
</em><br />
<br />OK, in your theory &quot;real existence&quot; = &quot;physical existence&quot;. But if the  
<br />
UDA is valid it would be better to write &quot;consensual reality&quot; =  
<br />
&quot;physical reality&quot;, and ontic or basic 3- existence = arithmetical  
<br />
existence, or to abandon CTM. If UDA is non valid, it would be nice to  
<br />
point where is the error. You said that the error is in step 0,  
<br />
because I would have pretended something like &quot;the number seven  
<br />
actually exists&quot;. My answer is that I don't see where I say so. I just  
<br />
say that the number seven exists, in the sense used by mathematicians.  
<br />
I limit my &quot;platonism&quot; to arithmetic to avoid the problem of  
<br />
&quot;platonism&quot; in set theory or analysis, and the CTM explains why  
<br />
realism on natural numbers in both necessary and sufficient.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not denying nay truths, only the interpretation of backwards-E
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as actual existence
</em><br />
<br />I am using a fairly common notion of mathematical existence, and I  
<br />
explain that once you say yes to the doctor, the notion of physical  
<br />
existence has to be reduced to that common notion of mathematical  
<br />
existence (actually a tiny part of arithmetical existence).
<br />
<br />Up to now, the only things you criticize in the UD reasoning are  
<br />
things *you* are introducing, and when I remark to you that it is not  
<br />
there, you say, it is implicit, but fail to show me where those  
<br />
implicit statement have been used. Then you change the meaning of  
<br />
&quot;platonism&quot; at every post. You define a criterium of &quot;real&quot; (RITSIAR)  
<br />
without ever saying if the &quot;I&quot; is the third person body (which we can  
<br />
doubt the existence) or the first person consciousness (which we  
<br />
cannot doubt, but can't communicate).  You said that the difference is  
<br />
epistemological, but that does not answer the question.
<br />
You said once that you accept mathematical truth, and then that the  
<br />
number seven does not exist AT ALL.
<br />
You compare mathematical object with fictional character in fairy  
<br />
tales! Do you really think that an arithmetician could write &quot;Once  
<br />
upon a time there was an odd number dreaming  becoming an even  
<br />
number ...&quot;.
<br />
<br />It would help much more if you were able to say &quot;I don't understand  
<br />
this or that in the reasoning, and give explicit reference to the  
<br />
paper or posts&quot;.
<br />
<br />I would be pleased if you could stop to attribute me more than I make  
<br />
explicit. Comp is perhaps just a more precise and much more weak  
<br />
assumption than usual CTM theory which usually put the comp level very  
<br />
high. Comp is a weak precise form of CTM. And yes, I do believe that 02  
<br />
+ 2 = 4, and that 07 is prime.
