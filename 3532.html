<br />Thanks for taking the time to write the questions. I hope this response
<br />
helps.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why should you care more or less about slow to compute universes?
</em><br />
<br />I don't see any reason to care more or less about slow to compute
<br />
universes, so I care about them as much as fast to compute universes. But
<br />
in general it's an arbitrary subjective choice. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What kinds of considerations would influence your decision to care about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such universes?
</em><br />
<br />For example, you might be living inside a simulation and also in a &quot;real&quot; 
<br />
world (for whatever definition of real), and you can decide that you don't
<br />
care about what happens in simulations as much as in &quot;real&quot; universes. 
<br />
But you don't need a rational justification for it, in the same way that
<br />
you don't need a rational justification for preferring, say, abstract art
<br />
to representational art. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Isn't it an empirical question which prior obtains (speed vs universal)?
</em><br />
<br />No, I argue it's not, it's a matter of preference. Note that Jurgen
<br />
Schmidhuber also argues that it's not, but I think his position is that
<br />
it's a matter of logical necessity. (Have you read his TOESV2 paper yet,
<br />
BTW?) Note that in both of our approaches you'd do the same things if you
<br />
adopt the same prior.  But our justifications/interpretations are
<br />
different.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You want to maximize your gains, so you try to figure out from reason
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and observation which prior is true.  For example you could build a small
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum computer and see if worked.  If not that would suggest that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speed prior is true, if it does work that suggests the universal prior
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is true.
</em><br />
<br />Let's see how this would work in my approach. If you adopt the speed
<br />
prior, then you care about the fast-to-compute universes so little that
<br />
you wouldn't even bother building a small quantum computer as an
<br />
experiment. Even if you observed someone else's quantum computer working,
<br />
you'd continue to act as if quantum computing was impossible because you
<br />
care more about the universes where that experience was the result of a
<br />
hallucination. 
<br />
<br />In Schmidhuber's approach, you'd think that the probability you being in a
<br />
universe where the quantum computer would work is so small that it's not
<br />
worth trying. If you observed someone else's quantum computer working,
<br />
you'd think that it happened because you hallucinated. 
<br />
<br />(BTW, Jurgen, if I'm misinterpreting please let me know.)
<br />
<br />Now suppose you adopt the universal prior instead, and assume that the
<br />
measure of the fast-to-compute universes is now small but significant
<br />
compared to the slow-to-compute universes.  In my approach, you'd do an
<br />
quantum computing experiment in order to choose different actions in
<br />
different universes.  (I.e. so you don't have to make the same decision in
<br />
both kinds of universes, but can condition your decision based on which
<br />
kind of universe you're in.) If you observe the quantum computer not
<br />
working, you'd think that you can no longer affect the slow-to-compute
<br />
universes, and therefore do not have to consider them any more in making
<br />
your decisions. (But you know that versions of you in other universes have
<br />
observed the quantum computer working, and that they can stop considering
<br />
the fast-to-compute universes.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose you observe that quantum computers don't work.  What does that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean in your formulation?  Does it mean that you have decided to care
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about a certain kind of universe?  Why should this fact change what you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; care about?
</em><br />
<br />No it doesn't change what you care about, it only changes what universes
<br />
you can affect, and by extension which ones you can no longer
<br />
affect and don't have to worry about anymore. So the point of making
<br />
observations (and remembering them) is to minimize the measure of
<br />
universes you will affect and have to consider when you choose a course of
<br />
action.
