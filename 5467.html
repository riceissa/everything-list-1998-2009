<br />Not yet. We know that the bizarre, inconsistent worlds must exist if the 
<br />
Platonia idea is correct, but we (or at least I) don't currently know how 
<br />
likely they are. In Platonia, there are X number of possible-next-states 
<br />
from my current state. (For simplicity's sake, lets even say that X is a 
<br />
very very large finite number.) If a vast majority of these states show me 
<br />
sitting in my chair typing, with my computer not turning into a kangaroo, 
<br />
etc., then no, the fact that my world so far has not been bizarre and 
<br />
inconsistent does *not* cast doubt on the validity of the Platonia theory. 
<br />
In fact, if we can show logically, mathematically, or computationally (for 
<br />
me these are all ultimately the same thing) that a vast majority of my 
<br />
next-possible-states do in fact show me sitting in my chair typing, with 
<br />
very few computers turning into kangaroos, this would be an extremely 
<br />
strong reason to believe that the Platonia theory is correct, because it's 
<br />
survived a rather stringent falsification test.
<br />
<br />Note that the tests we need to perform - tests like &quot;how many of my next 
<br />
possible states show me still sitting in my chair? How many of my next 
<br />
possible states show my computer turning into a kangaroo?&quot; - are logical / 
<br />
mathematical / computational ones, not empirical ones. We already have the 
<br />
empirical data, which we call &quot;the laws of physics&quot;. We need to know what 
<br />
the Platonia theory actually predicts, and compare it to the empirical 
<br />
data. For my part, I don't actually know what the Platonia theory predicts, 
<br />
because I have no idea how to go about addressing the question 
<br />
mathematically. Bruno Marchal says we need to create a better model of what 
<br />
counts as a platonistic observer, and &quot;interview it&quot; about its relative 
<br />
consistent extensions (what I've been calling &quot;next-possible-states&quot;), and 
<br />
find out what regularities it would see. To me, that's just another 
<br />
statement of the problem. I don't have a very good model of what counts as 
<br />
a platonistic observer, and I don't know how to determine the structure of 
<br />
its next-possible-states, etc.
<br />
<br />If we make progress on this issue, and we come to the mathematical 
<br />
conclusion that the probabilities we're looking for *don't* exist in 
<br />
Platonia - that is, if we determine that (say) my next-possible-states in 
<br />
which my computer turns into a kangaroo are just as common as those in 
<br />
which it remains a computer - then I think that that does cast doubt on the 
<br />
validity of the Platonia theory.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;For your vacation, you buy a ticket that allows you to be destructively 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scanned and teleported to one thousand fabulous destinations around the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;solar system. The machine also sends a copy of you to a receiving station 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;next door, on Earth (it's the rules). You enter the sending station, press 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the red button, and a second later find yourself in slightly altered 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;surroundings. When you get out of the machine, you realise that you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;still on Earth. Disappointed, you buy another ticket on the spot and go 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;through the same procedure again, hoping for a better result. Again, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;however, you walk out and see that you are still on Earth. This time, you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are angry. The probability that you finish up the stay-home copy twice is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;less than one in one million! You suspect on this basis that the company 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;running the teleporter has cheated you, and did not send copies to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;holiday destinations at all.
</em><br />
<br />Your vacation-company thought-experiment brings up interesting issues about 
<br />
falsifiability. If I buy two tickets in a row, and I reappear on Earth both 
<br />
times, I'm tempted to suspect that I've been cheated. On the other hand, I 
<br />
know that the chances were 100% that this was going to happen to *some* 
<br />
copy. So maybe I'm just that unlucky copy? Unfortunately, if you continue 
<br />
to think in this way, you give up the idea of falsifiability completely. No 
<br />
matter how many times you buy a ticket and reappear on Earth, you can 
<br />
always argue that the chances were 100% that this would happen to some 
<br />
copy. No amount of empirical data can ever convince you that the company is 
<br />
cheating you. This is fine if you have some independent reason for trusting 
<br />
the company with 100% confidence, but without such an independent reason, 
<br />
you should suspect foul-play.
