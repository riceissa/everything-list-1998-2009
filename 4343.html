<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer is that it cannot be factorized because the number is prime I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guess there'd be no fast way to check if that answer is correct.
</em><br />
<br />Factoring is not known to be in NP (the so-called &quot;NP-complete&quot; class 
<br />
of problems...solve on in P time and you've solved them all!).
<br />
<br />The example I favor is the Hamiltonian cycle/circuit problem: find a 
<br />
path through a set of linked nodes (cities) which passes through each 
<br />
node once and only once. All of the known solutions to an arbitrary 
<br />
Hamiltonian cycle problem are exponential in time (in number of nodes). 
<br />
For example, for 5 cities there are at most 120 possible paths, so this 
<br />
is an easy one. But for 50 cities there are as many as 49!/2 possible 
<br />
paths (how many, exactly, depends on the links between the cities, with 
<br />
not every city having all possible links to other cities). For a mere 
<br />
100 cities, the number of routes to consider is larger than the number 
<br />
of particles we believe to be in the universe.
<br />
<br />However, saying &quot;known solutions&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;we have 
<br />
proved that it takes exponential time.&quot; For all we know, now, in 2002, 
<br />
there are solutions not requiring exponential time (in # of cities).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is also somewhat relevant to &quot;theories of everything&quot; since we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might want to ask if somewhere in the set of &quot;all possible universes&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there exists one where time travel is possible and computing power 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increases without bound. If the answer is yes, that might suggest that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any TOE based on &quot;all possible computations&quot; is too small to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accomodate a really general notion of all possible universes.
</em><br />
<br />And this general line of reasoning leads to a Many Worlds Version of 
<br />
the Fermi Paradox: Why aren't they here?
<br />
<br />The reason I lean toward the &quot;shut up and calculate&quot; or &quot;for all 
<br />
practical purposes&quot; interpretation of quantum mechanics is embodied in 
<br />
the above argument.
<br />
<br />IF the MWI universe branchings are at all communicatable-with, that is, 
<br />
at least _some_ of those universes would have very, very large amounts 
<br />
of power, computer power, numbers of people, etc. And some of them, if 
<br />
it were possible, would have communicated with us, colonized us, 
<br />
visited us, etc.
<br />
<br />This is a variant of the Fermi Paradox raised to a very high power.
<br />
<br />My conclusion is that the worlds of the MWI are not much different from 
<br />
Lewis' &quot;worlds with unicorns&quot;--possibly extant, but unreachable, and 
<br />
hence, operationally, no different from a single universe model.
<br />
<br />(I don't believe, necessarily, in certain forms of the Copenhagen 
<br />
Interpretation, especially anything about signals propagating 
<br />
instantaneously, just the &quot;quantum mechanics is about measurables&quot; 
<br />
ground truth of what we see, what has never failed us, what the 
<br />
mathematics tells us and what is experimentally verified. Whether there 
<br />
&quot;really are&quot; (in the modal realism sense of Lewis) other worlds is 
<br />
neither here nor there. Naturally, I would be thrilled to see evidence, 
<br />
or to conclude myself from deeper principles, that other worlds have 
<br />
more than linguistic existence.)
