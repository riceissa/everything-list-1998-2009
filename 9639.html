Hal, thanks for explaining!
<br />
<br />I think that your approach makes a lot of sense. Applying this to copying
<br />
experiments, the probability of finding yourself to be the digital copy is:
<br />
<br />m1/[m1 + m2]
<br />
<br />where m1 is the measure of the mental experience corresponding to knowing
<br />
that you are the digital copy and m2 the measure of the mental experience
<br />
corresponding to knowing that you are still in biological form. I think that
<br />
for practical implementations m1 = m2 because the digital implementation
<br />
will just simulate the brain, so the complexity of the translation program
<br />
would be practically the same.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't understand why you consider the measures of the programs that do
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simulations. The ''real'' measure should be derived from the algorithmic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; complexity of the laws of physics that describe how the computers/brains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; work. If you know for certain that a computation will be performed in
</em><br />
this
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universe, then it doesn't matter how it is performed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think what you're saying here is that if a mental state is instantiated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by a given universe, the contribution to its measure should just be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the measure of the universe that instantiates it.  And that universe's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure is based on the complexity of its laws of physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I used to hold this view, but I eventually abandoned it because of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of problems.  I need to go back and collect the old messages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and discussions that we have had and put them into some kind of order.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I can mention a couple of issues.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One problem is the one I just wrote about in my reply to Russell, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fuzziness of the concept of implementation.  In at least some universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we may face a gray area in deciding whether a particular computation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or more specifically a particular mental state, is being instantiated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Philosophers like Hans Moravec apparently really believe that every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system instantiates virtually every mental state!  If you look at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right subset of the atomic vibrations inside a chunk of rock, you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; come up with a pattern that is identical to the pattern of firing of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neurons in your own brain.  Now, most philosophers reject this, they come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up with various technical criteria that implementations have to satisfy,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but as I wrote to Russell I don't think any of these work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The other problem arises from fuzziness in what counts as a &quot;universe&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is that you can write very simple programs which will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; create your mental state.  For example, the Universal Dovetailer does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just that.  But the UD program is much smaller than what our universe's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical laws probably would be.  Does the measure of the UD &quot;count&quot; as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contribution to every mind it creates?  If so, then it will dominate over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the contributions from more conventional universes; and further, since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the UD generates all minds, it means that all minds have equal measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To reject the UD as a cheating non-universe means that we will need a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bunch of ad hoc rules about what counts as a universe and what does not,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which are fundamentally arbitrary and unconvincing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then there are all those bothersome disputes which arise in this model,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such as whether multiple instantiations should add more measure than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just one; or whether a given brain in a small universe should get more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure than the same brain in a big universe (since it uses a higher
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proportion of the universe's resources in the first case).  All these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issues, as well as the ones above, are addressed and answered in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current framework, which is far simpler (the measure of a mental state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is just its Kolmogorov measure - end of story).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The algorithmic complexity of the program needed to simulate a brain
</em><br />
refers
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to a ''personal universe''. You can think of the brain as a machine that
</em><br />
is
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simulating a virtual world in which the qualia we experience exist. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; world also exists independent of our brain in a universe of its own.
</em><br />
This
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; world has a very small measure defined by the very large algorithmic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; complexity of the program needed to specify the brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with this, I think.  The program needed to specify a mental state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a priori would be far larger than the program needed to specify the laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of physics which could cause that mental state to evolve &quot;naturally&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Both programs make a contribution to the measure of the mental state,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but the second one's contribution is enormously greater.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The key point, due to Wei Dai, is that you can mathematically treat the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two on an equal footing.  As you have described it, we have a virtual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world with qualia being created by a brain; and you have that same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world existing independently as a universe of its own.  Those are pretty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different in a Schmidhuber type model.  The second case is the output of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one of the universe programs (a very very complex one).  The first case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a rather intangible property of a universe program much like our own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To unify them we ask the question of how we can output a representation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of that virtual world with qualia, using the shortest possible program.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming that there actually is a universe which naturally evolves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a brain experiencing this mental state, we can do it with a two-part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program: the first which creates and evolves the universe, and the second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which analyzes the output of that universe to output the virtual world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representation we seek.  This second part basically translates the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity, part of the universe created by the first part, into whatever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reprsentation we have chosen for the virtual world and qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given that the universe created by the first part does evolve the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain states needed as input for the second part, the second part can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a relatively simple translation from physical to mental states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore we can create a short program which outputs the virtual world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and qualia in all its glory, and this short, two-part program will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the main contribution to the measure of that mental experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Keep in mind that in this framework, we do not start with this two-part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure.  The starting point is much simpler: all we want to know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is, what is the Kolmogorov complexity of a mental experience?  It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only once we begin analyzing the problem that we note as you did that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; building that mental experience as a universe of its own would require
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an enormously large program.  And then we realize that we can make a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much smaller program - with exactly the same output! - that has the two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; part structure I described here.  We deduce that such a program is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is actually responsible for the measure of the experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And from this we conclude that the contribution of a universe to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure of a conscious experience is not the universe's measure itself,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but that measure reduced by the measure of the program which outputs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that conscious experience given the universe data as input.  This then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads to the principle that a big brain in a small universe gets more of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that universe's measure; that multiple instantiations of a consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within a universe mean more measure; and that fuzziness of the concept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of an instantiation is no problem because it only affects the size of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the numbers being multiplied together to get the measure contribution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for the question above about the Universal Dovetailer universe, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; easily solved in this framework.  The output of the UD is of essentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no help in producing the mental state in question, because the ouput is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so enormous and we would have no idea where to look.  Hence the UD does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not make a dominant contribution to mental state measure and we avoid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the paradox without any need for ad hoc rules.
