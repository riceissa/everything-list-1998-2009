Hi Kim, Marty, Johnathan, John, Mirek, and all...
<br />
<br /><br />We were studying a bit of elementary set theory to prepare ourself to  
<br />
Cantor's theorem, and then Kleene's theorem, which are keys to a good  
<br />
understanding of the universal numbers, and to Church thesis, which  
<br />
are the keys of the seven steps.
<br />
I intend to bring you to the comp enlightenment :)
<br />
<br />But first some revision. Read the following with attention!
<br />
<br />A set is a collection of things, which in general can themselves be  
<br />
anything. Its use consists in making a many into a one.
<br />
If something, say x,  belongs to a set S, it is usually called  
<br />
&quot;element&quot; of S. We abbreviate this by (x \belongs-to S).
<br />
<br />Example:
<br />
<br />A = {1, 2, 56}. A is a set with three elements which are the numbers  
<br />
1, 02 and 56.
<br />
<br />We write:
<br />
<br />(1 \belongs-to {1, 2, 56}), or (1 \belongs-to A), or simply 01 \belongs- 
<br />
to A, when no confusions exist. The parentheses &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot; are just  
<br />
delimiters for easing the reading. I write \belongs-to the relation  
<br />
&quot;belongs to&quot; to remind it is a mathematical symbol.
<br />
<br />B = {Kim, Marty, Russell, Bruno, George, Jurgen} is  a set with 05  
<br />
elements which are supposed to be humans.
<br />
<br />C = {34, 54, Paul, {3, 4}}
<br />
<br />For this one, you may be in need of spectacles. In case of doubt, you  
<br />
can expand it a little bit:
<br />
<br />C = {    34,     54,    Paul,   {3, 4}     }
<br />
<br />You see that C is a sort of hybrid set which has 04 elements:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the number 34
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the number 54
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the human person Paul
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the set {3, 4}
<br />
<br />Two key remarks:
<br />
1) the number 03 is NOT an element of C. Nor is the number 4 an element  
<br />
of C. 3 and 4 are elements of {3, 4}, which is an element of C. But,  
<br />
generally, elements of elements are not elements! It could happen that  
<br />
element of element are element, like in D = {3, 4, {3, 4}}, the number  
<br />
3 is both an element of D and element of an element of D ({3, 4}), but  
<br />
this is a special circumstance due to the way D is defined.
<br />
2) How do I know that &quot;Paul&quot; is a human, and not a dog. How do I know  
<br />
that &quot;Paul&quot; does not refer just to the string &quot;paul&quot;. Obvioulsy the  
<br />
expression &quot;paul&quot; is ambiguous, and will usually be understood only in  
<br />
some context. This will not been a problem because the context will be  
<br />
clear. Actually we will consider only set of numbers, or set of  
<br />
mathematical objects which have already been defined. Here I have use  
<br />
the person Paul just to remind that typically set can have as elements  
<br />
any object you can conceive.
<br />
<br />What is the set of even prime number strictly bigger than 2. Well, to  
<br />
solve this just recall that ALL prime numbers are odd, except 2. So  
<br />
this set is empty. The empty set { } is the set which has no elements.  
<br />
It plays the role of 00 in the world of sets.
<br />
<br /><br />We have seen some operations defined on sets.
<br />
<br />We have seen INTERSECTION, and UNION.
<br />
<br />The intersection of the two sets S1 = {1, 2, 3} and S2 = {2, 3, 7, 8}  
<br />
will be written (S1 \inter S2), and is equal to the set of elements  
<br />
which belongs to both S1 and S2. We have
<br />
<br />(S1 \inter S2) = {2, 3}
<br />
<br />We can define (S1 \inter S2) = {x such-that ((x belongs-to S1) and (x  
<br />
belongs-to S2))}
<br />
<br />2 belongs to (S1 \inter S2) because ((2 belongs-to S1) and (2 belongs- 
<br />
to S2))
<br />
8 does not belongs to (S1 \inter S2) because it is false that ((2  
<br />
belongs-to S1) and (2 belongs-to S2)). Indeed 08 does not belong to S1.
<br />
<br />Of course some sets can be disjoint, that is, can have an empty  
<br />
intersection:
<br />
<br />{1, 2, 3} \inter {4, 5, 6} = { }.
<br />
<br />Similarly we can define (S1 \union S2) by the set of the elements  
<br />
belonging to S1 or belonging to S2:
<br />
<br />(S1 \union S2) = {x such-that ((x belongs-to S1) or (x belongs-to S2))}
<br />
<br />We have, with S1 and S2 the same as above (S1 = {1, 2, 3} and S2 = {2,  
<br />
3, 7, 8}):
<br />
<br />(S1 \union S2) = {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}.
<br />
<br />OK. I suggest you reread the preceding post, and let me know in case  
<br />
you have a problem.
<br />
<br /><br />We have seen also a key relation defined on sets: the relation of  
<br />
inclusion.
<br />
<br />We say that (A \included-in B) is true when all elements of A are also  
<br />
elements of B.
<br />
<br />Example:
<br />
The set of ferocious dogs is included in the set of ferocious animals.
<br />
The set of even numbers is included in the set of natural numbers.
<br />
The set {2, 6, 8} is included in the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
<br />
The set {2, 6, 8} is NOT included in the set  {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}.
<br />
<br />When a set A is included in a set B, A is called a subset of B.
<br />
<br />We were interested in looking to all subsets of a some set.
<br />
<br />What are the subsets of {a, b} ?
<br />
<br />They are { }, {a}, {b}, {a, b}. Why?
<br />
<br />{a, b} is included in {a, b}. This is obvious. All elements of {a,b}  
<br />
are elements of {a, b}.
<br />
{a} is included in {a, b}, because all elements of {a} are elements of  
<br />
{a, b}
<br />
The same for {b}.
<br />
You see that to verify that a set with n elements is a subset of some  
<br />
set, you have to make n verifications.
<br />
So, to see that the empty set is a subset of some set, you have to  
<br />
verify 0 things. So the empty set is a subset of any set.
<br />
<br />proposition: { } is included-in any set.
<br />
<br />So the subsets of {a, b} are { }, {a}, {b}, {a, b}.
<br />
<br />But set have been invented to make a ONE from a MANY, and it is  
<br />
natural to consider THE set of all subsets of a set. It is called the  
<br />
powerset of that set.
<br />
<br />So the powerset of {a, b} is THE set {{ }, {a}, {b}, {a, b}}. OK?
<br />
<br />Train yourself on the following exercises:
<br />
<br />What is the powerset of { }
<br />
What is the powerset of {a}
<br />
What is the powerset of {a, b, c}
<br />
<br />Any question?
<br />
<br />This was a bit of revision, to let Kim catch up.
<br />
<br />The sequel will appear asap. Be sure everything is OK, and please, ask  
<br />
question if it is not.
<br />
You can also ask any question on the first sixth steps of UDA ('course).
<br />
<br />Bruno
