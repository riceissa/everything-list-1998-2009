<em class="quotelev1">&gt;says, you cannot have a 1^ point of view on it  so saying someone died is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;merely the statement that you have lost  them irrevocably
</em><br />
<br />Yes, death happens, but it only happens to other people. A first person 
<br />
experience of death is no first person experience at all.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Every time you come to a point where you might die, something will  happen 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to save you. When you get really old, perhaps some anti- ageing treatment, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;or mind uploading is introduced just in time. Of  course, there is no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;guarantee that you will continue living in full  physical and mental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;vigour: you might just slowly deteriorate over  time so that you end up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;spending centuries in a near-vegetative state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sounds like the most fun you can have ;) But people who have already  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;died&quot; (of natural causes) have *only* ever experienced near- vegetative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conditions - in this universe surely, since we have not  yet Nick 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bostrom-ed ourselves into posthumans capable of mind- uploading. Unless 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;posthumans capable of time travel who *have*  invented Jupiter brains etc. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can pluck us into their era
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure what you mean here. People who have &quot;already died&quot; have only 
<br />
died from someone else's point of view, given that the multiverse 
<br />
necessitates that there will always be branches in which they *don't* die, 
<br />
and they can only experience one of these branches.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The question then arises, how close to a vegetable do you have to  be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;before you can be pronounced dead for the purposes of QTI?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How close to a vegetable would you want to be and still be alive???  If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;true, it might therefore be a curse, a Hell that we all suffer  eventually. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Maybe the Church got it right after all in the middle  ages......only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;joking! Hell was cancelled by the church a while back.  Funny thing is - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;heaven's still there. I thought you couldn't have  the one without the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other...but I digress
</em><br />
<br />Yes, unfortunately the QTI does *not* necessarily lead to a life of eternal 
<br />
fun and happiness. If you fall from a great height, you will survive, but 
<br />
the multiverse will not arrange matters so that you aren't paralysed. The 
<br />
same goes for developing dementia as you get older.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The problem of gradually fading away can be illustrated by another  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;example. Suppose your body is destructively scanned and then  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;reconstituted in two separate locations, a1 and a2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Happened to me on New Years Eve after several drinks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;At a1, the reconstitution goes as intended, but at a2 something  goes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;wrong and you are reconstituted in a brain dead state. I think  we can say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in this case that you can expect to find yourself alive  at a1 with 100% 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;certainty a moment after you undergo the scanning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Yes Doctor&quot; :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Next, suppose that after the destructive scanning your body is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;reconstituted in 10 different locations, b1 to b10. As before, at  b1 the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;reconstitution is perfect and at b10 something goes wrong  and you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;reconstituted in a brain dead state. At locations b2 to  b9, however, due 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to varying degrees of malfunction in the  machinery, you are reconstituted 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;with varying degrees of dementia:  at b2 you are just a little bit more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;vague than usual, at b9 you  are still alive but have lost all your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;memories and sense of  identity, and in between are several variations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;with partial  dementia. The question now is, when you undergo the scanning 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  process, should you have an equal expectation of ending up at each  of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the locations b1 to b10? If you exclude b10 because you are dead  there, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;should you not also exclude b9, where you are no longer a  sentient being, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;let alone a particular sentient being? And does it  follow from these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;considerations that you are are somehow more  likely to find yourself at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;b2 than b8, for example?
</em><br />
<br />I should point out that I don't know the answers to the above questions. Can 
<br />
anybody make any suggestions?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  OK - so transferring this set of increasingly demented versions of  me to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a multiverse framework where they are all existing in parallel,  you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;saying that - as I age - I can expect a gradual fadeout to a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;near-vegetative twilight state due to the odds favoring my ending up  in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the highest achievable state of normality each time? This to me  highlights 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my question then - wouldn't I be better off doing a James  Dean or an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Elvis; living fast, &quot;dying&quot; young and keeping up my  probability measure of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ending up in universes where I am similarly  constituted with all my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;faculties intact? Like this I would expect to  take advantage of the system 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and be a Cassanova or a Lothario for  eternity. That's what I call 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;continuity&quot;!
</em><br />
<br />But remember where Don Giovanni finished up...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Not entirely tongue-in-cheek I hope
</em><br />
<br />Your question does actually suggest a method you could use to boost your 
<br />
chances of surviving with most of your faculties intact: suicide using a 
<br />
method which is very, very likely to kill you outright. This is the idea 
<br />
discussed in Johnathon Corgan's Tookie execution thread recently. If you 
<br />
find yourself in a situation where all the mundane ways you might escape 
<br />
death (eg. last moment clemency from the Governor, the IV drip tissues and 
<br />
the toxin extravasates, etc.) become extremely improbable, you are left with 
<br />
the more fantastic means of survival, such as finding yourself living as an 
<br />
upload on a far future computer network. (And I imagine that there wouldn't 
<br />
be much point building and living in such a network if its citizens couldn't 
<br />
switch on the Orgasmic Bliss function for a few thousand years at a time if 
<br />
they felt like it). Having said this, I can't really think of any method of 
<br />
killing yourself that would not be thwarted by mundane events in preference 
<br />
to the fantastic scenarios.
