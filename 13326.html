<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to 'stratify' into different levels.  Now let me elaborate a little.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reality are completely *reducible* to the lower level descriptions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reality?  (See for instance 'Non-reductive physicalism').  The idea

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; here is that 'the higher level' dsecriptions come about because of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; coarse graining and that there are features of these higher level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; descriptions that are not completely reducible to the lower level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; descriptions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've looked up &quot;non-reductive physicalism&quot; and it still seems to me an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oxymoron. Could a person's mental state be different even though his

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical state is unchanged? If so, then this implies that there is at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in part some non-physical process giving rise to consciousness. It may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the case, but it isn't physicalism.

</em><br />
<br />Non-reductive materialism *doesn't* say that a person's person state
<br />
could be different even though his physical state is unchanged.  If it
<br />
did, you are right, it wouldn't be materialism.  In all forms of
<br />
materialism, the person's mental state has to be completely fixed by
<br />
the physical state.
<br />
<br />What non-reductive materialism *does* say is that high-level
<br />
properties of a complex system are not completely reducible to
<br />
descriptions in terms of lower level properties.  That is, there exist
<br />
real (objective) high-level properties of a system which cannot be
<br />
replaced by low-level descriptions.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately reductionism appears to *the* modern day dogma of
<br />
science and it seems to be near impossible to get through to anyone in
<br />
the grip of this dogma. 'Eliminative materialism' is all the rage
<br />
these days aka Daniel Dennett and co who think that consciousness is
<br />
'just a fiction' (even though Dennett uses these same-said high level
<br />
cognitive processes to reason his way to his absurd conclusion).
<br />
<br />We know for sure (via the argument from indispensability) than there
<br />
exist mathematical concepts (for instance uncomputable numbers and
<br />
infinite sets) which *cannot* be identified with finite physical
<br />
processes.  Yet we see great minds desperate to try to deny the
<br />
existence of uncomputables (J.Schmidhuber on this very list just
<br />
showed up recently and tried to argue that only discrete math is
<br />
real!) - even though in fact Cantor put infinite sets on an infallible
<br />
footing long ago (and Abraham Robinson did the same for
<br />
infinitesimals).  See this link for an artilce I wrote giving a quick
<br />
demolition of the arguments against infinite sets:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://archives.betterhumans.com/Members/mjgeddes/BlogPost/4710/Default.aspx">http://archives.betterhumans.com/Members/mjgeddes/BlogPost/4710/Default.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />The bottom line is that if infinite sets are real (and they are!)
<br />
reductive materialism is false.
<br />
<br />But it doesn't stop there:  Science itself (via the notion of 'laws of
<br />
physics') uses concepts which are supposed to be *universal* in
<br />
scope.  But universals by definition cannot be empirically identified
<br />
with any finite physical concept.  Again the very use of universals
<br />
('laws of physics') actually falsifies the reductionist claims.
