<br />
I place a group of response ideas in one place for my convenience and for 
<br />
those on the list.
<br />
I have posted a lot lately.
<br />
<br />First Person:
<br />
<br />I have actually already addressed this but not very explicitly. See my 
<br />
&quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Thank you&quot; posts re: my equation is life. Each universe is an 
<br />
&quot;I&quot;. Some sub strings of a universe's Uj(i) may carry the illusion of an 
<br />
individual &quot;I&quot;. See also Tegmark, footnote # 2 - each of my universes is 
<br />
its own SAS.
<br />
<br />Nothing:
<br />
<br />My point, as I have said many times, is a logical one - you can not prove a 
<br />
postulate. In this case - if we have arrived at the correct conclusion - 
<br />
Everything exists - [or at least someone's concept of Everything] there 
<br />
must be more than one postulate that results in the same conclusion. 
<br />
Neither will have an argument that can exclude the other otherwise it 
<br />
amounts to a proof. This seems only straight forward. We could dance 
<br />
forever and not arrive at only one.
<br />
<br />I do not wish to dance this particular dance much, but:
<br />
<br />Someone would have to show me the cause of &quot;Nothing&quot;.
<br />
<br />It was said that &quot;ABSENCE of ANY cause leads to the Plenitude.&quot; Am I to 
<br />
understand that &quot;ABSENCE of ANY cause...&quot; is the postulate. I think not 
<br />
since as far as I can tell it has a dual belonging. It is a property of 
<br />
both postulates.
<br />
<br />Further someone would have to show me that within its own context &quot;Nothing&quot; 
<br />
is not &quot;all states&quot;.
<br />
<br />Machine:
<br />
<br />These universes of mine MUST spontaneously mutate. If that is a machine 
<br />
then the connotation &quot;machine&quot; to me carries no distinction from 
<br />
&quot;Everything&quot; so I see it as pointless to clutter things up with it.
<br />
<br />Deterministic vs non deterministic:
<br />
<br />Please note that my equation is piecewise computational.  Each 
<br />
computational run in Uj(i) is separated from another by non deterministic 
<br />
jumps.  In a way it unifies both views.
<br />
<br />Note:
<br />
<br />My fractal:
<br />
<br />My fractal is more than the usual description of &quot;Everything&quot; that I have 
<br />
seen. It has no selection at all up to the Hilbert/Turing limit [Which copy 
<br />
of all copies would a person select to form the usual version of the &quot;All 
<br />
strings exist.&quot; approach?],  and it is dynamic in the sense that it is 
<br />
overall not deterministic from the point of view of a particular &quot;I&quot; - a 
<br />
particular Uj(i). This &quot;I&quot; is not a selection either since there would be a 
<br />
countable infinity of identical &quot;I&quot;'s and so too for the sub string 
<br />
illusions of &quot;I&quot;.  Each string at a given &quot;i&quot; has a fixed history, but an 
<br />
uncertain future.  Each universe &quot;j&quot; has no interaction with another.
<br />
<br />As to not going to a continuum in my fractal I do not see how that can 
<br />
satisfy Hilbert - i.e. consistency - given Turing - i.e. no proofs beyond a 
<br />
countably infinite number. In my opinion consistency has no application 
<br />
beyond Turing's limit to &quot;proof&quot;.
<br />
<br />In addition my equation is a recursion and successive steps must halt.
<br />
<br />Hal
