<br />
<br /><br />Hal,
<br />
<br />Is there a pattern to how the system responds to its own
<br />
incompleteness? You say that there is not a pattern to the traces, but
<br />
what do you mean by that?
<br />
<br />-----------
<br />
<br />That is not what I actually said.  I indicated that there were no
<br />
restrictions on the copy process.  There would be a pattern to some of the
<br />
traces.  The incompleteness of the Nothings causes them individually to
<br />
eventually become a more distinction encompassing Something.  This is a
<br />
little like cold booting a computer that has a large [infinite] hard drive
<br />
containing the All.  [a Nothing -&gt; a Something] -&gt; The BIOS chip loads the
<br />
startup program and some data into the dynamic memory and the computer
<br />
boots.  The program/data would be the first Something in a trace.  From this
<br />
point on there is no fixed nature to traces.  The program could at one
<br />
extreme generate the entire remaining trace [a series of Somethings] from
<br />
just the data already present in the computer - without reading in more from
<br />
the All - outputting each resulting computer state to the All on the hard
<br />
drive.  The All already contains these states many times over so this is
<br />
just a copy process.  At the other extreme the program could just generate
<br />
random output which states are also in the All - another copy process. There
<br />
would be all nature of traces between these two extremes. 
<br />
<br />The incompleteness I cite is just the instability question.  There may be
<br />
others.  [A trace would end if the output went into a continuous repeat of a
<br />
particular state.]
<br />
<br />Other incompleteness issues of a particular Something seem like they should
<br />
also prevent a trace from stopping.     
<br />
<br />-----------------
<br />
<br />It sounds to me like what you are describing is some version of an
<br />
inconsistent set theory that is somehow trying to repair itself.
<br />
<br />-------------
<br />
<br />In other postings I have said that the All, being absolutely complete, is
<br />
therefore inconsistent since it contains all answers to all questions [all
<br />
possible distinctions and therefore no distinction]. 
<br />
<br />----------------
<br />
<br />(Except rather then sets, which are 2-fold distinctions because a
<br />
thing can either be a member or not, you are admitting arbitrary
<br />
N-fold distinctions, including 1-fold distinctions that fail to
<br />
distinguish anything... conceptually interesting, I must admit.)
<br />
<br />--------
<br />
<br />I am not well versed in set theory or logic but I believe I understand what
<br />
you are saying.  I see this as the All contains an N-fold distinction -
<br />
itself. 
<br />
<br />-----------
<br />
<br />So the question is, what is the process by which the system attempts
<br />
to repair itself?
<br />
<br />---------------
<br />
<br />The individual traces so far are attempts by a Nothing to repair its
<br />
incompleteness.  The terminus of some traces would be the All - an
<br />
absolutely complete, and thus inconsistent divisor.
<br />
<br />You seem to be adding traces based on inconsistency which seems reasonable -
<br />
see my responses below.
<br />
<br />---------------  
<br />
<br />Here is one option:
<br />
<br />The system starts with all its axioms (a possibly infinite set). It
<br />
starts making inferences (possibly with infinitistic methods),
<br />
splitting when it runs into an inconsistency; the (possibly infinite)
<br />
split rejects facts that could have led to the inconsistency.
<br />
<br />So, the process makes increasingly consistent versions of the set
<br />
theory. Some will end up consistent eventually, and so will stop
<br />
splitting. These may be boring (having rejected most of the axioms) or
<br />
interesting. Some of the interesting ones will be UDs.
<br />
<br />----------------
<br />
<br />So far I have not tried to identify a second source of the dynamic.  I see
<br />
the Nothings as consistent because they can produce no answers but therefore
<br />
incomplete since they need to answer at least one.  Some traces starting
<br />
here evolve towards completeness. The All contains at least one inconsistent
<br />
divisor - itself.  It is interesting to consider if traces could originate
<br />
at inconsistent divisors and evolve towards consistency.    
<br />
<br />----------------
<br />
<br />The entire process may or may not amount to more than a UD, depending
<br />
on whether we use infinities in the basic setup. You did in your post,
<br />
and it seems likely, since set theory is not finitely axiomizable and
<br />
your system is an extension of set theory. On the other hand, there
<br />
would be some fairly satisfying axiomizations, in particular those
<br />
based on naive set theory. This does have an infinite number of
<br />
axioms, but in the form of an axiom schema, which can be characterized
<br />
easily by finite deduction rules. So, your system could easily be
<br />
crafted to be either a UD or more-than-UD, depending on personal
<br />
preference. (That is, if my interpretation has not strayed too far
<br />
from your intention.)
<br />
<br /><br />--Abram
<br />
<br />-----------------
<br />
<br />So far I think the inconsistency driven traces you describe may be a
<br />
possible addition to the dynamic - Thank you.  
<br />
<br />Yours
<br />
<br />Hal
