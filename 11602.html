<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As for memory being encoded in or accessible to an OM, that is an unnecessary complication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As you said previously, the OM's are related solely by their information content. If the seconds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of your life were sliced up, shuffled and thrown to the wind, (t1) 3:10:02 PM of 10/10/06 would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; still subjectively follow (t2) 3:10:01 PM of 10/10/06 even though there is no connection or &quot;flow&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of information between them. If you look at how t1 and t2 are generated, then yes, there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; connection - they both come out of your head - but once generated, they form a natural sequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which cannot be disrupted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But my point about the 'coherence' of consciousness is that it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (especially from what occurs, or fails to occur, when it deteriorates)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that complex representation and processing of *temporally extended*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information sequences (e.g. grasp of the entirety of the content and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning of a sentence or proposition) is necessary for one to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience and act as a fully-functioning conscious individual.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently, it seems to me that such processes must converge on OMs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which all the necessary information is fully encoded and expressed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which is essentially what Barbour seems to be claiming for his 'time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capsules' - e.g. his 'flight of the kingfisher' example). Without this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the alternative seems to be that the individual random, wind-blown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seconds of your metaphor would need to be totalised in some additional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-information-based manner in order to coordinate an ensemble of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; informationally incomplete, discrete elements into coherent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences. AFAICS they only 'form a natural sequence' from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quasi-objective perspective of our philosophical stance. And such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coordination is in any case what we were assuring Peter was both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unnecessary and impossible.
</em><br />
<br />We have to distinguish between what actually happens to create the moments of a stream of 
<br />
consciousness and what is the minimum logically necessary that needs to happen. My brain must 
<br />
at some subconscious level have the structure of the whole sentence spanning a 2 second interval 
<br />
t1-t2 or else the sentence could not be generated. But that's just an engineering problem: if the 
<br />
moments t1 and t2 come about with exactly the right sort of phenomenal content, magically, or 
<br />
by random processes, then I will experience a coherent 2 second span of consciousness in which I 
<br />
utter the full sentence. The only way I might not experience this is if there is something wrong with 
<br />
the actual phenomenal content of t1 and t2: if whatever vague sense I have of the whole sentence 
<br />
during t1 and t2 is missing during either or both intervals, then I would forget what I was saying. 
<br />
The vague sense of the whole sentence has two parts, in t1 and t2, just as the sentence itself has 
<br />
two parts. If we had a longer sentence through further nitervals t3, t4 and t5, it could be, for example, 
<br />
that during t4 the sense of the whole sentence is completely absent, and only in retrospect from t5 is 
<br />
it seen that t4 was part of the whole. This sort of thing happens all the time during absent-minded 
<br />
moments, and we rely on the machinery of the brain keeping track of everything to generate successive 
<br />
moments of consciousness which pull everything back into coherence.
