<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unfortunately I don't think this is true. The problem with the white

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rabbits is that there are consistent! For exemple we can dream of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; white rabbits.
</em><br />
<br />This is too simplistic.
<br />
It could be that we differ because of semantics or maybe because of confusion
<br />
with regard the frame of reference. Let's explore the issue with some thought
<br />
experiments.
<br />
<br />1) Let's consider dreams that I've had. I have dreamt many times of flying
<br />
(white rabbits? to be determined). In those dreams, I strongly believe that
<br />
flying is a natural ability that I have and I wonder why sometimes in the so
<br />
call real world I cannot fly. Everything in the dream world seems to be
<br />
consistent and I can fly. Flying, from the dream world perspective is not a
<br />
white rabbit. In fact the so called real world seems to be false and not having
<br />
the ability to fly IS a white rabbit!
<br />
<br />In the dream world,  the rule of physics seem to be different and allow flying.
<br />
My belief system appears to conform to those physical laws and I do not find any
<br />
contradiction. Flying is OK in the dream world!
<br />
<br />The resolution of the paradox is simple. The frames of reference are different.
<br />
What appears to be a white rabbit in one frame  is not in another! Now, is the
<br />
dream world frame of reference consistent? As far as I tested it it was. I did
<br />
not do much testing.
<br />
<br />2) Here is an example in which a kind of dream state Uncertainty Principle seems
<br />
to preserve consistency. I dream sometimes of seeing shapes and color ( these
<br />
are a form of phospenes produced by the brain in the dream state.) These
<br />
phospenes begin as relatively simple geometric patterns but then, as I enter
<br />
deeper into the dream state, they evolve into wonderful geometrical shapes, or
<br />
animals or people etc... They are so beautiful that I try to stop them form
<br />
changing, to be able to analyze them in detail. A soon as I attempt to focus on
<br />
them, they disappear. I can't perform any kind of consistency analysis on them.
<br />
<br />3) Here is another dream which illustrates how the discovery of an inconsistency
<br />
brings the dream to an end. I sometimes dream of out of body experiences Are
<br />
they real or not? Being a amateur physicist -even in my dreams - I want to know
<br />
if these experiences are &quot;real&quot;. So I give myself a test: to find out what is
<br />
the arrangement of certain objects in another room.  When I tried that I came up
<br />
blank. I just couldn't do it. So, in the dream, I realized that these out of
<br />
body experiences were not real and that I was dreaming. This realization,
<br />
effectively, put an end to the dream - even though I continued dreaming, I knew
<br />
it was a fake.
<br />
<br />To summarize:
<br />
White rabbits are inconsistent by definition. The issue is &quot;inconsistent with
<br />
respect which frame of reference?&quot;
<br />
If we dream of a real world white rabbit (inconsistency as seen from the real
<br />
world point of view) then it may be perfectly consistent in the dream world. If
<br />
it is consistent in the dream world, no problem. No paradox in the dream world.
<br />
No paradox in the real world..
<br />
If we dream of a dream world white rabbit (inconsistency as seen from the dream
<br />
world point of view), then we realize the dream world is a fake and we wake up.
<br />
No more dream world. No more paradox.
<br />
<br />We can resolve the white rabbit paradox if we take relativity seriously.
<br />
<br />George
