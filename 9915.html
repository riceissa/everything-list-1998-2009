<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not so sure that the standard model of personal identity with which we are familiar would be a universal standard. Imagine
</em><br />
intelligent beings evolved from hive insects which go through several radically different life stages, frequently share genetic
<br />
information with each other like bacteria, identify self and others via pheromones which can change or be transferred to other
<br />
individuals... the possibilities are endless. These beings would have an utterly alien psychology, ethics, aesthetics, and probably
<br />
also an utterly alien sense of what it means to be a person, including what it means to be the same person from one life stage to
<br />
another.
<br />
&lt;
<br />
<br />Yes, I think that that is right.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, if they were intelligent, they would come up with the same scientific truths as us, even if they thought about them very
</em><br />
differently, because such truths are in a fundamental sense observer-independent.
<br />
&lt;
<br />
<br />Right.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps we have reached a consensus of sorts (Brent and Lee, let me know if you disagree): evolution has given us brains hardwired
</em><br />
with a sense of continuity of personal identity over time for very good reasons, but it could have been otherwise,
<br />
&lt;
<br />
<br />Otherwise in the sense that if we were like insects (instead of mammals, or maybe just
<br />
large primate-like creatures), yes, we might not have this lingering notion that we
<br />
are the same people from day to day. And the sense that (I claim) young people have
<br />
that they will not be the same people when they are old.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it would not have been inconsistent with any logical or empirical fact about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world had it been otherwise.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that seems so too: though no tribe of humans (or even lions, for that matter)
<br />
would ever develop the notion of &quot;day-persons&quot; (see Mike Perry's book, Forever For
<br />
All for his independent discussion of day-persons), that is indeed a contingent
<br />
fact of evolution.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand, evolution has also given us brains which tend to believe that the Earth is flat and that there is an absolute
</em><br />
up and down in the universe, also for fairly good reasons. However, in the latter case, the received belief *is* inconsistent with
<br />
empirical facts about the world.
<br />
&lt;
<br />
<br />Only inconsistent, of course, when data became available that was not available
<br />
in the EEA (Environment of Early Adapteness).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a basic, and I think not immediately obvious, difference between beliefs about personal identity and logical or empirical
</em><br />
facts.
<br />
&lt;
<br />
<br />I would agree.
<br />
<br />Lee
