<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure that I understand what you do with that measure on programs.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I prefer to look at infinite coin generations (that is infinitely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reiterated self-duplications)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and put measure on infinite sets of alternatives. Those infinite sets of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relative alternative *are* themselves&quot; generated by simple programs (like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the UD).
</em><br />
<br />Here is how I approach it, based on Schmidhuber.  Suppose we pick a model
<br />
of computation based on a particular Universal Turing Machine (UTM).
<br />
Imagine this model being given all possible input tapes.  There are an
<br />
uncountably infinite number of such tapes, but on any given tape only
<br />
a finite length will actually be used (i.e. the probability of using
<br />
an infinite number of bits of the tape is zero).  This means that any
<br />
program which runs is only a finite size, yet occurs on an infinite
<br />
number of tapes.  The fraction of the tapes which holds a given program
<br />
is proportional to 1 over 2^(program length), if they are binary tapes.
<br />
This is considered the measure of the given program.
<br />
<br />An equivalent way to think of it is to imagine the UTM being fed with
<br />
a tape created by coin flips.  Now the probability that it will run a
<br />
given program is its measure, and again it will be proportional to 1
<br />
over 2^(program length).  I don't know whether this is what you mean
<br />
by &quot;infinite coin generations&quot; but it sounds similar.
<br />
<br />I believe you can get the same concept of measure by using the Universal
<br />
Dovetailer (UD) but I don't see it as necessary or particularly helpful
<br />
to invoke this step.  To me it seems simpler just to imagine all possible
<br />
programs being run, without having to also imagine the operating system
<br />
which runs them all on a time-sharing computer, which is what the UD
<br />
amounts to.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now we cannot know in which computational history we belong,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or more exactly we &quot;belong&quot; to an infinity of computational histories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (undistinguishable up to now). (It could be all the repetition of your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple program)
</em><br />
<br />And by &quot;repetition of your simple program&quot; I think you mean the fact
<br />
that there are an infinite number of tapes which have the same prefix
<br />
(the same starting bits) and which all therefore run the same program,
<br />
if it fits in that prefix.  This is the basic reason why shorter programs
<br />
have greater measure than longer ones, because there are a larger fraction
<br />
of the tapes which have a given short prefix than a long one.
<br />
<br />It's also possible, as you imply, that your consciousness is instantiated
<br />
in multiple completely different programs.  For example, we live in a
<br />
program which pretty straightforwardly implements the universe we see;
<br />
but we also live in a program which implements a very different universe,
<br />
in which aliens exist who run artificial life experiments, and we are
<br />
one of those experiments.  We also live in programs which just happen to
<br />
simulate moments of our consciousness, purely through random chance.
<br />
<br />However, my guess is that the great majority of our measure will lie
<br />
in just one program.  I suspect that that program will be quite simple,
<br />
and that all the other programs (such as the one with the aliens running
<br />
alife experiments) will be considerably more complex.  The simplest case
<br />
is just what we see, and that is where most of our measure comes from.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But to make an infinitely correct prediction we should average on all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational histories going through our states.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I agree, although as I say my guess is that we will be &quot;close enough&quot;
<br />
just by taking things as we see them, and in fact it may well be that
<br />
the corrections from considering &quot;bizarre&quot; computational histories will
<br />
be so tiny as to be unmeasurable in practice.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your measure could explain why simple and short subroutine persists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everywhere but what we must do is to extract the &quot;actual measure&quot;, the one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparently given by QM, from an internal measure on all relatively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent continuation of our (unknown!) probable computationnal state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is independent of the fact that some short programs could play the role of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some initiator of something persisting. Perhaps a quantum dovetailer ? But to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proceed by taking comp seriously this too should be justify from within.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Searching a measure on the computational histories instead of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programs can not only be justified by thought experiments, but can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be defined neatly mathematically. Also a &quot;modern&quot; way of talking on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Many Worlds is in term of relative consistent histories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the histories emerge from within. This too must be taken into account.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It can change the logic. (And actually changes it according to the lobian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine).
</em><br />
<br />I'm losing you here.
