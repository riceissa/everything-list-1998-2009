</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most of this paper is way over my head. I need to read the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ending much more carefully in order to understand its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusions. But I wanted to make one point which IMO is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really amazing and not often appreciated. I'm not 100%
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure that it applies to the specific model considered in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this paper, but it does apply in general. I think I got
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this idea from the Huw Price book on The Arrow of Time.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The authors use the example of a box containing a gas,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which starts in a low-entropy state with all the molecules
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a small region. Then as time moves forward the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecules spread out and we get entropy increase, allowing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for dissipating structures to form such as vortices, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the general case even life.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then the gas reaches equilibrium, and all the dissipative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states die out. All structure and order is lost, and in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense, time is no longer passing, as far as causality is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concerned. Causal time is something that only happens when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is entropy increase.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; After an extremely long interval, we may get a Poincare
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recurrence. (Actually, I'm not sure this is the right term
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for this; I think a Poincare recurrence is a more general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thermodynamic effect. But I will use the phrase here to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specifically talk about a low-entropy fluctuation out of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high-energy equilibrium state.) The gas will randomly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen to move back into a low-energy state, perhaps even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same state we started with, all the molecules in one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corner. At that point we once again get dissipation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures, the passage of time, and the possibility of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life. This cycle can and will repeat indefinitely.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The authors suggest, applying this concept to cosmology,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;In the recurrent view of cosmology the second law of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thermodynamics and the arrow of time would have an unusual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significance. In fact they are not laws at all. What is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true is that interesting events, such as life, can only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occur during the brief out-of-equilibrium periods while
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the system is returning to equilibrium.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The amazing thing is that this is wrong. Life and other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dissipating events are not restricted to the period when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the system is returning to equilibrium. Here is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surprise: these events also occur, to exactly the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extent, while the system is *departing* from equilibrium.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is, if we wait long enough for a Poincare recurrence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the kind described here, where the gas goes into a low
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entropy state and then goes through some kind of complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolution back to equilibrium, we must pay attention to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how exactly the gas goes into the low entropy state. And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given the microscopic reversibility of the system, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most likely path into the low entropy state is a mirror of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the most likely path out of it.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is, if we really assume that somehow this gas in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corner evolved life which then died out in the heat death
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the universe, then the most likely path back into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corner is to evolve life backwards. We would see the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formless void of space begin to cluster together to form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure. That structure would include the pattern of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dead life-forms. These life-forms would come to life, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they would live their lives backwards. They would grow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; young and be un-born. Each generation would be replaced by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its ancestors. Life would un-evolve back to a primordial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state, and eventually to simpler dissipative structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and chemical reactions. The whole clock of the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would continue to turn back until it reached the peak of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Poincare recurrence, the point of minimal entropy, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then it would start to run forward again.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, this does not mean that we would see exactly the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; path out of the low entropy state as in; but rather, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both paths would be governed by the same statistical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constraints. The path out of the recurrence shows constant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increases in entropy which guide its path. The path into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the recurrence shows constant decreases in entropy which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guide it in exactly the corresponding manner.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know this is pretty amazing; so amazing that I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hardly believe it myself. But it follows immediately from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the time-symmetry of the laws of physics. If Poincare
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recurrences did not occur in this way, it would mean that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics had an absolute arrow of time. We could watch a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; movie of a low-entropy state forming and then dissipating,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the two phases would look different, showing that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics is not symmetric in time.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One more point: during the entropy-decrease phase of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Poincare recurrence, what force pushes us backwards in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time? Why does entropy continue to decrease? The answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is, there is no such force. At every point during the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recurrence, it is *overwhelmingly* more likely to turn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; around and start heading towards higher entropy than to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continue towards further decreases in entropy. It is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more likely for time to continue to run backwards during
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the first half of a Poincare recurrence than it is for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time to turn around and begin running backwards today.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So how come it happens, then? It is not a physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenon, rather it is a selection effect. We choose to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pay attention only to those Poincare recurrences which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting, that is, those which go back to what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider a &quot;beginning of the universe&quot; state. Given enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time, enormous time, some recurrences will go back that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far. So if we restrict our attention to that minute subset
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of events, and we ask what path did the universe follow in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; getting to this amazing low-entropy state, then what I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have said above is true. The most likely path into the low
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entropy state runs along the same constraints as the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely path out of it. Time runs backwards into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; low-entropy state.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe it follows, then, that if we are living in such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a Poincare recurrence, it is overwhelmingly likely that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe did not really go all the way back to the Big
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bang. Rather, our past is an illusion. Time ran backwards
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far enough to form us; but among those recurrences where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we formed, the overwhelming majority of them don't have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time go back much farther than that. (My son is reading
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Price book now and says that this idea goes back to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Boltzmann, that our past is false and the universe no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; older than us, if our experience are explained by such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recurrence.)
</em><br />
<br />I had some similar thoughts on reading the paper. However,
<br />
I'm not sure you can apply the idea of Poincare' recurrence
<br />
to the universe. Poincare' recurrence applies to a closed
<br />
system.  The universe isn't really closed (at least not
<br />
unless there's a big crunch).  It is expanding and as it
<br />
expands the maximum possible entropy in a given region is
<br />
increasing, there is more and more room for disorder. 
<br />
Since the universe now appears to not only be expanding,
<br />
but expanding faster and faster, it will never come to
<br />
equilibrium - much less go back away from equilibrium.
<br />
<br />I think what the paper says is that when matter/energy have
<br />
thinned out enough so that we have essentially empty space
<br />
again, a de Sitter universe, a vacuum fluctuation can start
<br />
a new universe.  If these new universes can occur with
<br />
different cosmological constants, then some will have
<br />
values such that the universe bounces instead of the
<br />
runaway expansion we see.  The former are a far more likely
<br />
place for us to find ourselves - for reasons you've given
<br />
above.
