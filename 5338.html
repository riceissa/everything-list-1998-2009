<br />
By the way, after writing my message the other day about the question of 
<br />
what it means for the RSSA and ASSA to be compatible or incompatible, I 
<br />
thought of another condition that should be met if you want to have both an 
<br />
absolute probability distribution on observer-moments and a conditional one 
<br />
from any one observer-moment to another. Suppose I pick an observer-moment B 
<br />
from the set of all observer-moments according to the following procedure:
<br />
<br />1. First, randomly select an observer-moment A from the set of all 
<br />
observer-moments, using the absolute probability distribution.
<br />
2. Then, select a &quot;next&quot; observer-moment B to follow A from the set of all 
<br />
observer-moments, using the conditional probability distribution from A to 
<br />
all others.
<br />
<br />What will be the probability of getting a particular observer-moment for 
<br />
your B if you use this procedure? I would say that in order for the RSSA and 
<br />
ASSA to be compatible, it should always be the *same* probability as that of 
<br />
getting that particular observer-moment if you just use the absolute 
<br />
probability distribution alone. If this wasn't true, if the two probability 
<br />
distributions differed, then I don't see how you could justify using one or 
<br />
the other in the ASSA--after all, my &quot;current&quot; observer-moment is also just 
<br />
the &quot;next&quot; moment from my previous observer-moment's point of view, and a 
<br />
moment from now I will experience a different observer-moment which is the 
<br />
successor of my current one. I shouldn't get different conclusions if I look 
<br />
at a given observer-moment from different but equally valid perspectives, or 
<br />
else there is something fundamentally wrong with the theory.
<br />
<br />I think there'd be an analogy for this in statistical mechanics, in a case 
<br />
where you have a probabilistic rule for deciding the path through phase 
<br />
space...if the system is at equilibrium, then the probabilities of the 
<br />
system being in different states should not change over time, so if I find 
<br />
the probability the system will be in the state B at time t+1 by first 
<br />
finding the probability of all possible states at time t and then 
<br />
multiplying by the conditional probability of each one evolving to B at time 
<br />
t+1, then summing all these products, I should get the same answer as if I 
<br />
just looked at the probability I would find it in state B at time t. I'm not 
<br />
sure what the general conditions are that need to be met in order for an 
<br />
absolute probability distribution and a set of conditional probability 
<br />
distributions to have this property though. In the case of absolute and 
<br />
conditional probability distributions on observer-moments, hopefully this 
<br />
property would just emerge naturally once you found the correct theory of 
<br />
consciousness and wrote the equations for how the absolute and relative 
<br />
distributions must relate to one another.
<br />
<br />One final weird thought I had a while ago on this type of TOE. What if, in 
<br />
finding the correct theory of consciousness, there turned out to a sort of 
<br />
self-similarity between the way individual observer-moments work and the way 
<br />
the probability distributions on the set of all observer-moments work? In 
<br />
other words, perhaps the theory of consciousness would describe an 
<br />
individual observer-moment in terms of some set of sub-components which are 
<br />
each assigned a different absolute weight (perhaps corresponding to the 
<br />
amount of 'attention' I am giving to different elements of my current 
<br />
experience), along with weighted links between these elements (which could 
<br />
correspond to the percieved relationships between these different elements, 
<br />
like in a neural net). This kind of self-similarity might justify a sort of 
<br />
pantheist interpretation of the theory, or an &quot;absolute idealist&quot; one maybe, 
<br />
in which the multiverse as a whole could be seen as a kind of infinite 
<br />
observer-moment, the only possible self-consistent one (assuming the 
<br />
absolute and conditional probability distributions constrain each other in 
<br />
such a way as to lead to a unique solution, as I suggested earlier). Of 
<br />
course there's no reason to think a theory of consciousness will necessarily 
<br />
describe observer-moments in this way, but it doesn't seem completely 
<br />
implausible that it would, so it's interesting to think about.
<br />
<br />Jesse
