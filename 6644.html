<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are some things that can be known by examination of an object, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are other things that can only be known by being the object.
</em><br />
<br />Okay; but some examples are probably necessary. (1) Only Mozart can
<br />
know what it's like for the Mozart auditory system to hear C-sharp
<br />
on a harpsichord. (2) only a human being can know the feeling that
<br />
a human has at the loss of a family member.
<br />
<br />(Those are the best I could do; can anybody come up with better ones?)
<br />
<br />Note that my first example had this same peculiar linguistic structure
<br />
of &quot;what-it-is-like-to-be&quot;. Not necessarily an indictment; but
<br />
something to notice. As for my second example: are feelings knowledge?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When the object is a human brain, this latter class of things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is consciousness. (When the object is something else, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; latter class of thing is... well, how would I know?)
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that the distinction between these two types of knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is surprising, and I would never have noticed it had I not been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious myself.
</em><br />
<br />As you write (below), it's possibly debatable whether this
<br />
really is *knowledge*. Certainly it does not resemble the
<br />
usual kind of knowledge that is communicated from one person
<br />
to another. But here is my analysis of what knowledge is:
<br />
<br />Knowledge is an internal map of something usually outside
<br />
of the skin. But then, a gunshot patient may also obtain
<br />
knowledge provided by his doctors of the exact location of
<br />
a bullet in his brain. Still, this is *knowledge* of what
<br />
conditions obtain in the physical world, encoded into a
<br />
yet different area of the patient's brain.
<br />
<br />Are there other examples of knowledge?  This is important
<br />
because, of course, one may be pressed to make the case
<br />
for consciousness *itself* to provide special knowledge
<br />
(of the non-communicable variety).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The response of those who think that consciousness is nothing special to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above is that it is not surprising that there is a difference between a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description of an object and the object itself, and that what I have called 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;knowledge&quot; in reference to conscious experiences is not really knowledge, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but part of the package that comes with being a thing. I can't really argue 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against this; as I said, it is just a different way of looking at the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; facts.
</em><br />
<br />Good. You anticipated my question. But your answer is oddly
<br />
interesting in a certain way: I would never have conflated this
<br />
question about &quot;what is knowledge&quot; with the difference between
<br />
&quot;the description of an object&quot; and &quot;the object itself&quot;. Yet, it's
<br />
true: they are both examples of &quot;the map&quot; versus &quot;the territory&quot;.
<br />
Interesting.
<br />
<br />I wonder if this knower/known distinction can help even further.
<br />
After all, I might claim that in all the cases of this suspicious
<br />
different kind of &quot;knowledge&quot;, it's as if those who see &quot;the problem&quot;
<br />
are trying to establish this difference between the knower and
<br />
the known in a case in which there isn't any actual difference.
<br />
<br />In fact, the whole erection of the notion of *qualia* seems now
<br />
to me to be an effort to impose the knower/known dichotomy where
<br />
it doesn't apply. Hence the peculiar English language construction
<br />
of &quot;what it is like to be a...&quot;.
<br />
<br />(A good test to apply to doubtful cases where there may simply
<br />
be a semantic problem is to demand restatement using other terms.
<br />
For example, I am highly critical of the word &quot;rights&quot; used in
<br />
the abstract, such as &quot;what gives X the right to do A?&quot;. So I
<br />
challenge people to try to say the same thing without using
<br />
the word &quot;right&quot;. As near as I recall, they don't succeed without
<br />
greatly reducing the impact of what they want to say. So perhaps
<br />
a good challenge is this: we could try to articulate Nagel's
<br />
question without the construction &quot;what it is like to be...&quot;.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Much has been written about particular formulations of the mind/body problem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or, if you prefer, &quot;problem&quot;). For example, Douglas Hofstadter's commentary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on Thomas Nagel's famous essay, &quot;What Is It Like to Be a Bat?&quot; (which I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looked up at your suggestion) makes the point that the logic of the titular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question itself is muddled: if Nagel were a bat, he would not be Nagel, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he would therefore not be Nagel asking the question. If Nagel were actually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; asking what it would be like for him to stay Nagel and experience being a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bat, perhaps by having his brain stimulated in a batty way, then that is (a) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a different question, and (b) in theory possible, and not the intractable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem originally advertised. This is fair enough, so I shall try to avoid 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talking about qualia in the way Nagel does. However, I can't get rid of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea that there is something special and fundamental about first person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience.
</em><br />
<br />Yeah! I know the feeling!  :-)  I myself can't shake the feeling
<br />
that there *isn't* anything special about first person experience.
<br />
<br />Thanks very much both for your effort to consult that source,
<br />
and, as usual, your perceptiveness and eloquence in explicating
<br />
a difficult matter.
<br />
<br />Lee
