<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW, Bruno, from the little I did understand from your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; texts so far and from the lots I didn't I think we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; NOT in a perfect match of worldviews. Hard to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pinpoint, because I bleong to those who do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;speak&quot;/(think) within your vocabulary &lt;G&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't think it is a question of vocabulary, and actually I am not 
<br />
sure we are not in, well *perfect* perhaps not, but at least in an a 
<br />
larger matching area than you think.
<br />
Perhaps, like so many, you have not yet really understand the impact of 
<br />
the discovery by Turing and its relation with Godel's theorem.
<br />
When I talk on Platonia, it is really &quot;Platonia&quot; updated by Godel's and 
<br />
Lob's theorem. I hope you are open to the idea I could perhaps progress 
<br />
in my way of communicating that. It really concerns machines and even 
<br />
many non-machines. I think about abandoning comp for ind, where ind is 
<br />
for indexical, given that G and G* applies to almost anything 
<br />
self-referentially correct.
<br />
I knew this for long, the comp hyp just makes the reasoning and the 
<br />
verification easier.
<br />
<br />All what I say John is that anyone interested in Truth should look deep 
<br />
inside him or her or itself, and that's all.
<br />
That's hardly original, but I add something: a diskette with a couple 
<br />
of programs enabling you to follow in a finite time some sort of 
<br />
infinite conversation with a Universal Turing Machine looking deep 
<br />
inside herself.
<br />
Which programs? G, G*, G* \ G, S4Grz, S4Grz1, Z1, Z1*, X1, X1*, etc.
<br />
<br />And this leads to a testable &quot;TOE&quot; explaining both qualia and quanta, 
<br />
without assuming quanta or any piece of stuff at the start. 
<br />
Verifiability is ensured by the fact that propositional physics should 
<br />
be given, with the ind hyp, by S4Grz1, or X1* or Z1* precise 
<br />
propositional logics (and as far as I have been able to proceed we got 
<br />
quantum logics there)
<br />
<br />John, George, Stephen, Kim, thanks for your naming suggestion. I will 
<br />
continue to medidate upon! I can already say that I disagree the word 
<br />
&quot;quantum&quot; should be in it. The name should not issue what will or 
<br />
should be derived by the theory. There is nothing surprising that 
<br />
quantum physics could be derived from quantum psycho mechanics. Please 
<br />
recall I am not assuming anything physical.
<br />
<br />Also, the questions that I address has been addressed by many people 
<br />
before (Plato, Plotinus, Proclos, and many others in different 
<br />
continents). Nobody would say that ocidental psychomechanics has begun 
<br />
with Plato or Plotinus. The word I am searching should be large, 
<br />
general, and without as few presupposition as possible.
<br />
<br />Plato is the one who introduced the word &quot;theology&quot; with the meaning of 
<br />
&quot;Science of Gods&quot;, and by extension I take it as the science of what we 
<br />
can hope or bet upon.  It is just the truth *about* machine, and we can 
<br />
talk and reason about it without ever knowing that truth, given that no 
<br />
scientist at all can *know* the truth, at least as knowed.
<br />
<br />To talk on immortality issues (cf: quantum immortality or 
<br />
comp-immortality) without accepting we are doing theology is perhaps a 
<br />
form of lack of modesty.
<br />
<br />Nobody would dare to try to help me making a case for the use of the 
<br />
word &quot;theology&quot;?
<br />
<br />I am not yet convinced by your argument against the use of the word  
<br />
&quot;theology&quot; but you help me to be aware that some misunderstanding 
<br />
prevails here. I  should perhaps say more about Plotinus, and other 
<br />
neo-platonists.
<br />
<br />Bruno
