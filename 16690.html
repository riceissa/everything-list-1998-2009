<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Indeed you agree with the hypothesis, and your philosophy appears to

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be a consequence of the hypothesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Excellent!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Glad you say so.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It remains possible that we have a disagreement concerning the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; probability, and this has some importance, because it is the use of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; probability (or credibility) which makes the consequences of comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; testable. More in the comment below.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So my only problem with the usual view of probability is that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't seem to me to emerge naturally from a platonic theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious.
</em><br />
<br />It does not in Platonia-before-Gödel.
<br />
After Godel we know machines (and even most &quot;gods&quot;), when they observe  
<br />
they neighborhoods are confronted to many modalities which reflect the  
<br />
gap between truth, intelligibility, observability, sensibility.  
<br />
Rational probabilities, qualia sensibilities, quanta probabilities  
<br />
emerge by the reflection, for each normal universal machine/number, of  
<br />
their personal and collective border of their (abyssal) ignorance.  
<br />
After Godel we know that such an ignorance has a mathematical creative/ 
<br />
productive shape.
<br />
But just UDA should convince you that probabilities emerge. I will  
<br />
come back on this.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Is your proposal something that would conceivably be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arrived at by a rational observer in one of the (supposedly) rare
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds where white rabbits are common?
</em><br />
<br /><br />White rabbits are never common. When a white rabbit is common and  
<br />
regular, we call it a particle.
<br />
Today, the problem with comp is that it still could predict a priori  
<br />
too much white rabbits, and not enough particles, to be short ...
<br />
A priori the universal machine dreams too much ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Does it have features that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would lead one to predict the absence of white rabbits, or does it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just offer a way to explain their absence after the fact?
</em><br />
<br />The UD reasoning has to justify the observation that they are very  
<br />
rare. We have to justify why our neighborhoods seems to obey  
<br />
computable and compressible laws, when we know that below our  
<br />
substitution level we are supported by a continuum of computations.  
<br />
Well, computer science and mathematical logic are promising with that  
<br />
respect. That continuum has a mathematical shape.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I mentioned before, assuming computationalism it seems to me that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is theoretically possible to create a computer simulation that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would manifest any imaginable conscious entity observing any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imaginable &quot;world&quot;, including schizophrenic beings observing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychedelic realities.
</em><br />
<br />The UD does exactly that.
<br />
The first price of its universality is that it will not only do that,  
<br />
but it will do that *redundantly*. The redundance is big and  
<br />
unavoidable.
<br />
The second price is that it will generate (in its platonic static way)  
<br />
non terminating histories, from which a continuum will be projected as  
<br />
viewed from &quot;inside&quot;.
<br />
<br />The UD is redundant, like the Mandelbrot set. See
<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DD1k4BAUg&amp;feature=channel_page">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DD1k4BAUg&amp;feature=channel_page</a>
<br />
It is an impressive zoom on compact representation of a universal  
<br />
dovetailng (most probably) and illustrates the redundancy, and the  
<br />
presence of a rich structure. It is generated by a very little program.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, then further assuming Platonism, all of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these strange experiences should exist in Platonia.  Along with all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible normal experiences.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. But clearly we don't see them, or very rarely. This has to be  
<br />
explained from the general indeterminacy.
<br />
The special indeterminacy is the indeterminacy in a relative to this  
<br />
&quot;cosmos&quot; self-duplication à-la Washington/Moscow.
<br />
The global indeterminacy is you in front of a (material or immaterial,  
<br />
platonic) Universal Dovetailer (UD).
<br />
<br />Elementary arithmetic defines already a universal dovetailer.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see any obvious, non-&quot;ad hoc&quot; mechanism to eliminate or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minimize strange experiences relative to normal experiences, and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't think adding one is justified just for that purpose, or even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary since an unconstrained platonic theory does have the obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; virtue of saying that there will always be Kellys like myself who have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never seen white rabbits.
</em><br />
<br />This explains the Kelly of here and now. But it does not explain where  
<br />
my assurance comes from that the Kelly which I hope will read this  
<br />
mail will still share my history, in which the white rabbit has not  
<br />
made an apparition.
<br />
Given that you are already idealist, UDA is just UDA1-7, lucky you!
<br />
<br />UDA1-7 is the explanation where the probabilities (or credibilities)   
<br />
come from, and why they have to be quantum-like unless comp or quantum  
<br />
mechanics are flawed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for your earlier questions about how you should bet, I have two  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; responses.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First that there exists a Bruno who will make every possible bet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One particular Bruno will make his bet on a whim, while another Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will do so only after long consideration, and yet another will make a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wild bet in a fit of madness.  Each Bruno will &quot;feel&quot; like he made a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choice, but actually all possible Brunos exist, so all possible bets
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are made, for all possible subjectively &quot;felt&quot; reasons.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here I disagree as far as I understand something .. I am not sure to  
<br />
which Bruno you are talking.
<br />
And I agree with Papineau's paper you quote (see below), but it seems  
<br />
to me that it pleads in the favour of the use of objective in (quantum  
<br />
or not) self-multiplication.
<br />
<br />Let me ask you the following question. I have already ask the list.
<br />
I propose you the following experience/experiment.
<br />
<br />I multiply [you-in-front of a (16180x10000) black and white pixels  
<br />
screen] so that each of your future &quot;you&quot; (third person) will be in  
<br />
front of each of the 2^(16180*10000) configurations of the screen.  I  
<br />
will do this concretely in this universe, tomorrow.
<br />
<br />Actually, I repeat it 24 times per second during 1h30 (60 * 90  
<br />
seconds). So after a lapse of 1h30, you will be multiplied in  
<br />
2^(16180*10000*60*90*24) exemplars, and, of course, each of those  
<br />
resulting exemplars will have the memory of having seen ONE  
<br />
&quot;movie&quot; (in a larger sense than usual) .
<br />
<br />And I am asking you, here and now, what do you expect the most  
<br />
probable experience you will feel tomorrow, when I will do that  
<br />
experiment.
<br />
It is easy to predict that you will feel, from your first person point  
<br />
of view, with certainty, (assuming comp and the correct choice of  
<br />
level) seeing a movie, one movie.
<br />
<br />What do you thing is the more probable events that you will live which  
<br />
one is the more probable? What is your most rational choice among
<br />
<br />1) I will see a Monty Python with chinese subtitle
<br />
2) I will see the beginning of Space Odyssey (black and white version)
<br />
3) I will see a black screen
<br />
4) I will see a white screen
<br />
5) I will see white noise, but looking in the details, the black and  
<br />
white sequence gives the decimal of PI in binary.
<br />
6) I will see white noise, and looking in the details I will not find  
<br />
a program generating that sequence.
<br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Second, and probably more helpfully, I'll quote this paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (<a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/content/1/c6/04/17/78/manymindsandprobs.doc">http://www.kcl.ac.uk/content/1/c6/04/17/78/manymindsandprobs.doc</a>) by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David Papineau, which sounds reasonable to me:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;But many minds theorists can respond that the logic of statistical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inference is just the same on their view as on the conventional view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; True, on their view in any repeated trial all the different possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequences of results can be observed, and so some attempts to infer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the probability from the observed frequency will get it wrong.  Still,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any particular mind observing any one of these sequences will reason
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just as the conventional view would recommend:  note the frequency,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infer that the probability is close to the frequency, and hope that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are not the unlucky victim of an improbable sample.  Of course the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic of this kind of statistical inference is itself a matter of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; active philosophical controversy.  But it will be just the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inference on both the many minds and the conventional view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is worth observing that, on the conventional view, what agents want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from their choices are the desired results, rather than that these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; results be objectively probable (a choice that makes the results
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objectively probable, but unluckily doesn't produce them, doesn't give
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you what you want).  Given this, there is room to raise the question:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why are rational agents well-advised to choose actions that make their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; desired results objectively probable?  Rather surprisingly, is no good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer to this question.  (After all, you can't assume you will get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what you want if you so choose.)  From Pierce on, philosophers have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been forced to conclude that it is simply a primitive fact about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rational choice that you ought to weight future possibilities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; according to known objective probabilities in making decisions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The many minds view simply says the same thing.  Rational agents ought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to choose those actions which will maximize the known objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability of desired results.  As to why they ought to do this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is no further explanation.  This is simply a basic truth about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rational choice.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I supect that this basic truth actually makes more sense on the many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minds view than on the conventional view.  For on the conventional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view there is a puzzle about the relation between this truth and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; further thought that ultimate success in action depends on desired
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; results actually occurring.  On the many minds view, by contrast,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is no such further thought, since all possible results occur,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; desired and undesired, and so no puzzle:  in effect there is only one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criterion of success in action, namely, maximizing the known objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability of desired results.  However, this is really the subject
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for another paper, not least because the idea that agents ought to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maximize the known objective probability of desired results itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hides a number of complexities which I have been skating over here.&quot;
