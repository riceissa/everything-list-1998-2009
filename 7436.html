Lee, Stephen, Stathis, Jonathan,
<br />
<br />Thanks for your illuminating responses.
<br />
<br />I went to <a href="http://internationalreporter.com/news/read.php?id=641">http://internationalreporter.com/news/read.php?id=641</a> and left a 
<br />
message telling them that I objected to the slur on Hawking, and that I 
<br />
thought Dr. Baldev was a charlatan.  I also rated the article as &quot;Bad,&quot; the 
<br />
worst available rating.
<br />
<br />Somebody responded with thanks.  In addition to their gratitude, I noticed 
<br />
that my &quot;Bad&quot; rating of the article had been magically transformed into 
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot;
<br />
Norman

Subject: RE: How did he get his information?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;After about 9 months from the release of the book of Dr. Raj Baldev, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stephen Hawking, one of the noted authorities on Black Hole changed his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea about the Black Hole.  Hawking was of the firm opinion that nothing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could escape from the Black Hole, not even light and nothing could come 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out of it.  But in July 2004, at 17th International Conference on General 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Relativity and Gravitation in Dublin, he admitted his mistake that he was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong for thirty years.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hawking wrong about &quot;nothing could escape black holes&quot;?  Has the writer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;never heard of Hawking radiation? Hawking began writing about black holes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evaporating as far back as the 1970s.
</em><br />
<br />I think he's talking about Hawking changing his mind as to whether 
<br />
information can escape from black holes. Hawking always said radiation can 
<br />
escape, but believed all information was destroyed. He changed his mind 
<br />
about that. The above quote is pure bovine excrement. Baldev probably got 
<br />
his doctorate in farming technology.
