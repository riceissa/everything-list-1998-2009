<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't think this makes sense, at least I can't understand it.
</em><br />
<br />I think Ben's question here does make sense. See below...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The point is, there is no change to the s photon when we put the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;polarizer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; over by p.  Its results do not visibly change from non-interference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; to interference, as the web page might imply.  (If that did happen,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; we'd have the basis for a faster than light communicator.)  No, all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; that is happening is that we are choosing to throw out half the data,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; and the half we keep does show interference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes but we are choosing which half to throw out in a very peculiar way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;--
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; i.e. we are throwing it out by &quot;un-happening&quot; it after it happened,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; by destroying some records that were only gathered after the events
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; recorded in the data already happened...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You have to try to stop thinking of this in mystical terms.  IMO people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;present a rather prosaic phenomenon in a misleading and confusing way,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and this is giving you an incorrect idea.  Nothing is un-happening.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;No records are destroyed after they were gathered.
</em><br />
<br />Although it may be true that no records are destroyed after they're 
<br />
gathered, what is true is that an *opportunity* to find out retroactively 
<br />
which path the &quot;signal&quot; photon took is eliminated when you choose to combine 
<br />
the paths of the &quot;idler&quot; photons instead of measuring them. For reference, 
<br />
look at the diagram of the setup in fig. 1 of this paper:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/PS_cache/quant-ph/pdf/9903/9903047.pdf">http://xxx.lanl.gov/PS_cache/quant-ph/pdf/9903/9903047.pdf</a>
<br />
<br />In this figure, pairs of entangled photons are emitted by one of two atoms 
<br />
at different positions, A and B. The signal photons move to the right on the 
<br />
diagram, and are detected at D0--you can think of the two atoms as 
<br />
corresponding to the two slits in the double-slit experiment, while D0 
<br />
corresponds to the screen. Meanwhile, the idler photons move to the left on 
<br />
the diagram. If the idler is detected at D3, then you know that it came from 
<br />
atom A, and thus that the signal photon came from there also; so when you 
<br />
look at the subset of trials where the idler was detected at D3, you will 
<br />
not see any interference in the distribution of positions where the signal 
<br />
photon was detected at D0, just as you see no interference on the screen in 
<br />
the double-slit experiment when you measure which slit the particle went 
<br />
through. Likewise, if the idler is detected at D4, then you know both it and 
<br />
the signal photon came from atom B, and you won't see any interference in 
<br />
the signal photon's distribution. But if the idler is detected at either D1 
<br />
or D2, then this is equally consistent with a path where it came from atom A 
<br />
and was reflected by the beam-splitter BSA or a path where it came from atom 
<br />
B and was reflected from beam-splitter BSB, thus you have no information 
<br />
about which atom the signal photon came from and will get interference in 
<br />
the signal photon's distribution, just like in the double-slit experiment 
<br />
when you don't measure which slit the particle came through. Note that if 
<br />
you removed the beam-splitters BSA and BSB you could guarantee that the 
<br />
idler would be detected at D3 or D4 and thus that the path of the signal 
<br />
photon would be known; likewise, if you replaced the beam-splitters BSA and 
<br />
BSB with mirrors, then you could guarantee that the idler would be detected 
<br />
at D1 or D2 and thus that the path of the signal photon would be unknown. By 
<br />
making the distances large enough you could even choose whether to make sure 
<br />
the idlers go to D3&amp;D4 or to go to D1&amp;D2 *after* you have already observed 
<br />
the position that the signal photon was detected, so in this sense you have 
<br />
the choice whether or not to retroactively &quot;erase&quot; your opportunity to know 
<br />
which atom the signal photon came from, after the signal photon's position 
<br />
has already been detected.
<br />
<br />This confused me for a while since it seemed like this would imply your 
<br />
later choice determines whether or not you observe interference in the 
<br />
signal photons earlier, until I got into a discussion about it online and 
<br />
someone showed me the &quot;trick&quot;.  In the same paper, look at the graphs in 
<br />
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, Fig. 3 showing the interference pattern in the signal 
<br />
photons in the subset of cases where the idler was detected at D1, and Fig. 
<br />
4 showing the interference pattern in the signal photons in the subset of 
<br />
cases where the idler was detected at D2 (the two cases where the idler's 
<br />
'which-path' information is lost). They do both show interference, but if 
<br />
you line the graphs up you see that the peaks of one interference pattern 
<br />
line up with the troughs of the other--so the &quot;trick&quot; here is that if you 
<br />
add the two patterns together, you get a non-interference pattern just like 
<br />
if the idlers had ended up at D3 or D4. This means that even if you did 
<br />
replace the beam-splitters BSA and BSB with mirrors, guaranteeing that the 
<br />
idlers would always be detected at D1 or D2 and that their which-path 
<br />
information would always be erased, you still wouldn't see any interference 
<br />
in the total pattern of the signal photons; only after the idlers have been 
<br />
detected at D1 or D2, and you look at the *subset* of signal photons whose 
<br />
corresponding idlers were detected at one or the other, do you see any kind 
<br />
of interference.
<br />
<br />So, my guess is that something similar would be true if you created a more 
<br />
complicated type of quantum-eraser experiment along the lines of what Ben is 
<br />
suggesting. For example, imagine something like the double-slit experiment 
<br />
with an electron, except that the slits are on one side of a closed box 
<br />
whose insides resemble a cloud chamber, with the electron gun on the inside 
<br />
of the box on the opposite side. Imagine that this box is an idealized one 
<br />
that can perfectly isolate the inside from any interactions with the outside 
<br />
world, along the lines of the box in the Schrodinger's cat 
<br />
thought-experiment (perhaps the only way to realize this practically would 
<br />
be to simulate the insides of the box on a quantum computer). Now, if an 
<br />
electron comes out of the slits and hits a screen, then if we immediately 
<br />
open the box and look inside, we'll probably still be able to see the path 
<br />
the electron took through the cloud chamber, and thus we'll know which slit 
<br />
it went through. On the other hand, if we wait for a long time before 
<br />
opening the box, the insides will have gone back to equilibrium and we'll 
<br />
have no way of telling which slit the electron went through. In analogy with 
<br />
the quantum-eraser experiment, no matter which we do, I don't think you'll 
<br />
see an interference pattern in the total pattern of electrons on the screen. 
<br />
But, again in analogy with the quantum-eraser experiment, if you were to 
<br />
look at all possible outcomes of measuring the exact quantum state of the 
<br />
inside of the box in the case where you wait a large time t to open it (and 
<br />
the number of possible distinct quantum states would be huge, because of the 
<br />
number of particles making up a cloud chamber), and then you performed the 
<br />
experiment an equally huge number of times so you could look at the subset 
<br />
of trials where the box was found in a particular quantum state X, then in 
<br />
that subset, my guess is that you'd see an interference pattern in the 
<br />
position that the electron was detected on the screen. But if you add up all 
<br />
the different subsets involving each possible quantum state for the inside 
<br />
of the box, my guess is that just as in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the peaks and 
<br />
troughs of all the various subsets would add together so the total 
<br />
distribution of the electron's position would show no interference. And on 
<br />
the other hand, if you opened the box immediately instead of waiting a large 
<br />
amount of time, then most of the exact states you would find when you open 
<br />
the box would show clearly which path the electron took, so that even if you 
<br />
looked at a subset of trials where the box was found in a particular quantum 
<br />
state Y, you'd still see no interference pattern in the electron, just like 
<br />
you don't see an interference pattern in Fig. 5 of the paper which looks 
<br />
only at the subset of trials where the idler ended up at D3 and thus was 
<br />
known to have come from atom A.
<br />
<br />And of course, instead of just having the inside of the box contain a cloud 
<br />
chamber, you could have it contain some even more complicated macroscopic 
<br />
recording device, like a cloud chamber *and* a little man who can see the 
<br />
condensation track in the cloud chamber and remember it, and then you could 
<br />
choose whether to open the box and measure the state of the system inside 
<br />
while the man's memory was still intact, or after a bomb had gone off inside 
<br />
the box and made the information impossible to recover even in principle 
<br />
from a measurement of the state. The basic idea here should be the 
<br />
same--you'll never see interference in the total pattern of electrons, but 
<br />
if you repeat this experiment some vast amount of times and look only at the 
<br />
subset of trials where the inside of the box was found in a particular 
<br />
precise quantum state, then you may see interference in that subset, in the 
<br />
cases where the information has been erased (in this example, the cases 
<br />
where you wait until after the bomb has blown the man and his memories to 
<br />
smithereens).
