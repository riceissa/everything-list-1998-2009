Hi,
<br />
<br />I comment Georges Quenot's Post, and then I try to meet Peter D Jones 
<br />
critics on Quentin Anciaux.

<br /><br />The question is whether comp is true or not. If comp is false then it 
<br />
should obviously lead to a wrong direction for the question of 
<br />
existence. If comp is true, then we have no choice to derive the many 
<br />
form of possible existence or appearances from it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A matrix of numbers is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the only type of mathematical object the multiverse can be.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure what you mean by matrix of numbers.
<br />
Now I agree with your point in the sense that if follows from the UDA 
<br />
that if comp is true then many things, including the appearance of a 
<br />
multiverse go well beyond most mathematical object.
<br />
This is corroborate by the fact that the first person description is 
<br />
already not definable by a mathematical object, from the first person 
<br />
point of view.
<br />
You can get an intuitive understanding of this key feature by following 
<br />
the UDA, or to get a mathematical or computer science theoretical 
<br />
understanding through the study of incompleteness.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Where could the executive program have come from?   Perhaps one could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; call
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it &quot;God.&quot;  I can think of no possibility other than  &quot;It was always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; there,&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and eternal existence is a concept I can't imagine.  Are there any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; possibilities?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think there is another possibility. I tried to explain it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in my exchanges with John. It relies on several speculations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or conjectures:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Mathematical objects exist by themeslves (&quot;They were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    (or: are, intemporal) always there&quot;),
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK (I could add some nuances but at this stage it would be confusing: 
<br />
roughly speaking we must keep in mind that &quot;all the mathematical 
<br />
object&quot; cannot be a mathematical object).
<br />
Note: it is like in Plotinus. The big &quot;ONE&quot; cannot be among the 
<br />
&quot;existing&quot; things even if all existing things proceed from it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; - The multiverse is isomorphic to a mathematical object,
</em><br />
<br /><br />What do you mean? I guess this: The multiverse is not a mathematical 
<br />
object, but still  is describable by a mathematical object.
<br />
I don't think so. If comp is true the mutiverse should not be entirely 
<br />
describable (in any third person term) by any mathematical object. If 
<br />
we are numbers our possibilities go beyond what we can describe in term 
<br />
of mathematical object (and that is why I insist that comp is 
<br />
antireductionist).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Perception of existence is an internal property of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    multiverse (mind emerges from matter activity),
</em><br />
<br />The multiverse would be &quot;physical&quot;? But then: What is mind, what is 
<br />
matter, what is activity?
<br />
Are you postulating a physical universe? In that case comp-or-weaker  
<br />
is just false. Let me recall that the UDA shows that if we can survive 
<br />
(in the folk sense) through a digital body substitution, then physical 
<br />
appearances must be justified entirely without any physical ontological 
<br />
commitment. Arithmetical truth already contains the full description of 
<br />
the deployment of a full quantum universal doevetailer, but it remains 
<br />
to explain why such a quantum realm wins the &quot;white rabbit hunting 
<br />
battle&quot; (that is how it solve the measure problem).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Mathematical existence and physical existence are the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    same (&quot;there is no need that something special be inside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    particles&quot;, the contrary is an unnecessary and useless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    dualism, &quot;the fire *is* in the equations&quot;).
</em><br />
<br /><br />All this is too much ambiguous for me. I tend to criticize all 
<br />
*fundamental* dualism. I agree with you that the fire is in the 
<br />
equation (or more aptly in their solutions, or still more aptly: in the 
<br />
memory of the possible observer-machine described relatively by (all) 
<br />
their solutions).
<br />
<br />===================
<br />
Now please let me quote the short dialog between Peter and Quentin, 
<br />
which are addressing a key and probably difficult point:
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Quentin Anciaux: But whatever you do with numbers can be encoding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with numbers, as such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assuming platonic existence, numbers are the only requirements, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; operation on them, discourse about them, description on them are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; numbers too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Peter D Jones: Hmm. You can hardly claim that the meaning is intrinsic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the number.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does &quot;2&quot; mean &quot;red&quot;, &quot;mammal&quot;, &quot;male&quot; or what ? It could be mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything in a given coding scheme.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quentin Anciaux: I agree, but the coding scheme is also a number.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Peter D Jones: Is that a fact, or something you need to assume to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maintain the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument ?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quentin Anciaux: The coding scheme is the instruction set of a turing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine, which is also a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number... I'm stuck ;)
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Peter D Jones: Can TM's interpret -- or do they need to be interpreted 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?
</em><br />
<br /><br />When a (may be universal) Turing machine M1  interprets some piece of 
<br />
code C, such an interpretation is only defined relatively to some ... 
<br />
other Universal Turing machine M2. Now, if that piece of code, when 
<br />
interpreted, corresponds to the running of some &quot;conscious program&quot; C, 
<br />
that conscious entity, from its first person perspective, is not just 
<br />
related to M2 or to M1 but to *all* Universal Machine embedded through 
<br />
*all* possible codings in the arithmetical Platonia (that the main UDA 
<br />
point). Now, by Godel's coding technic, all those executions can be 
<br />
entirely and completely defined by pure relation among (natural) 
<br />
numbers, and no conscious entity can attach itself directly to that 
<br />
level, but, by UDA, can attach itself only to the infinity of similar 
<br />
processes corresponding to the sufficiently similar relation between 
<br />
numbers.
<br />
So Peter Jones is right when he says that &quot;2&quot; could code anything a 
<br />
priori, but &quot;2&quot; will only *code* something relatively to some precise 
<br />
Universal machine ... itself coded by some universal machine, etc. 
<br />
until we get the grounded level of arithmetical truth where &quot;2&quot; and any 
<br />
number will code themselves, and addition or multiplication  will mean 
<br />
the standard addition or multiplication of Platonia.
<br />
You can get a better picture by thinking more precisely on the 
<br />
universal dovetailing, and coding it entirely in term of relations 
<br />
between conventional numbers.
<br />
It is probably a subtle point and it is hard to explain without more 
<br />
explanation of Godel's technic of arithmetization and its relation with 
<br />
computer science through Church thesis.
<br />
<br />Perhaps it is easier to see this the other way round. Arithmetical 
<br />
truth has nothing conventional. The fact that 17 is prime is an 
<br />
absolute truth, where of course 17 represents the number of strokes in 
<br />
&quot;IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII&quot; (and not the string &quot;17&quot; which indeed could means 
<br />
red, mammal, male, or what.)
<br />
Once you agree with this, it is just a matter of work (which should be 
<br />
obvious for computer scientists) that unconventional truth about 
<br />
sophisticated relations between numbers will represent sophisticated 
<br />
computational histories, including universalone, including universal 
<br />
one, etc. With comp each of our first person conscious experience will 
<br />
be associated to the usual infinity of sufficiently fine grained (cf 
<br />
the comp subsititution level) third person computational histories.
<br />
The &quot;real&quot; problem is to show that the aberrant stories and other white 
<br />
rabbits vanish from some first person &quot;normal&quot; point of view (and then 
<br />
this is handled in the thesis by the lobian interview).
<br />
<br />This explanation relies heavily on some understanding of the UDA 
<br />
argument. See
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.htm">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.htm</a>
<br />
A key point is that our first person expectations depend on an infinity 
<br />
of computational histories, and this results from the fact that the 
<br />
first persons cannot be aware of the (incredibly long) delays appearing 
<br />
in the running of those never terminating programs.
