Le 21-nov.-06, à 03:42, Tom Caylor a écrit :


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. What is the purpose of this 0-person?  What role does it play?  As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; soon as we say it has a purpose or role, we've just instantiated it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do you (or Plotinus) think we need it?



</em><br />
The 0-person is the big whole. It is the &quot;everything&quot;. A physicalist 
<br />
could say it is the whole UNIverse. A physicalist MW could say: it is 
<br />
the whole multiverse. It is something which could only be viewed from 
<br />
outside the universe: that is from nowhere.

<br />
Let me give the arithmetical interpretation of the plotinian hypostases 
<br />
(person pov). You can consider it as a &quot;toy&quot; plotinian-like (and thus 
<br />
neoplatonist) theology.To each (lobian) machine we can associate such 
<br />
an arithmetical interpretation. Then it can be shown that we get the 
<br />
same logical and mathematical structure for the theology of a large 
<br />
class of machine (the *sound* lobian one, i.e. the correct or honest 
<br />
ideal machine which asserts only true sentences (independently of us 
<br />
knowing that or not: we do classical math).

<br />
The eight hypostases:

<br />
1) The zero-person pov is the &quot;ONE&quot;: I propose to interpret it by 
<br />
arithmetical truth. By Tarski theorem, the sound lobian machine cannot 
<br />
even define or name it. Note that the machine can built powerful 
<br />
approximation of it, but the machine get into inconsistency or 
<br />
incorrectness once she confuses the ONE and any of its approximations.

<br />
2) The third person point of view is the &quot;INTELLECT&quot;.  I propose to 
<br />
interpret it by the communicable or provable third person discourse by 
<br />
the correct machine about herself. The modal logical skeleton (Bp) is 
<br />
given by the modal logic G. By Solovay theorem it extends naturally 
<br />
into a richer modal logic G* which proves many more correct, but 
<br />
unprovable by the machine, propositions. So the intellect, like with 
<br />
the neoplaonists, splits into two hypostases: the discursive or 
<br />
&quot;terrestrial&quot; intellect, which is the one described by G, and the 
<br />
divine one G*. &quot;divine&quot; just means &quot;true&quot;, by the arithmetical 
<br />
interpretation of the &quot;ONE&quot;.

<br />
3) The first person point of view is the &quot;ALL-SOUL&quot; or &quot;UNIVERSAL SOUL&quot; 
<br />
described by Plotinus. I define it by the knower, which I define by the 
<br />
Theaetetical trick, which according to the scholars Brehier is the way 
<br />
Plotinus proceeds too.  So the knowledge modality is defined by Bp &amp; p. 
<br />
By a kind of mathematical magic, the soul does not split. The &quot;divine&quot; 
<br />
G* and the &quot;terrestrial&quot; G have the same discourse about its logic. You 
<br />
can find a proof of this in Boolos 1979 or Boolos 1993. The logic you 
<br />
get here is known as S4Grz (S4-Grzegorczyk). It is indeed a knower 
<br />
logic (unlmike G or G*).  It is a logic of unnameable self and/or 
<br />
unnameable time.

<br />
4) The first person &quot;plural&quot; point of view, or the Plato-Plotinus' 
<br />
INTELLIGIBLE MATTER, will be interpreted by Bp &amp; Dp, or equivalently 
<br />
(cf Kripke semantics of G): Bp &amp; Dt. This leads to the Z logic. By the 
<br />
Godel completeness theorem this is equivalent with &quot;p is true in all 
<br />
accessible world &amp; there is at least one world&quot;. From the machine 
<br />
terrestrial point of view, it is not equivalent with Bp, by the 
<br />
incompleteness theorem. &quot;Dt&quot; (the consistency of  &quot;1 = 1&quot; is the same 
<br />
as the non provability of the false). We have to add &quot;Dt&quot; for having a 
<br />
notion of probability on the computational continuations (cf UDA). 
<br />
Unlike the soul S4Grz, G* proves more about Z than G, this gives rise 
<br />
to Z*.

<br />
5) Then the &quot;true first person plural&quot;, that is: (Bp &amp; p) &amp; Dt leads to 
<br />
the sensible feeler or &quot;SENSIBLE MATTER&quot; in the plotinian terminology. 
<br />
Again the feeler splits into two different logic: which I call X and 
<br />
X*.

<br />
To extract the physical law: you have to add the comp hypothesis. I 
<br />
will explain later that this can be done by adding &quot;p -&gt; Bp&quot; to the 
<br />
logic G. This changes all the 8 hypostases. The new logics are written 
<br />
with their old name +  &quot;1&quot;. If either S4Grz1 or Z1* or X1* does not 
<br />
obey quantum logic, then comp is refuted. Until now, evidences exist 
<br />
that the three logics S4Grz1, Z1*, and X1* do obey at least minimal 
<br />
form of quantum logic, and this in a sufficiently constructive way that 
<br />
there is an algorithm for extracting arithmetical interpretation of a 
<br />
notion of quantization. Of course a lot of works remains to be done: 
<br />
even the simplest of all Bell inequalities remain untractable when 
<br />
traduce in those logics. Alas.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. This 0-person cannot be the basis for saying that the scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discourse (and allegedly the Everything List discussions) has to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an impersonal basis.  As you say, this 0-person has no discourse.  And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the hypothetical existence of a 0-person does not rule out the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of person at the deepest level to which we can relate (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persons).


</em><br />
The trick is that a lobian machine as rich as ZF is able to prove the 
<br />
whole (provable and unprovable by PA) theology of a simpler lobian 
<br />
machine like PA. There is nothing hypothetical in the notion of 
<br />
&quot;arithmetical truth&quot; from the pov of a rich (set theoretically based) 
<br />
lobian machine. Faith arrives only when a machine begins to bet on its 
<br />
*own* correct theology, i.e. its *own* G* if you want (or G* minus G).




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe the reasoning behind an impersonal basis is based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the desire to get away from the personal at the core level of being.



</em><br />
I don't think so. It comes only from the scientist desire to get away 
<br />
of first person truth in the scientific discourse. Actually, the cute 
<br />
thing here is that we get a extremely powerful defense of the existence 
<br />
of the first person, at the core level of being (despite the need to 
<br />
restrict the scientific discourse in the third person discourse).





<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What are the steps for logical inference from mathematical consistency
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the existence of God?



</em><br />
I was quoting Benacerraf. No need to accept such definition too 
<br />
seriously.  In particular &quot;consistency of math&quot; or &quot;self-consistency&quot; 
<br />
are nameable concepts, by the machine. Nothing to do with the unameable 
<br />
plotinian ONE (here: arithmetical truth for PA, set theoretical truth 
<br />
for ZF, TomCaylorable truth for Tom Caylor (if I may say)).






<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What are the steps of logical inference from incompleteness to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Holocaust?



</em><br />
I don't take this too literally. But I have explained, to you and 
<br />
George if you remember, that the price of being a universal machine is 
<br />
that you are &quot;crashable&quot;. And then the price of being a &quot;sufficiently 
<br />
rich&quot; universal machine is that not only you are crashable but you 
<br />
&quot;know&quot; it or &quot;can guess it&quot; (there are some nuances but I simplify). So 
<br />
the UTM can be frustated somehow. Now frustation of a large collection 
<br />
of machines could well lead to human catastrophe. I mean I can conceive 
<br />
this.

<br />
Exercice: show that the UD is not a Universal Machine (at all). It is 
<br />
enough to show that the UD cannot crash. Indeed it has no inputs! (Now 
<br />
there is a sense in which we could say that the UD is &quot;borned crashed&quot; 
<br />
given that it is programmed for non stopping (my usual definition of 
<br />
crashed). So there is a sense to say that the UD is a &quot;crashed 
<br />
universal machine&quot;.





<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Weyl quote is interesting though in that it cites the infinite in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first half in reference to good, and it cites our finiteness in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; second half in reference to evil.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say that our finiteness (or other limitations such as a need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a particular reference frame) is not sufficient for the existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of evil.



</em><br />
Let me restate more precisely what I say above. Let us interview PA and 
<br />
ask her if there is a reality. By the godel completeness theorem you 
<br />
can express this by Dt (= there is an accessible world/model/reality).  
<br />
As any correct lobian machine, PA will crash on this question. You will 
<br />
have to reboot it. Or you can talk with the chatty version of PA, which 
<br />
dovetails on all its proofs (and thus by incompleteness this cannot be 
<br />
a universal dovetailer for absolute provability). Such a PA will not 
<br />
crash indeed, but at some point she will assert the second 
<br />
incompleteness theorem (which *is* provable by the machine: a point 
<br />
that Penrose did not take enough into account). That is the machine 
<br />
will assert:

<br />
Bf v DBf    (we know it by the G theorems, or by PA proves:   Beweisbar 
<br />
('f') or Consistent(Beweisbar ('f') ).

<br />
= I will prove some absurdity or it is consistent that I will prove 
<br />
some absurdity.

<br />
This is what I have summed up yesterday by &quot;shit happens or shit may 
<br />
happen&quot;.

<br />
This reflects that the machine has enough introspection to prove its 
<br />
own limitation. In the multiverse which verify (Bf v DBf), a cul-de-sac 
<br />
world is accessible from each world.

<br />
But &quot;Bf&quot; can be fuzzify a lot and play the role of death, madness, 
<br />
dream, lies, etc... Not so far from some notion of evil.

<br />
Yes, evil belongs intrinsically to the realm of the ideally correct 
<br />
self-observing universal machine.

<br />
I hope all people see that &quot;Dt -&gt; ~BDt&quot; and &quot;Bf v DBf&quot; are just two 
<br />
equivalent versions of Godel's second incompleteness theorem; please 
<br />
ask if there is a problem here. It would be sad to be stuck here for 
<br />
reason of having no good base in elementary propositional calculus; 
<br />
there is no shame to ask question especially for the 
<br />
non-mathematicians. Here we use the tautological equivalence between (p 
<br />
-&gt; q) and (~p v q).




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with your assessment of science.  I also believe that science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not solve all of our problems.


</em><br />
OK. Sure. Provably so with the (a)comp hyp.

<br />
[by &quot;deriving something from (a)comp&quot; I mean you can derive it &quot;easily&quot; 
<br />
from UDA (and thus with the yes doctor) or with AUDA (that is 
<br />
&quot;arithmetically&quot; and without using the yes doctor. The &quot;a&quot; in (a)comp 
<br />
is for arithmetical].





<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Getting back to the more impersonal question, as has been observed on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; this List multiple times, there is a problem with discerning the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; source
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of order in the universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In which &quot;universe&quot;? (physical, mathematical, computer-theoretical,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; arithmetical ...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The word universe is worst than the word &quot;god&quot; in the sense that many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; people, since about 1500 years, take for granted that there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; primitively physical universe. But such an assumption is no more an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explanation than the dishonest use of &quot;God&quot; during centuries.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But is there not a problem with discerning the source of order in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever multiverse that has been hypothesized?  I think your point is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar to mine, that &quot;natural order&quot; is a relative term, as I see in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your related posts.




</em><br />
Yes. I think so. Precisely: if (a)comp is true the &quot;natural order&quot; is 
<br />
given by S4Grz1, or Z1(*), or X1(*).
<br />
The natural order should emerge from the recollable or glueable 
<br />
machine's dreams (number relative computation from some internal point 
<br />
of view).







<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Proposed explanations include the use of ideas such as the Anthropic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Principle,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Occam's Razor, some kind of &quot;measure&quot;, numbers, local order at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the expense of disorder somewhere else far away, etc.  So again, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; light of this lack of understanding, it seems pretty presumptuous for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; us to say that there must not be interventions in the natural order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; simply because we don't see any as we've defined them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree with you. But the word &quot;god&quot; and &quot;natural order&quot; are very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fuzzy, and rather dangerous to use out of an axiomatic or scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; context, and, as I said, such notion have been out of the realm of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ratio since the closure of Plato Academy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is my point.  We go too far when we let our view of the &quot;natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order&quot; (or &quot;god&quot;!) be the dictator of what can happen.  Indeed this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually making ourselves the center of the universe (multiverse).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is against the true essence of spirituality.



</em><br />
I agree with you. &quot;Naturalism&quot; as implicit metaphysics or theology is 
<br />
as fake as any form of authoritative dogma. Of course a *doubting* 
<br />
naturalist can remain scientific. But a naturalist who says that when 
<br />
we die, we will not born again (like many materialist believes) is just 
<br />
&quot;religious&quot; in the worst sense of the word. The truth is that we don't 
<br />
know, but can propose theories.
<br />
With comp, it is easy to kill oneself ... locally. It is harder  ... 
<br />
globally.  With comp it remains possible that consciousness is a sort 
<br />
of prison, as Otto Rossler extracts from Descartes (I agree with him on 
<br />
that).





<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If God is the one who does miracles, then from his Gods-eye view a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; miracle is simply a rare event, not inconsistent at all.  But from our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view a miracle is something that punctuates the equilibrium of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable &quot;natural order&quot; that we have deduced from the relative calm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which we live.



</em><br />
Perhaps. I have only extracted the logic of &quot;probability/credibility 
<br />
one&quot;. I will cautiously not venture myself on the very hard notion of 
<br />
&quot;historical rare event&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;future&quot; white rabbits, 
<br />
which must be explained away if the comp idea has to survive).
