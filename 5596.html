Hi Jeanne,
<br />
<br />Welcome to the group. The idea behind First and Third Person is the 
<br />
Quantum Suicide experiment which probably had many originators but the 
<br />
most well known is Max Tegmark professor at the Institute for Advanced 
<br />
Studies at Princeton. You can find some of Tegmark's references at
<br />
<a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/everett.html">http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/everett.html</a> 
<br />
&lt;<a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/%7Emax/everett.html">http://www.hep.upenn.edu/%7Emax/everett.html</a>&gt;
<br />
<br />and at
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/everett_guardian.html">http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/everett_guardian.html</a> 
<br />
&lt;<a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/%7Emax/everett_guardian.html">http://www.hep.upenn.edu/%7Emax/everett_guardian.html</a>&gt;
<br />
<br />Quantum suicide is a completely hypothetical thought experiment which 
<br />
show that if one assumes the manyworld interpretation then one may be 
<br />
forced to conclude that at &quot;death&quot; someone's perspective of the world 
<br />
can be very strange. First person and third person refer respectively to 
<br />
one who commits quantum suicide and one who observes someone else commit 
<br />
quantum suicide.
<br />
<br />As these articles explain, after a quantum suicide a first person 
<br />
observes himself or herself living since he only occupies those &quot;rare&quot; 
<br />
worlds where his/her attempt has not been sucessful. However, a third 
<br />
person observes that the person who commit suicide dies since in most 
<br />
worlds the quantum suicide is successful. Some of the underlying and 
<br />
unstated assumption in this miraculous survival is that consciousness is 
<br />
unaware of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) any substitution of parts or the whole of its physical 
<br />
implemetation (i.e. body) 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) its own measure  (the size of the subset of worlds in the 
<br />
manyworld that sustain his or her consciousness)

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;In this note I try to outline my current thoughts on quantum physics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;for your comments. I am sending this to a few mailing lists with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;overlapping memberships, so you may have received this twice or more.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I apologise if this is the case and also for the very imprecise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;language and gross simplifications and analogies that I am using to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;make my point. While this is really a sketch of a sketch, I wish to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;discuss the core idea with people who understands these things better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;than I do, so please let me have your comments (even &quot;go back to your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;first year textbook and stop wasting my time&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I think that, while Everett's Relative State formulation of quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;mechanics makes a lot of sense, its popular interpretation as &quot;Many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Worlds&quot;(MWI) should be taken only as a simple pictorial device useful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;for a first understanding of the theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;As a more accurate interpretation, I propose thinking of perceived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;realities as shadows of a more complex reality. I suspect this is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;some authors, perhaps including Everett himself, were trying to say,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and that others may have said it explicitly (perhaps Lockwood), so I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;would appreciate any pointer to relevant works.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I will use poor Schroedinger's cat as an example. Following Everett,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the cat is in a superposition of [cat dead] and [cat alive] states
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;before an observer opens the box and looks inside, and stays so after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(there is no collapse). After opening the box and looking inside, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;observer is in a superposition of [observer who remembers having seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the cat dead] and [observer who remembers having seen the cat alive].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The MWI says that after the act of observation (measurement) the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;universe is split in two branches where the first has [cat dead] and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;[observer who remembers having seen the cat dead], and the second has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;[cat alive] and [observer who remembers having seen the cat alive].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The difficulty that I have is: on the one hand we are saying that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;fundamental reality contains no such things as cats dead or alive, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;on the other hand we are describing the world(s) with cats dead and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;cats alive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;To clarify the first part of the statement: as we can choose any two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;directions to form a basis to use for the description of a particle's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;spin, all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;choices generating equally valid descriptions, besides [cat dead] and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;[cat alive] we should be free to use another basis to describe the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;cat. While any pair of independent linear superpositions of [cat dead]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and [cat alive] will do, of course I have no idea of what such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;superposition would &quot;look like&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Since I cannot remember having ever seen one, I do not know what a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;superposition of [cat dead] and [cat alive] would look like, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;probably I would not recognise one if I saw it. Perhaps this is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;reason why I cannot remember having ever seen one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;In other words, perhaps since reality is One Big World too complex for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;our minds to process efficiently, we use a simplified representation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;as Many (small) Worlds for our processing. This is not so surprising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;when we remember that our best computer programs use data compression
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and segmentation techniques, throwing most of the information away, to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;perform complex tasks such as face recognition efficiently. Perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;reducing a complex reality to parallel worlds is a successful trick
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;that sentient beings have developed to process reality more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;efficiently.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I believe thinking of shadows may be a better mental device than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;thinking of parallel worlds. Using this model the realities that I,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and my doubles in other branches of the MWI model, perceive can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;thought of as shadows of a more complex reality. Observing a shadow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;permits saying certain things about its source, like size and overall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;shape, but not other things like colour and smell. The shadow does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;contain such information. Also, much of what we can say about shadows
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;has more to do with illumination and the surface where the shadow is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;cast than with the actual source.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Thinking of multiple worlds as shadows brings us back to Plato's cave,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;but there are two important differences: First, each of us observes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;shadows of the *real* world in a very large number of caves in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;parallel. Second, we are shadows ourselves, our mental computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;processes being shadows of other, possibly much more complex,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;computational processes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;In my view of the world, saying &quot;my mental computational processes&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;just another way to say &quot;I&quot;. So what am I a shadow of? I don't know,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;but perhaps by observing the shadow I can develop some plausible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;assumptions on the source.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I know that I am a conscious being: though I am not able to put my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;finger precisely on what consciousness *is*, I know that it is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;property that I posses. I also think that consciousness must have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;something to do with complexity: if a computational process is complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;enough, it may become a conscious process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;So, since it seems reasonable to think that a source must have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;degree of complexity not lower than its shadow, we should consider the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;possibility that we are shadows cast by conscious sources.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Following Greg Egan who outlined something similar in his novel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;Quarantine&quot;, we can use the term &quot;smeared self&quot; to indicate such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;source. Your smeared self is simultaneosly conscious of a very large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;number of Everett branches, and you, who can only perceive one, are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the shadow that your smeared self is casting on this specific branch.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The mental activity of your smeared self may well be much more complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;than yours, and perhaps the interaction between I who wrote this very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;speculative and imprecise note, and you who are reading it, is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;shadow of a much more complex interaction between our smeared selves.
