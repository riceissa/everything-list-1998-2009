<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Taken strictly, I think this idea is incoherent.  Essential to intelligence is taking some things as more important than others.  That's the difference between data collecting and theorizing.  It is a fallacy to suppose that emotion can be divorced from reason - emotion is part of reason.  An interesting example comes from attempts at mathematical AI.  Theorem proving programs have been written and turned loose on axiom systems - but what results are a lot of theorems that mathematicians judge to be worthless and trivial.

<br />Yeah.  That's the difference between *reflective intelligence* and
<br />
ordinary *symbolic logic*+*pattern recognition*.  I would say that
<br />
ordinary reason is a part of emotion.  (or reflective intelligence
<br />
encompasses the other two types).  But you're right, you can't divorce
<br />
conscious experience from reason.  It's from conscious experience that
<br />
value judgements come.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; feel guilty about causing hurt, but do it anyway because there is a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; competing interest that outweighs the negative emotions.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or they may feel proud of their actions because they have supported those close to them against competition from those distant from them.  To suppose that empathy and reflection can eliminate all competition for limited resources strikes me as pollyannish.

<br />The human brain doesn't function as a fully reflective system.  Too
<br />
much is hard-wired and not accessible to conscious experience.  Our
<br />
brains simply don't function as a peroperly integrated system.  Full
<br />
reflection would enable the ability to reach into our underlying
<br />
preferences and change them.
