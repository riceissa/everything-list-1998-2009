Subject: Peculiarities of our universe
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are a couple of peculiarities of our universe which it would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nice if the All-Universe Hypothesis (AUH) could explain, or at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shed light on them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One is the apparent paucity of life and intelligence in our universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This was first expressed as the Fermi Paradox, i.e., where are the aliens?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As our understanding of technological possibility has grown the problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has become even more acute.  It seems likely that our descendants
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will engage in tremendous cosmic engineering projects in order to take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; control of the very wasteful natural processes occuring throughout space.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We don't see any evidence of that.  Similarly, proposals for von Neumann
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self reproducing machines that could spread throughout the cosmos at a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; large fraction of the speed of light appear to be almost within reach
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; via nanotechnology.  Again, we don't see anything like that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So why is it that we live in a universe that has almost no observers?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wouldn't it be more likely on anthropic grounds to live in a universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that had a vast number of observers?
</em><br />
<br />Assuming the validity of the AP, we should expect to find ourselves in the
<br />
most typical of circumstances. We should thus expect that most observers are
<br />
similar to us. So, most observers are not part of a very advanced
<br />
civilization. Maybe, as I wrote in the other posting, this is because those
<br />
civilizations consist of only one individual. This should follow from the
<br />
AUH, but it is not very clear how. If most observers are like us, then we
<br />
shouldn't expect to find much evidence of intelligent life, even if there
<br />
are hundreds of civilizations in our galaxy now.
<br />
<br />Maybe the fact that we are in a situation in which we don't have controll
<br />
over our own bodies very much is a clue. This should again be a typical
<br />
situation observers find themselves in. They are on the verge of
<br />
understanding how the universe works, but they don't have a cure for deadly
<br />
diseases or old age. They don't have the capacity to design and build
<br />
observers like themselves. It should thus be the case that the moment they
<br />
do develop such capabilities, their numbers should decline dramatically.
<br />
This should be a universal property of civilizations evolving in a universe
<br />
with large measure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second peculiarity is the seemingly narrow range of physical laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which could allow for our form of life to exist.  Tegmark writes about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this at <a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html">http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html</a>.  He shows a chart of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two physical constants and how if they had departed from their observed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; values by even a tiny percentage, life would be impossible.  In the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; full paper linked from there he offers many more examples of physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paramters which are fine-tuned for life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So why is this?  Why does it turn out that our form of life (or perhaps,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any form of life) can exist for only a tiny range of variation?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why didn't it turn out that you could change many parameters a great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deal and still have life form?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see anything a priori in the AUH that would have led to this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prediction.  Now, it may just be one of those things that &quot;happens to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen&quot;, a fundamental mathematical property like the distribution of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primes or the absence of odd perfect numbers.  Self-aware subsystems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just mathematically turn out to only be possible in a very tiny region
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of parameter space.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, you might be able to make the argument that &quot;tiny&quot; is not well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined, that there is no natural length scale for judging parameter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ranges.  Tegmark could as easily have zoomed in on the appropriate region
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of his graph and shown a huge, enormous area where parameters could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moved around and life would still work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However I think there is a more natural way to put the question, which is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what fraction of computer programs would lead to simulated universes that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; include observers?  And here, if we follow Tegmark's ideas, the answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appears to be that it is a very small fraction.  (Of course, you still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need to use your own judgement to decide whether that is &quot;tiny&quot; or not.)
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure this is correct,  I do agree that there is a problem here.
<br />
Tegmark looks at what would happen if you change on or more parameters in
<br />
the standard model and then concludes that the parameter space for life is
<br />
very tiny. Most physicists believe that a fundamental theory with only a few
<br />
parameter, e.g. superstring theory, could be behind the standard model. The
<br />
standard model is what you get if you ''integrate out'' the as of yet
<br />
unknown physics at the smallest length scales. Given that the fundamental
<br />
theory is supposed to have only a few parameters, it should have a much
<br />
larger measure than generic versions of the standard model. So, the problem
<br />
is actually worse: Why does life only emerge in a tiny fraction of programs
<br />
describing versions of the standard model? And of those programs that do
<br />
give rise to life, at least one can be obtained from an atypically simple
<br />
program (simulating the TOE).
