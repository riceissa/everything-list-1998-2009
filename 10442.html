<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;'seeming' delivered by qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Seeming sounds great until you try and conduct a scientific study of the

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Colin Hales
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I don't understand that?  Qualia = &quot;directly perceived seemings&quot;.  I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;what you mean by a &quot;science of qualia&quot; - why we would need one?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You think we don't need a science of qualia? 
</em><br />
<br />No, I said I didn't understand what you meant - and now I don't think you do 
<br />
either.  You have apparently come to the recent realization that science just 
<br />
creates models and you never know whether they are really real (and most likely 
<br />
they aren't) but for some reason you have seized upon qualia as being the big 
<br />
problem.  You don't know whether electrons or tables or the Sun is really real 
<br />
either.
<br />
<br />If science explains qualia - and I think it will - the explanation will be in 
<br />
terms of a model in which this or that variable produces this or that qualia - 
<br />
like 700nm photons hitting your retina causes red qualia.  I understand now 
<br />
that's not what you want.  So maybe you could give an example of what a theory 
<br />
in the &quot;science of qualia&quot; might be like.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's the single biggest problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is: we don't have one! Science cannot make any justified,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; authoritative prediction as to the phenomenal life of a rock, a computer,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the internet or the plumbing in Beijing or, especially, a scientist. 
</em><br />
<br />That's because you don't want to use an opertional definition of &quot;phenomenal 
<br />
life&quot; and science can't work on just words defined in terms of other words.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Take a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; look at Science magazine's July 2005 issue where 125 questions were posed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that face scientific inquiry over the next quarter century. The top two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. What is the universe made of? 
</em><br />
<br />Stuff that kicks back when you kick it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. What is the biological basis of consciousness?
</em><br />
<br />Brains.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Q2 = &quot;what is the physics of qualia?&quot;, is delivered by the answer to Q1, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the behaviour of whatever the universe is made of, of which brain material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is constructed. This is one question, not 2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Seeming' =  is a) directly the experiences bestowed upon us by qualia and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; b) inductions(models) we make from the behaviour of the appearances thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provided.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The latter assembled as empirical laws or just 'intuited' from qualia...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not matter. Result is the same....which is great...works
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fine....until....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ....you turn the qualia (the evidence making system) on itself in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific study of the evidence making system (qualia) to try and get a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science of qualia. Then the system breaks down: you can't see it. All you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see is the brain delivering it to a 3rd person. This is the anomaly.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see it as an anomaly.  It's no different than the rest of science -and 
<br />
the rest of common sense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This means that we have literal screaming proof that the universe is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made of 'seemings'. 
</em><br />
<br />Nobody (except some mystics and idealists) every said it was.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's made of a separate 'something' 
</em><br />
<br />Or a lot of separate somethings - like strings or particles or fields.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;and we have license
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to scientifically consider potential 'somethings' and any underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamentals that may apply to the generation of qualia.
</em><br />
<br />I think that's whay neurobiologists do.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It doesn't make any existing law of science invalid. It just means we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; haven't got the complete picture (set of laws) yet. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ============================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here's another way to see it:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Every scientific question ever posed about any 'thing' X has two questions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to ask, not one. These are:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Q1. What is X?				A1. That which behaves Xly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Q2. What is it like to be X?		A2. It is like Xness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The physical sciences have neglected the second question for every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific exploration done to date. &quot;What is it like to be X?&quot;, as a piece
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of anomalous data is _only_ visible when X = &quot;the brain&quot;, where we even have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a special word for the answer to Q2 Xness = &quot;the mind&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This has been culturally neglected in relation to all other X, such as X =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'an atom' and X = 'a coffee cup'. It may not be 'like anything' to be these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things. That is not the point. The point is we can make no scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assertion about it ......yet.
</em><br />
<br />What's the operational definition of &quot;being like&quot; something?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We get a definite answer to Q2 only in brain material. This, I hold, is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; route to answering it for everything else. Like what is it like to be a cold
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rock cf a hot rock? And so on...
</em><br />
<br />You many hold it, but why should anyone else?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ==========================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here's yet another version of the anomaly:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To illustrate the absurdity of the position of saying that 'models are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it'... consider qualia speaking Xness into your head directly. 
</em><br />
<br />Qualia don't speak as far as I know.  Maybe you meaning &quot;hearing a voice&quot;, which 
<br />
I suppose is a class of qualia.
<br />
<br />But qualia are not well defined.  When I look over there in the kitchen I'd say 
<br />
my qualia is &quot;seeing a table&quot;.  But if I reflect on it, maybe it was seeing some 
<br />
pieces of wood, or again maybe it was seeing some color patches in my visual 
<br />
field, or maybe it was seeing a family gathering place.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalent to another human(an utterer) _pretending_ to be X. This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yelling &quot;X is true&quot; at a scientist. As a result the scientist creates a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model for something behaving X-ly. It's quite predictive. Successful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But look what happens if you now do a science of qualia...behold there's an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UTTERER in there pretending! Look what it did...it did an &quot;X is true&quot; dance!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And underneath it looks nothing like Xness at all! We have found a separate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causal basis (the utterer) for qualia! Eureka. Lets tear this pretender
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apart and see what makes it tick.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now go back to brain material. Xness is experienced. We look for the utterer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but we can see no Xness. Just brain material. Accepting (demanding!) qualia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as scientific evidence whilst denying that qualia are scientifically tenable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is like accepting the statement 'X is true' and whilst denying that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyone/thing said it! 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To make qualia scientifically tenable you have to be allowed to look at 'the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; utterer'...structures delivering qualia... this is implicit evidence, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opposed to explicit evidence.... but no less compelling. The fact that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can't see qualia when we open up a brain is OUR problem, not the universe's.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;the way things seem&quot; is a model, i.e. a construct.  The model is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;what we assume and that's what we investigate.  I can't tell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;whether you're agreeing with me in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;different words or trying to point to some correction?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Brent Meeker
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I'm saying is that a policy, a cultural attitude, preference or habit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in scientists that....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'things &quot;are&quot; what they seem as described by a model that correlates with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearances'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...is perfectly fine for every case but one. When you try and do science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (the regularities of qualia as 'seemings') on the 'seeming system'(qualia).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then it breaks down...not wrong... just completely impotent (circular) as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation. You can't explain appearances with appearances.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Qualia, the biggest problem,  are a cultural problem first, then a technical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I suppose if I'm 'correcting' anything, all I'm doing is pointing to an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instance of that very cultural assumption at work in a dialogue on an email
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forum......A whopping great hole in the form of a assumption that models
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'are' it....which persists in spite of blatant evidence to the contrary in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain material.
</em><br />
<br />What evidence would that be?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The answer to Q1 'what is it all made of' is within biology because qualia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are the one and only pure expression of the deepest/complete possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure of whatever it is the universe is made of...
</em><br />
<br />Just because they are epistemologically prior, doesn't mean they are 
<br />
ontologically prior.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does that make sense?
</em><br />
<br />Not to me.
