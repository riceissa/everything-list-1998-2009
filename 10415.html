<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; emanating. I think, imaginatvely, that if one pictures a 'block
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; universe', Platonia, MW, or any non-process conception of reality, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; is more intuitive,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't see why it should be. It does not conform to our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;  because everything is 'just there' - superposed, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; it were. So, sure there's a 'layer' at which the individual 1st-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; 'emerges', but it's taking everything else 'working together' to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; manifest it. So in this sense, for me, it's all 'personal'. But maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; not for you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This business of what 'conforms to our experience' I think is fairly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deep. I used to be adamant that, whether or not 'timeless' theories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could be shown to be true or false on any other grounds, that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply didn't 'conform to our experience'. I was, however, also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suspicious of my own doubts: after all, we can't feel the earth moving,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and everyone knows you need to keep pushing things or otherwise they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grind to a halt. So I tried to go on an imaginative journey that might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take me into this apparently static realm but nevertheless preserve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something like 'what we experience'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my mind's eye I placed myself in the various 'points of view' that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'timelessly' exist within these structures. What would I see? Well,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever was manifested to me in virtue of 'my' local capabilities and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the perceptual information available to this 'me'. Would these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences be discrete, or would they be overlaid or 'smeared' with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information from other perspectives? Well, it seemed to me that what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characteristic about our experience, what makes it seem 'sequential',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is precisely what we *can no longer* or *can't yet* see, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information we *don't* have access to.
</em><br />
<br />In dynamic theories of time , that is explained by
<br />
the fact that memory traces are laid down causally, and the
<br />
future doesn't causally influence the present, so there
<br />
are no traces of the future.
<br />
<br />A static universe could be structured the same way, although
<br />
it would be coincidental.
<br />
<br />An Everythingist universe can't be. Every possible time
<br />
capsule must be instantiated. There must be versions of
<br />
you who ar the same in every erespect except that hey remember their
<br />
subjective future.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And so despite the 'superposed'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of these other states, delimitations of access to information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would act to make each capsule discrete.
</em><br />
<br />What does &quot;access to information&quot; mean ? In a dynamic
<br />
universe, it means causality. In a  Barbour-style universe
<br />
it means some &quot;nows&quot; coincidentally contain patterns representing other
<br />
&quot;nows&quot;
<br />
just as , in a world consisting of every possible picture, there will
<br />
be pictures containing pictures-within-a-picture.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; All the capsules capable of it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are 'conscious', but the localisation of information prevents there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being a 'totalising' point of view.
</em><br />
<br />what does the localisation of informatio mean ? What do
<br />
1's and -0's mean if they were not caused by anything ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The next puzzle for me was why any of this would 'feel' dynamic. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IMO is a subset of the qualia issue - i.e. why does anything feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyhow? Now, given that the arena under consideration consists in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both a 'substrate' and the structures within it, it has both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distributed and all-at-once aspects. Could it not be the the dynamic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; temporal 'feel' is the tension between these two? All dynamism derives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from contrast,
</em><br />
<br />That doesn't mean all contrast leads to dynamism !
<br />
You can get stasis out of dynamism by slowing things dwon to a halt;
<br />
it is still a paradox to get dynamism out of stasis.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and this seems to offer it. Putting these elements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; together (over a period of time involving many 'thought voyages') has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; re-aligned my intuition to make the scenario seem more plausible, at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least experientially.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Finally we come to the question of all these 'mes'. They all exist, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they're all conscious (the ones that are, that is). What's different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the other parts of the structure? Why aren't *they* conscious?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They're just organised differently, just like the parts *within*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persons that aren't conscious (ever), or the part that just went to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sleep, or died. So the whole structure, reflexively, *to itself*, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manifesting consciously, unconsciously, and no doubt every nuance in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between and beyond. That's my capital-P Personal. I strongly suspect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you find this way of thinking uncongenial, which is absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fine by me. But I've tried to describe it as clearly as I can, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps we can do no better than leave it at that.
</em><br />
<br />So the argument is:
<br />
<br />1) David is a person.
<br />
2) Because David is a person, some parts of David are conscious, and
<br />
others unconscious.
<br />
3) Some parts of the universe are conscious, and others unconcisous.
<br />
4) Therefore the universe is a person, too.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That isn't at all clear to me - mainly because you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are nto makign the all-improtant distinction between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; structures-structures and qualia-structures.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The qualia-structures are the fact of *being* the differentiated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substrate, and they manifest as 'feel', as distinct from 'possessing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties'. The structure-structures are the observed relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derived from these experiences, which also give us our relational or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'property' view of things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why is it not possible that *being* a substrate differentiated in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular way just *feels like* a particular existential/ experiential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quality to the differentiated substrate in question?
</em><br />
<br />I didn't say it was impossible. This is a confusion about
<br />
the meaning of &quot;structure&quot;. I was only doubting that qualia
<br />
are structures of a non-fundamental, decomposable sort.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I find the choice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of vocabulary here almost impossible, because it's not the sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing we're used to trying to communicate. But we're trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comprehend a sort of reflexivity, a 'seeming-to-itself'. How would you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prefer to characterise it? Is it critical to your conception that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualia are individual irreducible 'feels' and are subjectively neither
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analysable or synthesisable even to the 'feeler'?
</em><br />
<br />Qualia are what they seem. I still don't know what you mean by
<br />
&quot;synthesise&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I feel that we're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; getting to the point here where the problem stems from interpreting our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal experience in characteristically different ways, and this may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply be irreconcilable. As you say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I disagree. I can discern no structure *within* the taste
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of lemon or the colour red. There are relations between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; tastes, colours and so on, but they underdiefine the tastes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and colurs themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree about the underdefinition, but beyond this can one really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; debate something so personal as what one can 'discern'?
</em><br />
<br />The HP rests on the very fact that such things cannot be communicated.
<br />
<br />If they were just (structural) strcutures, they could be
<br />
communicated.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can't think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of any further argument to advance this here, so &quot;Wovon man nicht
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sprechen kann, darüber muß man schweigen&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At this stage, and attempting to recall our various points of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; departure, are you able to summarise what substantive areas of dispute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may remain that do not boil down to imaginative or linguistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preference?
</em><br />
<br />1) Persons aren't irreducible
<br />
<br />2) Qualia aren't structural.
<br />
<br />3) There needs to be some sort of Hard Problem
<br />
attached to peronhhod to justify the manoeuvre of making the
<br />
1st-pesoanl
<br />
primary. If a person is just a particualr structure, or a 1st person
<br />
statement is
<br />
just a  statement made by a person, that is not the case.
<br />
<br />4) Strenuous avoidance of dualism. Not all dualisms have the problems
<br />
of Cartesian dualism. There are dualisms within physicalism.
<br />
<br />5) How the apparent duality between the Easy problem and the Hard
<br />
Problem
<br />
emerges, if not from some other dualism.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mean this genuinely, not rhetorically. I have discovered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many points of agreement in thinking about your interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presentation of your views, and your pointed questions to this juncture
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have been most helpful in getting me to formulate justifications with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as much precision as I can. I'm only sorry I don't do better, but words
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; often fail me (or do I fail them?)
