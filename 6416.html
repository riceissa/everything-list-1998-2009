Dear Stathis,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was an interesting post. You're right in that, until quite
<br />
recently, we've understood the world only as well as we've needed to, in
<br />
order to survive. But if you believe, as some people on this list do, that
<br />
instantaneous 'observer moments' are the only fundamentally real objects in
<br />
the universe, (and that the reasoning, 'I think therefore I am' runs
<br />
primarily in that direction) then it is the logical struture of our
<br />
thopughts that is at each moment retrospectively generating a history in
<br />
which there evolved a creature intelligient enough to think them. From this
<br />
perspective, there is then a difference when someone becomes too mentally
<br />
disfunctional to survive by themselves; then their incoherent patterns of
<br />
thought will have to go one better and retrospectively generate a history in
<br />
which a successful species evolved,  of which they are a defective variant
<br />
(we might all belong in this category, and keep each other sane..)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But really, here we have to be more specific about what constitutes an
<br />
observer moment, and what does not. Do dogs, worms, viruses have observer
<br />
moments, or did they just coevolve in the history we might claim to have
<br />
created by thinking and being? I would suggest that they are as real as we
<br />
are, and that human consciousness is only distinguished from the animal sort
<br />
in matters of quantity and capacity, and believe that the sorts of thoughts
<br />
thatcan be taken as the fundamental objects of the universe are those that
<br />
appear in the context of an organism successful response to its surrounding
<br />
environment. This could be seen as a compromise between taking thoughts as
<br />
fundamental, and a more old-fashioned 'physicalist' perspective, but I would
<br />
see it more as observer moments being associated with the observer and
<br />
his/her/its environment. After all, the distinction between these is pretty
<br />
vague: Does the apple I just ate count as me or my environment? What if I
<br />
made myself sick? What if I cut off my appendage? Don't worry; I will do
<br />
neither of these things.
<br />
&nbsp;Yours Sincerely,
<br />
Chris Collins.

<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear aet.radal ssg,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you missed my point about the amnesic and psychotic patients,
</em><br />
which
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not that they are clear thinkers, but that they are conscious despite a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disability which impairs their perception of time. Your post raises an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting question in that you seem to assume that normally functioning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human minds have a correct model of reality, as opposed to the &quot;broken&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minds of the mentally ill. This is really very far from the truth. Human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brains evolved in a specific environment, often identified as the African
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; savannah, so the model of the world constructed by the human mind need
</em><br />
only
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; match &quot;reality&quot; to the extent that this promoted survival in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment. As a result, we humans are only able to directly perceive and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grasp a tiny, tiny slice of physical reality. Furthermore, although we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proud of our thinking abilities, the theories about physical reality that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; humans have come up with over the centuries have in general been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ridiculously bad. I have spent the last ten years treating patients with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; schizophrenia, and I can assure you that however bizarre the delusional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beliefs these people come up with, there are multiple historical examples
</em><br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparently &quot;sane&quot; people holding even more bizarre beliefs, and often
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insisting on pain of death or torture that everyone else agree with them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You might point out that despite the above, science has made great
</em><br />
progress.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is true, but it has taken the cumulative efforts of millions of
</em><br />
people
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over thousands of years to get to our current level of knowledge, which in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any case is still very far from complete in any field. Scientific progress
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of our species as a whole is mirrored in the efforts of a psychotic
</em><br />
patient
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who gradually develops insight into his illness, recognising that there is
</em><br />
a
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference between real voices and auditory hallucinations, and learning
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason through delusional beliefs despite the visceral conviction that
</em><br />
&quot;they
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really are out to get me&quot;.
