If you start with a set of <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;all <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;possible observer moments on which a measure is defined (which can be <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;calculated in principle using the laws of physics), then the paradox <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;arises. At any moment you can think of yourself as being randomly <BR>&gt; drawn <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;from <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the set of all possible observer moments. The observer moment who has <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;survived the suicide experiment time after time after time has a very <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;very low measure. <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure what you mean by "the paradox never arises" here. You <BR>&gt; have <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the past that although you initially believed in QTI, you later <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;realised <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it could not possibly be true (sorry if I am misquoting you, this <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;is <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from memory). Or are you distinguishing between QTI and QS? <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;That's correct. In both QTI and QS one assumes conditional probabilities. <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;You just <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;throw away the branches in which you don't survive and then you conclude <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;that you <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;continue to survive into the infinitely far future (or after performing <BR>&gt; an <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;arbitrary <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;large number of suicide experiments) with probability 1. <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;But if you use the a priori probability distribution then you see that <BR>&gt; you <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;the measure <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;of versions of you that survive into the far future is almost zero. <BR>&gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; What does "the measure of versions of you that survive into the far future <BR>&gt; &gt; is almost zero" actually mean? The measure of this particular version of <BR>&gt; me <BR>&gt; &gt; typing this email is practically zero, considering all the other versions <BR>&gt; of <BR>&gt; &gt; me and all the other objects in the multiverse. Another way of looking at <BR>&gt; it <BR>&gt; &gt; is that I am dead in a lot more places and times than I am alive. And yet <BR>&gt; &gt; undeniably, here I am! Reality trumps probability every time. <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; You have to consider the huge number of alternative states you could be in. <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; 1) Consider an observer moment that has experienced a lot of things. These <BR>&gt; experiences are encoded by n bits. Suppose that these experiences were more <BR>&gt; or less random. Then we can conclude that there are 2^n OMs that all have a <BR>&gt; probability proportional to 2^(-n). The probability that you are one of <BR>&gt; these OMs isn't small at all! <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; 2) Considering perforing n suicide experiments, each with 50% survival <BR>&gt; probability. The n bits have registered the fact that you have survived the <BR>&gt; n suicide experiments. The probability of experiencing that is 2^(-n). The <BR>&gt; 2^(n) -1 alternate states are all unconscious. <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; So, even though each of the states in 1 is as likely as the single state in <BR>&gt; 2, the probability that you'll find yourself alive in 1 is vastly more <BR>&gt; likely than in 2. This is actually similar to why you never see a mixture of <BR>&gt; two gases spontaneously unmix. Even though all states are equally likely, <BR>&gt; there are far fewer unmixed states than mixed ones. <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; Saibal <BR><BR>
