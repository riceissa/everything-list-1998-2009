2009/8/21 Flammarion &lt;peterdjones.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; My rhetorical question was &quot;how do we reach a state of certainty about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'what it is to be' on the basis of 'what it is to describe'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do we need certainty?
</em><br />
<br />OK.  Perhaps: how do we achieve the most inclusive understanding possible?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; my response is that we can't, because in the area of the first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we have indubitable acquaintance with at least some aspect of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; former.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That doesn't support the conclusion by itself. You also need to argue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for lack of certainty in descriptions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And in my view, this acquaintance is so alien to 'what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; described'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with regard to consciousness , or generally?
</em><br />
<br />With regard to consciousness.  But I have more to say on that below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that the assumption of the gap being bridged on the basis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of *any* model of observability can only be a brute apriori
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assumption.  Now I know that many people aren't troubled by this, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some just are.  Frankly, by this stage I'm ready to put it down to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; differences in imaginative style, what we're trying to achieve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; personally with our thinking, or something equally idiosyncratic.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; don't really believe it can be resolved entirely by persuasion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you concede that many aspects of mind -- cognition, memory and so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are not part of any Hard Problem?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, absolutely.  But I think our basic divergence is that I say you
<br />
can't end up at these destinations unless you buy the ticket at the
<br />
point of departure - the ticket being what I've called self-access
<br />
(i.e. as a characteristic of the situation as a whole, not of parts
<br />
taken in isolation).  Look, when I asked you &quot;how far down in our
<br />
analysis of the material do we have to go before the entities are no
<br />
longer material?&quot; your reply was in effect &quot;all the way down&quot;.  In
<br />
essence, I don't think I'm saying anything different vis-a-vis
<br />
consciousness.  Of course, as you imply in your question, nothing
<br />
complex comes for free, and we need to build up mechanisms, devices,
<br />
structures from their material-conscious building blocks - all the
<br />
'easy' stuff - to arrive at mind itself.  I say a bit more on this
<br />
below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Realism doesn;t need the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; existence of a non-mental world to be a certainty, it just needs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; it to be more plausible than the alternatives.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes, in general I agree with you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then what is the significance of Ontological Certainty?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;But I suppose on the mind-body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; question, the various positions that I've successively tried to hold
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on to (and I think I've traversed most of them over the last 30 years
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or so) having become less and less plausible to me.  I don't want to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be a mysterian, but I think that the assumption that with a bit more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; effort we've got the mind sorted on the basis of current theories will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; turn out to be more like Lord Kelvin's notorious dicta on black-body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; radiation and the ether wind.  Actually, if that were the case, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would be a good omen, because that presaged relativity and QM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think physicalism has been generally succesful and as much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of it should be retained as possible. hence the need to focus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the key issues in the MBP
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I wouldn't disagree with the spirit of that.  But I also say we
<br />
must continue to be alert to the possibility of gaps in some of our
<br />
basic assumptions.  I think part of the trouble is that to be
<br />
successful at anything, one has to push like mad, and this inevitably
<br />
leads - most especially when a particular approach has been very
<br />
successful - to the tendency to push it beyond usefulness. It probably
<br />
can't be avoided.  All I'm saying is that there is a long-standing
<br />
metaphysical corrective that has always stood to one side of
<br />
physicalism, and from time to time it's worth carefully reconsidering
<br />
it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes, but my view is that mind-body shows us that to consider the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; referent of a theoretical statement to be something 'external' is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fact the category error - i.e. the view from nowhere again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Referents are external by definition. So you must be sayign that no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory ever has a referent. But you have not said why.
</em><br />
<br />I'm drawing attention to the fact that 'external' and 'internal' are
<br />
epistemic polarisations which, in terms of any consistent monism, must
<br />
be seen as aspects of a unique ontic continuum.   When we carefully
<br />
examine what is entailed in conscious 'observation' we find that the
<br />
very act of qualitatively reifying or embodying local representations
<br />
entails the draining of proper ('internal') qualities from their
<br />
putative referents, thus 'externalising' them and abandoning them to
<br />
the realm of the 'non-conscious'.  So the 'red apple' is embodied
<br />
'redly' in my consciousness, but the qualitative embodiment of the
<br />
referent is not thereby locally realised.  This is the fons et origo
<br />
of the MBP, IMO.  More below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (can't remember who) put it like this: &quot;what is the external world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; supposed to be external to?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My head
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but try to see that in the context of what I said above.  What
<br />
I'm saying requires a shift in viewpoint.  If you don't make it - even
<br />
experimentally - what I'm saying will inevitably sound like gibberish.
<br />
&nbsp;OTOH, trying it for size doesn't commit you to the purchase.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Look, it may well be that you're capable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of doing this sort of category-juggling in your head whilst still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; using the standard theoretical language.  Part of the trouble is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm never quite sure if others are doing this, which is why I try to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; proceed in a painfully step-by-step way in enquiring into it - which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; probably makes me sound like the village idiot to you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmm. Well, I still think you are repeating standard map-territory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fallacies.
</em><br />
<br />Well, without the shift in viewpoint, there can be no agreement on
<br />
which is the map, and which the territory.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; How do you know? If you can't detect some mysterious inner essence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; how do you know there is one?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I certainly wouldn't put it like that.  I don't think that the view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from nowhere can 'detect' anything of the sort precisely because it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; doesn't - can't - say anything about the 'inner' at all - i.e. its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; externalised: that's its point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; YOu still haven't said about how you got into contact with the inner--
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or at least any &quot;inner&quot; other than your own.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I'm not arguing for solipsism, so I reason on the basis that my
<br />
inner isn't that much different to yours.  As for getting into
<br />
contact, perhaps this is the crux.  I think that your view of
<br />
consciousness is that it is mere epistemology, and hence that it can't
<br />
in and of itself tell us anything fundamental about ontology.  Well
<br />
you know of course that this is disputed - Bishop Berkeley, Vedanta,
<br />
the perennial philosophy, etc - and on what I think are good logical
<br />
grounds.  If I assume that my experience is a matter *merely* of
<br />
observation, I can't help getting into an infinite regress of
<br />
observation - i.e. of epistemology.  Consequently I'm forced to the
<br />
view that my fundamental relation to the qualitative is ontological,
<br />
and that the analysis of the qualitative into context and content is
<br />
what actually constitutes the apparent epistemological-ontological
<br />
'divide'.
<br />
<br />Further, since I'm a monist, I must believe that if this applies to
<br />
consciousness, it must also apply to whatever it is that the
<br />
epistemological content refers to, and consequently it is this that I
<br />
must make sense of in any comprehensible account of the 'mental' and
<br />
the 'material'.  Now, it's at this point that, adopting a
<br />
'materialist' stance, I might say to myself &quot;well, all this is
<br />
obviously untrue because the universe would be a mass of qualities -
<br />
which it clearly isn't - and things wouldn't merely manifest and
<br />
behave objectively and materially - which they obviously do&quot;.  But on
<br />
reflection, there's no contradiction here, because the very nature of
<br />
the epistemic-ontic split lies in the abstraction of quality from the
<br />
observable - it's represented qualitatively, but what-it-represents -
<br />
i.e. its referent - is what's left over relationally when the quality
<br />
is abstracted.  And this is why any account constructed entirely from
<br />
relational properties must be incomplete.
<br />
<br />Now clearly, if we can't agree on something reasonably close to the
<br />
foregoing as our point of departure on the way to what would be
<br />
acceptable as RITSIAR, it's hardly surprising that we find ourselves
<br />
in conflict further down the line.  Nonetheless, I'm interested to
<br />
know, even though you clearly disagree with the analysis, if you
<br />
reject this out-of-hand as a coherent point of view.  Do you think it
<br />
is demonstrably wrong, or simply an  unnecessary assumption?  If the
<br />
former, what specifically is wrong with it?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Theories represent the limit of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the world can *tell* us, not the limit of what it *is*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theories don't necessarily tell us the whole story. However
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you seem to have decided they necessarily don't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you can't peak over the horizon. how do you know there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is anything there?
</em><br />
<br />No, really, this isn't it.  The horizon is still there, and one seeks
<br />
to peek beyond it.  I'm just saying that there's a gap that can't be
<br />
bridged by any quantitative-relational theory.  It takes a shift in
<br />
viewpoint - or rather, a proper appreciation of what our 'viewpoint'
<br />
really implies - to acknowledge the gap.  Without the shift, one ends
<br />
up either explaining it away, or vaguely hoping that it will be
<br />
bridged by more or different relationships.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; really suppose that you are limited in any such way?  That your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; existence as it is known to you by acquaintance is entirely exhausted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; by what I can glean by interacting with you or bouncing signals off
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you think that if you scanned my brain right down to the atomic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you still wouldn't have captured all the information?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that's exactly what I think.  I realise, as I've said, that it's
<br />
arguing against the 'causal closure of the physical', but I think that
<br />
it's quite reasonable so to argue, as this assumption itself is
<br />
central to the MBP - see Chalmers for a review.  There's often a weird
<br />
sort of self-abnegation that creeps into attitudes at this point, as
<br />
though to say &quot;why should we suppose that mere human experience itself
<br />
sheds any light on the workings of the mighty and terrible universe
<br />
that glides on serenely without us?&quot;  But on reflection this is to
<br />
carry modesty beyond sense, because we're just a part of all this and
<br />
consequently what is true for us must be true - mutatis mutandis - for
<br />
the rest of it.  In fact the whole of science - nay the whole of life
<br />
- rests on a version of this statement of faith.
<br />
<br />And all that's required conceptually, I think, is to realise that
<br />
causality can't be 'closed' in the absence of mutual accessibility
<br />
between the interacting entities.  The metaphysical intuition here is
<br />
of a self-accessible continuum nonetheless differentiated by
<br />
self-encounter ('self' because the differentiation doesn't really
<br />
create 'separate entities').  The fundamental justification here is
<br />
that any other assumption just makes the whole universe disappear -
<br />
i.e. without it, any conjectured universe, and everything in it, would
<br />
be zombified - i.e. beside the point, Occamistically speaking.
<br />
Furthermore, we have absolutely no reason to suppose that this is
<br />
contradicted by physical theory - there's nothing whatsoever in the
<br />
observable or theorised behaviour of fundamental explanatory entities
<br />
that implies that mutual accessibility isn't a prerequisite (i.e. not
<br />
merely an accompaniment) for the mutual 'activity' that is the limit
<br />
of what is entailed by 'observation'.
<br />
<br />Consequently the qualitative basis of ontology is simply never
<br />
observed, because it is the unobservable *context* of observation.
<br />
It's not just the fish not seeing the water, it's the fish not seeing
<br />
the fish.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What we know by indubitable acquaintance is something absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; qualitatively different to what is described theoretically - it has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be - and whereas of course I'm not implying that this acquaintance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; gives us the ante on the whole nature of existence, I do believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it should be a salutory corrective to any notion of the 'completeness'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of our theories of observation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And the corrective to that corrective is that it must all be the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information -- just somehow presented differntly.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I agree, but with the caveat that you mustn't leave anything out,
<br />
as I've said above.  We're not that far apart, actually, once you
<br />
adjust for language and the status of the notorious 'gap'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You see, the thing that interests me about comp isn't that I know that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it's true.  Rather it's because I think that it confronts the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mind-body issue without sweeping the real problems under the rug.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CMT has next to nothng to say on the issue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of phenomenal consciousness and so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does Brouno's &quot;comp&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I agree.  One must be careful not to conflate the PM+CTM debate
<br />
with the status of phenomenal consciousness.  Bruno says that comp is
<br />
able to situate the quale, but that of course is a world away from
<br />
explaining it.  My view, as I say above - is that the qualitative lies
<br />
completely outside the domain of explanation, because it is in fact
<br />
the domain itself - i.e. the context within which all explanation
<br />
occurs (or more strongly  - is instantiated).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; That has not been demonstrated at all. At best you have an argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; that they are not necessarily RITSIAR. Which is straightforwardly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; by the observation that theories are less than certain. All you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; writen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; boils down to the fallacy that &quot;no necessarily true&quot; implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;necessarily untrue&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No, I think it boils down to the fact that no theoretical entity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; should ever be seen as RITSIAR - only in some relation to it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is the very fallacy I was complaining about. You are taking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;not necessarily real&quot; to imply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;necessarily unreal&quot;. (NB: RITSIAR is not intended as a claim of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainty. If you are just saying nothing is certain, you are nto
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying much).
</em><br />
<br />Well, I should sympathise with your complaint if in fact I was
<br />
claiming that, but I'm not.  I'm just saying that *any* theoretical
<br />
entity - which is the limit of can what we possess epistemologically -
<br />
is necessarily an incomplete representation of what we take it to
<br />
refer to, for the reasons I've given.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; difference between physics and comp is that in terms of the former
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; there's virtually no way of expressing this thought coherently,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whereas in terms of the latter it's a key aspect of the theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since the thought is unfounded, I don't see why that is an issue.
</em><br />
<br />No, if that is your view, I can see why you would think that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The unique feature of consciousness is not - as you claim - its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 'epistemic' certainty, but its status as what is *ontologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; certain*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Whatever that means.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It means its status as evidence by acquaintance of at least some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; indubitable aspects of 'what it is to be' something.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All that is delivered induibably is how things seem. Consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not offer any gold-plated insight into what things are. including
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself.
</em><br />
<br />This is perhaps an example of the 'self abnegation' I refer to above.
<br />
Whilst there clearly is nothing 'gold plated' about any particular
<br />
insight available *through* consciousness, we must nonetheless keep
<br />
tight hold of the fact that it is consciousness that is the unique
<br />
*vehicle* for such insights - and indeed for any hold on reality that
<br />
we possess.  And one cannot coherently claim that this vehicle is
<br />
essentially radically other than it *appears*, because in this case to
<br />
appear is to *be* - and of course vice versa.  So the extrapolation
<br />
from this is that the fundamental intuition of 'existence' on which
<br />
all - and I do mean *all* - the others parasitise, is that 'to be is
<br />
to appear'.
<br />
<br />Of course this is hardly a new idea, but I feel that it is usually
<br />
(though by no means always) somewhat thoughtllessly dismissed, and
<br />
hence its consequences don't get fully worked out.  There appears to
<br />
be a sort of 'embarrassment issue' connected with it in
<br />
'professionally respectable' circles!  It is assumed - on no evidence
<br />
- that it must somehow contradict the known facts without adding
<br />
anything to understanding, because nothing was missing before.  But
<br />
neither of these assumptions is the case IMO.  Consequently I regard
<br />
this approach as a needful metaphysical illumination of - not a
<br />
replacement for - relational theories be they comp, PM, or whatsoever.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;To regard consciousness itself (or in Bruno's terms the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ontological first person) as merely the object of 'knowledge' is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; commit the fallacy of taking 'observation' in a naively literal sense:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; i.e. to require there to be an 'observer'.  But this, self-evidently,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; can only lead to infinite regress.  Consequently, consciousness does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not consist in the 'observation' of epistemic entities, but in their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; instantiation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Whatever that means. Surely if soemthign is insantiated, it exist and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; is therefore ontological.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that's what I'm saying of course.  Epistemic entities are
<br />
instantiated in consciousness - it is their ontic context.  Further,
<br />
as I've said above, it is the *unique* ontic context.  Of course this
<br />
is what is claimed by Plotinus, the Vedantic literature etc, and I'm
<br />
saying it bears careful scrutiny.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I mean that consciousness isn't what we observe in others - or in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; functioning of our brains - it's what they experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consciousness doesn't seem to be the funcitoning of brains. But then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diamond doesn;t seem to be the same as graphite.
</em><br />
<br />Now we're back with the first-person / third-person distinction.
<br />
Surely you see the difference?  Sometimes you seem to argue for
<br />
elimination, sometimes for dual-aspect.  Which is it to be?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But this view relies on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the denial (in an unavoidably Freudian sense) that the physical is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; known exclusively in terms of conscious representations on which all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; extrapolation to an 'observable' reality rests.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No it doesn't. Why shouldn;t consciousness know the non-conscious?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are blurring epistemology and ontoloy again. I can paint
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Taj Mahal in oils, that doesn't mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here is anything oil-painting-ish abotu the Taj Mahal.
</em><br />
<br />Well I hope you can see now that I'm not in the least claiming that
<br />
the conscious can't know the non-conscious.  Rather, I'm trying to
<br />
clarify their relation.  If I'm claiming that 'consciousness' (for
<br />
want of a less contentious term) is the unique ontic context, then it
<br />
would appear that to ascribe non-consciousness to anything is no
<br />
longer tenable.  But this is not so - rather, we need to think in
<br />
terms of what is relevant in context.  So it is relevant in context
<br />
that, for example, I possess a conscious representation of the Taj
<br />
Mahal, but what isn't relevant in context is what that representation
<br />
is conscious-of - i.e. it has become in effect non-conscious.  If one
<br />
looks from the representation towards its referent, the same
<br />
reciprocal set of relations will obtain for it, in its own context.
<br />
<br />In your oil painting example, the painted Taj Mahal is the Taj Mahal
<br />
as represented in consciousness (i.e. in the context of the painting).
<br />
&nbsp;But - monistically speaking - the 'external' Taj Mahal - the subject
<br />
of representation - itself has no place to exist outside the
<br />
generalised painted context.  So it turns out - and this is where the
<br />
analogy breaks down - that the referent is another aspect of the
<br />
larger canvas, not 'external' to it.  Now of course the devil is in
<br />
the detail - there's always the 'easy' problem! - but in general
<br />
'epistemic' and 'ontic' are *functionally* polarised aspects of a
<br />
single category - the painted canvas in your analogy, in which the
<br />
canvas represents the continuity and the painted lines the
<br />
differentiation.
<br />
<br />At the risk of repeating myself (I suppose this must be irony!) I'm
<br />
not peddling anything new here, I'm just amplifying my own formulation
<br />
of the world-view of half the planet throughout half of history.  But
<br />
I think it's worth spelling out, because - properly appreciated rather
<br />
than dismissed - it is the necessary corrective to many of the MBP
<br />
confusions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Since such representations are not in themselves observable (though of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; course not unknowable) it is unreasonable to suppose that any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; putatively 'final' ontology known entirely on the basis of observation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could ever be considered a complete account of the situation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Who says they are unobsrvable? We can introspect them qua
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, and observe their neurological basis to boot.
</em><br />
<br />Ah.  It's the regress.  They're not fundamentally 'observed', because
<br />
of the regress. They're fundamentally be'ed (you see - we don't have a
<br />
word for it).  IOW, to observe is to *be* the representation.  That's
<br />
what makes it an ontic category, and that's what makes epistemology a
<br />
*functional* (what-it's-for) aspect of the ontic .  What-it's-for is
<br />
to function as a reference to a more inclusive generalised context
<br />
'external' to the representation, but within the same ontic category.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Look, for most of my life, most of my heroes have been the champions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of science.  I'm the last person to rubbish this effort.  All I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; saying is that in the mind-body domain the carefully designed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; methodology of 'vexing nature' is seeking to get a 'theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; everything' for free - because if you really believed that physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could account for 'everything' on the basis of' any possible set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; observations, then IMO you don't take the 'gap'  - between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; observable and the ontologically real  - that seriously.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Actually,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thinking about everything you've said, I conclude that you don't take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it seriously in that way. And that means that I'm worrying about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something unnecessarily in your view because you say it's just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; category error.  OK, we can agree to disagree.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, good. That saves me some typing. There is a gap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the way consciousness presents itself to the observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the way it appears in descriptions. That doesn't necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean we are dealing with an ontological divide, and it doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to be part of some wider gap betwee any kind of description and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of reality.
</em><br />
<br />I agree about the ontological divide, as I hope you see now, but not
<br />
about the completeness of the descriptions.  The ontological point of
<br />
departure is the crux, I think.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; No, it is nto the standard one in the literature. You are just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; commiting a basica fallacy -- saying that because the map is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; itself real, it cannot *represetn* a real territory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No, I'm not saying that.  I'm casting doubt on whether the mapping to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the territory can be complete.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now you are. You have been variously doubting whether maps can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the whole truth. or true at all in different passages.
</em><br />
<br />I regret that you feel I do not display the same consistency in
<br />
argument as you.  However if you press me I would say that the mapping
<br />
can be at worst incoherent, or at best incomplete.  I'm not sure if
<br />
that captures all the nuance of &quot;not true at all&quot; or &quot;not the whole
<br />
truth&quot;, but it's the best I can come up with.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm saying that all that can 'emerge' from one class of description is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; another class of description.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; The physical is not a description/map. Physics is the description/map.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; True.  But we have no direct access to the physical-in-itself through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; description, theory or mapping - only (in certain of its aspects)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; through consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How could we have got so far without the &quot;access&quot; argument?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is the facer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for physics, because of course it is precisely committed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; restricting itself to accounting for what is observed, and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; understand the power and intent of this approach.  But to extrapolate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from this to the causal closure of a physical ontology of everything,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; independent of consciousness, is fatal to a coherent resolution of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mind-body issues IMO.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are assuming that consciousness is unobserved. But as I pointed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out in the brain-scannign argument, there is good reason to think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that all the *information* in phenomenal cosnciousness is in fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physically available. What is missing in physical descriptions is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the mode of presentation of that informaiton  to the first person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A red quale doesn't convey information over and above &quot;that is red&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />We're getting into the third-person / first person confusion here.  I
<br />
assume you mean by consciousness in &quot;consciousness is unobserved&quot; its
<br />
putative observable correlates - which of course are ex hypothesi
<br />
observable.  Your brain scanning point is similarly circular - IOW if
<br />
you take consciousness to be exhausted by its physical correlates then
<br />
obviously a complete account of these is equivalent to &quot;all the
<br />
*information* in phenomenal consciousness is in fact physically
<br />
available&quot;.  The bit you choose to gloss over is &quot;the mode of
<br />
presentation of that information to the first person&quot;, as though it
<br />
were self-evident that this could be exhausted by third-person
<br />
description, and all that is missing is some processual account of its
<br />
'mode of presentation'.
<br />
<br />I agree of course that  &quot;a red quale doesn't convey information over
<br />
and above &quot;that is red&quot;, but this is because information - i.e. what
<br />
can be taken out-of-context - can only ever be ostensive in this way.
<br />
That's how it operates - it relies on *pointing* towards (i.e.
<br />
referring to) something that is instantiated qualitatively.  The
<br />
redness consists in *being redly* - the abstractable content consists
<br />
in pointing and saying &quot;like that&quot;.  It's like a set of instructions
<br />
for *reproducing the experience in context*.  And that - for perfectly
<br />
sound logical reasons - is why it can never be captured as
<br />
information.  It's at this point that some people panic and become
<br />
eliminativists.  I know you're not one of those, but then the problem
<br />
is that if you don't claim ontic primacy for qualitative existence,
<br />
you've backed yourself into unacknowledged dualism.
<br />
<br />BTW, essentially similar issues are at the heart of my &quot;little
<br />
theological divergence&quot; with Bruno.  I'm biding my time to see how the
<br />
seven-step math plays out before re-engaging on this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The 'arbitrariness' is inherent in the burden of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the term 'functionalism', which is intrinsically neutral as to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; details of physical implementation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; No, there are two quite differnt claim here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; 1. A function can have multiple instantions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; 2. Anything can instantiate any function.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's a pity you didn't comment on that.
</em><br />
<br />Well I wasn't sure what you meant.  Does 2) refer to the 'rock'
<br />
argument?  Well, if a rock consistently output the results of
<br />
calculations I tapped into its surface, I might be convinced it
<br />
instantiated the relevant functions.  Actually, a calculator is a sort
<br />
of rock that does precisely that, so maybe that says something about
<br />
the difference between 1) and 2).
<br />
<br />But my complaint doesn't consist in the denial of 1), but rather in
<br />
its consequences for CTM+PM.  IOW, if CTM+PM consists in the
<br />
conjunction of the two claims that a) specific physical processes
<br />
instantiate an (invariant) conscious state and b) any one of the
<br />
(variable) collection of physical processes functionally equivalent to
<br />
a specific computation instantiates the same (invariant) conscious
<br />
state, then c) I find this claim to be incoherent in virtue of its
<br />
sweeping the incompatibility of 'invariant' and 'variable' under the
<br />
rug.  It highlights the invariance of computational outcome of a class
<br />
of processes whilst ignoring the physical variability of each process;
<br />
since it is the latter that is postulated as responsible for
<br />
consciousness, the former is irrelevant to the case.  Gedanken
<br />
experiments like MGA and Olympia seek to make this more explicit by
<br />
reductio, but personally I find the contention prima facie
<br />
implausible.
