<br /><br /><br />Matt,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your remarks, question.
<br />
<br />First, let me say I am not wholly antagonistic
<br />
to platonic notions, except as the current
<br />
(last 2500 year) rendering of it has, IMHO,
<br />
a severe deficiency.  What is absent is clear
<br />
linkage between the Universal and the Real.
<br />
<br />For I do not see a coherent consistent compatible
<br />
universe existing without that connection/relation.
<br />
<br />So I have spent all my cognitive life working
<br />
to identify where and how that requisite is
<br />
present .. and to meld the domains.
<br />
<br />Essentially, the Universal has to be isomorphic
<br />
with Cantorian transfinities and Potentia -- 
<br />
including the emergent.  It must surpass Godelian
<br />
restrictions and the entire domain of information
<br />
possibilities must be 'self'-accessible even if
<br />
local bounds or limits are noted, used or identified.
<br />
<br />In line with your question, it is time to re-conceive
<br />
'real'.
<br />
<br />The wind and the referential cognition of wind
<br />
are both real and informationally co-relevant
<br />
-- and -- communicatively involved.  That 
<br />
'influence' might be limited to a preferential
<br />
direction, is distinct from the information 
<br />
access.  And so it is the information access
<br />
among domains that I am most interested in and see
<br />
as being of superior importance in any cosmology.
<br />
<br />Since Plato and Aristotle, humanity has been myopically
<br />
concerned with 'association' -- restrictively understood
<br />
as 'causality'.  With all the attendant disconnects:
<br />
form from function, materiality from process, mind
<br />
from matter, relations from relations, intentionality
<br />
from mechanisms from conditions from implementation
<br />
necessities.
<br />
<br />We struggle to put all these back together, but like
<br />
the characters in Waiting for Godot, we carry
<br />
hampering concepts and weighted baggage of old
<br />
ideations which are more problem than utility.
<br />
<br />For the universe and whatever aspects of it one
<br />
considers (material, energectic, aetheric)  to
<br />
function so pervasively consistently demands
<br />
not just certain absolute rules of performance,
<br />
but absolute communicative relational association:
<br />
communicative architecture and access and enactiveness
<br />
throughout all possible timespace of the architecture,
<br />
access and enactiveness.
<br />
<br />Which means -- that Platonia, that 'i' [sqrt -1],
<br />
that QM and continuum, and all dimensional realms
<br />
have relation (communicative access) with attendant
<br />
morphings of information (codification transfers).
<br />
<br />Designating the codification transfers relations
<br />
is the plateau we have reached.  Relating Universal
<br />
to Real.  Specifying that in a certain dimensional
<br />
frame of reference the [sqrt -1] -is- &quot;real&quot;, even
<br />
if it doesn't attain to qualifying as &quot;real&quot; in the
<br />
dimensional frame of reference our perception/cognition
<br />
operates in.  But the overarching communicative
<br />
process~architecture of Being allows the information
<br />
of one frame-of-reference to transcribe/transduce
<br />
to others, and so, what is 'unreal' to our
<br />
tactile criteria is still accessible relevant information,
<br />
just restricted to the form it can exist in our reality
<br />
as.
<br />
<br />No big deal.  We just have to let go of the bigotted
<br />
bias that 'our' frame of reference has to be 'the'
<br />
frame of reference.
<br />
<br />This led me to a strange but unavoidable conclusion
<br />
re certain aspects of 'information'.  Nearly without
<br />
exception, there isn't a scientific mind on this
<br />
planet that doesn't 'understand' that 'different
<br />
is different'. If you change information, it becomes
<br />
'different information'.
<br />
<br />But I noticed something else that seems intrinsic to
<br />
the operational formalism of The Calculus.  It can
<br />
be run in mutual reversal: integration, differentiation.
<br />
The function can take one set of information and generate
<br />
a second set, then be reversed to retrieve the original
<br />
data (within the caveat limit of +C).  But absent that
<br />
allowed variant, information is being consistently 
<br />
and perfectly reconstituted.  &quot;Different information&quot;.
<br />
<br />But what if those processes aren't generating 
<br />
'different' information?  Didn't Cantor alert us
<br />
to the reality that the infinity of a line is
<br />
identical with the infinity of a plane?  Wouldn't
<br />
that translate to there being some real and
<br />
meaningful identity property inherent between
<br />
the slope of a curve, a curve and the area 
<br />
under such surve?  Yes, there most definitely
<br />
could be.
<br />
<br />Which translates into this:  there are several
<br />
kinds/forms of information present in any 
<br />
observed system. One such is intrinsic and acts
<br />
as reliable anchor.  Another is extrinsic and
<br />
is appropriate to the domain it presents in.
<br />
<br />What the function Calculus does -- in this
<br />
expanded and strange way of thinking -- is
<br />
alter the dimensional form of the anchor 
<br />
information.   What 'looks' like different 
<br />
information, in one sense is, but in another
<br />
way is merely a different presentation of 
<br />
an invariant information set; consistent
<br />
invariant information -expressed in alternative
<br />
dimensional configurations-.
<br />
<br />For the last several hundred years, we've been
<br />
playing in a mathematical landscape oblivious
<br />
of these associations and informational possibilities.
<br />
<br />All the things/relations we've discovered were
<br />
the tail, ear, nose, gizzard parts, blood,
<br />
etc. of the camel.  Making holistic sense of
<br />
them all, all together, requires identifying
<br />
how they relate.  We thought that reductionism
<br />
would bring us to commonality, but that
<br />
didn't work.  And the distinct math frames
<br />
of QM and continuum only made matters worse.
<br />
<br />But now the future is open and accessible --
<br />
if we have the courage to work with expanded
<br />
evaluations re a 'communication universe'.
<br />
Einstein was correct about there being
<br />
no preferred frame of reference, but, there's
<br />
more to the situation than that.  We have to
<br />
hone the skills to fly through these multiple
<br />
frames of reference, not care about holding
<br />
on to any one of them in particular, but also,
<br />
not lose track of where we are as we navigate
<br />
through these dimensional spaces, because there
<br />
are utile demands afoot.  We will be doing things
<br />
in order to (as we have always done) accomplish
<br />
things and expand our competence and sustenance
<br />
of life and evolution.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Strange new relations are becoming apparent.
<br />
Such as: 'one' in x dimensions can be mathematically
<br />
substituted for 'zero' in x+/-1 dimensions.
<br />
<br />One bearing this has touches on the notion of 
<br />
collapse of the wavefunction.  We now have
<br />
a mechanism which means that a wavefunction
<br />
can be re-constituted. (!)  It also means that
<br />
in wholly normal operations, a wave -will- move
<br />
to, through and past x=0 and never lose information
<br />
content.
<br />
<br />Which means, that there is now a mathmematics
<br />
for natural co-residency of QM and continuum.
<br />
What once looked like an incompatible set of
<br />
relations can now be explored as alternative
<br />
dimensional presentations of self-same intrinsic 
<br />
information.
<br />
<br />The double and single slit experiments do
<br />
what the Calculus did .. change the number
<br />
of dimensions present.  The 'duality' is
<br />
not different information, but anchor information
<br />
manipulated to be in x or x-1 dimensional 
<br />
configurations.
