Hal Finney writes, in his usual eloquent and enlightening way:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I was working on an essay on the nature of thought experiments about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;copying, but it got bogged down, so I will make this short.  I am trying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to analyze it based on evolutionary considerations.  Copying is much like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;biological reproduction and we can expect many of the same effects in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a society in which copying is a long-standing and widely used technology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The most important effect is that making copies will be desirable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Just as genes try to reproduce themselves, so will people once that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;becomes possible, and for the same reason: successful reproducers occupy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more of the universe's resources (i.e. have higher measure) and so these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;habits tend to become more widespread.
</em><br />
<br />This is true in biology, but it seems that humans sometimes work directly 
<br />
against this principle. For example, to a rough approximation, the use of 
<br />
birth control is directly proportional and family size inversely 
<br />
proportional to economic success in human society. And while it is very 
<br />
common for people to want children and become very unhappy if for some 
<br />
reason they cannot have children, it is a very rare thing for someone to 
<br />
want as many children as possible - thousands, in the case of males. 
<br />
Arguably, greed for children should have evolved to be far more common than 
<br />
greed for money or power, which are only loosely correlated with 
<br />
reproductive success.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;When we consider thought experiments involving copies, it is important to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understand these effects.  It is truly different to make a set of copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than to experience a probabilistic event.  Making copies increases your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure in the world; flipping a coin does not.  The decisions you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;make in the two cases are different as a result.
</em><br />
<br />What does &quot;making copies increases your measure in the world&quot; mean? As far 
<br />
as I'm concerned, flipping a coin to determine whether another person or I 
<br />
will be tortured and splitting into two copies one of which will be tortured 
<br />
both give me a 50% chance of experiencing torture. There is nothing to 
<br />
choose between them other than the fact that having another person who looks 
<br />
like me, knows all my secrets, can access my bank account etc. is 
<br />
disturbing, and I would rather avoid it if possible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;One thought experiment was to consider two choices: flipping a coin and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being tortured if it came up a certain way; versus making several copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and having one of them be tortured.  Assuming the copies are all going to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;survive, clearly the latter would be the one selected by evolution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But note that this is still true if we reverse the probabilities: a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;small probabilistic chance of being tortured, versus making one copy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(so there are two of you) and having one of them being tortured.  There,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;too, I think the evolutionary approach would encourage making copies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Copying is such a bonus that it swamps consideration of quality of life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In a world where people have adapted to copying, they would work as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hard to make a copy as they would in our world to avoid dying (each one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;changes measure by plus or minus 100%).
</em><br />
<br />It may make sense from an evolutionary point of view, but why aren't people 
<br />
taking to the streets to demand unrestricted human cloning for all?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It might be objected that this approach does not shed much light on what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;our expectations would be or should be about what we will experience when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we go through these transformations.  I agree with the perspective that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there is truly no &quot;fact of the matter&quot; about what it is like to have one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of these things happen.  All we can really do is look at the experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and memory of each person, at each moment.  No one will disagree about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what each person at each moment remembers and how many of them there are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That is really all there is, factually.
</em><br />
<br />The last two sentences *are* the fact of the matter. We all know what it is 
<br />
like to be replaced by a copy because, over months or years, most of the 
<br />
matter in our body is replaced with raw materials from the environment, 
<br />
while the original matter disintegrates as thoroughly as if we had died and 
<br />
been cremated. The only difference is that it happens slowly, and there is 
<br />
never more than one copy extant at a time.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Our attempt to make these novel situations fit our conventional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;expectations don't work because we currently have an implicit assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of mental continuity which is violated by copying experiments.  There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;really is no meaningful and non-arbitrary way to map our current ways
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of thinking about the future to a world where copying is possible.
</em><br />
<br />It isn't really any different than the impression of a single continuous 
<br />
history we get at present if the MWI is correct. The relative measure of 
<br />
different outcomes translates to probabilities.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But what we can do is really just as good: we can predict how people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would and should behave.  Which preferences will they have in these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thought experiments?  How hard will they work to achieve one option versus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;another?  Evolutionary theory provides guidelines and examples we can use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to understand how people will behave if and when copying becomes possible.
</em><br />
<br />Evolutionary theory is important, but it is far from the only determinant of 
<br />
behaviour, nor should it be. &quot;Ought&quot; should not be derived from &quot;is&quot;.
