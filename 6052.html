<br />It's a good question, and this is where the rational comes up against the 
<br />
emotional. If it were my first trip, I think I'd be very nervous about the 
<br />
cheap alternative, and I would pay the extra or avoid going if I couldn't 
<br />
afford it. However, if I had used the $100 service many times in the past 
<br />
(through choice or necessity), I don't think I would worry about using it 
<br />
again.
<br />
<br />Here is another irrational belief I hold, while I'm confessing. I am 
<br />
absolutely convinced that continuity of personal identity is a kind of 
<br />
illusion. If I were to be painlessly killed every second and immediately 
<br />
replaced by an exact copy, with all my memories, beliefs about being me, 
<br />
etc., I would have no way of knowing that this was happening, and indeed I 
<br />
believe that in a sense this IS happening, every moment of my life. Now, 
<br />
suppose I am offered the following deal. In exchange for $1 million 
<br />
deposited in my bank account, tonight I will be killed with a sharp axe in 
<br />
my sleep, and in the morning a stranger will wake up in my bed who has been 
<br />
brainwashed and implanted with all my memories at my last conscious moment. 
<br />
This stranger will also have had plastic surgery so that he looks like me, 
<br />
and he will then live life as me, among other things spending the $1 million 
<br />
which is now in my bank account.
<br />
<br />If I were rational, I should probably accept the above deal, on the grounds 
<br />
that my apparent continuity of personal identity will be the same as it 
<br />
always has been. If such a proposal were put to me, however, I would be 
<br />
horrified; and I am sure my friends and family would be too, even if they 
<br />
shared my philosophical beliefs about personal identity. I would also be 
<br />
horrified if offered the role of the stranger who takes someone else's 
<br />
place. I can't decide which would be worse.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, if I had been forced to go through the above 
<br />
transformation several times, I might get used to the idea and not be so 
<br />
worried. Rationally, it shouldn't make any difference.
