John M writes (quoting SP):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; St:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you suggesting that a brain with the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pattern of neurons firing, but without the appropriate environmental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stimulus, would not have exactly the same conscious experience?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [JM]:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Show me, I am an experimentalist.  First show two brains with the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pattern of  (ALL!)   neuron firings. Two extracted identical firings in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; superdupercomplex brain is meaningless.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then, please, show me (experimentally) the non-identity of environmental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impacts reaching 2 different brains from the unlimited interaction of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; totality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I wrote already that I do not approve thought-experiments).
</em><br />
<br />Of course, you could not have both brains stimulated in the usual manner in 
<br />
both environments because then they would not have identical patterns of 
<br />
neural firing; you would have to artificially stimulate one of the brains in exactly 
<br />
the right manner to mimic the stimulation it would receive via its sense organs. 
<br />
That would be very difficult to achieve in a practical experiment, but the question 
<br />
is, *if* you could do this would you expect that the brains would be able to guess 
<br />
on the basis of their subjective experience alone which one was which? 
<br />
<br />Actually, &quot;natural&quot; experiments something like this occur in people going through a 
<br />
psychotic episode. Most people who experience auditory hallucinations find it 
<br />
impossible to distinguish between the hallucination and the real thing: the voices 
<br />
sound *exactly* as it sounds when someone is talking to them, which is why (if 
<br />
they are that sort of person) they might assault a stranger on the train in the belief 
<br />
that they have insulted or threatened them, when the poor fellow has said nothing 
<br />
at all. I think this example alone is enough to show that it is possible to have a 
<br />
perception with cortical activity alone; you don't even need to artificially stimulate 
<br />
the auditory nerve.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; St:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That would imply some sort of extra-sensory perception, and there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no evidence for such a thing. It is perfectly consistent with all the facts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to say that consciousness results from patterns of neurons firing in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain, and that if the same neurons fired, the same experience would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result regardless of what actually caused those neurons to fire.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [JM]:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regardless also of the 'rest of the brain'? Would you pick one of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; billions copmpleting the brainwork complexity and match it to a similar one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a different complexity?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the more relevant question (and I mean it):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What would you identify as (your version) of &quot;consciousness&quot; that &quot;results 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from neuron-fiting&quot; consistent with all the facts?
</em><br />
<br />My neurons fire and I am conscious; if they didn't fire I wouldn't be conscious, 
<br />
and if they fired very differently to the way they are doing I would be differently 
<br />
conscious. That much, I think, is obvious. Maybe there is something *in addition* 
<br />
to the physical activity of our neurons which underpins consciousness, but at the 
<br />
moment it appears that the neurons are both necessary and sufficient, so you 
<br />
would have to present some convincing evidence (experimental is always best, as 
<br />
you say, but theoretical will do) if you want to claim otherwise.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; St:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for consciousness being fundamentally irreducible, I agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [JM]:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consider it a singularity, a Ding an Sich? Your statement looks to me as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; referring to a &quot;thing&quot;. Not a process. Or rather a state? (Awareness??)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; St:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is a fact that when neurons fire in a particular way, a conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience results; possibly, complex enough electronic activity in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digital computer might also result in conscious experience, although we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot be sure of that. But this does not mean that the conscious experience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *is* the brain or computer activity, even if it could somehow be shown that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physical process is necessary and sufficient for the experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [JM]:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope you could share with us your version of that &quot;conscious experience&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as well, which &quot;could&quot; be assigned to a digital computer? What &quot;other&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity may a digital computer have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beside &quot;electronic&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is hard to show in 'parallel' observed phenopmena whether  one is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'necessary' for the other, or just observervable in parallel? Maybe &quot;the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other&quot; is necessary for the 'one'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you find that the 'physical' process (firing, or electronic) is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SUFFICIENT then probably your definition is such that it allows such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sufficiency.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I may question the complexity of the assigned situation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for such simplification,.
</em><br />
<br />I don't know that computers can be conscious, and I don't even know that 
<br />
computers can emulate human-type intelligent behaviour. Proving the latter 
<br />
lies in the domain of experimental science, while proving the former is impossible,  
<br />
although it is also impossible to *prove* that another person is conscious. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; St:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consciousness is something entirely different and, if you like, mysterious, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a category of its own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [JM]:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now you are talking! Thanks
</em><br />
<br />But I might add, saying that consciousness is mysterious and in a category of 
<br />
its own in no way suggests that computers cannot be conscious.
