<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;In LaTeX, this equation is

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;\frac {d\psi}{d t}={\cal H}(\psi)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It supposes time, but not space (TIME postulate). Moreover, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;supposes continuous time,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes but that is a lot of assumptions. Why a linear time capable of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being represented by the very special line with the usual topology of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the reals? I can imagine many topology on the reals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I thought the definition of the reals defined its topology? Perhaps
<br />
you're using topology somewhat differently.
<br />
<br />It is a good question as to why time should have a topological
<br />
dimension of 1, and I admit to not having a good answer to that. All I
<br />
can say is that computationalism also introduces a time with
<br />
topological dimension of 1. Tegmark has some arguments as to why the
<br />
topological dimension is 1, and not any other number, but these are
<br />
not overly persuasive (the argument depends on properties of 2nd order
<br />
PDEs, which already carries a greater amount of baggage)
<br />
<br />I only assume continuity to make contact with standard QM. It is an
<br />
arbitrary assumption in my opinion, and should rightly be viewed with
<br />
suspicion. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;but I do suggest in the paper how it might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;be generalised to other possible timescales.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yes but if you pretend to derive your equation, I don't understand what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you mean by generalizing your conclusion (if only by: I have not derive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it and it remains some work to do).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Of course there remains some work to be done.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Perhaps it also supposes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;continuity in time for \psi, although this probably flows from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;assuming continuity of time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why should a function be continuous just because it is defined on a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topological space (which is what I assume you are saying when you say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuity of time).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Because then it wouldn't be an evolution. For a state \psi(t') to
<br />
depend on the state \psi(t), there must be a corresponding limit
<br />
\psi(t')-&gt;\psi(t) as t'-&gt;t. Of course if t were not continuous, then
<br />
this condition is no longer necessary.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I do not think time is necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;continuous - I think it is interesting to explore alternative QMs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;without this assumption.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sure. But again how to talk on derivation then. I mean if someone 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pretend to derive B from A, then if someone else derive something m?ore 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general than B from A, it is a critic of the assertion that B has been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derived from A. If from facts I can derive the murderer is among John 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Charles, I am not so interested in  knowing the derivation can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generalized into leading that the murderer is among John, Charles, Lee, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno and Nicole!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />To use your analogy, the situation is more like:
<br />
<br />Assuming the murderer is John, Charles, Fred or Diana, I have shown
<br />
that the murderer must be one of John or Charles. However, if we also
<br />
consider Lee, Bruno and Nicole ... there is more work to be done.
<br />
<br />The assumption of J,C,F or D corresponds by analogy to the continuity
<br />
assumption. 
<br />
<br />L,B and N are not continuous - does that sound right? :)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The question is whether this is the most general evolution equation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;for continuous time, or whether there is some more general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;equation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Absolutely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I think it is, for the reason above. I willing to stand corrected
<br />
should that not be the case.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Remember, we do have already that \psi is a member of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Hilbert space, so we can write things like:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, but you assume Set theory (that by itself is huge in our context). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I show only that you have a preHilbetian space (why should &quot;cauchy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequence of vectors converges).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Yes I do assume set theory. That is stated.
<br />
<br />I prove Cauchy sequences converge in the paper. It requires the use of
<br />
Kolmogorov axiom no. 6. Hence the space of states is a Hilbert space.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;\psi(t')-\psi(t) = ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;What do you mean by derivability notion for H, and topological notion?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Topological notion are needed for talking of continuity (a continuous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function is just a function from topological space into a topological 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space such that the inverse image of open set is an open set).. You 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;assume&quot; the familiar topology of reals, complex number, etc.
</em><br />
<br />Ah yes, you're talking about topological spaces. I just did a quick
<br />
refresher course on these using Wikipedia. Indeed, when I make the
<br />
arbitrary continuity assumption of time, it is an assumption that time
<br />
is a subset of the reals, which has the usual metric and topology
<br />
defined. When you say you can imagine many topologies on the reals,
<br />
what you are really saying is that you can imagine sets isomorphic to
<br />
the reals (1-1 corrspendence), that have many different topologies, eg
<br />
the trivial or the discrete topology for instance, or anything defined
<br />
by an arbitrary metric. For instance the set of descriptions which is
<br />
isomorphic to the reals might more naturally have a Hamming metric
<br />
between pairs, which would induce a different topology from that
<br />
defined by the reals.
<br />
<br />The usual topology also applies for probability, which is defined by
<br />
Kolmogorov's axioms as a map X:-&gt;R. This induces a topology on the
<br />
space of states \psi. It does more than that, of course.
<br />
<br />I point to generalisation of the evolution equation by means of the
<br />
theory of time scales. I don't know that much about the theory, but I
<br />
think it does assume ordering of elements of time as a minimum. It may
<br />
also assume a metric - which would in turn induce a
<br />
topology. Unfortunately the relevant book is not in the library, and
<br />
very little appears on the internet.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Derivability is a stronger requirement (although some algebraist would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introduce many nuances). Someday I will show you make also assumption 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on consciousness, but that is more subtle, and then all physicist if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not almost scientist are doing them when they pretend to solve the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness problem like Dennett, or when they put it under the rug 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (a little bit like Lee in his last posts, I would say).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Please, I would be most interested - both in derivability and consciousness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Look Russell, as I said I appreciate your attempt, it is just that, as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hal and Paddy mentionned, there remains quite a lot of work to make it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thoroughly communicable. You should really put more clearly your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptions. You assume a vast part of mathematics, and I would say of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics, mainly with your time postulate and your equation. 
</em><br />
<br />True. The point of the work is that it forces into the open what needs
<br />
to be assumed in order for standard QM to work as it does. Things like
<br />
set theory, real numbers, Kolmogorov probability axioms and so
<br />
on. Some of these things are undoubtedly definitional (one could use a
<br />
different set of concepts, but still end up with an isomorphic
<br />
theory), whilst others relate to the nature of consiousness. I'm
<br />
trying to pack all of the consciousness assumptions into TIME and
<br />
PROJECTION.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Compare 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your work with those I have mentionned (I will give the reference for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those you don't have yet). 
</em><br />
<br />A reference for Henry would be great. I have the paper by Hardy.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Don't compare it to quickly  to mine where 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the assumptions are made still at a much more basic (logical and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical) level. I assume less than Peano arithmetic. I know I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could seem a little bit presomptuous, but nuance would make the post 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more long and more boring. Hope you don't mind, (actually I would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; glad someone criticize the most severely possible my work),
