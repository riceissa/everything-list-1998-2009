<br />
The following is an effort to remove some errors from my description of my 
<br />
idea.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />1) POSTULATE: All counting numbers exist with countably infinite copies in 
<br />
a seething foamy fractal.
<br />
<br />Call this fractal Everything or as I prefer to call it the Superverse S.
<br />
<br />In this fractal every universe Uj is isomorphic to a self sorting sequence 
<br />
Uj(i) of these numbers that, upon chance encounters between numbers, they 
<br />
self sort according to:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)  Pj(i) = {Rj(Uj(i - 1)) + PLj(i)} has the same length in bits as 
<br />
the AIT complexity of Uj(i).
<br />
<br />Where:
<br />
<br />Rj is the fixed rule set of Uj and Rj(Uj(i - 1)) is Rj acting as a 
<br />
comparison filter based on Uj(i - 1).
<br />
<br />Uj(i - 1) is the previous configuration.
<br />
<br />PLj(i) is the program length self delimiter.
<br />
<br />This is similar to the following expression from AIT:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)  P'j(i) = {&quot;Expression&quot; + &quot;Data&quot; + &quot;Self Delimiter&quot;} is the 
<br />
shortest program that can compute Uj(i).
<br />
<br />Here P'j(i) is the actual shortest program that can compute Uj(i), its 
<br />
length in bits is the complexity of Uj(i) so it has the same length as 
<br />
Pj(i).  &quot;Expression&quot; is identical to Rj, but the &quot;Data&quot; may not be Uj(i - 
<br />
1) and the &quot;Self Delimiter&quot; may not be PLj(i).
<br />
<br />The first number encountered that passes the Rj mediated compare becomes 
<br />
the successor to Uj(i - 1)  i.e. Uj(i).  the model is that some Rj's can 
<br />
perform the compare in a partially non deterministic &quot;do not care&quot; fashion 
<br />
and thus Rj can act as a source of &quot;true noise&quot; since the &quot;do not care&quot; 
<br />
sections of the filter will admit any sub string.  The
<br />
consequences of this will be discussed below.
<br />
<br />The relation (1) is like a compressed recursion notation and contains a 
<br />
finite Formal Axiomatic System [f-FAS] that defines Uj. The structure of 
<br />
the f-FAS is:
<br />
<br />a) It initially has a single axiom Aj unique to a particular family of 
<br />
universes which is in Pj(1) as Rj(Aj). It serves as Pj(0).  It is thus the 
<br />
compressed form of Uj(0) and initiates the recursion.
<br />
<br />b) It has a fixed set of rules = Rj which form the comparison filter.
<br />
<br />c) It has an alphabet = differently sequenced strings of bits in Uj that I 
<br />
call types of &quot;regions&quot;.  The axiom Aj contains the entire initial alphabet 
<br />
of regions and simultaneously the initial configuration for a particular 
<br />
universe.
<br />
<br />Thus as stated the equation (1) contains the entire N-bit, f-FAS.
<br />
<br />Each &quot;region&quot; type is modeled as isomorphic to a physical structure that 
<br />
has existence such that the location of a discrete isolated space point u 
<br />
inside a small fixed portion of a space grid is coded by each region 
<br />
type.  [In our case I believe the grid to be 3D and most likely Face 
<br />
Centered Cubic.]  the points can not leave its region but it can relocate 
<br />
within it.
<br />
<br />Uj(i) contains a theorem of this f-FAS giving a specific arrangement of 
<br />
&quot;regions&quot; - a configuration of a particular universe. The structure of 
<br />
Uj(i) using English letters to represent different &quot;region&quot; types would 
<br />
look like the following.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Uj(i) = 
<br />
aaxcvsyplmnjhkkyufpoiiimjkhlyhhhhnkmlpmneidhsu...qaeeerwetgbfvvvdcsdxazjfirjnfjgkkeirejqzq
<br />
<br />To compress this idea I will call each of these a type of sub string u.  In 
<br />
this limited example there are 26 types of sub string u.  For example a = 
<br />
the u 00000100000000, and b = the u 00100000000000.  The location within 
<br />
the string Uj(i) of a particular u identifies the particular grid region it 
<br />
codes and the location of the 1 in each u codes the location of the 
<br />
discrete space point u within that region.
<br />
<br />2) If there were no &quot;true noise&quot; in the system due to the nature of Rj [a 
<br />
fully deterministic Rj] then (1) would be a recursion as follows
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Pj(i) = {Rj(Uj(i - 1)) + PL(i)} computes [proves] Uj(i).
<br />
<br />Since Pj(i) must be longer than Pj(i - 1) [It contains Rj and PLj(i) in 
<br />
addition to the data Uj(i - 1)] unless Uj(i -1) is empty the sequence can 
<br />
not stop with a finite length Pj(i).  Consequently Uj(i) must also grow in 
<br />
length as i counts up.  All &quot;regions&quot; as described above have roughly equal 
<br />
complexity so increased length of Uj(i) means increased
<br />
complexity.  Since Rj is potentially a source of &quot;true noise&quot; if not fully 
<br />
deterministic then this accumulation of information just accelerates.
<br />
<br />To sustain this growth in complexity of Uj(i) the fc-FAS - as per Chaitin - 
<br />
must also increase in complexity.  It does this by randomly [nothing within 
<br />
the Pj(i) can control the process] adding additional alphabet elements - 
<br />
new types of &quot;regions&quot;.  This is also equivalent to &quot;true noise&quot; as well as 
<br />
to starting the sequence over with a new axiom which is now just Uj(i).
<br />
<br />3) Is this f-FAS also consistent?  Even though information can come from 
<br />
&quot;outside&quot; through the nature of the Everything, the possible dynamics of Rj 
<br />
and the necessary growth in the complexity of the FAS and ultimately reside 
<br />
in Uj(i) the FAS is none the less as structured incapable of proving both A 
<br />
and not A so it is consistent - an fc-FAS.
<br />
<br />Thus there are two potential sources of &quot;true noise&quot; in the model.
<br />
<br />4) How does the potential &quot;true noise&quot; nature of Rj impact the logic system 
<br />
during the sorting process?  Relation (1) is really saying that there is 
<br />
not necessarily enough data in Uj(i - 1) but the required additional bits 
<br />
to make Pj(i) the same length as P'j(i) will reside in PLj(i).  The 
<br />
consequent is that as a comparator based process Rj would have to be
<br />
applied to a string longer than Uj(i - 1) if we are to get to P'j(i).  So 
<br />
Uj(i) is longer - it has more &quot;regions&quot; - than Uj(i - 1).  Thus in the 
<br />
following:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Pj(i + 1) = {Rj(Uj(i)) + PLj(i + 1)}  has the same length in bits 
<br />
as the AIT complexity of Uj(i + 1),
<br />
<br />Uj(i) acts like a new initiating axiom.
<br />
<br />5) When Uj(i) gets to have a countably infinite number of bits the sequence 
<br />
ends since there are no larger numbers in the Superverse.
<br />
<br />The fractal contains all universes potentially an infinite number of times.
<br />
<br />6) Alternate beginning: No numbers exist.  This is the &quot;Nothing&quot;.  This is 
<br />
unstable logically. It contains no answer to its own stability which it 
<br />
must address.  It decays into the above fractal which is sufficient to 
<br />
contain the answer.
<br />
<br />Once Nothing becomes Everything in an attempt to answer its own stability, 
<br />
the question of the stability of Nothing is no longer meaningful to 
<br />
Everything neither is &quot;Nothing?&quot; itself, so Everything is now stuck as 
<br />
Everything.
<br />
<br />The relation (1) is just spontaneous self replication with mutation, in 
<br />
another word Life - as a minimum it is present  in every universe as itself.
