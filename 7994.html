Hi John,
<br />
<br />You referred me to your web page on &quot;Science Religion, a Historical  
<br />
View&quot;. Here:
<br />
<a href="http://pages.prodigy.net/jamikes/SciRelMay00.html">http://pages.prodigy.net/jamikes/SciRelMay00.html</a>
<br />
<br />I read it with great interest. I could agree up to a point, which I  
<br />
will try to make clear. And then I comment your last post.
<br />
<br />You are using human natural science and human science (history) to  
<br />
relativize religion.
<br />
And then you are doing the same to relativize an, admittedly  
<br />
widespread, &quot;religious&quot; belief in science (say).
<br />
&quot;Religious&quot; with quote is always put for some pejorative view of  
<br />
religion, that is a view with &quot;authoritative arguments&quot;.
<br />
<br />Somehow let me say that I agree 99,9999999999999999...%. But it  
<br />
remains a stubbornly infinitesimal point of disagreement (even if I  
<br />
totally follow your critical conclusions on the &quot;religious&quot; science).
<br />
<br />To make clearer my critic, I will relate it with both Descartes  
<br />
systematic doubting procedure (which I would argue is at the origin  
<br />
of modern theoretical sciences), and the Buddhist notion of *the  
<br />
center of the wheel&quot; which provides a good image.
<br />
<br />Of course I don't know what is a human being. But, as you know, for  
<br />
reason of clarity and modesty, I have *choose* a theory, and I have  
<br />
even choose a theory sufficiently precise so that we can derive  
<br />
precise conclusions. All what I say must be remembered as having been  
<br />
casted in the frame of that theory.
<br />
<br />I don't want to be specific on the details. The theory, in its  
<br />
intuitive description appears already in &quot;The question of King  
<br />
Milinda&quot; and many other old &quot;religious texts&quot;, but in his modern  
<br />
form, applied to animals, it is attributed to Descartes and is called  
<br />
&quot;mechanism&quot;, and I take the digital restriction: digital mechanism,  
<br />
or computationalism, or just comp.
<br />
<br />Now, with comp, there is a little problem in your strategy. If human  
<br />
are machines, by using human sciences to relativize human science,  
<br />
you will applied a computable transformation on the space of the  
<br />
computable transformations, and it can be shown that you will get a  
<br />
fixed point. It is like making rotating a wheel: all its points- 
<br />
propositions will move (put in doubt) and be relativized except one:  
<br />
the center of the wheel.
<br />
<br />This fixed point is related to the space of the un-doubtable, but the  
<br />
epistemological price of comp will be that science must be  
<br />
(provably!) modest. All (sufficiently rich, universal) theories are  
<br />
necessarily hypothetical. This happens when we enlarge the space of  
<br />
the sound human platonist reasoner into the space of the Lobian  
<br />
machines.
<br />
<br />What is the fixed point? in a nutshell it is science itself, but  
<br />
where science is understood as an ideal of communication conditionned  
<br />
by hypothetical statements (some scientists forget this; most forget  
<br />
this when talking on colleagues' fields).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You put the finger on one of the main difficulty to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; keep the dialog
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; between logician and physicist: they interchange,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; almost but alas not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; completely, the use of the words &quot;theory&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;models&quot;. Logicians use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the word &quot;model&quot; for the intended reality they want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to describe with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theory (like the painter how call the naked person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in front of him, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; model). The painting, is the theory, the little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; things we put on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; paper.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; JM: $fine. I like that kind of 'model' if she(!) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pretty.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I differentiate also the &quot;simulation&quot; model, as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical or physical simulation of a thing to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it accessible to our feeble knowledge. Now MY model:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as you know I think in totality (wholeness) at least I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; try. Our mind is incapable of envompassing ALL, so we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; select segments we can handle (if we can...) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; REDUCE our vision to them (=MY reductionism). Such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; segment is a (MY) model if it disregards the 'rest of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world' (as it should to serve our feeble mind). It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be a person, a theory, a science-topic, a thought,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a car, or anything topically (or functionally)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surrounded by boundaries (our mental model-horizon). I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; took the word from Robert Rosen. A limited model is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what we can use in our thinking. If we widen it beyond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ALL boundaries it becomes a &quot;natural system&quot;, maximum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model (nonsense) = the 'thing' itself. This is my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vocabulary and you cannot argue about it - it is MINE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (ha ha).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is nothing wrong with model-thinking, it helped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us to all we know of the world and to our technology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not to 'understanding' the connections.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Why? There is only a (necessary) problem with understanding  
<br />
'understanding'
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wriong it is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if we draw 'universal' conclusions from considerations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; upon a model - regard it universally valid.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I have no models in that sense. The theory which is isolated from the  
<br />
machine's interview is embeddable in number theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sciences (including I think logics, which is cut to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the thinking habits of the HUMAN brain (mind).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />No. It is build frrom the consideration of being the less dependent  
<br />
on prejudices or even just meanings. And there are many many logics.  
<br />
You should explain why you think science (and not its mediatic  
<br />
&quot;religious&quot; perception) is cut for human thinking habits, when the  
<br />
whole story of science and logic illustrates a (never ending)  
<br />
abstraction of all our contingent conditions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physix
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a model, with all the 'explanations' WITHIN the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />For those who assumes the explanation-closeness of the physical  
<br />
world. Not everyone accept this, and it is well know that all physics  
<br />
attempt to get a coherent talk of consciousness, mind and first  
<br />
person have failed. As for me, the concept of a physical world is  
<br />
just epistemologically incompatible with my working hypothesis.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Von Bertalanffy's System Kohler's Gestalt opened the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way and Bohm made it the implicate (sort of). Rosen is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lost in explaining within the science language for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reductionist audience (he was (+1998) a mathematician-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biologist) and started to generalize from models. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; started from generalities (nothingness) and &quot;modelled&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down myself to common (human!) sense. We met. (Never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in person, I even did not read his books).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The thing IMO is future thinking, not as you put it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; below. We don't even have expressions to talk with.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Rosen has misunderstood the impact of Church thesis. I think. We can  
<br />
come back on this.
<br />
An excellent book on Church Thesis is Judson Webb's book (ref in my  
<br />
Lille thesis, in my url).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We will come back on this but remember that once you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; say yes to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; doctor (for the artificial brain) then that brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; does not vehiculate a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; model of you, but you yourself (assuming comp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; $I am not clear with that 'doctor' if it is a machine,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it can only 'vehiculate' within its boundaries: a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model of me. &quot;I&quot; am part of the totality with certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; affinities (I am just working on how to define that)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which make me LOOK like an individual. Maybe 'comp'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may help, (again something not clear to me).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I definitely think it could.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; $which of course are all models cut from the total
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inteconnectedness by topical boundaries. Incl: theory.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />The third person description are indeed cut from that  
<br />
interconnectedness, given that you comp 'soul&quot; can be &quot;saved&quot; on a  
<br />
finite disk. The first person keep all its whole-related infinite  
<br />
interconnectedness. Actually comp protects that first person. Comp is  
<br />
really a vaccine against all namable reductionism.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Except in politics, I would say big regression,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; isn't it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; $No, I see the same brutal beast with different tools.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; More organization, more hypocrisy, more sneaky/lying.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />OK. But much less blood, and much less starvation.
<br />
Much less sincere spiritual concerns, but that has a long complex  
<br />
history.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; $depending how you define as the nonreligious theology
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Truth *about* machine   (as opposed to truth provable by (correct)  
<br />
machine)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a pantheistic wholeness? then I agree.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />&quot;pantheistic wholeness&quot;?  is still but a (human) name. Sound lobian  
<br />
machine are more wise by staying mute, here.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is god
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in such weird idea: the change? the interconnection?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the informative efficiency? Ask me 200 years from now.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Never ask me. If you have the cognitive ability to understand an  
<br />
answer (which I don't have), you would have the ability to get the  
<br />
answer by yourself.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Of course I have use &quot;religion&quot; in its pejorative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sense; its means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; anything using authoritative argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The nest millenia? It will be &quot;pschhht!&quot; or,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something like an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; uncontrollable creative big bang, from what I smell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from comp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; $Pessimist! We came a long way from the cave and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before that, I am an optimist, unless we overshoot our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own intelligence (do we really have sone?) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-destruct.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />This is more or less what I was trying to say.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not humanity, it will be over within a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; century,
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />If there is just one present or future, there will be continua of  
<br />
future for humanity.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but the biosphere with its evolving conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creatures in the run. Thinking clouds? non-matterics?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />In those futures where  humanity lasts, humanity will take many  
<br />
shapes. What is important is memory of its past(s): geographies and  
<br />
history.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I keep my mind open as long as it works.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I wish you the best,
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
