<br />I'm still not sure I've communicated this 'primitivity' correctly, but
<br />
IMO comp (in 'pure' AR+CT+YD form) achieves what you claim at the cost
<br />
of coherence about 'existence' (see below).
<br />
<br />(BTW, is it simply the case that 'existence' in the sense described
<br />
below is not really your concern? When you said that grandma was 'very
<br />
very close indeed', what else is needed for Achilles to get abreast of
<br />
the tortoise, if I may thus egregiously mix my metaphors?)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So yes, there is just a tiny difference between us. I just doubt you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can axiomatize your first person indexical seriousness in a simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third person way. If comp is correct, you can't, I think, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually this gives a protection of the first person against
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normative theories.
</em><br />
<br />But this suggests to me that comp, in the 'instantiation-free' AR+CT+YD
<br />
sense, *cannot* be correct, precisely because it makes 'existential'
<br />
claims for the 'axiomatisation of indexical existence in a 3rd-person
<br />
way'. The key issue here is surely the distinction between 'existence'
<br />
and 'truth' as Peter specifies in his post to me. Indexical seriousness
<br />
is believing that whatever exists does so 'in the sense that I exist'.
<br />
(The 'infinity' of this sense must be resolved within the infinity or
<br />
otherwise of whatever exists.) 'Truth' is an abstraction from whatever
<br />
exists, and there is no justification for hypothesising it to 'exist'
<br />
in any other sense whatsoever. Truths are 'dispositions to believe' -
<br />
highly organised metaphors, no more, just as 'I' am. What they are
<br />
'about' is other features of what exists, and this situation exists
<br />
self-referentially solely 'in the sense that I exist'. AR, CT, etc. are
<br />
functional instantiations of such metaphors within what exists. They
<br />
are just one part of what exists modelling another.
<br />
<br />My view is that 'participation in what exists' exhausts what we can
<br />
'modestly' claim as 'axiomatic'. We agree, I think, that it is our
<br />
unique source of knowledge of anything whatsoever. Consequently, it
<br />
seems to me perverse to reject its brutely 'given' status in any
<br />
schematisation of 'what exists'. I think you seek to overcome this by
<br />
giving 'truth' primacy and then deriving 'what exists' from this. I
<br />
know you believe that this is a 'modest' assumption, but IMO its
<br />
modesty cannot compensate for its incoherence.
<br />
<br />I would challenge you to demonstrate any natural language specifiable
<br />
meaning of truth that is not a mapping between putative features of
<br />
'what exists in the sense that I exist'. Mathematical truth is a
<br />
special version of this, the 'putative features' here being
<br />
metaphorised as highly abstracted/ highly structured 'mathematical
<br />
objects'. Ditto logic. The fact that a logical or mathematical analysis
<br />
can show what 3rd-person (i.e. logically) specifiable entities 'would
<br />
believe' is epistemologically insightful but existentially neither here
<br />
nor there, because the logic is the *model*, not the *referent*. And
<br />
it's the referent that 'possesses' the belief, not the model.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;I agree with Peter (1Z) when
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he criticize you by saying that a person is something complex, and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree with Dennett when he says that something complex must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explained by something easier.
</em><br />
<br />The 'sense in which I exist' is not dependent on my complexity. It's
<br />
rather the *bare participation* of 'whatever-I-am' in what exists, not
<br />
the specifics of this (as Peter points out, his formulation exists
<br />
precisely to leave questions of detail open). Consequently, what I've
<br />
been calling 'indexical' or '1st person' existence (and obviously these
<br />
are bad terms because they lead to such misunderstanding) is *not*
<br />
complex, and avoids Dennett's criticism, and also Peter's (because the
<br />
same confusion had unfortunately arisen between us).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes and that is normal. I reduce the mystery of &quot;here and now&quot; to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much simpler mysteries of the type:  &quot;why am I in Washington and not in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Moscow&quot;, or &quot;why am I in Moscow and not in Washington&quot; after a WM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-duplication experiment. Surely with comp you could figure out that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those questions, although first person meaningful, are third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningless. NO?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but I don't think these conclusions are dependent on comp. They
<br />
are simply an aspect of point-of-view, or the localising effect of
<br />
'information horizons'. Identity is global, point-of-view is local. My
<br />
criticism was not this, but rather against the invocation of 'global
<br />
indexicality' as an artefact of 3rd person models. Metaphorically, 3rd
<br />
person is 'over there', indexical necessity 'over here'. You can't make
<br />
something appear 'over here', whatever you do 'over there', because
<br />
what's 'over there' is just your *story* about what's going on 'over
<br />
here'. So my point is that the story about 'indexicality' has to be
<br />
understood as referring in all points to what is happening 'over here'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and would consequently have to decline the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; doctor's offer. This is what I mean by non-invariance of experiential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; structure to Turing emulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?
</em><br />
<br />I would address your '?' with reference to instantiation. Saying 'yes'
<br />
to the doctor is acquiescing to instantiation of some kind, whether
<br />
'static' (stored) or 'dynamic' (executed). In either case it
<br />
encompasses arbitrarily many physical architectures that just happen to
<br />
be 'syntactically' equivalent. So the 'non-invariance' I refer to would
<br />
be semantic/ experiential. Denying this is to claim the irrelevance of
<br />
the 'physical' layer to correct substitution in comp (even though this
<br />
layer 'emerges' from comp). Why is this justified?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is the correct incorrigibility of the first person which prevents
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her to participate in the third person discourse. Although she is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct, and here I follow you completely with the idea of being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maximally serious about that correctness, she have to stay mute, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not falling into incorrectness, or even inconsistency.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some truth just cannot be 3-asserted without becoming a falsity.
</em><br />
<br />So how then can we say anything, Dr Wittgenstein?

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (BTW please delete any previous version of this posted in error.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm absolutely sincere in what I've said about approaching comp in 'as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if' mode.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All right. I thought so. Let us try to see if and where we differ.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But at the same time I've hoped from the beginning that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could make explicit the choices that motivate our different ontic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; starting assumptions. Are there perhaps irreconcilable issues of style
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or preference, or are there fundamental logical, philosophical, or even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; semantic errors entailed in one or other position? Well, let me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; continue in the effort by trying to clarify my position on some of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; recent points.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; So, either you put in AR something which is not there (like peter D
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Jones who want me doing &quot;Aristotle error&quot; on the numbers (like if I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; reifying some concreteness about them), or you should have a powerful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; argument against AR, but then you should elaborate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; To be honest I have not yet seen where you postulates comp wrong in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; your long anti-roadmap post.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Recall that I take comp as YD + CT + AR (Yes Doctor + Church Thesis +
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Arithmetical Realism).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; OK.  I've already agreed to accept AR in 'as if' mode. So that implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm staying on the comp road in the same 'as if' spirit to see where it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; leads. It's very interesting! Also I genuinely think that AR is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'false' from any of the *logical* perspectives from which you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; defend it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My problem - outside 'as if' mode (and this goes back to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'primacy' issue) - is with adopting *any* essentially 'non-indexical'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (or in Colin's usage 'non-situated') postulate as 'ontic ground zero'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My view - and I'm still not clear whether you think it unjustified, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that you simply *prefer* to start elsewhere - is that we go wrong the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; moment we fail to treat reflexive indexical necessity with maximal -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *extreme* - seriousness. My most basic claim is that to make *any*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; non-indexical assumption primary - even one as apparently 'modest' as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; AR - is to try to 'sneak past' this, and thereby to fail *the* crucial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; test of ontic realism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because comp makes it possible to postulate a simple theory where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything is communicable in a third person way. By making the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person primitive, you loose the ability to explain it (or to get some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; best possible third person explanation). I agree with Peter (1Z) when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he criticize you by saying that a person is something complex, and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree with Dennett when he says that something complex must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explained by something easier. Now comp shows the ultimate fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; role of the first person, and that is why I appreciate your seriousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here, and in principle you still could try to formalize it in a third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person way, but your last attempt led to some explosion of more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complicated concepts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The same remark works when you are making &quot;indexical&quot; primitive,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; although &quot;indexical&quot; can be translated in purely third person way (that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is exactly what Post, Turing, Godel ... Kleene have proved). The case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of platonist or classical machine gives rise to the indexical but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purely arithmetical &quot;provability predicate&quot; B, and this one is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quasi-primitive in the sense that all others notions of persons (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypostases) are variant of B.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So yes, there is just a tiny difference between us. I just doubt you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can axiomatize your first person indexical seriousness in a simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third person way. If comp is correct, you can't, I think, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually this gives a protection of the first person against
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normative theories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To sum up, the notion of first person is too complex to be be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primitive, especially when you see that comp explains why the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person is correct when thinking it is primitive (but false by trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; put this in a third person discourse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And the, unlike Peter, I consider that the notion of &quot;matter&quot; is also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complex, and assuming it also thhrows away any hope foir explanation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and then comp forbid that move anyway by the UDA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We could call this position maximal personal, or indexical,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seriousness, but what's in a name? It frustrates me almost beyond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; endurance that this isn't simply 'obvious' (though error, especially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one's own, is subtle).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As a first person discourse, comp tells that you are correct. As a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third person discourse you are on the verge of inconsistency.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But it seems as though we're somehow 'tricked'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; out of seeing it because all 'personal' interaction (including that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with the 'self') is relational, and 3rd-person is the characteristic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mode of relational interaction. So all natural language just assumes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Consequently when you say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; What you say is exactly what the lobian *first person* will feel.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; hope you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; see this eventually.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think I do 'see' it. I understand that the lobian first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *emerging* from your non-indexical AR postulate could indeed be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; decribed as 'possessing' such a view. I can indeed 'see' how you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; invoke a '1st-person David analog' in 3rd-person language in this way,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but I can't at all see how this causes 'indexically necessary David' -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'here and now' - to appear out of 'thin 3rd-person air'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes and that is normal. I reduce the mystery of &quot;here and now&quot; to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much simpler mysteries of the type:  &quot;why am I in Washington and not in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Moscow&quot;, or &quot;why am I in Moscow and not in Washington&quot; after a WM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-duplication experiment. Surely with comp you could figure out that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those questions, although first person meaningful, are third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningless. NO?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Does mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; logic posess such power?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bertrand Russell thought so, but technically speaking logic is not that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; powerful (at all). Now Arithmetic is *that* powerful, amazingly enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It seems as if only magic will do. It's like

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Harry Potter saying - &quot;I know I'm just imagining you, but hang on, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; just a jiffy AR will make you indexically necessary&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No need of Harry Potter. If you are a digital machine,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (self-referentially correct or not) your current computational steps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will occur at a time (an infinity of time, but note that time here is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just given by the ordering of non negative integers), making you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;relatively necessary&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And then modal logic and Kripke &quot;multiverse&quot; has been invented to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; handle those notion of &quot;relative necessity&quot;. And the Godel &quot;B&quot; is quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rich in that respect.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; On the other hand, bare 'indexical necessity' is the sole ontic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; postulate I need.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is as correct as it is uncommunicable. &quot;First person ndexical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessity&quot; is true ... until you posit it as an axiom. My feeling is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you perhaps just confuse ... Bp and Bp &amp; p.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Is this an insufficiently 'modest' requirement? My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; justification is reflexively evident and incorrigible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Bp &amp; p&quot; is (obviously) incorrigible, but that is related with the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that no indexically correct machine can posit it as an hypothesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, no machine can even define its own indexical Bp &amp; p. To act
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a scientist, the machine, like the doctor,  can talk only on Bp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now a machine can make the complete theory of both Bp and Bp &amp; p for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any lobian machine sufficiently simpler than itself. Like ZF can prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the G* of PA, but not its own. The erst then follow from the comp hyp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It does no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; practical damage to the subsequent postulation of AR - it can't do,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; because this position simply *is* the situation from which I postulate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it. By the same token, CT survives (if true) undamaged by being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; postulated from this position. In other words, I'm claiming that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have access to versions of AR and CT manifested entirely in virtue of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; their generalisation from relational reality, and I can't see that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or I have reason to believe anything else, except through 'Penrose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; direct revelation', which you reject. So what's the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; alternative?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; YD now becomes the interesting case, and the point, as I recall, where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we started. My long post refers to the dependencies and assumptions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; implicit in bit-stream representations, that are only made explicit by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; their instantiation. My argument is that any digital program is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; arbitrary gloss on the behaviour of a 'substrate' (i.e. lower logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; level) - I think I've seen you argue more or less the same point - and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; therefore relies on a notion of 'causation' (dependency, sequence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; structure, behaviour, or state your preferred terminology) - that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; essentially non-local at the level of such instantiation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Consequently we must choose: to believe either that *any* example of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; situated, indexical, experience arises from localised phenomena at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; causal level of their instantiation (appropriately schematised), or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that it arises from arbitrary, non-localised, aspatial, atemporal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; abstractions from behaviour at this level. I can't see that these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; considerations don't apply to *any* digital 'substitution level' that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relies on a purely syntactical expression - e.g. instantiation in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; digital computer -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and would consequently have to decline the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; doctor's offer. This is what I mean by non-invariance of experiential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; structure to Turing emulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; However, the question then becomes one of defining the 'level' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; instantiation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is part of the 1-indeterminacy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You have pointed out, I recall, that the comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; assumptions leave 'matter' devoid of any unique explanatory function.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This isn't a surprise surely, because 'matter' is defined purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relationally as behaviour.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can agree. No physicist posit matter in a fundamental theory. Except
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by expression like &quot;let B be a field, ...&quot;. But I have not yet find a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter postulate in fundamental physics, not even in Aristotle (yet).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Be that as it may, why would we ever expect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a purely relational or behavioural description *on its own* to invoke
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; prior indexical necessity in my maximally serious sense?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why indeed?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; such a prior ontic postulate, any relational schema surely 'exists'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; only in 'Harry Potter space'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; With it, 'matter' becomes a causal layer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in the construction of experience and everything we infer from it. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we can schematise this in a way that proves capable of 'substitution',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; YD would then emerge as an empirical possibility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'from the bottom up'. In effect, to say 'yes' to the doctor would be to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; agree to be cloned.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So, in summary, if comp were presented as a relational substitution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; scheme defined on prior, maximally serious ontic necessity - in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sense - from which AR, CT and YD emerge at the appropriate relational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; level, I could perhaps travel with you even more happily. I just can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; see, except in 'as if' mode, how AR truly serves as 'ontic ground zero'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in this 'maximally serious' sense. I'd be grateful if you could show me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; how this is false. Or is it rather that modesty dictates that comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; takes us no further than 'as if'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not just comp. I would say of any scientific theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And then with comp this can be justify through B and its variants
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (hypostases).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is the correct incorrigibility of the first person which prevents
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her to participate in the third person discourse. Although she is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct, and here I follow you completely with the idea of being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maximally serious about that correctness, she have to stay mute, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not falling into incorrectness, or even inconsistency.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some truth just cannot be 3-asserted without becoming a falsity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Must go now,
</em><br />
