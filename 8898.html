- Five (expanded software acts)
<br />
<br />a KOP + xxxxx collaboration
<br />
in association with Open Congress and Boxing Club
<br />
<br />With an aim at developing a working module for agenda setting and
<br />
self-organisation, PLENUM further explores the tension between the
<br />
individual and the group voice, the human material and machine factor,
<br />
the coming together and the falling apart, ultimately, the potential
<br />
escalation of arguments leading to the (un)avoidable crash of
<br />
self-made social units. Hopefully, a final walk out to River Thames at
<br />
sunrise would revive the drained codes and souls.
<br />
<br />Totally Expanded Software Exercise Bike Supreme Work Out
<br />
<br />PLENUM/xxxxx
<br />
Five (expanded?) software acts
<br />
<br />Software is concerned with an interface which operates in two
<br />
directions - from the realm of speculative or expanded software
<br />
(aka. the social) to the reduced yet equally effective realm of
<br />
codified software and (as output, as interference, as noise) the entry
<br />
of executed results back. A repetitive return trip. A two way street.
<br />
<br />The code here is concerned with that which can be exchanged (or mapped
<br />
over) on this interface. On the machine side that which is knowable
<br />
for the patch - time, sound as data (amplitude and thus frequency
<br />
which then opens up to statistical analysis across various domains),
<br />
and, as we will have 8 microphones distributed in the room,
<br />
space. Simulation, and code herrings push things further.
<br />
<br />On the other side, the human, and within a narrow context the meta,
<br />
the xxxxx/PLENUM experiment attempts a simultaneous overmapping of
<br />
both realms using operatic, logical and holographic technique dressed
<br />
up in the emperor's new clothes; the expanded software script (human)
<br />
translated into machine and meta-human-machine operation.
<br />
<br />Software is substance. Software is script; a switch comprising one
<br />
element of the meta-CPU of the world on a wire.

<br />
<br />The crash that dare not speak its name; the xxxxx of atomic culture
<br />
within radically externalised computation, outside the observed
<br />
system. Modulation of the message begins, frequency becomes data
<br />
carrier for an urgent transmission; of software and substance rendered
<br />
equivalent under an expansive, digital universe as idea. Viral
<br />
execution of the source code programming results in a series of events
<br />
intensely orchestrated from discourse to noise, to granular
<br />
demodulation, the slur into entropy. Hours of screenings, discourse
<br />
and performance are possibly simulated, running highly speculative
<br />
software built from multiple components and sources, varying modes of
<br />
presentation and revelation heralding a computational revolution in
<br />
art and science.
<br />
<br />The code that comprises xxxxx is executed with reflexive data input
<br />
from Terminalbeach (Erich Berger and Pure), machinic still life and
<br />
networked cinematographix, microtonal drone god Phill Niblock, and
<br />
decadent networkers Farmers Manual. A descent into noise is vocalised
<br />
with supremely concrete performance from Joachim Montessuiss. Numerous
<br />
participants collaborate extensively within a totally unprecedented
<br />
and severely overheated lineup including Russell Haswell's and Florian
<br />
Hecker's UPIC diffusion session making use of an innovative sound
<br />
synthesis system devised by Iannis Xenakis, Takeshi Fumimoto/dieb13's
<br />
Jekyll and Hyde turntablism, and the analogue spume of Jason Kahn's
<br />
interior excess.
<br />
<br />Sensorialist Adriana Sa and NYC sound artist Toshio Kajiwara entertain
<br />
entropic elision, proposing a joyful new world interface to sound
<br />
making. Andy Bolus reverses the terms and trajectory of this
<br />
sensor-ship with refried Dada-ist and dark Shamanistic intent. To
<br />
further burn out the mix of all worlds code end, touching the very
<br />
blind edge of simulation, of crash and post-crash and xxxxx, a crazed
<br />
trilogy of USA and H bomb-based noise artists Kevin Drumm, Aaron
<br />
Dilloway and John Wiese sear the stage with savage feedback and
<br />
neuronic mayhem. crash real.

<br />
<br />xxxxx23 introduces a fascinating sphere of active discourse rarely
<br />
encountered in the UK, engaging with the rich consequences of expanded
<br />
software. Key thinkers include Otto Roessler, pioneering a view of the
<br />
world as interface, provide a solid conceptual background. Code art
<br />
gurus Florian Cramer and Olga Goriunova magnify contemporary unleashed
<br />
software. Art prankster Stewart Home, Graham Harwood from Mongrel and
<br />
various ap and socialfiction.org protagonists assess an original
<br />
interface, a particular world view informed by expansive life
<br />
software. Bruno Marchal, interrogating artificial intelligence
<br />
concerns, further opens the terms of code to embrace consciousness and
<br />
the universe, as the switched entry into noise is processed with input
<br />
from exploratory artist Shu Lea Cheang [PLENUM insertion with Ilze
<br />
Black and Armin Medosch]. Spectacular interruptions from renowned
<br />
mystical sound artist Leif Elggren and Yves Degoyon's self-destructive

<br /><br />4] xxxxx crystalpunk workshop at studio 22 22nd March 12pm to 6pm entry free
<br />
<br />Crystalpunk is a rally cry for people to come together and start
<br />
making all sorts of weird things, things slightly of kilter that need
<br />
a crystalpunk to have its delights appreciated, things that are
<br />
radical but hurt nobody.
<br />
<br />Other people, professionals, are making things too. In art, in
<br />
architecture, in computer science, in biology, crystalpunks want to
<br />
share in their excitement, often feeling it more than they do, but
<br />
understanding it through reverie not formalism.
<br />
<br />At socialfiction.org we have been thinking about gargoyle computation
<br />
[rococo automated search &amp; gargoylisation not optimisation], software
<br />
as a crystal ball [cellular automata as discrete little worlds that
<br />
hide complex operations creating universe to be discovered by its
<br />
users], pattern formation [put your fingers on your closed eyelids &amp;
<br />
press gently], non conventional computing [molecule based &amp; sea
<br />
based], unintentional intelligence [the wildtype adaptivism of
<br />
BacterioPoetics]. Somewhere in the middle we started writing a
<br />
chain-reaction automaton: on the GUI a Grid, inside it rectangles are
<br />
activated to rotate one step, activating others to rotate one step of
<br />
4 on close contact. The crystalpunk can interact with it: creating
<br />
patterns, signalling it and monitoring its output. But the rules that
<br />
guide its movement are mind boggling gargoyly. Can it Compute? Can it
<br />
loop forever? These and many other questions are to be explored during
<br />
this workshop.
<br />
<br />The script we have made is a sloppy bit of Python code and in this
<br />
workshop we invite you to make thing [fractalline patterns, logic
<br />
gates, literature, self-destructing embroidery forms] on top of it.
<br />
<br />Please bring your computer if you have one.
<br />

<br />5] holographic xxxxx at SPACE 20th March 7.30pm to 10.30pm entry free
<br />
<br />Neurophysiologist Karl Pribram investigates the Spectral Holographic 
<br />
Domain: in Brain, Navigation and the Universe.
<br />
<br />Karl Pribram is the leading exponent of a holonomic theory of the 
<br />
human brain backed up by hefty experimental research. All parts 
<br />
contain the story of the whole, with the term holonomic referring to 
<br />
a dynamic or changing hologram.
<br />
<br />A hologram is a total writing of a scene, a completely realistic 
<br />
three-dimensional representation. Every part of the hologram contains 
<br />
information about the whole; cut up a hologram into small pieces and 
<br />
the original image remains visible, all of the information is intact; 
<br />
the window on the world is solely reduced.
<br />
<br />Holography presents a transformation from the spatial into the 
<br />
frequency domain such as is enacted by the Fourier transform formula; 
<br />
holocaustic mathematics enabled by Leibniz' prime transformational 
<br />
tool, the discretising integral of Gravity's Rainbow.
<br />
<br />In the reverse direction, Light is in the frequency or holographic 
<br />
domain. An inverse Fourier transform is enacted by a lens which can 
<br />
focus a beam of light, converting the frequency nature of the 
<br />
information into a spatial image:
<br />
<br />Remove the converging lens in a slide projector that forms the image. 
<br />
Place a slide in the projector and project the light onto a screen. 
<br />
No image will form. Technically, the light incident on the screen is 
<br />
in a holographic form. Each point on the screen is receiving 
<br />
information from every point from the slide. If a converging lens is 
<br />
placed at a location between the screen and the slide projector an 
<br />
image can be formed on the screen. The lens can now be moved to new 
<br />
locations in a plane cutting through the light path to the screen and 
<br />
in each case a complete image is formed (Taylor, 1978).
<br />
<br />The consequences of such domain transforms within the context of 
<br />
consciousness are extreme. xxxxx pairs Karl Pribram's lecture with a 
<br />
rare screening of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's sci-fi magnum opus Welt 
<br />
am Draht.
<br />
<br />A world where one is able to make projections of people with a 
<br />
computer. And of course that leads to the uncertainty of whether 
<br />
someone is himself a projection, since in this virtual world the 
<br />
projections resemble reality. Perhaps another larger world made us a 
<br />
virtual one? In this sense it deals with an old philosophical model, 
<br />
which here takes on a certain horror (RWF)
<br />
<br />Transformations enacted by both the lens of Pribram and of Fassbinder 
<br />
open up the total consequences of the universe as hologram under a 
<br />
rereading of the instantaneous communication of totally distant 
<br />
subatomic particles. Holographic theory presents a radical view of 
<br />
reality which well connects with monadology and computation, with a 
<br />
stress on the framing of perception, the question of which 
<br />
abstraction or domain we inter information within.

<br />- taken literally
<br />
- presented using information technology.
<br />
<br />A performance by Karl Heinz Jeron and Valie Djordjevic
<br />
<br />For a long time I would to go to bed early. Sometimes, the candle
<br />
barely out, my eyes closed so quickly that I did not have the time to
<br />
tell myself: I'm falling asleep. Marcel Proust, In Search of Lost Time
<br />
<br />The performance A la recherche du temps perdu takes the code
<br />
literally. We are reading the machine-code version of Marcel Proust's
<br />
novel. During the eight hours of a working day the human performers
<br />
are playing computer. From the analog to the digital and back again:
<br />
The sequence of events of the performance is described in this
<br />
manual. Starting from the ASCII-Version of Marcel Proust's novel A la
<br />
recherche du temps perdu it is then re-coded into its underlying zeros
<br />
and ones and then read by two performers alternately (one is reading
<br />
the zeros, the other one the ones). The third person is CPU (the
<br />
Central Processing Unit): She interprets the zeros and ones with the
<br />
aid of an ASCII allocation table, cuts out the corresponding letter
<br />
from the prepared sheets and turns it over to Display, who sticks it
<br />
onto the wall panel. After eight hours of performance about 250
<br />
characters can be processed. During the act of reading, interpreting
<br />
and presenting the work of art emerges, posing questions about the
<br />
nature of the digital and the analogue, of work and art, time and
<br />
beauty.

<br />
March 18th 12pm to 11pm entry free
<br />
<br />Free software isn't just about open applications, it's about exposed
<br />
and extruded code, and a modular, highly constructivist approach to
<br />
data; environmental code, physical code, tangible code. Code is
<br />
data. Data is code. Code bends data. Noise to signal ratio over signal
<br />
to noise.
<br />
<br />As part of the xxxxx series of exploratory events ap, Mongrel and
<br />
friends present an experimental one day workshop and evening
<br />
performance event examining varying approaches to data bending and
<br />
free software noise.
<br />
<br />ap, forcing the extension of free software exposure in the wilderness
<br />
of computational destruction, will examine base approaches to
<br />
commandline tools such as cat, split and dd in relation to raw OS
<br />
nature. After a brief introduction to their work, including abstract
<br />
computation in the Californian desert, workshop participants can
<br />
explore virtual machine tools created by ap including ap0202 and
<br />
self. Piping data, shifting data, bending data means connectivity as
<br />
we explore connections in the Unix world and beyond, introducing the
<br />
highly versatile Pd (Pure Data) environment.
<br />
<br />Code and network artist and co-founder of Goto10, Aymeric Mansoux
<br />
picks up the Pd ball and runs with it, introducing a very physical
<br />
dimension which will be further explored in his evening performance;
<br />
data needs a real carrier, in this instance voltage. Voltage is
<br />
readily transformed into sound by way of amplifier and
<br />
loudspeaker. The concrete relation is clear, simple and
<br />
beautiful. Noise.
<br />
<br />ap, Aymeric, noise luminaries and physical coders from the UK free
<br />
software art scene lead the workshop into an evening of free
<br />
noise. Again the physical, again the real. The (new) medium surely
<br />
isn't the message. Abhorrent concrete noise cancels out the signal to
<br />
achieve only exposed systematics. Crash JelliedEel.

<br />8] From Ripper to Stripper. A Psychogeographical walk around the City
<br />
and East End. Meet Aldgate tube station March 16th 6pm entry free
<br />
<br />Stewart Home remaps the 1960s London 'nude murders' attributed to the
<br />
uncaught Jack The Stripper, onto an earlier series of sex killings of
<br />
prostitutes, the Victorian Jack The Ripper murders. Since the
<br />
locations at which the bodies were found (and these are not in all
<br />
instances the actual murder sites) have change dramatically since the
<br />
killings, it seems reasonable to treat the sites of one series of
<br />
murders as belonging to the other. This is about historical resonance
<br />
and the difficulties of physically revisiting the past, rather than
<br />
historical accuracy.
