Hi John,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could you tell in one sentence YOUR identification for logic?

<br />That is a difficult question, and to be honest, I am still searching.  
<br />
As a platonist (that is: classical logician) I am OK with the idea  
<br />
that logic is the abstract (domain independent) study of the laws of  
<br />
thought, although I would add probability theory to it (like Boole).
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the rest ab out what we have no idea  today yet.
</em><br />
<br />I can agree with this, althought the aim is too suppress as far as  
<br />
possible the distortion.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I never studied 'formal' logic, because I wanted to start on my own  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (online mostly) and ALL started using signs not even reproducible on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; keyboards
</em><br />
<br />That is why Knuth invented LATEX :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and not explained what they are standing for. As I guessed: the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'professors' issued &quot;notes&quot; at the beginning of the college-courses  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (($$s?)) and THERE the students could learn the 'vocabulary' of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those signs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You also use some of them.
</em><br />
<br />I think you are pointing the finger on the real difficulty of logic  
<br />
for beginners. You are supposed not to attribute meaning on those  
<br />
signs, because what the logician is searching for is rule of reasoning  
<br />
which does not depend on the meaning. The hardness of logic is in the  
<br />
understanding of what you have to NOT understand to proceed. Logicians  
<br />
take the signs as just that: sign, without meaning. Then they will  
<br />
develop rule of transformation of those sign, in such a way that  
<br />
machine can play with them, and mathematical rule of meaning, and they  
<br />
are happy when they succeed to find nice correspondence between rule  
<br />
and meaning. It makes the subject both very concrete and abstract at  
<br />
the same time. I am used to think that logic is the most difficult  
<br />
branch of math. Somehow, computer science makes it more easy. It  
<br />
motivates the point of not trying to put meaning where none is  
<br />
supposed to be.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was looking at a dozen books as well and did not find those signes  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explained, not in footnotes, not in appendicis, not as intro- or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; post- chapters. They were just applied from page 1.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I gave up.
</em><br />
<br />I can understand. It is hard to study logic alone. Yet there are good  
<br />
books, but it takes some effort to understand where you have to take  
<br />
those sign literally. I would suggest the reading of the little  
<br />
penguin book by Hodges &quot;Logic&quot;, which is perhaps clear for an  
<br />
introduction.
<br />
Logic is laso hard to explain to the layman, because it concerns  
<br />
objects which look like formal things, and it takes time to understand  
<br />
that we study those objects without interpreting them. beginners take  
<br />
time to understand the use of saying that, for example, we will say  
<br />
that &quot;A &amp; B&quot; is true when A is true and B is true. They can believe  
<br />
that they learn nothing here, but they are false because the &quot;&amp;&quot; is  
<br />
formal, and the &quot;and&quot; is informal. After all you do learn something if  
<br />
I say that &quot;A et B&quot; is true when A is true and B is true. In this case  
<br />
you learn french, which are at the same level of informality, but in  
<br />
logic you attach rules and meaning to explicitly formal things on  
<br />
which you reason *about*.
<br />
To ask a logician the meaning of the signs, is a bit like asking a  
<br />
biologist the meaning of &quot;ATTAGTTCAATCCCT&quot; or DNA. It is like asking  
<br />
the logician what is logic, and no two logicians can agree on the  
<br />
possible answer to that question.  When student ask some question  
<br />
here, it is not rare the answer he get is just &quot;we are not doing  
<br />
philosophy here&quot;. The object study is far more concrete than beginners  
<br />
can imagine, and that is why the notion of machine and computer  
<br />
science can help a lot for many parts of logic.
