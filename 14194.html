Gene,
<br />
<br />I appreciate the logic you employed in answering this question.  Q asking
<br />
&quot;Why was I born here?&quot; is more or less equivalent to asking &quot;Why am I Q?&quot;.
<br />
In this case however Q is ignoring the fact that it is Q's brain pondering
<br />
the question and therefore Q's brain that will also be experiencing life
<br />
from Q's perspective.
<br />
<br />Rolf my come back and say that the crux of his question is &quot;Why am I
<br />
experiencing this perspective and not a more probable one somewhere else?&quot;
<br />
but that too ignores the circular nature of the question.  A friend of mine
<br />
often phrases the question in that way and my answer to him has been that
<br />
the fact that all observer moments are experienced explains why he is
<br />
experiencing his perspective, and that &quot;you&quot; (taking the word in a loose
<br />
way) could be said to experience all observer moments.  He believes that
<br />
answer is too circular and refuses to accept it answers anything at all.  In
<br />
my opinion its a circular question which can only be dealt with using a
<br />
circular answer.
<br />
<br />Jason
