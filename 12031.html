Nice try Colin!  :-)
<br />
and very thought provoking, as are all the contributions of yours which 
<br />
I have read on various  discussion groups.
<br />
<br />Here though I think your assumptions are driving your conclusions and 
<br />
you beg some of the questions you seem to be assuming that you are 
<br />
answering.
<br />
I don't see this as either a sin or a crime, so long as it is 
<br />
acknowledged. This is because I assert that we MUST assert what we 
<br />
believe about the world, because if we didn't we couldn't function at 
<br />
all or, alternatively, neither self nor other could honestly infer that 
<br />
we did believe anything about the world; it would just be a form of 
<br />
dreaming.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From what you write it is not at all clear what 'Marvin' really is 
<br />
although I suspect he comes from the same cell line as Professor Mary of 
<br />
'black and white' fame. [Although perhaps that should be 'cell block' 
<br />
... yes? :-]
<br />
<br />By calling Marvin 'human' you muddy the waters I think: the ghost slips 
<br />
into the 'machine' unnoticed.
<br />
<br />I see several issues:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Marvin develops 'models' as algorithmic summaries of all the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patterns of changes in the displays and presumably these include
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;optimal patterns for button pushing also because his 'human
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sensory emulation' room also includes emulations of damage warning
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devices [pain] and homoeostatic normalisation warnings [hunger,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thirst, bladder-full, etc.] and these models have handy summary
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;labels [afferent] and short cut keys [efferent] -
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o because effectiveness and economy of effort are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intrinsically rewarding and are prerequisites for the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;achievement of Marvin's scientific aims;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Marvin's models of the 'not-room' come to embody a pronounced
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distinction between patterns of correlations best labelled as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'flexible unity which is extension of the buttons' versus 'bundled
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;large scale unity of many surprising things which is yet diverse
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and distant' -
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o because, if the information of the input displays and the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effect of the buttons both truly emulate information
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entering and leaving the human brain case, there are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;correlations between sight and sound of self-body, touch
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sense of skin and tongue on the one hand and proprioceptive
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sensing on the other which endow self-body information with
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distinct and persistent identity which is profoundly
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contrasted with non-self-body world information;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* AND you are being unfair to '1Z', as a result of you begging the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question of the nature of phenomenal C rather than him being
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thoughtless.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;What you show in this tale of Marvin's room is that OUR phenomenal 
<br />
experience is the outcome of consistency and persistence; 'habit' in 
<br />
other words. This is shown in Marvin's case because, once 'the model has 
<br />
stabilised', the invariance embodied by and within it has the same 
<br />
dependability as the inner shape, colours and textures of 'the room'. If 
<br />
Marvin is truly like the rest of us, apart from the rigours of his 
<br />
particular fate, then his interactions with 'the model' will become to 
<br />
him like extensions of his mind and body. He will become an homunculus, 
<br />
forgotten within his greater self!
<br />
<br />I like this story because it brings out the interdependence of sameness 
<br />
and habit on the one hand and novelty and exploration on the other. As I 
<br />
have asserted many times before, the most succinct explanation of 
<br />
phenomenal experience is that it is what it is like to be the updating 
<br />
of the model of self in the world [UMSITW].
<br />
IOW the incorporation of novelty into our sets of tested beliefs.
<br />
<br />This is how I relate to your assertion that the ability to do science is 
<br />
the true indicator of consciousness.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This discussion is a hybrid of a number of very famous thought

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments. Unlike those thought experiments, however, this experiment is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aimed purely and only at scientists. The intent is to demonstrate clearly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and definitively the nature of subjective experience (phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness) and its primal role in a scientist's ability to function as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a scientist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Imagine a room. Its walls and celing and floor are matt black. There are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no doors or windows. All over the walls are digital displays which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; announce numbers in warm, friendly colours. Up against all four walls and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up to international standard control desk height (roughly 750mm) is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sloping console. Covering the console around all four walls  are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pushbuttons. The number of displays is equal to the number of sensory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nerves entering a typical human brain from the peripheral nervous systems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; including all sensory input. The number of pushbuttons is equal to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entire set of effector nerves emanating from a typical brain. This total
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of displays and pushbuttons is in the millions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a comfortable chair upon which is seated the room's sole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occupant, Marvin the human. Marvin is normal except for never having been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outside the room and having never otherwise acquired any knowledge of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything other than that of the room and its contents. He knows absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing of any sort of external world or any other people. He has no clue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the external world except for what he can surmise from the displays
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and buttons.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Marvin thinks of himself as a scientist. Exactly what is he a scientist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of? His science is, he thinks, the science of 'not-room'. But is it? All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he has is a very sophisticated model of display/button correlations. His
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science is not about 'not-room' at all! His science is the science of room
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; display/buttons. He has absolutely no justification to any claim about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything going on anywhere else, although that is how Marvin thinks of it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; His science is very very predictive of button/display behaviour. As to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality of the model he has developed? He has no way of contextualising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any of the abstractions he has created with the actual state of affairs in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'not-room'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Absolutely anything could be out there driving the displays and Marvin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will never know. Indeed worse than that, there may be an infinite number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of different ways that not-room could present the same display values and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Marvin would never know. The display data is fundamentally, intrinsically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ambiguous. Even if the displays and buttons were nicely grouped and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; labeled all that would happen is that there would be expectations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related behaviours in a group, which Marvin does not have to name himself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It could even be named 'sight', 'sound' and so on and Marvin may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand what that might mean, but it delivers no claim to any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitive or unambiguous knowledge of not-room.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And that, fundamentally, is the real nub of the matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is outside the room? It doesn't really matter. It could be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elaborate multistory building with a ratsnest of electrical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interconnections done with a computer. It could be a control room in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; head of a giant robot. It could be literally wired up to a human body with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no brain. It could be a spaceship. None of that matters except in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; details. Marvin can never know because he has no experience available to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even imagine it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To finish off the room scenario we now take Marvin out of the room. In his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place we leave a machine that is based on his systematic scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour. It runs with clockwork and pneumatics from punched cards. None
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the displays are needed, none of the buttons are needed - they are all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directly connected to the new machine. The massively complex model marvin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has constructed, which has nothing whatever to do with 'not-room' except
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the most indirect of abstracted ways, goes on being verified and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occasionally amended using more rules for amending the model, also devised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by Marvin. The model can never say anything about any changes in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'not-room'. All it can sense is novel (unexpected according to the model)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour in the sensing displays, which is an entirely different thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main message to take from this is that this bizarre concoction is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary circumstance that would exist in a human if it weren't for what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal consciousness provides a human scientist.
