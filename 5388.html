<br />Yes, but particles are not virtual if they do not recombine
<br />
and annihilate. If they do not recombine then matter is
<br />
being continually created out of nothing and the universe is
<br />
increasing in density over time. If they do recombine then
<br />
they do not exist long enough as a mechanism to convey the
<br />
transference of gravitational energy at a cosmological
<br />
distance. The evidence seems to be against a universe that
<br />
is increasing in density.
<br />
<br />Thank you for the comment. My silence was in hope that
<br />
others might also pick up on this thread (I see that Fred
<br />
Chen seems the only other one to have done so, so far).
<br />
Unlike my previous (and other than this one, my only) topic
<br />
in this forum, I'm not in this topic presenting and
<br />
defending a postulate. In this topic, I'm just looking for
<br />
points of view.  :)
<br />
<br />I do have a problem with virtual particles being able to
<br />
perform just about any way that they like, including moving
<br />
faster than light. In one case (in one of the 4 sections of
<br />
the above link) the argument is made that *all* particles
<br />
are virtual particles. I have no problem with that per se,
<br />
and I believe the statement to be true against reality, but
<br />
I can not agree that it follows that all (or any) particles
<br />
are able to move faster than light! Forwards and backwards
<br />
in time, perhaps, but not faster than light within a
<br />
measurable frame. We've never observed anything moving
<br />
faster than light (to do so would convey information faster
<br />
than light, and that seems to be forbidden). Indeed, one
<br />
could argue that if anything did move faster than light then
<br />
we could never in principle measure it. If we can not
<br />
measure it, at least in principle even if the technology to
<br />
do so does not exist, then it is not part of measurable
<br />
reality. If all of reality is not measurable then all of
<br />
reality can not, even in principle, be proven to exist.
<br />
<br />I also take issue with normalization; to me that seems a
<br />
statistical mathematical trick akin to a description of an
<br />
immovable object meeting up with an irresistible force. The
<br />
process does not describe an instantaneous point in time (a
<br />
measurement is not possible). I mean that we never observe
<br />
an average response to a system measurement, we always
<br />
observe a focused and localized measurement response. And if
<br />
we are measuring something then it is not normalized
<br />
(because the measurement is always localized).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Just because so much agrees with current theories and
<br />
measurement does not mean that there is total agreement in
<br />
all the disciplines. Perhaps, in light of continuing new
<br />
development in theory and observation, the fundamental
<br />
questions of physics are rightfully worthy of a FAQ followed
<br />
by deep re-examination and discussion of *all* its premise.
<br />
Until we really do have a Theory of Everything!
<br />
<br />So, based on all that, I'm left to consider that no
<br />
measurement has ever confirmed any action with re-action
<br />
that occurs faster than light. Instead, we have indications
<br />
that particles can exchange &quot;localized&quot; (even at
<br />
cosmological distances) information &quot;with themselves&quot;,
<br />
apparently instantaneously, but that the localization never
<br />
includes the rest of the universe (and so information can
<br />
not be imposed upon and recovered from such a system). Those
<br />
indications are not measurable even in principle, they can
<br />
only be offered up as a mathematical explanation rather than
<br />
as a measurable reality. Logic seems to dictate that,
<br />
therefore, such a mechanism is not based in reality -
<br />
because it can be inferred but even in principle it can not
<br />
be measured.
<br />
<br />And I've yet to see even a report, much less evidence, that
<br />
even one sub microscopic black hole has evaporated. No doubt
<br />
that in itself is comforting to our existence! Yet they are
<br />
supposed to be much more numerous than are the macro type.
<br />
There's something wrong with theory.
<br />
<br />And so, I have a problem with virtual particles being the
<br />
way that black holes express gravity. That mechanism does not
<br />
seem measurable. But gravity itself is measurable.
