</em><br />
<br />I'm really sorry. I send that mail too quickly. I regret and I
<br />
admit not having been straightforward. Note that James's question
<br />
was very difficult, but that is not an excuse.  
<br />
I was neither clear nor very funny. OK. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course you know what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is meant by the 'physical world'. It is that complex that we infer from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;our perceptions to provide a comprehensible account of the relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;among those perceptions.  
</em><br />
<br />In *that* very large sense I believe in the 'physical world', sure.
<br />
But why the adjective &quot;physical&quot;? Why on earth should the world
<br />
necessarily be physical, and what does that mean?
<br />
I agree that for most people, words like &quot;physical&quot;, &quot;natural&quot; and
<br />
even &quot;empirical&quot; have some easy meaning.
<br />
My belief is that such an eazy  meaning is illusory.
<br />
My whole work try to explain that. And then I try to explain where
<br />
the illusion comes from.
<br />
That 'complex we infer from our perception' is arithmetical truth or
<br />
mathematical truth (I am not sanguine about the arithmetical 
<br />
restriction).  Stories like what we are living, including our
<br />
perception and the laws we infer are partial aspects on arithmetical
<br />
truth seen from inside. and &quot;seen from inside&quot; can be defined in terme
<br />
of relative computations (at least with comp).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you wish to take a radically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fundamentalist position, avoiding all inference, then you can only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;speak of &quot;softness&quot; not &quot;softness of velvet&quot; and you cannot presume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that you &quot;feel only the presence of persons...&quot;.  You can only feel -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to assign a source to that feeling is an inference just as is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical world.  
</em><br />
<br />This shows how much I was unclear, because I have no problem  at all
<br />
with inference. I have a problem only with the inference of
<br />
material stuff or substance.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think you have the direction of abstraction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;backwards. 
</em><br />
<br />Indeed. I agree, and that's what is really difficult to accept
<br />
in my work.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perceptions and feelings are the raw stuff of being. 
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps, perhaps not. With comp it is more easy to postulate that
<br />
there is no raw stuff at all, only arithmetical truth like
<br />
&quot;the number x apply to the number y relatively to the number z 
<br />
gives the number t. Such collection of truth contains all
<br />
truth on the behavior, belief, even knowledge (definissable 
<br />
axiomatically) of all possible machines embedded in all possible
<br />
neighborhood. I don't believe there is stuff, that is why
<br />
I feel obliged to explain why machines believes in stuff, why it
<br />
is locally useful with respect to their most probable computational
<br />
history, etc.
<br />
I really think that if we are digital machines (= if we can survive
<br />
with a digital brain) then  &quot;the law of physics&quot; can be derived
<br />
from &quot;the law of psychology&quot;, which are themselves derivable from
<br />
computer science, through the discourse of the sound universal
<br />
machine. This is what I called the reversal between physics
<br />
and machine's psychology.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Persons, velvet, and the physical world are abstracted from them. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Information is, as you say, another level of abstraction away from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical world - but in the direction away from raw experience.
</em><br />
<br />Mmmh ...
<br />
<br />For easyness I repeat James Higgo question:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In conversations with friends, I am often asked why the minimal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Kolmogorov complexity of Tegmark's schema has any relevance to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical world. Why should information theory tell us anything about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the 'real' world? What grounds do we have to believe that the stuff
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the 'physical' world is information?
</em><br />
<br />If the word 'information' (which is a confusing word which has a 
<br />
lot of meaning) is taken in the lay psychological sense (like in the 
<br />
sentence &quot;I know because I get the information&quot;, then my shortest
<br />
suggestion to James would be based on the idea of virtual reality.
<br />
<br />BEGIN SHORT ANSWER 1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality is dream sharing, which is information sharing. That is why
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when we look outside or inside close enough, information theory 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shows its nose.
<br />
END SHORT ANSWER 1
<br />
<br />James can then suggest the reading of Daniel Galouye's 
<br />
SIMULACRON III, or the more recent PERMUTATION CITY by Greg Egan.
<br />
These novels illustrate very well the idea.
<br />
<br />But I should without doubt make precise that people like David
<br />
Deutsch, Ekert, Landauer (and a lot more) would answer James
<br />
Higgo in another, quite opposite, way : they would answer that
<br />
information theory play a role in our study of nature because 
<br />
we realise, through the discovery of quantum information science, 
<br />
that information is physical.
<br />
<br />I, personaly, don't believe that at all, I believe, on the
<br />
contrary, that physics is informatical, right at the start.
<br />
(Actually I argue that such reversal follows logically from 
<br />
comp, that's the purpose of my thesis, cf my URL).
<br />
<br />I will think for better 'short' answer.
<br />
<br />Bruno
