</em><br />
<br />Let us a say a Church Turing Markov -tropic principle, eventually.
<br />
If you want I (re)define the physical by what is observable
<br />
by a sound universal machine. And observable is eventually
<br />
defined by a measure on her set on consistent extension, and I
<br />
must add &quot;as seen by her&quot;. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;and then hope to show that will entail the step (mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;law) =&gt; (physical law)?  
</em><br />
<br />It seems to me that the UDA entails that &quot;reversal&quot;.
<br />
We must recover physical laws and physical sensations from the 
<br />
discourse of &quot;average&quot; sound universal
<br />
machine about their most probable computational neighborhood.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And why do you take this approach rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(number law) =&gt; (computer law) =&gt; (physical law) =&gt; (mind law)?
</em><br />
<br />Just for the &quot;kantian&quot; reason that I can access only to my first
<br />
person knowledge, even when I just look to a needle of a physical
<br />
measuring apparatus. The UDA shows I must integrate on all
<br />
computational histories going through, similar enough, from
<br />
a first person point of view, states. Those states-point of
<br />
view are psychological concept.
<br />
It could still be possible that, in fine,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(physical law) &lt;=&gt; (mind law)  
<br />
<br />That could happen if our level of description is very low.
<br />
But then we will know it, without having put the mind-body
<br />
problem under the rug.
<br />
<br />What is very promising with the arithmetical transformation is that
<br />
all logics are doubled (G and G*, Z and Z*, ...) so that we get 
<br />
information on both communicable and incommunicable propositions. 
<br />
The arithmetical quantisation seems to put light on both 
<br />
qualia and quanta.
<br />
<br />Also, independently, Maudlin and me have shown in some more
<br />
direct way that, with comp, there is no hope for (physical law) 
<br />
=&gt; (mind law). (It is the crackpot proof in Jacques Mallah's 
<br />
terms!, look in the archive at key words like &quot;Maudlin&quot;, 
<br />
&quot;movie&quot;, &quot;crackpot&quot;. (But with Occam it is not necessary).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps you could briefly elucidate what you think goes into each &quot; =&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;?  For example, I assume that the step (number law) =&gt; (computer law)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is motivated by saying our TOE must be finitely describable and so it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;must lie in a subset of all mathematics that is most explicitly defined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by computation.  Is this right?
</em><br />
<br />Mmh ...
<br />
Arithmetical truth is not finitely describable and I doubt there
<br />
is a TOE for any first person plenitude (Levy's term).
<br />
You should realise that Godel shows that the structure
<br />
(N, +, x, &gt;, =, 0)  is far more complex than the equivalent
<br />
structure for the reals, which are completely captured by the
<br />
notion of archimedian algebraicaly closed field. Natural numbers
<br />
are in a sense much more complex than reals. We have no TOE for
<br />
them.
<br />
<br />The step &quot;(number law) =&gt; (computer law)&quot; comes from the fact that
<br />
you can, by chosing some number encoding (like Godel's one) embed
<br />
proposition on programs in pure arithmetical terms.
<br />
<br />An example is Godel's encoding of provability, which I promise 
<br />
George to discuss about, and so will I ASAP or perhaps later. But in
<br />
a nutshell, Godel did build, uniquely from the symbole O, =, X, +, x, s,
<br />
(intended for the successor function) an arithmetical predicate
<br />
B(x,y) meaning x is the godel number of a proof for the formula
<br />
with godel number y. So that provable(y) is just the arithmetical
<br />
sentence ExB(x,y).   (E = the existencial quantifier).
<br />
<br />I'm not sure I can give &quot;precise&quot; meaning to an expression
<br />
like &quot;all mathematics&quot;. Perhaps this is the Cantor &quot;inconsistenz&quot;.
<br />
But I don't ask mathematics to be made explicit by computations.
<br />
<br />In fact most of the truth *about* computations are not reachable by
<br />
univoquely determined computations. This is the foremost
<br />
origin of the gap between G and G*. Computerland, which
<br />
is just an intentional variant of numberland, is not computable,
<br />
not finitely describable.
<br />
A brain, or any &quot;implementation&quot; of a universal machine is really
<br />
nothing other than a door on many (many) realities.
