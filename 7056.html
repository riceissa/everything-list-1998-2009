<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Yes, if you think there is a concrete reality in which everything exists

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;(your question of where does the observer live?), then the AP is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;tautology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I meant by &quot;where does the observer live&quot;, in more formal language, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is &quot;how do you account for the (apparent) sense data we have?&quot;. 
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps you ask too much. Your question is something along the lines
<br />
of &quot;what explains qualia&quot;, or &quot;what breathes fire into the
<br />
equations&quot;. 
<br />
<br />I could state baldly that descriptions can conscious. This is no more
<br />
preposterous than Tegmarks &quot;mathematical systems can be
<br />
conscious&quot;. Maybe that satisfies you, maybe not. What can be stated
<br />
more convincingly is that all experience (including internal conscious
<br />
experience) is a description, a bunch of data interpreted by an
<br />
observer. Consequently, the set of all descriptions will contain a
<br />
description of your current conscious experience. Hence we can make
<br />
strong claims about appearances - the phenomenon. As to whether there
<br />
is a Noumenon - I take Laplace's rather agnostic point of view - I have
<br />
no need of that hypothesis. Perhaps you do.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a strong preference for an account where the description of at least 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our &quot;world&quot; doesn't privilege one particular observer. In particular, this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is hard to square with your insistence that &quot;the observer provides the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation&quot; of each of your bitstring universes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />The situation is symmetric with respect to all observers. That is
<br />
hardly priveleging  an observer.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As both Hal and I keep trying to emphasise, we are interested in how, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether, your theory can account for our own existence and the reality (or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance, if you prefer) that we see around us. So the case of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disembodied intelligences is a total a red herring. I don't really care 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether these feature in your theory or not, but I do care whether you can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; account for (apparently) embodied intelligences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Apparently embodied intelligences are part of the space of all
<br />
descriptions by definition. The anthropic principle accounts for the
<br />
fact that we observer them, and not (say) flying white rabbits.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Instead, one can take the Anthropic Principle as an assertion of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;reality we inhabit...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, you are using a private language... the AP is not regarded as any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such assertion by anyone else I've ever heard of. Most people regard their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence as proved by their own subjective experience, not some invented 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle. 
</em><br />
<br />Of course - Decartes and all that. The AP applies to what we see in
<br />
the world around us, not a proof or otherwise of our own existence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ... and experimentally test it. In all such cases is has been shown to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;be true, sometimes spectacularly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we know &quot;experimentally&quot; &quot;the reality we inhabit&quot; (?!), which I guess 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've just claimed that we do, why do we need a principle to assert it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Likely you mean something completely different, in which case please 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain (with examples of said experiments!).
</em><br />
<br />The experiments are the usual suspects showing fine tuning of physical
<br />
parameters in the universe. Tegmark's paper is a good review of the
<br />
topic. As is Barrow and Tipler's book.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;snip&gt; Quoting me:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;Then you are implying that the observer can, in a finite time, read and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;attach meaning to a full (space-time) description of itself, including 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;the act of reading this description and so on recursively.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Not at all. Consistency is the only requirement. If the observer goes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;looking for erself, then e will find erself in the description. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;doesn't imply the observer is doing this all the time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think here we have run into the same inconsistency that you admitted in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your discussion with Hal. In your first reply to Hal you assert that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer O(x) attaches a unique meaning to the description string. Which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would imply processing all bits of the string up to the start of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;don't care&quot; region. A later reply suggest that we should in different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contexts assume (a) this and (b) what your paper actually says, i.e. the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meanings are updated as further bits are read.  Now you have changed this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again, and the observer is not (modelled by) a simple mapping but is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; free agent who can choose to apply mappings to different &quot;regions&quot; of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bitstring at will.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, as I've further clarified to Hal, O(x) is actually a function of
<br />
time. One imagines that in general the region of sigificant bits of x
<br />
expands as a function of (psychological) time. 
<br />
<br />In my defence, the paper was written over a period of 4 years, and the
<br />
O(x) was a later addition to try to clarify points in section 2. I
<br />
didn't realise at the time that it introduced some ambiguities into
<br />
section 3.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And even that doesn't actually answer my problem: let's assume the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer *does* &quot;go looking for erself&quot;. You claim he will find himself, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but if the description is *complete* my original problem remains: he will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never finish reading his own description. Consequently the description 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will remain uninterpreted. In particular, he will never get to the part 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which would be interpreted as &quot;himself now&quot;. So is there any sense in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which *himself now* exists?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Of course, since all descriptions &quot;exist&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This assumes that the string description contained a complete definition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the observer, which is a natural interpretation of your phrase:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Since some of these descriptions describe self aware substructures,...&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But maybe you just meant that the string contains references to (tokens 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of) the observer. This would be consistent with your comment a couple of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; posts ago that both &quot;observers&quot; and &quot;descriptions&quot; are primary.  This also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to be consistent with your other recent post in response to Hal, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which the bitstrings are treated not so much as universes in the usual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense but as either the stream of sense data entering the observer's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conciousness, or as a continuously-updated description of that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conciousness itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In which case your paper should have specified the set of observers which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are deemed to exist, e.g. is it all maps from prefix strings to natural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers? Or maybe you only need one observer if its target domain is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; full set of natural numbers, because you can then reach any of them from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one or another of your bitstrings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />What is wrong with all possible observers? What I'm asserting is that
<br />
all observers corresponds to a prefix map, or perhaps more precisely
<br />
an _evolving_ prefix map O(t,x). The prefix map is not the be all and
<br />
end all of the observer, merely a property.
<br />
<br />In my private ontology I would also say that some of the descriptions
<br />
can be conscious observers, and so the whole thing is complete, but I
<br />
do not make this point in the paper as it is beside the point - this
<br />
paper only deals with appearances, which are descriptions.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well at least we agree on that.  No strange loops in this picture, so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is unlike the picture you outline in your paper.
</em><br />
<br />Depends if you call the AP a &quot;strange loop&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;But it will still be absurd to claim that the Sims are responsible for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;construction of PCs (assuming they are not connected to robot arms etc, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;for which no analogs exist in your theory). Let alone for them to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;construct the actual PC on which they are running, as apparently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;implied by your last message... even robot arms wouldn't help there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;No, it is called stretching an an analogy too far!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I havn't stretched it at all from the analogy you originally accepted (see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above). I've just removed your get-out about your AP not applying.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Paddy Leahy
</em><br />
<br />In my picture there is no &quot;hardware&quot; running a simulation of the set
<br />
of all descriptions. There is in Schmidhuber's. Please don't confuse us!
