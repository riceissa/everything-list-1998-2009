I think on this list we should be willing to seriously consider the
<br />
many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics as the ontology for
<br />
our universe.  In particular, we should not assume that wave function
<br />
collapse is anything more than an illusion caused by decoherence
<br />
of formerly interacting components of the universal wave function.
<br />
Almost all of the supposed paradoxes of QM go away if you eliminate wave
<br />
function collapse.
<br />
<br />There are a few objections which I am aware of which have been raised
<br />
against the MWI.  The first is its lack of parsimony in terms of
<br />
creating a vast number of universes.  We gain some simplification in
<br />
the QM formalism but at this seemingly huge expense.  The second is its
<br />
untestability, although some people have claimed otherwise.  And the
<br />
third is that it retains what we might call the problem of measure,
<br />
that is, explaining why we seem to occupy branches with a high measure
<br />
or amplitude, without just adding that as an extra assumption.
<br />
<br />The point is, all of these objections apply equally to the more
<br />
ambitious multiverse models we consider here.  Our multiverse is even
<br />
more profligate than the MWI; it is if anything less observable; and
<br />
the problem of measure is at least as acute.
<br />
<br />If we're willing to seriously consider the prospect that &quot;everything
<br />
exists&quot; and specifically &quot;all universes exist&quot;, I think it makes most
<br />
sense to take the MWI as the model for our own universe, when working
<br />
within the multiverse framework.  By the metrics we typically use for
<br />
universe complexity, basically the number of axioms or the size of a
<br />
program to specify the universe, the MWI is in fact simpler and therefore
<br />
more probable than the traditional interpretation.
<br />
<br />This is one of the things that bothered me in Jurgen Schmidhuber's paper,
<br />
Algorithmic Theories of Everything,
<br />
<a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/toesv2.html">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/toesv2.html</a>.
<br />
<br />His &quot;Example 1.1&quot; at <a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/node2.html">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/node2.html</a>
<br />
describes a universe like ours that has wave-function collapse, which
<br />
requires the continual creation of a large number of random bits.
<br />
He proposes the use of a pseudo-random number generator as the source
<br />
of this randomness, and later explores the possibility that this would
<br />
imply that we could detect patterns in quantum randomness, and (if I
<br />
understood this part right) that quantum computers would not work.
<br />
<br />IMO this line of analysis is misguided (note, I'm not saying that the rest
<br />
of the paper is wrong).  None of these perhaps-unlikely observations
<br />
is a true prediction of assuming his Speed Prior as the foundation
<br />
for a universal computation engine.  It would make much more sense,
<br />
in terms of his overall approach, to assume that we ourselves live in
<br />
a universe whose physics is based on the MWI.  Such a universe has a
<br />
simpler physical description (so it seems), therefore a smaller program
<br />
and higher measure.  And it requires no information creation, hence no
<br />
need for a random number generator, neither true nor pseudo.
<br />
<br />Quantum randomness does not exist in the MWI.  It is an illusion caused by
<br />
the same effect which Bruno Marchal describes in his thought experiments,
<br />
where an observer who is about to enter a duplication device has multiple
<br />
possible futures, which he treats as random.  If Schmidhuber would adopt
<br />
this model for the physics of our universe it would improve the quality
<br />
of his predictions.
