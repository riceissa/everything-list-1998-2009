&lt;&lt;SNIP&gt;&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No confusion at all. The zombie is behaving. 'Wide awake'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in the sense that it is fully functional.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, adaptive behaviour -- dealing with novelty --- is functioning.
</em><br />
<br />Yes - but I'm not talking about merely functioning. I am talking about the
<br />
specialised function called scientific behaviour in respect of the natural
<br />
world outside. The adaptive behaviour you speak of is adaptivity in
<br />
respect of adherence or otherwise to an internal rule set, not adaptation
<br />
in respect of the natural world outside.
<br />
<br />BTW 'Adaptive' means change, change means novelty has occurred. If you
<br />
have no phenopmenality you must already have a rule as to how to adapt to
<br />
all change - ergo you know everything already.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Doing stuff. I said it has the _internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; life_ of a dreamless sleep, not that it was asleep. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; means that the life you 'experience that is the state of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a dreamless sleep - the nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of it - that is the entire life of the awake zombie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Want to partially 'zombie' yourself?  close your eyes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; block your ears. I know seeing black/hearing nothing is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; blindess/deafness, but you get the idea.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That isn't zombification. A zombie is not an entity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which cannot see at all. A zombie will stop its car when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the lights turn red. It is just that red does not &quot;seem like&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything to the zombie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A zombies has a kind of efficient blindsight.
</em><br />
<br />I said 'partially', so you'd get the idea of it. It seems you are.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Scientific behaviour demanded of the zombie condition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is a clearly identifiable behavioural benchmark where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we can definitely claim that phenomenality is necessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ...see below...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The reason it is invisible is because there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; phenomenal consciousness. The zombie has only sensory data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to use to do science. There are an infinite number of ways
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sensory data could arrive from an infinity of external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; natural world situtations. The sensory data is ambiguous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; That doesn't follow. The Zombie can produce different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; responses on the basis of physical differences in its input,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; just as a machine can.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I spent tens of thousands of hours designing, building,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; benchtesting and commissioning zombies. On the benchtop I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have pretended to be their environment and they had no 'awareness'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; they weren't in their real environment. It's what makes bench
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  testing possible. The universe of the zombies was the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe of my programming. The zombies could not tell if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; they were in the factory or on the benchtop. That's why I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can empathise so well with zombie life. I have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; literally swatted by zombies (robot/cranes and other machines)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; like I wasn't there....scares the hell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; out of you! Some even had 'vision systems' but were still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; blind. so....yes the zombie can 'behave'. What I am claiming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is they cannot do _science_ i.e. they cannot behave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scientifically. This is a very specific claim, not a general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; claim.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I see nothing to support it.
</em><br />
<br />I have already showed you conclusive empirical evidence you can
<br />
demonstrate on yourself. Perhaps the 'zombie room' will do it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;- it's all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; same - action potential pulse trains traveling from sensors to
</em><br />
brain.
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; No, it's not all the same. Its coded in a very complex way. It's like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; saying the information in you computer is &quot;all the same -- its all ones
</em><br />
and zeros&quot;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; yes you got it - all coded....I am talking about action potential pulse
</em><br />
trains. They are all the same general class. Burst mode/Continuous
<br />
mode,
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all the same basic voltage waveform, overshoot, refratory period...LTP,
</em><br />
LTD, afterhyperpolarisation.... all the same class for sight, sound,
<br />
taste, imagination, touch, thirst, orgasm etc etc... coded messages
<br />
travelling all the way from the periphery and into the brain. They are
<br />
all
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the same...and..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They need to be interpreted an contextualised against other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other information. How does that lead to the conclusion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that zombies can't do science?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
They can do science on their sensory data only. They have no a-priori
<br />
method for applying any interpretation as to its context in the natural
<br />
world that originated the sensory feeds. If you like: it can do the
<br />
science of its boundary. Even that is a stretch - for it has no idea it
<br />
has a body or any boundary.
<br />
<br />They cannot contextualise NOVELTY with respect to the external world,
<br />
merely against the non-phenomenal rule-set they have concted. They cannot
<br />
do science on the natural world - but they can do science on zombie sense
<br />
data and internal rule-sets, whose correpondence with any sort of external
<br />
world is a complete mystery. If any of the rules they concoct happen to
<br />
correpond to the a natural world law it'd be an accident and they'd never
<br />
know it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; None of it says anything about WHY the input did what it did. The
</em><br />
causality outside the zombie is MISSING from these signals.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's missing from the individual signals. But we must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be able to build up a picture of the external causes on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the basis of the combined information. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't have anything else to go on. Pheneomenality is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not an extra source of information that clairvoyantly tells
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you where each photon originated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Yes it is an extra source. That is the whole point. The fact that you call
<br />
it 'clairvoyance' merely means that it is unknown. Why is it so impossoble
<br />
to think that your current understanding of the universe may be
<br />
incomplete?
<br />
There is nothing supernatural going on. The reality of phenomenality is
<br />
stark. Your neurons have a way of access enough information to constrcut
<br />
phenomenal scenes. They do it. They are real. There is far more
<br />
information inthe phenopmenal scenes than arises from the sensing. Your
<br />
inability to see how that may be does not negate it as a reality.
<br />
<br />In the mathematical proof I gave the extra information is built into P(.),
<br />
which the zombie does not have.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; They have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intrinsic sensation to them either. The only useful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; information is the body knows implicitly where they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; came from..which still is not enough because:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Try swapping the touch nerves for 2 fingers. You 'touch'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with one and feel the touch happen on the other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The touch sensation is created as phenomenal consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in the brain using the measurement, not the signal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; measurement itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now think about the touch..the same sensation of touch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could have been generated by a feather or a cloth or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; another finger or a passing car. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; context is what phenomenal consciousness provides.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It creates it out of information that is also available to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zombie.
</em><br />
<br />No it doesn't. The information the zombie has is &quot;neurons a,b,c,d, fired
<br />
in finger tip'. That's it. The zombie and the human both have that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It doesn't create new information ex nihilo.
</em><br />
<br />Of course not. It creates new information by a mechaniusm you don;t
<br />
understand that is perfectly natural. &quot;ex nihilo&quot; actually means it can;t
<br />
do it based on what I know...not that it is impossible.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes but how is it to do anything to contextualise the input other than
</em><br />
correlate it with other signals?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why would it need to ?
</em><br />
<br />What's the difference between &quot;neurons z,x,x,c,v,f,r,we,w, in my retina
<br />
correlate like this&quot; and &quot;here comes an elephant&quot;? That is why.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (none of which, in themselves, generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; any phenomenal consciousness, they trigger it downstream in the
</em><br />
cranium/cortex).
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; re robot...now do science on a signal and use the signal to make a
</em><br />
statement about the natural world that generated/caused the signal
<br />
elsewhere away from/outside the robot. It can't. It's blind, deaf,
<br />
can't
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; taste or smell or touch.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It can interact with its environment: you have already conceded that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />No. It's body boundary (which it has no means to intuit) can interact with
<br />
whatever impacts with it. That's it. Beyond the boundary? Multiple
<br />
external worlds could present the same stimulus and the zombie would never
<br />
know.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The main fact is that the zombie does not have sensation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; at all and that as a result it cannot do science on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; world outside the zombie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A zombie has sensors which can alter its behaviour in response
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to changes in the environment.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;It doesn't even know there is a world to do science on.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why not? Because it can't paint a causal picture of where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its signals came form? Why not?
</em><br />
<br />Where does this notion of 'causality' come from? You. Not it. You are
<br />
projecting your internal life into the numbers the zombie has. Stop it!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; All it can do is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; correlate measurements with each other, measurements that could have come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from anywhere and the zombie can never tell from where.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why not? Surely it only takes a kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for information analysis to tell that a set of signals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably came form a cubic object, or whatever.
</em><br />
<br />Where has the zombie got any idea of 'cube', space, distance?
<br />
You! Stop doing that. You keep grounding the zombie in your own
<br />
experiences and assuming it can do what you can. It has no idea of space,
<br />
time ,matter, causality, the natural world itself....NOTHING.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I have great empathy for the poor zombie! Indeed I am starting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to realise that it may be my practical training which has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; enabled me to better understand the zombie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure you grasp the standard meaning of &quot;philosophical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Zombie&quot; at all.
</em><br />
<br />I couldn't care less about the philosopghical zombie. Who ever said
<br />
philosophy had a patent on the concept! If you like dump the whole label
<br />
and replace every occurrence of the word zombie with &quot;a human but with a
<br />
brain not capable of phenomenal consciousness&quot;.
<br />
<br />What point is there in bothering with it. The philosophical zombie is
<br />
ASSUMED to be equivalent! This is failure before you even start! It's
<br />
wrong and it's proven wrong because there is a conclusively logically and
<br />
empirically provable function that the zombie cannot possibly do without
<br />
phenomenality: SCIENCE. The philosophical zombie would have to know
<br />
everything a-priori, which makes science meaningless. There is no novelty
<br />
to a philosophical zombie. It would have to anticipate all forms of
<br />
randomness or chaotic behaviour.... NUTS.
<br />
<br />I am only intersted in the state where there is no phenomenal
<br />
consciousness and the role it has in science. You can have the
<br />
philosophical zombie - it's an oxymoron and you're welcome to it. You can
<br />
let it define your world if you like - I'd prefer to let the natural world
<br />
be my guide.
