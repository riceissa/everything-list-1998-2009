<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;EC: And why assume that we are not? I prefer not to have

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my right to ask waived. If I cannot ask it, then I should

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understand why not, and that would be an answer in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM: Yes. Somehow it would be an answer at a higher level, or even a meta-level.
<br />
Now later I will perhaps try to explain that consciousness will be linked
<br />
(among other things) with some collapse between a level and a meta-level, so
<br />
it's good to keep in mind those levels, and it is good to expect that if
<br />
some question lacks an answer, we will perhaps be able to justify that very
<br />
fact, by a level shifting indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; To borrow a bit from Wittgenstein -- imagine you have completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; translated these aliens' language, and they tell you that each of them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; has a box with something inside it.  Although they talk a lot in rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; vague terms about what's in their box, they insist you can't really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; know what is inside it.   Now what is the logical conclusion here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a)  There may or may not be something in the box.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; b)  There's definitely something in the box, and I have absolutely no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; idea what it is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What on earth could possibly make someone conclude (b) here?  It's not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; logical at all.  Yet this is what people conclude when they bend over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; backwards talking about &quot;qualia&quot; and how ineffable they are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And you seem to conclude a (c) hypothesis: &quot;there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;definitely nothing inside the box&quot;. I stay with (a). And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to try to find out if there is something there or not, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;need to talk about it, and &quot;qualia&quot; is the word for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hypothetical contents of the box.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />OK. Although I assume you are using the word &quot;content&quot; with
<br />
the meaning of &quot;meaning&quot;, qualia being an interpretation of
<br />
a state of the &quot;brain&quot; by the owner of the brain, grosso modo.
<br />
Saying that &quot;qualia are ineffable&quot; is very interesting, and
<br />
Carlton's mention of Wittgenstein is quite relevant (imo...),
<br />
and indeed, shifting from the level of what consciousness can
<br />
be I propose to try to capture it by the possible self-referential
<br />
discourse, and ineffability is the key point for, at first,
<br />
a very large sense of consciousness (including all Protogoras
<br />
Virtue, conscience, sensation, self-identity, cleverness,  honesty,...)
<br />
So here is a first proponent for an &quot;axiom&quot; of those &quot;virtues&quot;:
<br />
<br />AX 1     It is ineffable or uncommunicable
<br />
<br />I call it &quot;Wittgenstein&quot; principle (in my Brussel's thesis), and we
<br />
can abbreviate it by 'existential) formula (equation)
<br />
<br />AX 1      Not Communicable x,
<br />
<br />and even translate it in modal logic language as -[]x.
<br />
<br />Note that Wittgenstein is in trouble here, because when he says
<br />
in the tractatus &quot;we cannot talk on those things&quot; he is really
<br />
talking about, and we are entitled to ask him what does he really
<br />
talk about. In the same way we will need to find &quot;models&quot;, or
<br />
mathematical structures to classify our valid forms of reasoning
<br />
with those sentences (but then that's all what logic is about).
<br />
<br />A trivial solution for a honest machine (or being, I am not
<br />
using comp here) would be F (your favorite falsity, like 1 = 0, ...)
<br />
But Wittgenstein was hardly giving a moral statement like
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;you will not communicate the false&quot;  ( -[]F )
<br />
<br />nor can we suppose Wittgenstein was saying &quot;you will not be wrong&quot;,
<br />
or &quot;you will not be mad&quot;, etc...
<br />
<br />So F is perhaps a little bit too trivial, but note that this solution
<br />
will remains stable for a very vast amount of semantics for the box.
<br />
<br />But Godel and the logicians found many other solutions...
<br />
Actually for self-referentially correct (SRC) machine, the Wittgenstein 
<br />
principle
<br />
is itself a solution of the Wittgenstein principle:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-[] (-[]F)
<br />
<br />Actually, a SRC machine can even prove that, that is, that if she would be
<br />
honest (consistent,  ...) then she would not been able to prove that she is
<br />
honest:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-[]F -&gt;  -[] (-[]F)
<br />
<br /><br />That is just Godel's second incompleteness theorem. It gives an
<br />
arithmetical model for most of what we can be derived, informally or not,
<br />
from the ineffability assumption.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; So, in addition to the empirical data, there is this extra bit of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; information, neither contained in the data nor able to be derived from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; it using the laws of physics: what it actually feels like to be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; one experiencing the subjective sensation. If someone can think of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; better way to describe it than &quot;extra bit of information&quot; or can come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; up with a way to formalise it, I would be happy to hear about it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A better way to describe what, exactly?  &quot;What it actually feels like&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;   But why do you first commit yourself to the view that this question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; makes any sense?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose a blind man did understand all the chain of events
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that lead from the light reaching the eyes to the retina, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the brain and finally to the qualia of red. Would he see the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;red? Why not?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I can imagine that I have my vision scrambled in such a way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that red is exchanged with blue. Red is the color that I associate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with an apple, and blue to the sky. I can imagine that the sky
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appeared to have the color of an apple and an apple appeared
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to have the sky's color. But if that happened, from then on, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could change the names of the colors in such a way that I still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;called the apple 'red' and the sky 'blue'. If there is no such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thing as 'qualia', then nothing really happened. But I could tell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that things are different. In what sense could they be different?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Good question.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I suppose there will still be some who insist that if you know all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; about the physiology etc. behind the alien response to gamma rays,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; then you know all there is to know. I think this response is analogous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; to the &quot;shut up and calculate&quot; attitude to the interpretation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; quantum mechanics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes, I am one of these people.  You say &quot;if you know all about&quot;, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you must be taken seriously here:  you would really have to know &gt;all&lt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about it.  But if you did, you would be able to entirely trace the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; causal pathway from the receipt of the gamma rays, to whatever internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; responses go on inside the alien's body, to the subsequent report of &quot;I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; feel that pleasant, odd-multiple feeling&quot;.  Let's say you had that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; entire explanation written out.  And &quot;subjective experience&quot; doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; appear anywhere on this list.  So what reason on earth do you have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; assert that it exists?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;When the alien says &quot;I feel that pleasant feeling&quot;, he is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;saying that he knows that chain of events is happening
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in his body right now. Suppose you are watching him with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equipments that let you know that same thing. Could you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also say &quot;I feel that pleasant feeling&quot; too? Why not, if there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is nothing beyond the chain of events? What could make the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;alien's knowledge different from yours? One obvious answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is that &quot;he is the organism where those events are happening&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But this means that each organism is entitled to &quot;feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something&quot; about himself , an experience that is inaccesible to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;others, no matter how comprehensive their knowledge is. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that is something that you are claiming that does not exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How can we explain this without something as &quot;qualia&quot;?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />...or without making explicit, like you did, the difference between
<br />
a pure 3-person description of a chain of events (&quot;made of&quot; a number
<br />
quantifiable happenings) and the way an organism is able to
<br />
get higher order and unquantifiable information or knowledge
<br />
about itself: that is, some first person apprehension.
<br />
<br />But now what could be that &quot;unquantifiable&quot; knowledge?
<br />
Well I want to stay modest but it's here that my thesis makes
<br />
a &quot;tour de force&quot;. Actually, the &quot;tour de force&quot; has been made
<br />
by Thaetetus when trying to define science and knowledge
<br />
to Socrate.  Now the crazy things is that the godel's incompleteness
<br />
phenomenon introduces so many nuance between the notion of
<br />
provable, true, consistent, correct, that it makes it possible to
<br />
translate quasi-literally the (many) Thaetetus attempt to define
<br />
knowledge. In particular, if you define knowable(p) by
<br />
provable(p) and true(p), you get a knower which has no name,
<br />
no description, and cannot know he could be a machine, or any
<br />
object having a pure 3-person description, showing there is a
<br />
necessary sort of gap between 1 and 3 pov for honest machine.
<br />
Than this is related to Brouwer's theory of soul and consciousness,
<br />
and intuitionnistic logic. Eventually it is another thaetetic variant
<br />
of provability which provide the logic of the &quot;probability 1&quot; physical
<br />
propositions, from which a quantum logic can be extracted, and
<br />
from which a similarity measure for consistent
<br />
computational extensions can be mathematically apprehended.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sorry for making so many questions. I don't intend to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pedantic, but I really don't know the answers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course subjective experience exists in a way -- but it's just a way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of talking about things.  It isn't a &quot;primitive&quot;.  When I see red, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have a subjective experience of red, sure -- but all this means is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that my brain has responded to a certain stimulus in the way it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; normally does.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And maybe it is not all that this means...
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />I would say it most certainly means something else. It is more the fact that
<br />
the brain has responded in some way which means for you that
<br />
you are seeing red. Would Pete Carlton say &quot;I love that person but
<br />
actually it just means my (and btw what does mean &quot;my&quot; here) brain
<br />
has been put in such configuration&quot;?
<br />
<br />I will try to explain more of the theory of &quot;consciousness&quot; ... I am at last
<br />
rereading my brussel's thesis, which is the same as the lille thesis,
<br />
except everything is explained in details (In the lille thesis I wrote just
<br />
6 pages on the theory of consciousness (this is justified by the fact that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;it is essentially just logical variant of the &quot;well-known&quot; logic of 
<br />
self-reference G and G*),
<br />
but in the brussels's thesis those 6 pages makes 400 pages ...mmmmh...
<br />
<br />I hope you have all buy Boolos 93 now!
