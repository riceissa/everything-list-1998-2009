<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno recently urged me to read up on Tim Maudlin's movie-graph argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;against the computational hypothesis. I did so. Here is my version of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;............................
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;According to the computational hypothesis, consciousness supervenes on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;activity and the important level of organization in the brain is its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computational structure. So the same consciousness can supervene on two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different physical systems provided that they support the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structure. For example, we could replace every neuron in your brain with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;functionally equivalent silicon chip and you would not notice the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Computational structure is an abstract concept. The machine table of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Turing Machine does not specify any physical requirements and different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical implementations of the same machine may not be comparable in terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the amount of physical activity each must engage in. We might enquire:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what is the minimal amount of physical activity that can support a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computation, and, in particular, consciousness?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consider that we have a physical Turing Machine that instantiates the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;phenomenal state of a conscious observer. To do this, it starts with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;prepared tape and runs through a sequence of state changes, writing symbols
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the tape, and moving the read-write as it does so. It engages in a lot 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical activity. By assumption, the phenomenal state supervenes on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical computational activity. Each time we run the machine we will get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the same phenomenal state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let's try to minimise the amount of computational activity that the Turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Machine must engage in. We note that many possible pathways through the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machine state table are not used in our particular computation because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;certain counterfactuals are not true. For example, on the first step, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machine might actually go from S_0 to S_8 because the data location on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tape contained 0. Had the tape contained a 1, it might have gone to S_10,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but this doesn't obtain because the 1 was not actually present.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So let's unravel the actual computational path taken by the machine when it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;starts with the prepared tape. Here are the actual machine states and tape
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;locations at each step:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	S_0   s_8   s_7   s_7   s_3   s_2 . . . s_1023
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	t_0   t_1   t_2   t_1   t_2   t_3 . . . t_2032
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Re-label these as follows:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	s_[0] s_[1] s_[2] s_[3] s_[4] s_[5] . . .s_[N]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	t_[0] t_[1] t_[2] t_[3] t_[4] t_[5] . . .t_[N]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Note that t_[1] and t_[3] are the same tape location, namely t_1. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Similarly,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;t_[2] and t_[4] are both tape location t_2. These tape locations are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;multiply-located&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The tape locations t_[0], t[1], t[2], ..., can be arranged in physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sequence provided that a mechanism is provided to link the multiply-located
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;locations. Thus t[1] and t[3] might be joined by a circuit that turns both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on when a 1 is written and both off when a 0 is written. Now when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machine runs, it has to take account of the remapped tape locations when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computing what state to go into next. Nevertheless, the net-effect of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this is that it just runs from left to right.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the machine just runs from left to right, why bother computing the state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;changes? We could just arrange for each tape location to turn on (1 = on) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;off (0 = off) when the read/write head arrives. For example, if t_[2] would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have been turned on in the original computation, then there would be a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;local
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mechanism that turns that location on when the read/write head arrives 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(note
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that t_[4] would also turn on because it is linked to t_[2]). The state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;S_[i] is then defined to occur when the machine is at tape location t_[i]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(this machine therefore undergoes as many state changes as the original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machine). Now we have a machine that just moves from left to right
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;triggering tape locations. To make it even simpler, the read/write head can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be replaced by a armature that moves from left to right triggering tape
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;locations. We have a very lazy machine! It's name is Olympia.
</em><br />
<br />The main objection that comes to my mind is that in order to plan ahead of 
<br />
time what number should be in each tape location before the armature begins 
<br />
moving and flipping bits, you need to have already done the computation in 
<br />
the regular way--so Olympia is not really computing anything, it's basically 
<br />
just a playback device for showing us a *recording* of what happened during 
<br />
the original computation. I don't think Olympia contributes anything more to 
<br />
the measure of the observer-moment that was associated with the original 
<br />
computation, any more than playing a movie showing the workings of each 
<br />
neuron in my brain would contribute to the measure of the observer-moment 
<br />
associated with what my brain was doing during that time.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What, then, is the physical activity on which the phenomenal state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;supervenes? It cannot be in the activity of the armature moving from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;left to right. That doesn't seem to have the required complexity. Is it in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the turning on and off of the tape locations as the armature moves?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Again that does not seem to have the required degree of complexity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It might be objected that in stripping out the computational pathway that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;did, we have neglected all the other pathways that could have been executed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but never in fact were. But what difference do these pathways make? We 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;construct similar left-right machines for each of these pathways. These
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machines would be triggered when a counterfactual occurs at a tape 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;location.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The triggering mechanism is simple. If, say, t_[3] was originally on just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;prior to the arrival of the read/write head but is now in fact off, then we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can freeze the original machine and arrange for another left-right machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to start from that tape location. This triggering and freezing can be done
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;using a simple local mechanism at t_[3].
</em><br />
<br />But this would still be just a playback device, it wouldn't have the same 
<br />
&quot;causal structure&quot; (although I don't know precisely how to define that term, 
<br />
so this is probably the weakest part of my argument) as the original 
<br />
computation. To build all these pathways, you could expose a given 
<br />
deterministic A.I. to all possible strings of sensory input of a certain 
<br />
finite length, record the results for each string, and construct an 
<br />
Olympia-type-playback device for each one. But although the original 
<br />
computations contributed to the measure of a huge number of 
<br />
observer-moments, playing back recordings of them would not, I think.
<br />
<br />This actually brings up an interesting ethical problem. Suppose we put a 
<br />
deterministic A.I. in a simulated environment with a simulated puppet body 
<br />
whose motions are controlled by a string of numbers, and simulate what 
<br />
happens with every possible input string to the puppet body of a certain 
<br />
length. The vast majority of copies of the A.I. will observer the puppet 
<br />
body flailing around in a completely random way, of course. But once we have 
<br />
a database of what happened in the simulation with every possible input 
<br />
string, we could then create an interactive playback device where I put on a 
<br />
VR suit and my movements are translated into input strings for the puppet 
<br />
body, and then the device responds by playing back the next bit of the 
<br />
appropriate recording in its database. The question is, would it be morally 
<br />
wrong for me to make the puppet body torture the A.I. in the simulation? I'm 
<br />
really just playing back a recording of a simulation that already happened, 
<br />
so it seems like I'm not contributing anything to the meaure of painful 
<br />
observer-moments for the A.I., and of course the fraction of histories where 
<br />
the A.I. experienced the puppet body acting in a coherent manner would have 
<br />
been extremely small. I guess one answer to why it's still wrong, besides 
<br />
the fact that simulated torture might have a corrupting effect on my own 
<br />
mind, is that there's bound to be some fraction of worlds where I was 
<br />
tricked or deluded into believing the VR system was just playing back 
<br />
recordings from a preexisting database, when in reality I'm actually 
<br />
interacting with a computation being done in realtime, so if I engage in 
<br />
torture I am at least slightly contributing to the measure of 
<br />
observer-moments who are experiencing horrible pain.
