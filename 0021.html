Maybe we can find some common ground to start with.
<br />
<br />The central idea of the MW and similar interpretations is that wave
<br />
function collapse does not occur.  Instead, the wave function is universal
<br />
and evolves in time strictly by means of the Schrodinger equation.
<br />
This is the mathematical theory which supposedly describes our universe.
<br />
<br />Now we have to try to understand how or whether this theory actually
<br />
could apply to our universe.  This gets into the issue of mapping, which
<br />
I talked about yesterday.  Maybe in theory the mathematical formula is
<br />
enough and whatever evolves from it gets to experience it from the inside.
<br />
But in practice, to try to judge whether a theory matches our universe,
<br />
we need to have a way to map between its predictions and what we see.
<br />
<br />With MW it is especially difficult since we observe what seems to be wave
<br />
function collapse during measurement interactions.  Therefore the thrust
<br />
of the discussion is how to reconcile the appearance of wave function
<br />
collapse with the (theoretical) reality that it does not collapse.  The
<br />
focus is on measurement-like interactions and how it could be that an
<br />
observer would seem to see collapse.
<br />
<br />The actual definition of what constitutes a measurement is not looked
<br />
at too closely in this analysis.  Instead, as with the conventional
<br />
interpretation, we assume that we have classical-like measurements and
<br />
explore how to relate those to the reality of what is going on with the
<br />
wave function.  That leads naturally to the notion of decoherent branches
<br />
of the wave function, and hence the appearance of &quot;many worlds&quot;.
<br />
<br />It sounds like what you want to do is to explore the issues of what
<br />
constitutes a measurement, and when decoherence occurs.  This would then
<br />
lead to a more detailed understanding of when worlds can be said to split.
<br />
<br />This topic is discussed in conventional measurement theory, from a
<br />
different point of view.  There it is shown that as a quantum phenomenon
<br />
undergoes amplification to large numbers of particles, the nature of
<br />
the wave function changes.  It changes from a superposition of states
<br />
to a mixture of decoherent states.  This can be derived purely with
<br />
the continuous evolution of the wave function, without introducing any
<br />
notions of wave function collapse.
<br />
<br />In the context of the MWI, once you have a mixture of decoherent states,
<br />
we can interpret this as being different branches of the wave function
<br />
which no longer will interfere with each other, thus giving the effect
<br />
of &quot;many worlds&quot;.
