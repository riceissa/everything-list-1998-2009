<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and misuses of Godel theorems? Despite some big mistake I will talk

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; about, it is a quite excellent book which I would recommend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have read this book and would very much want to know what big 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mistake you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are talking about.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Let me insist that I do love Torkel Franzen book, and recommend it 
<br />
heartily to those who want a readable concise introduction to Godel's 
<br />
theorem, and some warning on many possible abuses, indeed.
<br />
<br />Having said this, here are the &quot;big&quot; mistakes I mentionned  (just 
<br />
recall that all good books have mistakes!):
<br />
<br /><br />First in the subtitle of the book: &quot;An Incomplete Guide to its Use and 
<br />
Abuse&quot;. But no &quot;use&quot; is really described. Franzen does not cite Post 
<br />
positive use of incompleteness, nor does it mention Benacerraf, 
<br />
Chihara, Reinhard, Webb  ... or myself. Also, Church thesis is not 
<br />
really explained despite proof of incompleteness based on 
<br />
computability(*), nor are the provability logic mentionned.
<br />
(*)Compare with the first or second footnote in my Plotinus paper:
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/CiE2007/SIENA.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/CiE2007/SIENA.pdf</a>
<br />
<br /><br />Second: after demolishing correctly some misuses of Godel in theology, 
<br />
and assessing the role of faith in science, he concludes that Godel's 
<br />
result are irrelevant in theology. Such a conclusion is just not valid. 
<br />
Even if 100% or the current uses of Godel in theology are abuses, it 
<br />
does not logically follow that Godel is irrelevant in that context. 
<br />
Actually if you define the (pure) theology of the machine M by all the 
<br />
true propositions *bearing on* the machine M (unprovable by machine M), 
<br />
then it is a theorem that the (pure) theology is given by G* (minus G) 
<br />
and their intensional variant. So pure theology, for a vast class of 
<br />
machines, is given by the arithmetical interpretation of the difference 
<br />
logics: G* \ G, X* \ X, Z* \ Z, G1* \ G1, X1* \ X1, etc.
<br />
<br />Third: I disagree with his critics of Hawking use of Godel. Hawking has 
<br />
been probably just a little not rigorous enough but it is easy to add 
<br />
the arithmetical realist assumption (for example) to make his reasoning 
<br />
rigorous. Yes, arithmetical incompleteness entails that we can build 
<br />
machine such that no physical theory can ever describe completely their 
<br />
long run behavior, which is part of the physical reality (assuming or 
<br />
not the ontic (primitive) existence of a physical world, but being 
<br />
realist (platonist) on number relations. So I think Torkel is a bit 
<br />
unfair with Hawking analysis.
<br />
<br />Fourth: I do think Franzen is also a bit unfair with Rudy Rucker too. 
<br />
True, Rudy Rucker should have add in his seventh step (page 116 in 
<br />
Torkel's book) that Godel knew the truth of the sentence only 
<br />
conditionally from the assumption that the machine is correct, and of 
<br />
course the machine knows that conditional truth too!  Those who read 
<br />
completely the &quot;infinity and the mind&quot; book by Rudy Rucker can 
<br />
understand that he has seen this point, mainly trough his appendix on 
<br />
man and robot.
<br />
<br />Fifth:  this is perhaps the most embarrassing mistake (or bad 
<br />
pedagogical shortcut) in the misuse setting, especially with respect to 
<br />
my own work (but I reassure: none of the many experts in logic who has 
<br />
study my work has ever criticized it and there is nothing controversial 
<br />
about it: I do have problem but only with literature-philosophers who 
<br />
apparently never read my work).
<br />
Indeed page 125 in his book, Franzen asserts that a system cannot fully 
<br />
even just postulate its consistency nor assert it, and that the 
<br />
unprovability of consistency is really unassertibility of consistency. 
<br />
This apparently goes against my dicto that consistency can *only* be 
<br />
postulated, and certainly can be asserted, unlike self-soundness for 
<br />
example. Here Torkel confuses the Rogerian sentence/machine with the 
<br />
Godelian sentence/machine. The godelian sentence asserts its own 
<br />
unprovability, and can be shown (by the lobian machine itself) 
<br />
equivalent with a consistency statement. The Rogerian sentence/machine 
<br />
asserts its own consistency, and can be shown (by the lobian machine 
<br />
itself) equivalent with 0=1.
<br />
So a consistent machine can asserts its own consistency (on the 
<br />
contrary a consistent machine cannot assert or even define its own 
<br />
soundness). Three type of things can happen when a machine asserts its 
<br />
own consistency. If the machine means it globally, the machine become a 
<br />
Rogerian machine, and it will become inconsistent (prove the false). I 
<br />
guess this is what Torkel was thinking about.
<br />
But the machine can means it locally, and just add its late consistency 
<br />
as a new axiom. In that case the machine transforms itself in a *new* 
<br />
machine and, not only remains sound (if it was before) but will be more 
<br />
efficacious. It will speed itself up, shortening many proofs.
<br />
The machine can also assert it even more locally by defining a new 
<br />
provability predicate, like the Z predicate Bp &amp; Dp (Provable(p) and 
<br />
Consistent(p)). In which case the machine discovers an intensional 
<br />
variant of provability which obey some other provability logic, despite 
<br />
its extensional equivalence with the Godel beweisbar predicate. This is 
<br />
how the machine can discover the &quot;person points of view&quot; (hypostases).
<br />
<br />All this can be proved by the machine:
<br />
<br />Indeed G proves: (and thus the machine proves all this with p being any 
<br />
sentence written in the language of the machine).
<br />
<br />B(p &lt;-&gt; ~Bp) &lt;-&gt; B(p &lt;-&gt; Dt)   (Godelian sentences)
<br />
B(p &lt;-&gt; B~p) &lt;-&gt; B(p &lt;-&gt; Bf)   (Kreiselian sentences, or Smullyanian, I 
<br />
would say)
<br />
B(p &lt;-&gt; ~B~p) &lt;-&gt; B(p &lt;-&gt; f)    (Rogerian sentences)
<br />
B(p &lt;-&gt; Bp) &lt;-&gt; B(p &lt;-&gt; t)         (Lobian sentences)
<br />
<br />In french:  the machine can prove that
<br />
<br />a sentence provably equivalent to its own unprovability is provably 
<br />
equivalent to consistency   (Godel)
<br />
a sentence provably equivalent to its own refutability is provably 
<br />
equivalent to inconsistency    (Kreisel, Smullyan)
<br />
a sentence provably equivalent to its own consistency is provably 
<br />
equivalent to a contradiction    (Roger)
<br />
a sentence provably equivalent to its own provability is provably 
<br />
equivalent to a tautology     (Lob)
<br />
<br />Note that you can substitute the word &quot;sentence&quot; by &quot;machine&quot;, by 
<br />
defining the machine dynamic by the modus ponens rule only (Hilbertian 
<br />
&quot;machines&quot;).
<br />
<br />OK, this could *look* severe, so I insist that Franzen book is *quite* 
<br />
excellent, and probably the best one optimizing the tradeoff 
<br />
time/results. His appendices are also quite good and I do think that 
<br />
book could help a lot in this list, for those interested in the 
<br />
arithmetical UDA, alias the interview of the universal (and lobian) 
<br />
machine.
