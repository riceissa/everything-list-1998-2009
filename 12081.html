<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
In my view, your motivation is not large enough.  I am also motivated
<br />
by a problem: the problem of evil.  I don't think the real problem of
<br />
evil is solved or even really addressed with comp.  This is because
<br />
comp cannot define evil correctly.  I will try to explain this more.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note also that the major critics by the neoplatonists on Aristotle,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; besides their diverging opinions on the nature of matter, is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-person character of the big unnameable, but then for Plotinus the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;second God&quot; (the second primary hypostase is &quot;personal&quot;), and indeed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; G* has a personal aspect from the point of view of the machine. I agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (comp agree) with Plotinus  that the big first cannot be a person. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; second one can. To be sure Plotinus is not always completely clear on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that point (especially on his chapter on free-will).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
None of Plotinus' hypostases are both personal and free from evil (as
<br />
well as infinite, which we agree is needed (but not sufficient, I
<br />
maintain!) for the problem of meaning).

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; An impersonal origin results in everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; finally being equal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why? This reminds me Smullyan describing two possible reactions of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human in front of the comp hyp:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) The human does not trust himself and believes that machine are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stupid at the start. His reaction about comp is: &quot;I am machine thus I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am as stupid as a machine&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) The human trust himself: his reaction with the comp hyp is &quot;Cute, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means machine can be as nice as me&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
Where you can really see that numbers are impersonal is in the fact
<br />
that they don't solve the problem of evil.  Yes, Man is finite and cf
<br />
Sartre, Plato etc. is not a sufficient integration point within himself
<br />
for meaning.  But man, as a person, is also noble and cruel in his
<br />
relationship with himself and other persons.  With an impersonal core,
<br />
the universe/multiverse is totally silent in this area.  With an
<br />
impersonal core, Man's alienation with himself and other persons is
<br />
only because of chance.  With an impersonal core, man is simply
<br />
statistically out of line with the rest of the universe.   With an
<br />
impersonal core, the only possible definition of &quot;right&quot; vs. &quot;wrong&quot; is
<br />
statistical (e.g. the average), and ultimately there is no difference
<br />
between cruelty and non-cruelty.  As Marquis de Sade said, &quot;What is, is
<br />
right&quot;.  If we were all tied to a computer which takes the average and
<br />
spits it out as the current definition of &quot;right&quot;, then after a while,
<br />
if it weren't for meaningless random fluctuations, it would filter into
<br />
a constant and we would all end up flat-lining.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Impersonal+complexity does not produce personal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would like to see a proof of that statement. The comp first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to me to be a counterexample, unless you assume at the start the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; negation of comp (and weaker-comp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
See above paragraph.  Impersonal+complexity produces something with
<br />
evil intrinsically in the mix, and no real solution can exist.  See
<br />
below for more on this.

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is the problem Plato had.  He knew that you need absolutes in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; order to have meaning.  Plato's gods weren't big enough to be the point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of reference needed to define a person.  The gods and fates were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; continuously fighting one another.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are right, but Plato did not know about Church thesis, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incompleteness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I know you get some nice relative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; forms, G*/G and all that.  But in the end it is all meaningless.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are quite quick here. Why would machine's beliefs and hopes be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningless?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
You are talking about relative meaning, meaning relative to the
<br />
machine.  This is why I said *in the end* it is all meaningless.
<br />
Meaning has to address evil and nobility.  See below.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Satre pointed out, no finite point has any meaning without an infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reference point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I totally agree with Sartre's point here. Church thesis is exactly what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gives an absolute infinite reference point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
OK, even saying for the sake of argument Church's Thesis gives an
<br />
absolute infinite reference point.  This is not sufficient for solving
<br />
the problem of evil.  When you change the language or reference frame
<br />
from one machine to the other, suddenly evil (in one machine's
<br />
perspective) gets redefined.  This is the problem that happens for
<br />
example in marriage.  The two person's see each other as a machine in
<br />
an impersonal universe, and the cycle of &quot;I'm withholding love or
<br />
respect until I get love or respect from you&quot; starts and doesn't end...
<br />
until at least one person makes the choice to tap into (and hold onto)
<br />
the ultimate Person who provides the infinite source of unconditional
<br />
love), resulting in the manifestation of nobility rather than cruelty.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Everything that there is is there.  But this is the ultimate in begging
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the question. The question remains, why is everything (I see) there?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Why do I exist?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We have to accept something, if only because we cannot explain prime
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers without accepting the numbers, then comp explains why numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talk like if they were sensible person, like if they were not numbers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like if they believe in a physical reality and beyond.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And above all, G* explains why those beliefs are correct.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can indeed sum up a part of the interview by: machine will correctly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discover their unnameable self and G* will correctly prove that such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self is not a machine from the first and third person point of view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
My view is that, yes because of the limitations of finite systems, cf
<br />
Godel incompleteness, certain things are unnameable *relative* to the
<br />
system, BUT that this does not necessarily imply that the absolute core
<br />
of Everything has to be unnameable by anyone.  I claim that the
<br />
absolute core of Everything is nameable by the core Himself, a Person.
<br />
And He has told us His name: &quot;I AM THAT I AM&quot;.  He is infinite (we are
<br />
not), and He is absolutely good and loving (we originally were and will
<br />
be).  More below.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Relative truth is ultimately useless when it comes to the end of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with you. It is really the discovery of Church thesis, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introduces a lot of &quot;absoluteness&quot; in math (Godel found this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; miraculous) that I have begin to take &quot;mathematicalism&quot; seriously.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
Great.  But again, because of the problem of evil, &quot;mathematicalism&quot; is
<br />
insufficient for a theory of absolutely Everything.  The linguistics
<br />
philosophers confine themselves to too small of a territory.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I would paraphrase Brent Meeker and ask, &quot;Why does 'blind' have to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; default?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If &quot;non blindness&quot; is introduced as an hypothesis, it will prevent at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the start any possible impersonal (blind) explanation of &quot;vision&quot;. Like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; putting consciousness in the neuron for explaining consciousness in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain: this does not explain consciousness. Not only this does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain consciousness, but it makes the search of an explanation almost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
Is it not possible that reality indeed has a definite personal
<br />
character, even at the core?  If so, then if you start with impersonal
<br />
blindness, i.e. &quot;Everything is random&quot; no matter how orderly is appears
<br />
locally, then you will never find the definite personal character of
<br />
the universe, because if you take this blind approach absolutely
<br />
seriously you will always ignore order and character and personality as
<br />
intrinsic. (Actually nobody does that consistently.  See story at end.)

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My response to Bruno addresses the assumption of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; impersonality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not convinced. The assumption of a personal God, like the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption of an impersonal physical universe, explains nothing. Imo.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It explains neither mind nor matter, nor ... God.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, I have much more evidence---empirical and theoretical--- for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (probably impersonal and immaterial) God, than for a primitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impersonal physical universe, which I take to be a locally useful FAPP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; superstition which does not resist reflection and introspection, as I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; try to illustrate with machine's introspection.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/</a>

</em><br />
Here is more on the problem of evil:

<br />
If we assume that there as been a continuous line of intrinsic evil in
<br />
the universe (as the impersonal core has to), then there is an unbroken
<br />
line between what man is now and what he has always been, i.e. man has
<br />
always had a thread of cruelty.  With this assumption, then the
<br />
conclusion would have to be that of French thinker Charles Baudelaire,
<br />
&quot;If there is a God, He is the Devil&quot;.  For example in (impersonal,
<br />
pantheistic) Hinduism, there is constructive Vishnu and destructive
<br />
Kali.  Also, Albert Camus noted that with such a core there is no
<br />
reason to stand against evil, for instance in helping widows and
<br />
orphans in Christianity, because evil is just part of the way things
<br />
intrinsically are.  Finally, with such an impersonal core, with no
<br />
ultimately good personal God, there is no hope of a qualitative change
<br />
in man, since cruelty is intrinsic to the way man has always been.

<br />
The &quot;later Heidegger&quot; saw that this assumption that &quot;man, the way he
<br />
is, is normal&quot; leads to a dead end.  However, his attempted solution
<br />
was only an epistemological solution.  He put the discontinuity at
<br />
Aristotle, and called man's problem an epistemological abnormality,
<br />
rather than a moral one.  By &quot;moral&quot; I mean a rejection of our origin
<br />
in the ultimately good Person.  (I don't mean that evolution is false.
<br />
I mean *ultimate* origin.)  However, Heidegger's solution was not
<br />
sufficient, since he did not define evil correctly, since evil can only
<br />
be correctly defined with respect to a Personal core.  I maintain that
<br />
any impersonal core has this same instrinsic limitation.

<br />
Plato searched for a place to root his absolutes.  Neither Plator nor
<br />
the neo-Platonists found the solution because their impersonal gods
<br />
were not immune from evil.  The impersonal gods ultimately cannot
<br />
distinguish between man's finiteness and his cruelty.  Only the
<br />
infinite personal good God has a character from which evil is totally
<br />
excluded.  This is the only core for which a solution to the real
<br />
problem of evil is possible, so that everything can ultimately be
<br />
brought back into unity and wholeness.

<br />
Finally, regarding the unsolvable dichotomy in the impersonal (closed)
<br />
naturalistic system, Francis Schaeffer tells the following story:
<br />
&quot;I remember sitting in a Lyons' Corner House near Marble Arch in London
<br />
some years ago, talking to a brilliant young physicist.  I asked him
<br />
about the latest work he was doing, and he told me about a new idea
<br />
that he thought might solve Einstein's problem concerning
<br />
electromagnetism and gravity.  He became very enthusiastic about this,
<br />
because I knew enough about the subject to stimulate him, and he was
<br />
far away in his thought.  Then I brought him back by saying, 'This is
<br />
fine for the Christian, who really knows who he is, to say that the
<br />
material universe may finally be reduced to energy particles moving in
<br />
opposite directions in a vortex, but what about your naturalistic
<br />
colleagues?  What happens to them when they go home to their wives and
<br />
families at night?'  He paused for a moment and then said, 'Oh, Dr.
<br />
Schaeffer, they just have to live in a dichotomy.'&quot;
