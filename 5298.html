<br />
The big difference between ethical and aesthetic axioms and the axioms of 
<br />
empirical science is that the latter are so widely accepted that they are 
<br />
not even recognised as axioms, for the most part. If I say &quot;water boils at 
<br />
100 degrees celcius&quot;, this can be proved or disproved to the satisfaction of 
<br />
just about anyone by measuring the temperature of boiling water on several 
<br />
different occasions with several different thermometers. The means of 
<br />
verification contains as it were &quot;hidden&quot; axioms: that checking the boiling 
<br />
point several times with different equipment and obtaining consistent 
<br />
results allows one to generalise about the boiling point of a substance 
<br />
under certain conditions. One could go a level deeper and point out the 
<br />
(axiomatic) assumption that a physical law proved here and now applies to 
<br />
all time and space, the assumption that a logical deduction applies to all 
<br />
possible universes, the &quot;axioms&quot; of logic itself, including rules for using 
<br />
the term &quot;axiom&quot;, definition of &quot;rule&quot;, definition of &quot;definition&quot;... 
<br />
Fortunately, we hardly ever have to go to such lengths in scientific fields 
<br />
because everyone agrees on the basic axioms. Now that I think of it, this 
<br />
could be used to define a field as a science: a field is a scientific field 
<br />
when the underlying axioms are well-defined and not in dispute by the 
<br />
scholars in that field.
<br />
<br />This all stands in stark contrast to ethics and aesthetics, where axiomatic 
<br />
statements (defined as statements taken as given, not dependent on any more 
<br />
basic assumptions) are in dispute all the time. For the record, I am all in 
<br />
favour of being nice to people, opposed to torture and murder, etc. I take 
<br />
these as &quot;axiomatic&quot;, meaning that I cannot give a more basic reason behind 
<br />
my acceptance of these beliefs. Some philosophers may push the axiom one 
<br />
level lower, and say, for example, &quot;murder is wrong _because_ it decreases 
<br />
the net happiness in the world&quot;. In that case, the axiom is the utilitarian 
<br />
belief that &quot;the good is the greatest happiness of the greatest number&quot;. 
<br />
However - and this is the point of this extended reply - there are many who 
<br />
would reject these axioms, especially if they are not of a liberal 
<br />
democratic bent, and there is no way to argue against them as being 
<br />
&quot;irrrational&quot; because if the axiom were rational or irrational it wouldn't 
<br />
be an axiom! If an advanced alien species decided to wipe us out because 
<br />
they regard us in the same way as we regard bacteria, do you seriously think 
<br />
you have a chance of convincing them they are doing something &quot;evil&quot;? What 
<br />
will your argument be when they point out the clause in the Handbook of 
<br />
Intergalactic Ethics which says (after the preamble where it says &quot;we hold 
<br />
these truths to be self-evident&quot;) &quot;...more advanced species have the right 
<br />
to enslave, consume or destroy less advanced species.&quot; It isn't the same as 
<br />
if they got the boiling point of H2O wrong, is it?
