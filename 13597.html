</em><br />
<br />Thank you Colin.  'Eloquence' or 'gibberish'?  Hmm...but let us
<br />
proceed...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; where I identify &lt;&lt;&lt;???&gt;&gt;&gt; as a &quot;necessary primitive&quot; and comment that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'computation' or 'information' or 'complexity' have only the vaguest of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arm waving grip on any claim to such a specific role. Such is the 'magical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emergence' genre.
</em><br />
<br />Just so.  My own 'meta-analysis' is also a (foolhardy?) attempt to
<br />
identify the relevant 'necessity' as *logical*.  The (awesome) power
<br />
of this would be to render 'pure' 3-person accounts (i.e. so-called
<br />
'physical') radically causally incomplete.  Some primitive like yours
<br />
would be a *logically necessary* foundation of *any* coherent account
<br />
of 'what-is'.
<br />
<br />Strawson, and Chalmers, as I've understood them, make the (IMO)
<br />
fundamental mis-step of proposing a superadded 'fundamental property'
<br />
to the 'physical' substrate ('e.g. 'information').  This has the fatal
<br />
effect of rendering such a 'property' *optional* - i.e. it appears
<br />
that everything could proceed just as happily without it in the 3-
<br />
person account, and hence 'consciousness' can (by some) still airily
<br />
be dismissed as an 'illusion'.  The first move here, I think, is to
<br />
stop using the term 'consciousness' to denote any 'property'.
<br />
<br />My own meta-analysis attempts to pump the intuition that all
<br />
processes, whether 0, 1, or 3-person, must from *logical necessity* be
<br />
identified with 'participative encounters', which are unintelligible
<br />
in the absence of *any* component: namely 'participation', 'sense',
<br />
and 'action'.  So, to 'exist' or 'behave', one must be:
<br />
<br />1) a participant (i.e. the prerequisite for 'existence')
<br />
2) sensible (i.e. differentiating some 'other' in relationship)
<br />
3) active (i.e. the exchange of 'motivation' with the related 'other')
<br />
<br />and all manifestations of 'participative existence' must be 'fractal'
<br />
to these characteristics in both directions (i.e. 'emergence' and
<br />
'supervention').  So, to negate these components one-by-one:
<br />
<br />1) if not a participant, you don't get to play
<br />
2) if not sensible, you can't relate
<br />
3) if not active in relationship, you have no 'motivation'
<br />
<br />These logical or semantic characteristics are agnostic to the
<br />
'primitive base'.  For example, if we are to assume AR as that base,
<br />
then the 'realism' part must denote that we 'participate' in AR, that
<br />
'numbers' are 'mutually sensible', and that arithmetical relationship
<br />
is 'motivational'.  If I've understood Bruno, 'computationalism'
<br />
generates 'somethings' at the 1-person plural level.  My arguments
<br />
against 'software uploading' then apply at the level of these
<br />
'emergent somethings', not to the axiomatic base. This is the nub of
<br />
the 'level of substitution' dilemma in the 'yes doctor' puzzle.
<br />
<br />In 'somethingist' accounts, 'players' participate in sensory-
<br />
motivational encounters between 'fundamental somethings' (e.g.
<br />
conceived as vibrational emergents of a modulated continuum).
<br />
<br />The critical move in the above argument is that by making the relation
<br />
between 0,1, and 3-person accounts and the primitives *self-relation*
<br />
or identity, we jettison the logical possibility of 'de-composing'
<br />
participative sensory-motivational relationship.  0,1, and 3-person
<br />
are then just different povs on this:
<br />
<br />0 - the participatory 'arena' itself
<br />
1 - the 'world' of a differentiated 'participant'
<br />
3 - a 'proxy', parasitising a 1-person world
<br />
<br />'Zombies' and 'software' are revealed as being category 3: they
<br />
'parasitise' 1-person worlds, sometimes as 'proxies' for distal
<br />
participants, sometimes 'stand-alone'.  The imputation of 'soft
<br />
behaviour' to a computer, for example, is just such a 'proxy', and has
<br />
no relevance whatsoever to the 1-person pov of the distal
<br />
'participatory player'.  Such a pov can emerge only fractally from its
<br />
*participative* constitution.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle of the kind X must exist or we wouldn't be having this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion. There is no way to characterise explanation through magical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emergence that enables empirical testing. Not even in principle. They are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impotent at all prediction. You adopt the position and the whole job is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; done and is a matter of belief = NOT SCIENCE.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I'm happy on the above basis to make the empirical prediction:
<br />
<br />No 'computer' will ever spontaneously adopt a 1-person pov in virtue
<br />
of any 'computation' imputed to it.
<br />
<br />You, of course, are working directly on this project.  My breath is
<br />
bated!
<br />
<br />For me, one of the most important consequences of the foregoing
<br />
relates to our intuitions about ourselves.  We hear from various
<br />
directions that our 1-person worlds are 'epiphenomenal' or 'illusory'
<br />
or simply that they don't 'exist'.  But this can now be seen to be
<br />
vacuous, deriving from a narrative fixation on the 'proxy', or
<br />
'parasite', rather than the participant.  In fact, it is the tacit
<br />
assumption of sense-action to the parasite (e.g. the 'external world')
<br />
that is illusory, epiphenomenal and non-existent.  Real players -
<br />
participators - inherit the precursors of *all* their characteristics
<br />
from the primitives on which they supervene: hence the fundamental
<br />
'spontaneity' (i.e. 'given-ness') of the primitives must also emerge,
<br />
mutatis mutandis, at the 1-person level.  This is crucial, because we
<br />
can now stop gibbering about 'illusion' (which of course isn't to say
<br />
that we can never be mistaken).  Our personal worlds really are
<br />
'something like' - sensorily, motivationally - the explanatory
<br />
primitives on which they supervene.  After all, sans magic, how else
<br />
could it be?
<br />
<br />Cheers

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; =====================================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 4) Belief in 'magical emergence' .... qualitative novelty of a kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; utterly unrelated to the componentry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Colin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think there's a link here with the dialogue in the 'Asifism' thread
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between Bruno and me. I've been reading Galen Strawson's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Consciousness and its place in Nature&quot;, which has re-ignited some of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the old hoo-hah over 'panpsychism', with the usual attendant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; embarrassment and name-calling. It motivated me to try to unpack the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basic semantic components that are difficult to pin down in these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; debates, and for this reason tend to lead to mutual incomprehension.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Strawson refers to the 'magical emergence' you mention, and what is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his view (and mine) the disanalogy of 'emergent' accounts of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness with, say, how 'liquidity' supervenes on molecular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour. So I started from the question: what would have to be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case at the 'component' level for such 'emergence' to make sense (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm aiming at the semantics here, not 'ultimate truth', whatever that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be). My answer is simply that for 'sensing' and 'acting' to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'emerge' (i.e. supervene on) some lower level, that lower level must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself 'sense' and 'act' (or 'grasp', a word that can carry the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning of both).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What sense does it make to say that, for example, sub-atomic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particles, strings, or even Bruno's numbers, 'grasp' each other?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, semantically, the alternative would be that they would shun and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ignore each other, and we wouldn't get very far on that basis. They
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clearly seem to relate according to certain 'rules', but we're not so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; naive (are we?) as to suppose that these are actually 'laws' handily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supplied from some 'external' domain. Since we're talking 'primitives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here', then such relating, such mutual 'grasping', must just *be*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There's nothing wrong conceptually here, we always need an axiomatic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; base, the question is simply where to situate it, and semantically IMO
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the buck stops here or somewhere closely adjacent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The cool thing about this is, that if we start from such primitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'grasping', then higher-level emergent forms of full sense-action can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now emerge organically by (now entirely valid) analogy with purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; action-related accounts such as liquidity, or for that matter, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emergence of living behaviour from 'dead matter'. And the obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complexity of the relation between, say quantum mechanics and, say,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the life cycle of the sphex wasp, should alert us to an equivalent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complexity in the relationship between primitive 'grasp' and its fully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualitative (read: participatory) emergents - so please let's have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (oh-so-embarrassing) 'conscious electrons' here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Further, it shows us in what way 'software consciousness' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disanalogous with the evolved kind. A computer, or a rock for that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter, is of course also a natural emergent from primitive grasping,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and this brings with it sense-action, but in the case of these objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more action than sense at the emergent level. The software level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description, however, is merely an imputation, supplied externally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (i.e. by us) and imposed as an interpretation (one of infinitely many)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the fundamental grasped relations of the substrate components. By
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contrast, the brain (and here comes the research programme) must have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolved (crucially) to deploy a supremely complex set of 'mirroring'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes that is (per evolution) genuinely emergent from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primitive 'grasp' of the component level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From this comes (possibly) the coolest consequence of these semantics:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our intrinsic 'grasp' of our own motivation (i.e. will, whether 'free'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or not), our participative qualitative modalities, the relation of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suffering to subsequent action, and so forth, emerge as indeed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'something like' the primitive roots from which they inherit these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characteristics. This is *real* emergence, not magical, and at one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stroke demolishes epiphenomenalism, zombies, uploading fantasies and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the other illusory consequences of confusing the 'external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world' (i.e. a projection) with the participatory one in which we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; included.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ===========================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Methinks you 'get it'. You are far more eloquent than I am, but we talk of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same thing..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Liquidity is to H2O
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;???&gt;&gt;&gt; is to consciousness (qualia)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where I identify &lt;&lt;&lt;???&gt;&gt;&gt; as a &quot;necessary primitive&quot; and comment that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'computation' or 'information' or 'complexity' have only the vaguest of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arm waving grip on any claim to such a specific role. Such is the 'magical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emergence' genre.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have a viable candidate for the 'necessary primitive' of the kind you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seek. Note that regardless of what anyone's suggestion  for such a thing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be, the process of declaring it valid must arise in the form of (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you intuit above) an axiom. That is, it must come in the form of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement such as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; X = &quot;It is a fundamental principle of the natural world that &lt;&lt;&lt; such and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such a thing&gt;&gt; is the ultimate necessary primitive state of affairs that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be the case for consciousness to a) deliver a faculty of observation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at all and then b) for biological delivery that, when observing its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes delivering observation, looks like brain material when that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is happening and NOT when it isn't&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the generic form of the kind of 'fundamental principle' that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chalmers called for in his 1996 book. You cannot escape the reality of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some form of X, regardless of &lt;&lt;&lt;such and such a thing&gt;&gt;. In terms of X:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; liquidity is to H2O
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The property X  is to consciousness (qualia)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Such a statement, in one fell swoop, eliminates the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circularity/self-fulfilment of the magical emergence kind...that which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have been at pains to point out (dialog with Russel) is inherent at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiple levels in the 'computationalist' or 'eliminativist' or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'functionalist' or 'representationalist' flavours of magical emergence. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle of the kind X must exist or we wouldn't be having this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion. There is no way to characterise explanation through magical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emergence that enables empirical testing. Not even in principle. They are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impotent at all prediction. You adopt the position and the whole job is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; done and is a matter of belief = NOT SCIENCE.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remaining at the 'meta' level of general discussion of statements of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind X, we can make a couple of important observations:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) X must be consistent with all empirical (neuroscience/cognitive) evidence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) X must at least in principle be able to make verifiable novel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predictions of the natural world critically dependent on X being the case.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If it cannot do this then it is not viable. If it can make even ONE then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is a better proposition than magical emergence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note there is a unique character to X that is unlike anything science has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ever encountered. Direct evidence for X is not any specific observation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is the cause of the mere possibility of any observation at all. As I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have said in previous posts.... &quot;that which is seen (contents of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness) is our traditional demanded source of explicit scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence. However...&quot;Seeing&quot; (any observation/consciousness at all) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic/implicit evidence of the existence of circumstances that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily exist or no explicit observation would exist. Every explicit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; act of scientific observation also delivers implicit evidence of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ability to observe. In other words evidence of the lack of qualia is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; failure to observe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only third party verifyable circumstance where failure to observe can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be counted as evidence is in the failure of the scientific act. Hence my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insistence that science and the scientific act be the evidentiary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circumstances of a viable empirical science directed at proving X.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Other than this strangeness (scientists themselves are evidence), the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process is just like any other scientific process. Business as usual.
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If Galen Strawson is setting fire to the magical emergence camp....GOOD!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have an X proposition that delivers what looks like panpsychism, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isn't actually....well... if X is a principle that applies universally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (something that exists at all spatial scales... inherent in the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe) and is intrinsic, logically unavoidable and implicit...then does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that count as panpsychism? I don't know. Frankly I don't care!...X is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; member of the class &quot;Law of Physics&quot;. Where it fits philosophically is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone else's problem. Not such characterisation has any impact on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirical work... and I am fiendishly empirical to the bitter end...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Before I re-deliver my X... I'd like to leave the discussion at the META-X
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level (about any X or about all possible Xs)....over to you....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cheers
