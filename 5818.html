<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;else did.  And your description is not consistent with that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;This illustrates another problem with the lane-changing example, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;is that the described mechanism for choosing lanes (choose at random)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;is not typical.  Most people don't flip a coin to choose the lane they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;will drive in.
</em><br />
<br />I agree with both of these remarks. Of course that is not
<br />
the mechanism for choosing lanes, and that may be the
<br />
problem with the whole argument. As John M pointed out,
<br />
a highway is a very complex system, and we are treating
<br />
it in a model that might just not correspond to the real
<br />
thing.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, trying to think of an idealized model
<br />
might not tell us anything about the specific problem we
<br />
are talking about, but can shed some light on a general
<br />
class of (at least gedanken) problems.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Suppose we modify it so that you are handed a biased coin, a coin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;will come up heads or tails with 99% vs 1% probability.  You know about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;the bias but you don't know which way the bias is.  You flip the coin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;and walk into the room.  Now, I think you will agree that you have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;good reason to expect that when you turn on the light, you will be in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;the more crowded room.  You are now a typical member of the room so the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;same considerations that make one room more crowded make it more likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;that you are in that room.
</em><br />
In this case, I agree with the expectation you might have
<br />
in the end. 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes, this is correct. The &quot;typical observer&quot; must be typical in the way he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; makes the choice of room or lane. With the traffic example, given that there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are slower and faster lanes on most roads, even in the absence of road works 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or accidents, this may mean that for whatever reason the typical driver on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that day is more likely to choose the slower lane on entering the road. If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this is so, then a winning strategy for getting to your destination faster 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could be to pick the lane with the most immediate appeal, then reflect on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this (having participated in the present discussion) and choose a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; _different_ lane. This is analogous to counter-cyclical investing in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; stock market, where you deliberately try to do the opposite of what the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; typical investor does.
</em><br />
<br />I think I start to understand Bostrom's argument. In case we
<br />
don't know the mechanism that took us to the point we are;
<br />
and if it is reasonable to make the assumption that we just
<br />
followed the same mechanism as everyone else; and in case
<br />
this mechanism is biased towards one of the lanes;
<br />
THEN I can think of myself as a typical driver in the road,
<br />
such that it would be more likely for me to be at the slower
<br />
lane. 
<br />
<br />The weak link of this argument is the third premise, though.
<br />
But provided that the mechanism is biased, and affects everyone
<br />
equally, there are grounds for Bostrom's reasoning.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But there may be a problem with the above argument. Suppose everyone really 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; did flip a perfectly fair coin to decide which lane of traffic to enter. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is then still very most that one lane would be more crowded than the other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at any given time, purely through chance. Now, every driver might reason, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;everyone including me has flipped a coin to decide which lane to enter, so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there is nothing to be gained by changing lanes&quot;. However, most of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; drivers reasoning thus would, by chance, be in the more crowded lane, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; therefore most would in fact be better off changing lanes.
</em><br />
<br />In the road case, as Stathis points out above, it is possible
<br />
to make one of the lanes be more crowded than the other merely
<br />
by each driver randomly choosing a lane by chance. In fact,
<br />
it is very *unlikely* that both lanes would have the same speed
<br />
with such a pure random mechanism. 
<br />
<br />But in this case, there is no basis for the third premise above.
<br />
Suppose, in the room problem, that instead of a biased coin,
<br />
everyone tossed a fair coin, as in Stathis original problem, and
<br />
enters a room by the decision of the coin. If the number of people
<br />
is large enough, it is highly likely that one of the rooms will
<br />
be more crowded. But as you enter one of the rooms, you have no
<br />
reason to believe that you are in the more crowded room, **even
<br />
though you followed the same mechanism as everyone else**, in
<br />
constrast with Stathis original problem (where there were already
<br />
1000/10 people in each room).
<br />
<br />And this is the case where this problem is most paradoxical.
<br />
We are very likely to have one of the lanes more crowded than
<br />
the other; most of the drivers reasoning would thus, by chance,
<br />
be in the more crowded lane, such that they would benefit from
<br />
changing lanes; even though, NO PARTICULAR DRIVER would benefit
<br />
from changing lanes, on average. No particular driver has basis
<br />
for infering in which lane he is. In this case you cannot reason
<br />
as a random sample from the population.
<br />
<br />Eric.
