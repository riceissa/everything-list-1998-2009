<br />These are difficult issues... First it seems that the UD does not have 
<br />
to be a basic assumption from which the plenitude can be derived. I 
<br />
think you agree with that.
<br />
<br />Another issue is that if we begin with the basic assumption of first 
<br />
person perspective (from which the third person can be derived when 
<br />
first persons share the same frame of reference) then the plenitude 
<br />
should necessarily be regarded from the first person perspective.
<br />
<br />Is it correct to say that the plenitude is invariant when seen from the 
<br />
first person? In other words, are all the future potentialities present 
<br />
in the same amount as seen by any observer (no matter how little or how 
<br />
much his life is compromised by his circumstances)? This may be a basic 
<br />
invariance law in the MWI similar to the invariance of c in relativity.
<br />
<br />If this invariance is true, then your statement that the UD is a nice 
<br />
third person description for the plenitude is OK however it would only 
<br />
be a derivation from the plenitude invariance principle The UD would 
<br />
also be invariant to describe or generate the plenitude, for any observer.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please recall me your feelings about the comp hyp in the cognitive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science/philosophy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of mind, if you mind. 
</em><br />
<br />This is a hard question to answer, but I'll give it a try. I am very 
<br />
committed to the first person &quot;relativistic&quot; or &quot;relative&quot; perspective. 
<br />
I believe that science has been gradually moving toward it from the days 
<br />
of Galileo and Copernicus. Einstein made the &quot;I&quot; relative in space and 
<br />
time. Everett made it relative in the quantum realm. I want to push that 
<br />
to its ultimate conclusion: that the &quot;I&quot; should be the basic axiom from 
<br />
which everything else derives. In &quot;I&quot;, I include consciousness and its 
<br />
logical process.
<br />
<br />I reviewed your Universal Dovetailer Argument. at your internet site and 
<br />
I agree very much with it. However, I have some questions. Step 1-11 
<br />
forces the reader to consider the first person perspective. Step 12  may 
<br />
have been taken too hastily. It presumes that the observer in steps 1-11 
<br />
exists in a plenitude (for example a closed set of the set of 
<br />
programmable functions). This is not clear. In fact step 1-11 could have 
<br />
been taken in a reduced universe.
