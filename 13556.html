<br />Well, you might as well ask why the engine drives the car and not the
<br />
brakes.  Presumably (insert research programme here) the different
<br />
neural (or other relevant) organisation of the cortex is the
<br />
difference that makes the difference.  My account would run like this:
<br />
the various emergent organs of the brain and sensory apparatus (like
<br />
everything else) supervene on an infrastructure capable of 'sense-
<br />
action'.  I'm (somewhat) agnostic about the nature of this
<br />
infrastructure: conceive it as strings, particles, or even Bruno's
<br />
numbers.  But however we conceptualise it, it must (logically) be
<br />
capable of 'sense-action' in order for activity and cognition to
<br />
supervene on it.  Then what makes the difference in the cortex must be
<br />
a supremely complex 'mirroring' mode of organisation (a 'remembered
<br />
present') lacked by other organs.  To demonstrate this will be a
<br />
supremely difficult empirical programme, but IMO it presents no
<br />
invincible philosophical problems if conceived in this way.
<br />
<br />A note here on 'sense-action':  If we think, for example and for
<br />
convenience, of particles 'reacting' to each other in terms of the
<br />
exchange of 'forces', ISTM quite natural to intuit this as both
<br />
'awareness' or 'sensing', and also 'action'.  After all, I can't react
<br />
to you if I'm not aware of you.  IOW, the 'forces' *are* the sense-
<br />
action.  And at this fundamental level, such motivation must emerge
<br />
intrinsically (i.e. *something like* the way we experience it) to
<br />
avoid a literal appeal to any extrinsic source ('laws').  Kant saw
<br />
this clearly in terms of his 'windowless monads', but these, separated
<br />
by the 'void', indeed had to be correlated by divine intervention,
<br />
since (unaware of each other) they could not interact.  Nowadays, no
<br />
longer conceiving the 'void' as 'nothing', we substitute a modulated
<br />
continuum, but the same semantic demands apply.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This point is poised on the cliff edge of loaded word meanings and their

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; use with the words 'sufficient' and 'necessary'. By technology I mean

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; novel artifacts resulting from the trajectory of causality including human

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; scientists. By that definition 'life', in the sense you infer, is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; technology. The resulting logical loop can be thus avoided. There is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; biosphere that arose naturally. It includes complexity of sufficient depth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to have created observers within it. Those observers can produce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; technology. Douglas Adams (bless him) had the digital watch as a valid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; product of evolution - and I agree with him - it's just that humans are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; necessarily involved in its causal ancestry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your argument that only consciousness can give rise to technology loses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; validity if you include &quot;must be produced by a conscious being&quot; as part of

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;    That assumes that complexity itself (organisation of information) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;    origin of consciousness in some unspecified, unjustified way. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;    position is completely unable to make any empirical predictions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;    about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;    nature of human conscousness (eg why your cortex generates qualia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;    and your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;    spinal chord doesn't - a physiologically proven fact).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; STATHIS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, why does your eye generate visual qualia and not your big toe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It's because the big toe lacks the necessary machinery.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Colin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am afraid you have your physiology mixed up. The eye does NOT generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; visual qualia. Your visual cortex  generates it based on measurements in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the eye. The qualia are manufactured and simultaneously projected to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; appear to come from the eye (actually somewhere medial to them). It's how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you have 90degrees++ peripheral vison. The same visual qualia can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; generated without an eye (hallucination/dream). Some blind (no functioning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; retina) people have a visual field for numbers. Other cross-modal mixups
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can occur in synesthesia (you can hear colours, taste words). You can have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a &quot;phantom big toe&quot; without having any big toe at all....just because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cortex is still there making the qualia. If you swapped the sensory nerves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in two fingers the motor cortex would drive finger A and it would feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; like finger B moved and you would see finger A move. The sensation is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; your head, not the periphery. It's merely projected at the periphery.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course all that is true, but it doesn't explain why neurons in the cortex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are the ones giving rise to qualia rather than other neurons or indeed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; peripheral sense organs.
