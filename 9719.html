Stathis agreed with most of my long post, but then wrote
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What I disagree with is your statement that the mind of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer really played any key role. True, in most realistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; situations it helped for the new sentient race to have minds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and to exercise them in the conscious collection of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; far flung pages; but accidental solar winds from millions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of stars per chance could have done exactly the same thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So the book would come back into existence again, totally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; without observers being present anywhere in the universe.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, but first you would have to wait for chance or whatever to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; put the book back together again, and then you would have to wait
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for someone to read it if it's going to be of any use, right?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's not performing its bookish function at any given time unless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is being read, and it's not going to be readable until it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assembled in the appropriate way.
</em><br />
<br />Well, that applies to old books hidden in secret passages in monasteries.
<br />
We ought to say that they exist, but have been currently forgotten about.
<br />
But the books are still there, even if no one knows about them, just as
<br />
a falling tree creates sound, even if no one is there to listen. (Feynman
<br />
chimed in on this one saying that the falling tree makes scratches on
<br />
leaves that corresponded to the vibrations through the air, and so it
<br />
did make a sound---and who is going to argue with Feynman? :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chopped up moments of conscious experience, on the other hand, do *not*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need to be specially ordered nor do they need to have an external observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to appreciate them (although they would be less lonely if they did), ...
</em><br />
<br />I know what you are saying, and agree.  But as we are evidently arguing
<br />
about what the term &quot;exists&quot; should mean (i.e. how we should use it, given
<br />
that its usage does shape our thinking), then I'm stubbornly clinging to
<br />
the idea that the book existed too.
<br />
<br />I guess you are right: the set of OMs in question has a certain additional
<br />
benefit or use: they are of use to the person himself.
<br />
<br />Lee
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; because (a) they have their own observer built in, by definition, and (b) their ordering is a function of their information
</em><br />
content, not a function of specially being linked up by someone. This is expressed well in Greg Egan's &quot;Permutation City&quot;, in which
<br />
the upload's moments of conscious experience are implemented here, there, backwards, forwards, etc. on a distributed computer
<br />
network, but the result from the inside (as it were) is of a single continuous conscious stream. This is not the case for an
<br />
external observer: the widely distributed computations have to be specially ordered and interpreted to make any sense, just as the
<br />
words in a book have to be specially ordered, and without this ordering they are so much noise. But for the observer implemented by
<br />
the computations himself, the ordering follows implicitly from the nature of the information being encoded, as surely as 3 follows 2
<br />
and precedes 4 .
