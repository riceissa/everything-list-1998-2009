<br />Don't rest so quickly, Jesse. I have read Tim's argument and while I 
<br />
found it intriguing, I thought that it was too simplistic. Tim's 
<br />
argument did not convince me.
<br />
<br />To paraphrase Shakespeare  &quot;Oh what a wonderful web we weave when we 
<br />
practice to perceive.&quot;
<br />
<br />Our perceived universe must be, as Bruno says, a &quot;logical extension&quot; of 
<br />
ourselves. If we look at the world around us we must be capable of 
<br />
generating an anthropic &quot;tale&quot; explaining us. The question hinges is how 
<br />
detailed should this tale be to satisfy our degree of resolution. The 
<br />
finer the resolution, the larger the tale must be. Given the size of the 
<br />
univere, I would say that our resolution is pretty fine. (There may be a 
<br />
relationship between Planck's constant and Hubble constant - I have read 
<br />
somewhere that someone was playing with these numbers to show such a 
<br />
relationship. Maybe it was Feynman)
<br />
<br />The above argument is kind of analogous to trying to represent a signal 
<br />
by means of a Fourier series. The more resolution we want in our signal, 
<br />
the more terms we need. Well, it appear that the amount of resolution 
<br />
that WE need, requires the whole universe to explain. Think about it. No 
<br />
time was wasted in our creation.Every step in the chain of event that 
<br />
lead to our existence was necessary. Humans have existed for a few 
<br />
hundred of thoushands of years. To make humans possible mulitcellular 
<br />
life had had to evolve from unicellular life for about 500 million 
<br />
years. It took about 3.5 billion years for the earth to cool down and to 
<br />
generate unicellular life.  Before that it took about 8 billion years 
<br />
for the first stars to cook enough heavy elements to make  life 
<br />
possible. As you go back in time, the tale that you are weaving expands, 
<br />
the causal pyramid grows.  The tale ends when you reach quantum 
<br />
indeterminacy in the cosmic scale, at the big bang, and quantum 
<br />
indeterminacy at the microscale. 
<br />
<br />Could we have evolved more quickly? Possibly, but improbably. Creating 
<br />
humans, using a whole universe on a 12 billion years schedule seems to 
<br />
me to be pretty economical and time efficient job.
