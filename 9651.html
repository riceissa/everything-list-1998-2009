<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Hal Finney in his recent thread on teleportation thought

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiments disagrees with the above view. He suggests
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that it is possible for  a subject to apparently undergo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; successful teleportation, in that the individual walking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; out of the receiving station has all the appropriate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mental and physical attributes in common with the individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; entering the transmitting station, but in reality not survive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the procedure. I have difficulty understanding this, as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seems to me that the subject has survived by definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, if you've characterized his views correctly, then he's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not in agreement with you, me, and Derek Parfit. What might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be fun to explore is how desperate some people would have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be in order to teleport (or perhaps how lucrative the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opportunity?).  Also, I suppose that if you confided to them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that this was happening to them all the time thousands of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times per second, they'd still have some unfathomable reason
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not to go near a teleporter.
</em><br />
<br />Sorry, I have been reading the list somewhat lightly recently and
<br />
have missed some threads.
<br />
<br />What I argued was that it would be easier to find the trace of a person's
<br />
thoughts in a universe where he had a physically continuous record than
<br />
where there were discontinuities (easier in the sense that a smaller
<br />
program would suffice).  In my framework, this means that the universe
<br />
would contribute more measure to people who had continuous lives than
<br />
people who teleported.  Someone whose life ended at the moment of
<br />
teleportation would have a higher measure than someone who survived
<br />
the event.  Therefore, I would view teleportation as reducing measure
<br />
similarly to doing something that had a risk of dying.  I would try to
<br />
avoid it, unless there were compensating benefits (as indeed might be
<br />
the case, just as people willingly accept the risk of dying by driving
<br />
to work, because of the compensating benefits).
<br />
<br />You can say that &quot;by definition&quot; the person survives, but then, you
<br />
can say anything by definition.  I guess the question is, what is the
<br />
reasoning behind the definition.
<br />
<br />As far as Lee's suggestion that people could be dying thousands of
<br />
times a second, my framework does not allow for arbitrary statements
<br />
like that.  Given a physical circumstance, we can calculate what happens.
<br />
It's not just arbitrary what we choose to say about life and death.
<br />
We can calculate the measure of different subjective life experiences,
<br />
based on the physical record.
<br />
<br />If we wanted to create a physical record where this framework would
<br />
be compatible with saying that people die often, it would be necessary
<br />
to physically teleport people thousands of times a second.  Or perhaps
<br />
the same thing could be done by freezing people for a substantial time,
<br />
reviving them for a thousandth of a second, then re-freezing them again
<br />
for a while, etc.
<br />
<br />If we consider the practical implications of such experiments I don't
<br />
think it is so implausible to view them as being worse than living a
<br />
single, connected, subjective life.  It would be quite difficult to
<br />
interact in a meaningful way with the world under such circumstances.
<br />
<br />However, if one were so unfortunate as to be put into such a situation,
<br />
then it would no longer be particularly bad to teleport.  You're being
<br />
broken into pieces all the time anyway, so the event of teleportation
<br />
would presumably not make things any worse.  Particularly if you were
<br />
somehow being teleported thousands of times a second, then adding a
<br />
teleportation would basically be meaningless since you're teleporting
<br />
anyway at every instant.  So I don't agree with Lee's conclusion that
<br />
in this situation people would still resist teleportation.
