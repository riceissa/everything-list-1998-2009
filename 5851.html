<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Not to detract from your main point, but I want to point out that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;sometimes there is ambiguity about how to count worlds, for example in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the many worlds interpretation of QM.  There are many examples of QM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;based world-counting which seem to show that in most worlds, probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;theory should fail.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure what examples you have in mind here,
</em><br />
<br />The specific kind of example goes like this.  Suppose you take a
<br />
vertically polarized photon and pass it through a polarizer that is
<br />
tilted slightly from the vertical.  Quantum mechanics predicts that
<br />
there is a high chance, say 99%, that the photon will pass through,
<br />
and a low chance, 1%, that it will not make it and be absorbed.
<br />
<br />Now, the many worlds interpretation can be read to say that the universe
<br />
splits into two when this experiment occurs.  There are two possible
<br />
outcomes: either it passes through or it is absorbed.  So there are two
<br />
universes corresponding to the two results.
<br />
<br />However, the universes are not of equal probability, according to QM.
<br />
One should be observed 99% of the time and the other only 1% of the
<br />
time.
<br />
<br />The discrepancy gets worse if we imagine repeating the experiment multiple
<br />
times.  Each time the multiverse splits again in two.  If we did it, say,
<br />
20 times, there would be 2^20 or about 1 million universes.  In only
<br />
one of those universes did the photon take the 99% chance each time,
<br />
yet that is the expected result.  By a counting argument, the chance
<br />
of getting that result is only one in a million since only one world
<br />
out of a million sees it.  This is the apparent contradiction between
<br />
the probability predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics and the MWI,
<br />
assuming that we count worlds in this way.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but this is actually the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general point I was trying to make: probability theory doesn't seem to work 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same way in a many worlds cosmology, due to complications such as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers multiplying and then not being able to access the entire 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability space after the event of interest.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consider these three examples:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (A) In a single world cosmology, I claim that using my magic powers, I have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bestowed on you, and you alone, the ability to pick the winning numbers in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this week's lottery. If you then buy a lottery ticket and win the first 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prize, I think it would be reasonable to concede that there was probably 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some substance to my claim (if not magic powers, then at least an effective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way of cheating).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (B) In a single world cosmology, I announce that using my magic powers, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have bestowed on some lucky gambler the ability to pick the winning numbers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this week's lottery. Now, someone does in fact win the first prize this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; week, but that is not surprising, because there is almost always at least 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one winner each week. I cannot reasonably claim to have helped the winner 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless I had somehow tagged him or otherwise uniquely identified him before 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the lottery was drawn, as in (A).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (C) In a many worlds cosmology, I seek you out as in (A) and make the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim about bestowing on you the ability to pick the winning numbers in this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; week's lottery. You buy a ticket, and win first prize. Should you thank me 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for helping you win, as in (A)? In general, no; this situation is actually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more closely analogous to (B) than to (A). For it is certain that at least 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one future version of you will win, just as it is very likely that at least 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one person will win in the single world example. I can only claim that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; helped you win if I somehow identified which version in which world is going 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to win before the lottery is drawn, and that is impossible.
</em><br />
<br />I'm afraid I don't agree with the conclusion in (C).  I definitely should
<br />
thank you.  To see this, let's make my thanks a little more sincere,
<br />
in the form of a payment.  Suppose I agree in advance to pay you $1000
<br />
if you succeed in helping me win the lottery.  I say that is a wise
<br />
decision on my part.  It doesn't cost me anything if you don't help,
<br />
and if you do have some way of rigging the lottery then I can easily
<br />
afford to pay you this modest sum out of my winnings.
<br />
<br />But I think your reasoning suggests that it is unwise, since I will win
<br />
anyway, so why should I pay anything to you?  I don't need to thank you
<br />
in this way.  Do you agree that this follows from your reasoning?
<br />
