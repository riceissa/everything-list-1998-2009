<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If by flying-rabbit you mean any deviation from simplicity, then I agree

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with you.  Notice that our own universe is full of quantum randomness, but

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we don't see any pattern to the randomness. Similarly, an observer in a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Conway's life universe may observe these anomolies that you described, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; most observers would perceive them as random fluctuations rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; flying rabbits. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The universes where the deviations form patterns meaningful to their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observers would collectively have a very small measure compared to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universes where the deviations are perceived as random, because in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; former case the programs to generate the meaningful deviations would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to contain information about what kinds of deviations would be meaningful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to the observers, and that would make them much longer than programs that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simply generate random deviations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Russell Standish sent me private mail referring to his article at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://parallel.hpc.unsw.edu.au/rks/docs/occam/">http://parallel.hpc.unsw.edu.au/rks/docs/occam/</a>, where he made a similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument.  However I am not completely convinced.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Parenthetically, I don't see that the presence of quantum randomness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in our universe is relevant.  If we assume that many-worlds is the true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics of our universe, then in fact our universe is deterministic and is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not full of quantum randomness.  Even if we do have quantum randomness,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that would not be like the situation I am describing, where you have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe which is almost entirely lawful and has some kind of extremely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rare exception.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the viewpoint of my paper &quot;Occam's Razor&quot; paper, QM is not the
</em><br />
&quot;true physics&quot; of the universe. It is just that any observer is
<br />
unlikely to be able to distinguish the behaviour of er world from one
<br />
described by QM. That is the result of the last section of that paper. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree however that you (and Russell) are right that one would not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literally expect to see a flying rabbit or a materializing dragon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The information content of such a manifestation would be large, and most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;miracles&quot; which used a similar quantity of information would be random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in their effects, and probably unnoticeable.
</em><br />
<br />I hadn't noticed until now that Wei Dai agrees with my argument in
<br />
Occam's razor...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nevertheless I think there could be exceptions to the laws of nature which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have major, observable effects while being relatively concise to specify.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Going back to my CA example, in some CA worlds if you had a cell fixed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the &quot;1&quot; state, that could have dramatic macroscopic effects.  It might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appear to be continually radiating the equivalent of energy, for example.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In such a situation, you might have conservation of energy throughout
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the entire universe, except at this one location it would be violated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />A rather poor choice of example - our universe appears to have a
<br />
violation of exactly this sort at its origin. But then, that is
<br />
required of the Anthropic Principle, otherwise we would be here to
<br />
argue about it :)
<br />
<br />More seriously, any undergraduate will be able to demonstrate the
<br />
failure of conservation of energy. I did it several times - even at
<br />
high school. However, the reason this is not worthy of a Nobel prize
<br />
is that experimental error is a more likely explanation for the
<br />
experimental results, than that the conservation law broke down. It
<br />
would require a really massive violation of the magnitude of the
<br />
afore-mentioned dragon to convince the Nobel Prize committee...
<br />
<br />Now of course, with more sophisticated experimental and statistical
<br />
techniques one can increase the sensitivity of the test by many
<br />
orders of magnitude (ie reduce the amount of extra information
<br />
required for a &quot;magical&quot; universe). Of course this can be done so far,
<br />
that the violating universe is no longer considered &quot;magical&quot;. For
<br />
example, if some experimenter should show that mass/energy was violated on
<br />
the scale of 10^{-20} (lets say), then it is unlikely that people
<br />
would say the universe was not regular, and that science failed. The
<br />
researcher might get the Nobel prize, but that would probably be the
<br />
limit of the discovery's impact on the methodology of science.
<br />
<br />Incidently, experiments were conducted in the 1980s to detect
<br />
violations of the baryon conservation no, which were expected to be of
<br />
the order of 10^{-32}/year. In the event, the violations were not
<br />
detected, ruling a particular class of GUT.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The collection of all universes which have this kind of violation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws of nature could, by my argument, have measure not much less than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that of a universe which had the simpler laws of physics which allowed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for no such violation.  Inhabitants of such a universe who have not yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stumbled upon the magic location might think that their observations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give them reason to believe that the laws of physics hold everywhere.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But they are wrong.  There is a significant probability that violations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of this sort exist.  Occam's razor is not as sharp as they believe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I would agree with you. Occam's razor is probabilistic in nature,
<br />
rather like the second law of thermodynamics. There is always the
<br />
possibility of violation.
