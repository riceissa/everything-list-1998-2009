<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you mean randomness, not chaos.  Chaos theory deals with

<br /><br />Don't believe in randomness. &quot;Random&quot; means we don't understand what  
<br />
determines it. Like &quot;Junk DNA&quot;; it's only junk up until we work out  
<br />
what it's really for.
<br />
You can predict with 100% accuracy that systems with varying initial  
<br />
conditions will bifurcate and become chaotic once driven beyond a  
<br />
certain point. What you cannot say is what is determining the order in  
<br />
the chaos once it arrives. That's closer to what I mean.
<br />
<br />2 men start to dig a hole. They are instructed to make it reach a  
<br />
depth of 5 feet. One of them murders the other with his shovel. Nobody  
<br />
predicted that would happen. We can 'determine' the reasons for this  
<br />
event only AFTER it happens, even though it was determined by  
<br />
something that we might have noticed prior to the event if only we had  
<br />
been able to. All action can be seen as logically determined in  
<br />
hindsight. Before something happens is where we would like to be more  
<br />
on top of things. Intelligence exists on terrorism but usually this  
<br />
usually fails to determine our actions to prevent terrorist acts,  
<br />
interestingly enough. If you look closely at what I am saying, it is  
<br />
the rather messy human consciousness part of the equation that SPOILS  
<br />
the mathematical modelling in most cases.  I am saying that a full  
<br />
perceptual scan of the situation often takes us way beyond what the  
<br />
data suggests. Just like the Mumbai massacre - intelligence WAS  
<br />
available that suggested it could happen. Yet the massacre was  
<br />
&quot;allowed&quot; to happen, because nobody could see the looming pattern in  
<br />
the data until after it happened by which time it was bleeding obvious  
<br />
to one and all. It seems that in many situations the sheer volume of  
<br />
information available is as much a part of the problem as the decision- 
<br />
making process. How do we decide? Data alone are incapable of making  
<br />
decisions. You still need a wet, messy human brain with a perceptually  
<br />
skilled mind to do that
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Isn't this kind of like an act of  faith?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No.  Faith isn't based on evidence.  When we use math to model  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality, we do so empirically.  If a distribution doesn't fit after  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; testing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it, we don't use it to model that set of data, for example.  How we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use math
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functionally is different from math itself.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sure, but correlations occur between sets of data and there is a  
<br />
tendency for them to look like causations. Most scientists and data  
<br />
collectors are trained to say &quot;correlations do not necessarily imply  
<br />
causations&quot; which is great advice up until the correlation turns out  
<br />
to BE a causation
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If we could perfectly model where things are heading then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; please tell me why all the BTSOAPs of the dismal science of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; economics world could not arrange a more stable financial future for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; us than the one we are currently moving into?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem with (for example) economic forecasts is not that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics is flawed; the math is fine.  It's the data collection  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flawed.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say that it is the premises - the starting assumptions that  
<br />
are probably flawed, not the collection method, unless by collection  
<br />
method we include the starting assumptions which are unavoidably  
<br />
guiding the triage of the data. The biggest flawed assumption of all  
<br />
is the belief that data collection of itself will give rise to ideas  
<br />
and concepts. Data do not do that. We choose our starting points and  
<br />
assumptions in all cases. Often we aren't even aware of these because  
<br />
- well, they are assumptions and nobody really questions assumptions  
<br />
much. Our way of looking at the data is not itself present in any way  
<br />
in the data. I'm saying that if reality conforms to our model of it,  
<br />
then the danger is we are looking at only a part of the situation. The  
<br />
issue in question is the WHOLE situation, not just that part we CHOOSE  
<br />
to look at. How can we ever be ccertain that we are in fact looking at  
<br />
the whole situation. We only see what our assumptions and premises  
<br />
allow us to see - we are blind to many things up until we get  
<br />
clobbered by them
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  We have access to incomplete and imperfect information with which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to make predictions, so we're occasionally wrong.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Hence my whole argument. I would say you are being somewhat kind!!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  That's exactly what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happened with the banking system in the US, actually...they tried to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical models developed on responsible lendees to apply to other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lendees who were much less likely to pay back the bank, and after a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; while
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the amount of fail exceeded the ability of banks to handle it.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />So why wasn't the &quot;people situation&quot; factored into the modelling? How  
<br />
can we say we have a reputable model to go by when it explicitly does  
<br />
not include the human problem? Answer: people only looked at the money  
<br />
trail. The human foibles were not investigated until they suddenly  
<br />
revealed themselves not as correlations but as causations. Even the  
<br />
High Priest of Economics, the great Alan Greenspan had to admit  
<br />
(rather humiliatingly) that he had been &quot;too trusting of human nature&quot;
<br />
<br />No model of a situation is ever going to be complete if it doesn't  
<br />
include the OBSERVER which is why I think my making an issue of this  
<br />
is relevant to this list.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you're forming a straw man of mathematics, because I don't  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that math does all the things you're suggesting.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Exactly, but people like to think it does. Why we need &quot;Lateral  
<br />
Thinking&quot; or &quot;Possibility Thinking&quot; or &quot;Creative Thinking&quot; to project  
<br />
alternative futures and steer the present into the future by DESIGNING  
<br />
ways around problems.
<br />
<br />Mostly people just stand back and say &quot;Well - if only that pattern had  
<br />
been present in the data we would have seen it and would have been in  
<br />
a position to act&quot;. That's nonsense. Usually we are completely BLIND  
<br />
to the gravitating patterns in the data because our starting  
<br />
assumptions don't allow that kind of clarity of sight
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Mathematics is not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science of fitting math to the natural world, and flaws in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; latter don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggest a fundamental incompleteness (Godel aside) to the former.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No - agreed. I am not &quot;anti-mathematical&quot; by any means. I merely  
<br />
suggest that there are limits - very strong limits - to what we can  
<br />
expect mathematical reasoning to achieve in the light of the chaotic  
<br />
nature of human decision-making in a rapidly evolving (and  
<br />
accelerating) universe. We may be the dream of numbers, but we cannot  
<br />
use the numbers to predict how we ourselves might respond in a given  
<br />
situation. You call that random - well, I am saying it is determined  
<br />
by things we can only be conscious of AFTER events have transpired.
<br />
<br />No data set can ever be the optimum model of a given reality - I don't  
<br />
care what we are modelling.
<br />
