<br />Laugh if you want but one day we will be obliged to
<br />
put clearly our ontological carts on the table, if only to
<br />
satisfy Hal Ruhl in his (long term) search for an 
<br />
*everything* faq :-)
<br />
<br />Well, let me recall you mine: numbers. (natural numbers, 
<br />
positive integers).
<br />
<br />Kronecker said &quot;God creates the natural numbers, all the
<br />
rest has been created by humans&quot; (or something similar to that)
<br />
<br />My favorite current paraphrasing of it  is:
<br />
<br />God creates the natural numbers, all the rest are dreamed
<br />
by universal machines (numbers). 
<br />
<br />All the rest: from the negative numbers to your servitor :-)
<br />
<br />Note that dreams are first person phenomena.
<br />
<br />Some dreams are partially shared because there are entangled with
<br />
deep computational histories. A continuum of histories
<br />
which makes first person plural discours possible, which
<br />
makes rich nich of local third personne realities : worlds,
<br />
universes, multiverses, multimultiverses, and well beyond.  
<br />
<br />Godel's theorem implies that arithmetic seen from inside
<br />
seems *very* big. To be sure, there isn't one drop of
<br />
Cantor Paradise which could not help us to measure this internal
<br />
bigness &quot;feeling&quot;.
<br />
<br />Even George's plenitude seems ridiculously tiny in comparison.
<br />
(Sorry George for this 100% easy and incorrect but funny argument).
<br />
<br />And I am a classical platonist about the truth on numbers and
<br />
their relations, definable or relatively definable ...
<br />
<br />My scientific (third person) ontology = numbers and their relations.
<br />
<br />But then I accept intensional interpretations, which adds 
<br />
in my set of &quot;ontological truth&quot; the whole of computer science, 
<br />
provability logics, ... and ... you and me. 
<br />
<br />First person ontology includes the physical laws and you, and me.
<br />
I hope it is first person plural. With comp, QM (MW) gives
<br />
empirical evidences we share a deep computational history.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    You're the one who tried to distinguish it as &quot;a concrete UD&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but only for the sake of an argument. It helps those who still
<br />
believe in a magical concrete universe to abandon that belief or
<br />
to abandon comp!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I take it, from your above statement, that you do not object to my use 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the term &quot;implemented&quot;.  It seems that, in fact, your claim that while I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have a problem because I need a precise definition of &quot;implementation&quot;, you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;supposedly don't, was totally groundless.
</em><br />
<br />Implementation must be some sort of relative computations. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    It's hard to define &quot;existance&quot;, isn't it? 
</em><br />
<br />No. Positive integers exists. Nothing else. 
<br />
I have no problem if you want more, but in general I don't need it.
<br />
The &quot;right&quot;frontier is somehow arbitrary.
<br />
I *do* &quot;abus de langage&quot;  like saying Hilbert Space exists.
<br />
But it just means that (some) numbers find Hilbert space useful for
<br />
classifying the apparent computational histories their are
<br />
apparently going through.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Certainly, I would say that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whatever structure is responsible for my own thoughts must exist in this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sense.  I only distinguish a &quot;strong sense&quot; from the weaker sense used in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematics, which basically just means self-consistent.
</em><br />
<br />Consistency is an attribute of theories or machines or talking ducks, 
<br />
not of mathematical object like numbers. Your use of &quot;basically&quot;
<br />
hide a confusion between an object and a machine's conception of that
<br />
object.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And why do you want to classify as physical any mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; structures.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That's the &quot;everything&quot; idea, that all math exists, and that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the physics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we see is just a subset of that TOE.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but why any mathematical structures?
<br />
When I say that the number 439 exists, I mean it exists
<br />
with its fellow 438 and 440 in Platon Heaven.
<br />
<br />Of course 439 can incarnate itself in a deeper
<br />
computational history like being the number of pages
<br />
of your current favorite novel.
<br />
<br />You cannot just say physical = mathematical.
<br />
I agree of course, but it is not obvious. It is part of our
<br />
work to make that clear. In particular, in
<br />
that case, we must be able to prove F = ma, or SE.
<br />
<br />What I say is that we have the following reduction with
<br />
comp: physicalness emerges (in some Darwinian/turing-tropic
<br />
way) from the psychological, which also emerges (in the *same*
<br />
Darwinian/turing-tropic) from numbers and their relations.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  We use &quot;physical&quot; to refer to the structure that we guess exists in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strong sense.  If you believe in the AUH, then the distinction disappears.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Most people don't.
</em><br />
<br />The distinction disappears ontologically only, but the appearance 
<br />
of the distinction does not disappear and must be explained.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, we can also use it to refer to things directly related to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what we are seeing.  This leads to statements like &quot;the branch of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wavefunction that I see is physically real, while the rest aren't&quot;.  I don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;like that kind of statement.
</em><br />
<br />I am glad with that! But why a wave function ? remember you cannot
<br />
answer that we infere it from observation. It would not be 
<br />
purely &quot;mathematical&quot; in that case.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Tegmark, like Everett, *do* distinguish the first and third person, which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;helps to make sense of that idea.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Leave Everett alone, he is dead and can't defend himself against your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;abuse of his name.  
</em><br />
<br />How dare you saying that! And beside have you read Everett? 
<br />
I quote it: 
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;We shall be able to introduce into the theory systems which represent
<br />
observers. Such systems can be conceived as automatically functioning
<br />
machines (servomechanisms) possessing recording devices (memory) and 
<br />
which are capable of responding to their environment. The behavior
<br />
of these observers shall always be treated within the framework of 
<br />
wave mechanics. Furthemore, we shall deduce the probabilistic assertions
<br />
of Process 1 [the collapse] as *subjective* appearances to such 
<br />
observers, thus placing the theory in correspondence with experience.
<br />
We are then led to a novel situation in which the formal theory is 
<br />
objectively continuous and causal while subjectively discontinuous and 
<br />
probabilistic.&gt;&gt;  
<br />
(The theory of the universal wave function, Everett in DeWitt &amp; Graham
<br />
page 9).
<br />
In my thought experience (UDA and the like) I use *exactly* the
<br />
Everett notion of subjective/objective. I call them first person and
<br />
third person as in classical philosophy of mind.
<br />
Only in my formal part I give a more sophisticated definition based
<br />
on the definition of knowledge by Thaetetus in the Platon's Thaetetus.
<br />
Note that Everett is wrong in assuming the total psycho/physico 
<br />
parallelism, and this explain why he has not see that the continuum itself
<br />
is subjective !
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm sure that, otherwise, he would find my approach to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be the logical next step for the MWI.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Now I have the definitive evidence that you or your ancestor are
<br />
french, Monsieur Jacques Mallah, le roi Lion.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It sounds more like you want to say that the &quot;view&quot; seen by a conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moment is his &quot;physical world view&quot;.  
</em><br />
<br />No.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If so, this has absolutely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nothing to do with your terms &quot;first person vs. 3rd person views&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as it has nothing to do with time evolution or measure.
</em><br />
<br />... 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't like to call a thought's view his physical world view, but I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;might call it &quot;his effective physical world view&quot;.  (Ever notice how the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;main change that is needed in using the English language, to make it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;correct, is to preface almost every word with &quot;effective&quot;?)
</em><br />
<br />I have rather big and effective doubts about that!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sure. Yes. UD implements all computations, and even all implementations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of all computations.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Great.  So you need a precise definition of &quot;implementation&quot; in order to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;find the measure distribution.  So much for your claim not to need it.
</em><br />
<br />It is the other way round. I know it is hard to swallow or even just
<br />
to realise I'm serious (and not just poetical) but the physical
<br />
emerges from the wole set of possible consistent continuations, so that
<br />
the &quot;physical implementation&quot; appears only in the logical end.
<br />
An another way to put it is that the physical world is defined by all
<br />
implementations with the weaker sense of any relative computation.
<br />
No first person can ever know how it is implemented.
<br />
With comp the solidity of the physical worlds is a result of the complete
<br />
invariance of first person experience for change among implementations.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    In any case, we see once again that the fabled &quot;first person point of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;view&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with the subject under discussion.
</em><br />
<br />It is true that physics and science has evolved through the abandon
<br />
of the first person (Galileo, Einstein). And even Everett does that by
<br />
showing how to evacuate the collapse assumption under the subjective
<br />
appearance. But here I come and show that with comp even the
<br />
schroedinger equation can be explained as a subjective appearance.
<br />
And I explain this in an objective way with an objective definition
<br />
of the subjective. Physics is really reduced to psychology which is
<br />
really reduced to number theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    You need to realize that.  Thoughts exist.  Thoughts have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;characteristics such as the set of things seen by a thought.  Indexical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information is important (and guessing it is how I bring effective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probabilities into QM).  &quot;1st person point of view&quot;, as used on this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list to mean something to do with QTI, is nonsense [...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and does not mean anything. 
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Anything real can be stated in objective terms.
</em><br />
<br />I totally agree with you. In particular subjective experience are real,
<br />
and objective proposition can be stated on them (through informal or
<br />
formal definition).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Just because I realize that some reality has objective existance, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;doesn't mean I don't have conscious experiences (with, indeed, particular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;characteristics).  It's just that I know better than to confuse 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;what I see&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with &quot;what I should believe in&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Sure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you say, prior to the duplication &quot;I will either end up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in Washington xor in Moscow&quot;, that's an objectively false statement.
</em><br />
<br />Correct. I hope you will agree that if you say , prior to the 
<br />
duplication, &quot;I will feel myself ending up 
<br />
in Washington xor in Moscow&quot;, that's an objectively true statement.
<br />
(objectively with comp).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; The difference between the first person and the third person is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; basically the same as the difference between having an headache and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; having a friend having an headhache.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    The above statement makes no sense, unless it is the same as the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difference between having a headache, and having had a headache.
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps. Sure if you are willing to believe there is eventually only
<br />
one person. I am open to that idea but quite not convince yet.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Concerning *believes* the case is arguable. For *knowledge* I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;think you will ever succeed in describing them in some provable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(objectively, 3-person) way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;This can be proved with very reasonable definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;See ref by Benacerraf, or Kaplan and Montague in my thesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Why don't you explain it here?
</em><br />
<br />Because it would be long and technical, I say a little more in
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2487.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2487.html</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Some time ago &quot;merde&quot; was considered as very vulgar, but since then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;it has been overthrown by &quot;shit&quot;, or worse ... &quot;Merde&quot; seems almost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;polite in comparison.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    So does it mean feces?
</em><br />
<br />You mean faeces ?
