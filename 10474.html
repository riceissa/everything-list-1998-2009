<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; According to Stathis Papaioannou:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Given that even in case (c) doctors were completely wrong, the way we test 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; new treatments now is more stringent. However, evidence is still evidence, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; including evidence of past failures from medical history, which must be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; included in any risk/benefit analysis. You can criticise someone for making a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; decision without fair consideration of all the evidence, but you can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; criticise him if he does.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually we can and often do.  The question is one of insight into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one's own ignorance.  Suppose a child is run over by a car which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is driven at high speed through a residential neighborhood.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question of the driver's guilt isn't determined by his knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or ignorance that the child was about to run into the street, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by his lack of insight and prudent adaptation to his own ignorance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of same.  In this case prudent adaptation = driving at a safe speed.
</em><br />
<br />Why would you not include the well-known fact that driving at high speed 
<br />
is more likely to kill someone as &quot;evidence&quot;? If the driver honestly did not know 
<br />
this, say due to having an intellectual disability, then he would have dimminished 
<br />
responsibility for the accident.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Medicine is not like astronomy. Given the self-healing properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of adaptive systems, doing nothing is often the best course of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;action.&quot;  The precautionary principle applies.  
</em><br />
<br />Astronomy does not really have an ethical dimension to it, but most other sciences 
<br />
do. Discovering that cyanide kills people is science; deciding to poison your spouse 
<br />
with cyanide to collect on the insurance is intimately tied up with the science, but it 
<br />
is not itself in the domain of science. 
<br />
<br />As for doing nothing often being the best course of action, that's certainly true, and 
<br />
it *is* a question that can be analysed scientifically, which is the point of placebo 
<br />
controlled drug trials. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The human mind, especially, is capable of &quot;healing&quot; itself (i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finding a new stable equilibrium) in most circumstances without the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aid or hinderance of drugs or lobotomies or electroshock or drilling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; holes in the skull to release demons.  Of course it often takes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time and a change of environment, but what's the alternative?  To
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemically or physically intervene in a self-organizing neural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system is like trying to program a computer with a soldering iron,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based on the observation that computer programs run on electricity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ignorance is unavoidable.  The question is whether one adapts to one's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own ignorance so as to do no harm.
</em><br />
<br />You are suggesting that certain treatments believed to be helpful for mental 
<br />
illness by the medical profession are not in fact helpful. You may be right, because 
<br />
the history of medicine is full of enthusiastically promoted treatments that we now 
<br />
know are useless or harmful. However, this is no argument against the scientific 
<br />
method in medicine or any other field: we can only go on our best evidence.
