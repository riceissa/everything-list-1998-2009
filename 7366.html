<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A good historical analogy is this: to really understand the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;planets, moons, and sun, it was necessary to totally abandon

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Earth-centric view, and try to see the situation from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bird's eye view. By remaining fixated with appearances, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;how it looks *from here*, we could never have advanced to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;truth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is the same here; if you are interested in knowing what the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;case is, and not merely what the appearances are, then you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have to understand that you are a physical process, and it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;may so happen that you execute in different places, and in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different times, and that overlaps are possible.
</em><br />
<br />Certainly, this is the objective truth, and I'm very fond of the objective 
<br />
truth. But when we are talking about first person experience, we are not 
<br />
necessarily claiming that they provide us with objective knowledge of the 
<br />
world; we are only claiming that they provide us with objective knowledge of 
<br />
our first person experience. If I say that I have a headache, and my 
<br />
duplicate says he doesn't have a headache, who can argue with that? In this 
<br />
consists the basis for maintaining that we are two separate people. You say 
<br />
later in your post that if I am to be consistent, I would have to say that 
<br />
we are two different people when we are separated by time as well as space 
<br />
or across parallel universes. What I would say is that my successor tomorrow 
<br />
is potentially &quot;me&quot; if there is continuity of consciousness between all the 
<br />
intermediates between now and then. The successor of my duplicate with the 
<br />
headache does not satisfy this criterion and is therefore not potentially 
<br />
&quot;me&quot;. Arbitrary though this criterion for continuity of identity may be, it 
<br />
is the criterion our minds have evolved with, and calling it irrational will 
<br />
not change that fact. If we are to be strictly rational and consistent, it 
<br />
is simplest to go to the extreme of saying that *none* of the instantiations 
<br />
of an individual are actually the &quot;same&quot; person, which is another way of 
<br />
saying that each observer moment exists only transiently. This would mean 
<br />
that we only live for a moment, to be replaced by a copy who only thinks he 
<br />
has a past and a future. We die all the time, so death is nothing to worry 
<br />
about. I actually believe this extreme view to be closest to the &quot;objective 
<br />
truth&quot;, but I still make plans for the future and I still don't want to 
<br />
&quot;die&quot; in the more usual sense of the word. Being &quot;rational&quot; is completely 
<br />
incapable of making any impact on my biological programming in this case, 
<br />
and as you know, there are people in the world who hold being rational in 
<br />
much lower esteem than the members of this list do.
