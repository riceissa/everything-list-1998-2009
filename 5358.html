<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The theory of consciousness is needed because I think the conditional

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;next
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; moment will probably have most of the same memories, personality, etc. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; current one, instead of having my subjective experience flit about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; radically different observer-moments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Such questions can also be addressed using only an absolute measure. So, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;doesn't my subjective experience ''flit about between  radically different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moments''? Could I tell if it did? No! All I can know about are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;memories stored in my brain about my ''previous'' experiences. Those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;memories of ''previous'' experiences are part of the current experience. An
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moment thus contains other ''previous'' observer moments that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consistent with it.
</em><br />
<br />But I would expect this consistency to be a matter of degree, because 
<br />
sharing &quot;memories&quot; with other observer-moments also seems to be a matter of 
<br />
degree. Normally we use the word &quot;memories&quot; to refer to discrete episodic 
<br />
memories, but this is actually a fairly restricted use of the term, episodic 
<br />
memories are based on particular specialized brain structures (like the 
<br />
hippocampus, which if damaged can produce an inability to form new episodic 
<br />
memories like the main character in the movie 'Memento') and it is possible 
<br />
to imagine conscious beings which don't have them. The more general kind of 
<br />
memory is the kind we see in a basic neural network, basically just 
<br />
conditioned associations. So if a theory of consciousness determined 
<br />
&quot;similarity&quot; of observer-moments in terms of a very general notion of memory 
<br />
like this, there'd be a small degree to which my memories match those of any 
<br />
other person on earth, so I'd expect a nonzero (but hopefully tiny) 
<br />
probability of my next experience being that of a totally different person.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Therefore all one needs to show is that the absolute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure assigns a low probability to observer-moments that contain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inconsistent observer-moments.
</em><br />
<br />But if observer-moments don't &quot;contain&quot; past ones in discrete way, but just 
<br />
have some sort of fuzzy &quot;degree of similarity&quot; with possible past 
<br />
observer-moments, then you could only talk about some sort of probability 
<br />
distribution on possible pasts, one which might be concentrated on 
<br />
observer-moments a lot like my current one but assign some tiny but nonzero 
<br />
probability to very different ones.
<br />
<br />In any case, surely my current observer-moment is not complex enough to 
<br />
contain every bit of information about all observer-moments I've experienced 
<br />
in the past, right? If you agree, then what do you mean when you say my 
<br />
current one &quot;contains&quot; past ones?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As for probabilities not being conserved, what do you mean by that? I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; assuming that the sum of all the conditional probabilities between A and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible &quot;next&quot; observer-moments is 1, which is based on the quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; immortality idea that my experience will never completely end, that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; always have some kind of next experience (although there is some small
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probability it will be very different from my current one).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't believe in the quantum immortality idea. In fact, this idea arises
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if one assumes a fundamental conditional probability.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, it depends on whether one believes there is some theory that would give 
<br />
an objective truth about first-person conditional probabilities. But even if 
<br />
one does assume such an objective truth about conditional probabilities, 
<br />
quantum immortality need not *necessarily* be true--perhaps for a given 
<br />
observer-moment, this theory would assign probabilities to various possible 
<br />
future observer-moments, but would also include a nonzero probability that 
<br />
this observer-moment would be a &quot;terminal&quot; one, with no successors. However, 
<br />
I do have some arguments for why an objective conditional probability 
<br />
distribution would at least strongly suggest the quantum immortality idea, 
<br />
which I outlined in a post at 
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m4805.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m4805.html</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;everything should follow from an absolute measure. From this quantity one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;should derive an effective conditional probability. This probability will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;longer be well defined in some extreme cases, like in case of quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suicide experiments. By probabilities being conserved, I mean your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;condition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that ''the sum of  all the conditional probabilities between A and all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  possible &quot;next&quot; observer-moments is 1'' should hold for the effective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conditional probability. In case of quantum suicide or amnesia (see below)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this does not hold.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;effective conditional probability&quot;...is it 
<br />
just the P(S'|S) = P(S')/P(S) idea you suggested earlier? This equation 
<br />
would seem to suggest that the degree of similarity between two 
<br />
observer-moments is irrelevant when deciding the conditional probability of 
<br />
experiencing the second after the first, that if an observer-moment of 
<br />
Charlie Chaplin's brain in 1925 has the same absolute probability as an 
<br />
observer-moment of my brain 1 second from now, I should expect the same 
<br />
probability of either one as my next experience. But from your other 
<br />
comments I guess you're also adding that if an observer-moment S' doesn't 
<br />
&quot;contain&quot; my current one S then there's 0 probability I will experience it 
<br />
next.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Finally, as for your statement that &quot;the relative measure is completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fixed by the absolute measure&quot; I think you're wrong on that, or maybe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; were misunderstanding the condition I was describing in that post.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree with you. I was wrong to say that it is completely fixed. There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some freedom left to define it. However, in a theory in which everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;follows from the absolute measure, I would say that it can't be anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;else than P(S'|S)=P(S')/P(S)
</em><br />
<br />Only if you also impose the condition that each observer-moment has a unique 
<br />
past, that there can be no &quot;merging&quot;. If merging is possible, the 
<br />
conditional measure could still follow from the absolute measure (my 
<br />
suggestion is that the two measures mutually determine each other), but the 
<br />
probabilities would be different.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Imagine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the multiverse contained only three distinct possible observer-moments, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; B, and C. Let's represent the absolute probability of A as P(A), and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conditional probability of A's next experience being B as P(B|A). In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; case, the condition I was describing would amount to the following:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; P(A|A)*P(A) + P(A|B)*P(B) + P(A|C)*P(C) = P(A)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; P(B|A)*P(A) + P(B|B)*P(B) + P(B|C)*P(C) = P(B)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; P(C|A)*P(A) + P(C|B)*P(B) + P(C|C)*P(C) = P(C)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And of course, since these are supposed to be probabilities we should 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have the condition P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1, P(A|A) + P(B|A) + P(C|A) = 1 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; must have *some* next experience with probability 1), P(A|B) + P(B|B) +
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; P(C|B) = 1 (same goes for B), P(A|C) + P(B|C) + P(C|C) = 1 (same goes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; C). These last 3 conditions allow you to reduce the number of unknown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conditional probabilities (for example, P(A|A) can be replaced by (1 -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; P(B|A) - P(C|A)), but you're still left with only three equations and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;six
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distinct conditional probabilities which are unknown, so knowing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;values
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the absolute probabilities should not uniquely determine the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conditional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probabilities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Agreed. The reverse is true. From the above equations, interpreting the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conditional probabilities P(i|j) as a matrix, the absolute probability is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the right eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 1.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that occurred to me after I had posted this. But I don't remember 
<br />
enough linear algebra to say what conditions have to be met for a 
<br />
nonnegative matrix to have a unique eigenvector for a given eigenvalue, and 
<br />
the situation is complicated by the fact that I'm really imagining an 
<br />
infinite number of distinct possible observer-moments and thus the matrix 
<br />
would have an infinite number of components (but the sum of each row and 
<br />
each column would be finite).
<br />
<br />I also thought of a possible simplification: I said earlier that I thought 
<br />
the function for the conditional probability between A and B would involve 
<br />
both the absolute probability of B, P(B), and 'formal properties' of A and B 
<br />
that, like the vague notion of 'similarity' I have been talking about, which 
<br />
would have to be quantified by a theory of consciousness. But it seems like 
<br />
there's a good argument for saying something a bit more specific, namely 
<br />
that the function would involve the *product* of P(B) with the 'similarity' 
<br />
(or whatever you call it) between A and B. Think of a duplication experiment 
<br />
where the initial difference between the two duplicates is very small, like 
<br />
they initially have identical brainstates but then diverge as one sees he's 
<br />
in a room with green walls and the other sees he's in a room with red walls. 
<br />
Presumably any quantity based on a comparison of formal properties between 
<br />
two observer-moments, such as 'similarity', would be basically the same 
<br />
whether you compared my current observer-moment with the one in the green 
<br />
room or the one in the red room, so if the observer-moment in the green room 
<br />
had twice the absolute probability as the one in the red room (say, because 
<br />
the one in the green room was scheduled to be duplicated again later while 
<br />
the one in the red room was not), it makes intuitive sense that my 
<br />
conditional probability of becoming the one in the green room would also be 
<br />
twice as large.
<br />
<br />Obviously this isn't a watertight argument, but if it's true then we could 
<br />
say P(B|A) = P(B)*Sab, where Sab is the 'similarity' between A and B (Don't 
<br />
take the term 'similarity' too literally since this function might be quite 
<br />
different from the ordinary sense of the term...for example, ordinarily we 
<br />
think of the word similarity as something symmetrical, so the similarity of 
<br />
A to B is the same as that of B to A, but the subjective directionality of 
<br />
time and memory suggests this probably shouldn't be true for whatever 
<br />
function is used here, because I'd expect to have a much higher conditional 
<br />
probability of my next experience being that of my brain 1 second from now 
<br />
than he should have of his next experience being my current one.) So the 
<br />
equations would look like this:
<br />
<br />P(A)*Saa*P(A) + P(A)*Sab*P(B) + P(A)*Sac*P(C) = P(A)
<br />
P(B)*Sba*P(A) + P(B)*Sbb*P(B) + P(B)*Sbc*P(C) = P(B)
<br />
P(C)*Sca*P(A) + P(C)*Scb*P(B) + P(C)*Scc*P(C) = P(C)
<br />
<br />Which simplifies to:
<br />
<br />Saa*P(A) + Sab*P(B) + Sac*P(C) = 1
<br />
Sba*P(A) + Sbb*P(B) + Sbc*P(C) = 1
<br />
Sca*P(A) + Scb*P(B) + Scc*P(C) = 1
<br />
<br />Which would mean the &quot;similarity matrix&quot; operating on the 
<br />
absolute-probability vector equals the unit vector, so as long as the 
<br />
similarity matrix has an inverse, this inverse operating on the unit vector 
<br />
would give the vector of absolute probabilities. Again though, I don't know 
<br />
much about how linear algebra works for infinite matrices, or whether they'd 
<br />
have inverses.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Let P(S) denote the probability that an observer finds itself in state 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;S.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Now S has to contain everything that the observer knows, including who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;and all previous observations he remembers making. The ''conditional''
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;probability that ''this'' observer will finds himself in state S' given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;he was in state S an hour ago is simply P(S')/P(S).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This won't work--plugging into the first equation above, you'd get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (P(A)/P(A)) * P(A) + (P(B)/P(A)) * P(B) + P(P(C)/P(A)) * P(C), which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; equal to P(A).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You meant to say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;''P(A)/P(A)) * P(A) + (P(A)/P(B)) * P(B) + P(A)/P(C) * P(C), which is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  equal to P(A).''
</em><br />
<br />Actually I just got confused about whether S' or S was the current state, 
<br />
but yeah, that's what I should have written. Anyway, as I said, for 
<br />
something like this to be true in general you'd need a 1/N factor, where N 
<br />
is the total number of possible observer-moments. But from your comments 
<br />
about amnesia below I take it you're saying that S' has a unique previous 
<br />
state S, so if B's unique past state was A, then P(B|A) = P(B)/P(A) while 
<br />
P(B|C) = 0 and P(B|B) = 0, so the condition P(B|A)*P(A) + P(B|B)*P(B) + 
<br />
P(B|C)*P(C) = P(B) would be satisfied. But does this also mean that each 
<br />
observer-moment has a unique future? Consider the matrix of conditional 
<br />
probabilities:
<br />
<br />P(A|A)  P(A|B)  P(A|C)
<br />
P(B|A)  P(B|B)  P(B|C)
<br />
P(C|A)  P(C|B)  P(C|C)
<br />
<br />You're saying that only one entry in each row can be nonzero. But this means 
<br />
either that each column has exactly one entry that's nonzero (every 
<br />
observer-moment has a unique future), or that some columns have multiple 
<br />
nonzero entries while others have all zero entries--maybe these might 
<br />
correspond to &quot;terminal&quot; observer-moments where death is certain? Anyway, I 
<br />
guess this conclusion wouldn't hold for a matrix whose rows and columns 
<br />
contained an infinite number of components, where you could have something 
<br />
like this:
<br />
<br />.5 0 0 0 0 0 . . .
<br />
.5 0 0 0 0 0

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This shows that in general, the conditional probability cannot be defined

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in

<br />By &quot;amnesia&quot;, you're talking about the idea that streams of consciousness 
<br />
can merge as well as split, correct? That a given observer-moment can be 
<br />
compatible with multiple pasts? If so, then yes, I would assume something 
<br />
like that is possible, if splitting is possible.
