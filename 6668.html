</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  &quot;Behaviour systems&quot; are complicated enough that it is a mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainty that they fall in the second class.
</em><br />
That depends on how one characterizes them.  I'm describing a behavior 
<br />
system that is described as a &quot;snapshot&quot; of interactions between 
<br />
elements.  It's an abstraction, of course, but not all that far removed 
<br />
from, say, a snapshot of a neural net.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In which case there is no way to detect that the superposition is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happening; for all practical purposes each world goes its own sweet way.
</em><br />
<br />No.  Probabilities differ by a small degree across z space, but there are 
<br />
not necessarily discrete differences.  It would be &quot;infinite&quot; in the sense 
<br />
that a continuum is infinite, or that a line contains an infinite number of 
<br />
infinitesimals.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;If there are say, 10 possible &quot;worlds&quot; available to the behavioral state 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(percipient) but each world differs from the other by elements that are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;not observed by the percipient, then the behavior system is under the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;assumption that interaction is taking place with a single, unified environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Recalling the Copenhagen interpretation: does Chicago exist if you happen 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to be by yourself in a hotel room in Des Plaines, IL?  The answer is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;irrelevant until the behavior system begins to experience some aspect of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Chicago.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The superposition properties depend on the information available in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whole system (e.g. your hotel room), not just the mind of the observer.
</em><br />
That's a very basic assumption, of course---one that cannot be proven 
<br />
without measurement.  Obviously the source material (whatever that is) is 
<br />
available for the behavior system to define as discrete bits of 
<br />
information, but the hard fact is, we're assuming we know the mathematical 
<br />
characteristics of this &quot;source material&quot; when we really don't.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The world is constantly in close touch with itself.
</em><br />
<br />Yes it is.  But we have characterized this &quot;matrix of information&quot; based 
<br />
upon interesting experiments that study the mortar between the bricks (as 
<br />
it were).  Inferring much more gets us into great discussions of whether 
<br />
the universe is really a big computer and leads to films like, well, The 
<br />
Matrix.  As Abraham Kaplan (1964) said, &quot;when we don't know something, we 
<br />
don't know it.&quot;  And we really don't know much about the character of the 
<br />
information that constitutes &quot;the world&quot;.  Let's take a look at the 
<br />
assumptions about Chicago, for example:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;For instance, if Chicago vanished in a large quantum fluctuation photons 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which would otherwise have been reflected from its streets to the clouds 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be different.
</em><br />
<br />We're assuming that photons (rather than probabilities) exist independently 
<br />
of our observations and measurements of them.  While obviously something is 
<br />
&quot;out there&quot; that when measured will fit the profile of a photon, it's a 
<br />
stretch to suggest that it can exist *as we know it* independently of our 
<br />
observation.  We don't know the properties of &quot;out there&quot; very well, so 
<br />
perhaps we shouldn't assume that &quot;reflection&quot; and even &quot;distance&quot; are 
<br />
relevant.  Our observations that lead us to the concept of entanglement 
<br />
lead us to assume the entangled objects are separated by &quot;distance&quot; when 
<br />
distance is, let's face it, an abstraction.  (There was only one article 
<br />
that has ever called &quot;distance&quot; into question, and it appeared in Omni 
<br />
magazine a few months before it's demise.  I'll say it before you: Maybe 
<br />
that was the reason it finally failed---it was heading in the direction of 
<br />
Hume with no Descartes to rescue it.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Hence photons leaving (assumption: separation) the clouds that land 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (assumption: separation) in fields 40 miles away (assumption: distance) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be different and so on. Very soon (within microseconds) the photons 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coming through your hotel window are affected, and you become 100% 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlated with the state of Chicago (assumption: we know the phase state 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Chicago---that it is commensurate with collapsed probabilities 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; associated with a quantum fluctuation resulting in photons becoming 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separated with an object and impinging on another object, etc.  Lots of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collapsed probabilities here with no measurement in sight--and no proof 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that Chicago exists independent of individual measurement.  It's not just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a limitation, it's an assumption--and maybe an improper one.  Broadly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I'm not talking about Copenhagen, here) we generally assume that because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the object has been measured once, it exists thereafter.  Does it?  We 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume that if everyone measures the object it exists for those who have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not measured it.  There's no proof for that. None.  Zip.  It's just a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convenient assumption we make.  In fact, one interpretation of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beryllium &quot;watched pot&quot; experiment shows that the percipient interacting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the &quot;object&quot;--in this case, the Be atoms being exposed to RF--is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principal observer.  What of the rest of us?  What mechanism links our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world view to that of that particular principal observer?   Obviously, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is one, otherwise, nothing would get done and the scientific method 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wouldn't work very well.  But what is the nature of that mechanism?  We 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really don't know.  The only experiments to find out are usually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; performed by psychologists or physicists with an interest in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness--and we end up with vague terms like mathematics-free terms 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like &quot;qualia.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   From your point of view, Chicago is either there or not.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;From the isolated percipient's point of view, that which is unobserved may 
<br />
not necessarily *have* to exist.  Two isolated percipients (behavorial 
<br />
scientists might call them a &quot;dyad&quot;) observing Chicago from, say, the 
<br />
Hancock building may see different things, but what they see---and 
<br />
presumably what they share--are abstractions.  They can't see into the 
<br />
buildings.  However, they may be superimposed with situations in which they 
<br />
do observe, say, the deep-dish pizza in that little restaurant on Rush 
<br />
street.  The sum of these collapsed probabilities across z space---and 
<br />
their interaction with the observations of others--- may constitute 
<br />
consciousness.  Put another way, this connected fibre bundle of &quot;measured 
<br />
probabilities&quot; through z space---in conjunction with all others may 
<br />
constitute our shared reality.   Viewing behavior systems topologically, I 
<br />
believe, can help answer questions about decoherence.  In this view a 
<br />
behavior system exists across a continuum through &quot;layers&quot; of varied 
<br />
probabilistic environments.  One set of layers (one lane of the highway) 
<br />
may be chosen based upon its utility.  I suggest that the &quot;hidden observer&quot; 
<br />
phenomenon--the &quot;executive&quot; function found only under deep hypnosis may be 
<br />
a evolutionary structure that has developed over time to sample 
<br />
probabilities.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;What if Deutsch is incorrect about contact between the various worlds?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;i.e., what if quantum theory is wrong and a different theory applies?
</em><br />
<br />That's not what I'm asking---no more than Godel proved all math is a waste 
<br />
of time.  I'm suggesting that by viewing a behavior system 
<br />
topologically--we can better understand some of the results we are 
<br />
seeing--including those on the speculative side.  Sheldrake's dogs who trot 
<br />
to the front door ten minutes before their master arrives may simply be 
<br />
sampling un-collapsed probabilities on either side of the one they 
<br />
inhabit.   The remote-viewing folks may be tapping in to probabilities in 
<br />
which they visit the site or otherwise have an opportunity to view it.  Not 
<br />
the same thing as a closed time-like loop, but, last I heard those things 
<br />
haven't exactly been ruled out, either.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But the only reason we have to believe this stuff is the evidence in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;favour of QM (which is pretty overwhelming).
</em><br />
<br />QM is extraordinarily predictable, but it is not particularly good at 
<br />
explaining what is going on &quot;out there.&quot;  Quantum entanglement is a huge 
<br />
mystery.  Do we have a good explanation of delayed choice?   (As for 
<br />
&quot;sci-fi&quot; mentioned later) Cramer's transactional interpretation suggests 
<br />
communication between particles from future to past---he might be right, 
<br />
but I wonder if, as a kid he read Isaac Azimov's *End of Eternity*?  In 
<br />
that novel, they weren't called &quot;particles&quot;--they were called 
<br />
&quot;kettles.&quot;  QM is *predictable*, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't 
<br />
seriously examine the model to see how it's quirkier aspects fit with 
<br />
observations in other fields.   Psychologists and sociologists rarely take 
<br />
on QM (though some do); it's usually the physicist who tackles 
<br />
consciousness.  As a result we have consciousness books out there that 
<br />
discuss &quot;qualia&quot; and quantum processes taking place inside microtubles, but 
<br />
nothing that directly addresses measurement.  Check the indices in some of 
<br />
these books.  Hilgard is never mentioned, and neither is Jung (who happened 
<br />
to be a friend of Dirac and was himself interested in QM.)
<br />
<br />More to the point, if you happen to know why the mere act of 
<br />
measurement--even at a distance-- &quot;induces&quot; a probability collapse, I'd 
<br />
love to hear it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Suppose the behavior system normally exists across a manifold of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;closely-linked probabilities, with the similarities forming a central 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;tendency and the differences existing at each edge of the distribution?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Again, QM makes definitive (but difficult-to-understand) predictions about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this.
</em><br />
I know.  That's why I brought this up.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes there is a manifold of possibilities, in fact an infinite number of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;them, for instance &quot;configuration space&quot; which is the manifold of all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;particle positions (3N dimensional for N particles), or &quot;momentum space&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the manifold of all particle momenta (also 3N dim).
</em><br />
<br />Yes.  Manifolds are part and parcel of the canon.  We're talking about the 
<br />
same thing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   According to QM, the probability distributions in these manifolds are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not independent, e.g. config and momentum wave functions are related by a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fourier transform.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure I follow you there. A Fourier transform is a mathematical tool 
<br />
used to deconstruct a complex wave form into its component parts.  Wouldn't 
<br />
it be more accurate to say that configuration and momentum wave functions 
<br />
can be *described* using Fourier transform?  Even if the config, momentum 
<br />
etc. share equivalent wave functions, does that necessarily imply 
<br />
relationships?  I don't mean to chase any rabbits down that particular 
<br />
trail, I'm only saying we often assume more than we know.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your &quot;central tendency&quot; is just the wave function, which is peaked around 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some configuration of particles in any given branch.
</em><br />
<br />Same argument.  A wave function describes, and the central tendency (in 
<br />
say, a normal distribution) can be described as a wave function, 
<br />
certainly.  But I would argue that the wave function itself is not the 
<br />
configuration.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What people generally don't factor into this is just how *BIG* 3N 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dimensional spaces are, when N is macroscopic.  Even apparently minor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;differences, such as the presence or absence of a speck of dust, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;correspond to enormously large separations in configuration space.
</em><br />
<br />Well, yes---if everyone on the planet measured every speck of dust there 
<br />
would be an enormous amount of data involved--and somewhat less, perhaps if 
<br />
one person measured every speck of dust (had he the time and funding.)  But 
<br />
if all the dust specks exist as probabilities then we really don't know how 
<br />
much 3N space it takes up.  Of course, it may require thousands of pages of 
<br />
mathematical description to nail down properly, but that's a limitation of 
<br />
the tools, not a limitation of the thing we're describing.  Just because an 
<br />
&quot;object&quot; requires a lot of paper to describe it doesn't necessarily mean it 
<br />
takes up a commensurate amount of space.  Space implies distance--greater 
<br />
the distance, bigger the space---but then what are we to make of 
<br />
entanglement--which seems to suggest distance is irrelevant.  If distance 
<br />
is irrelevant, then maybe we're assuming something we shouldn't.  We're 
<br />
trying to describe a circle using the quadratic formula when it can just as 
<br />
easily be described in terms of radius.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Although technically there is some (usually infinitesimal) amplitude for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all configurations, the only way you can get a useful amplitude for two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;macroscopically different &quot;worlds&quot; is to amplify some quantum behaviour, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in which case the wave function splits into 2 or more branches, each of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which behaves more or less according to classical physics.
</em><br />
<br />That's when we *measure* them.  The measurement of an object is not the object.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The &quot;width&quot; of the distribution for a single branch corresponds to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ordinary microscopic quantum fuzziness.
</em><br />
<br />Again, if we assume the variable position of a dust particle--for 
<br />
example--is the criteria for a discrete branching.  There are other ways to 
<br />
describe branching that do not imply a discrete and individual 
<br />
&quot;direction.&quot;  Each point in space may involve a unit probability; the 
<br />
branching occurs when the behavior system interacts with enough of them to 
<br />
form a unique field of probabilities--resulting in a unique outcome 
<br />
commensurate with the environment.   Maybe worlds branch as a result of 
<br />
observation and interaction.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hence the branches don't overlap in configuration space (or in the space 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of any other macroscopic variable), and so can't communicate.
</em><br />
<br />By that model, no.  But again, we're talking about the limitations of 
<br />
measurement, and those limitations should not be the occasion to decide 
<br />
that &quot;communication&quot; cannot exist between worlds.  We investigate a house, 
<br />
and that house includes two different rooms.  The rooms are different and 
<br />
they are at opposite sides of the house.  Worse, the house has been in an 
<br />
earthquake and a two inch gap exists between room 1 and room 2.  We declare 
<br />
that the rooms are different, and are not even connected to each other.  To 
<br />
describe one room in terms of the other results in an unintelligible 
<br />
mess.   So, we decide there is no communication between the rooms--and 
<br />
ignore the fact that we've strolled through the entire house.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;If the behavior system can perceive only a small chunk of information at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;a time, then it may be possible that each percipient really does live in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;his or her own little world---a small island of similar probabilities 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;made&quot;real&quot; from the larger cloud of probabilities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We are all in our own little worlds, but in an objective sense; the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is true for &quot;non-behavior&quot; systems, e.g. rocks.
</em><br />
<br />In a different sense.  A rock doesn't interact in the same way a behavior 
<br />
system does, and it doesn't change very much throughout it's 
<br />
history.  There's very little evidence to suggest that rocks talk to each 
<br />
other and modify their activity as a result.  You could probably say the 
<br />
same thing for some people, but generally, we interact with one another and 
<br />
(generally) we think.  Rocks don't do that very well, either.  If our 
<br />
thinking involves sampling probabilities (lanes) on either side of our 
<br />
world line, then we have it over rocks big time.  We now have access to 
<br />
information that the typical rock (or mountain lion) may not have.  We can 
<br />
call it hunches, or our &quot;guardian angel&quot; whispering in our ear.  We can 
<br />
produce works of art that mimic what will be seen in the news months later, 
<br />
or in the case of the first nuclear test---the very next day. I'm not one 
<br />
to believe in ESP or precognition (necessarily). But this sort of thing can 
<br />
be explained as the behavior system simply being a part of and taking 
<br />
information from the &quot;lane&quot; next to the one it's on.  The effect might be 
<br />
described as having a very wide specious present.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;If we quantify a behavior system in terms of elements and interactions 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;between elements, we arrive at a complex, but definable state.  If that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;behavior system exists across multiple worlds that differ in minute 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;details (i.e. a unobserved kitchen saucer moved an inch to the side) then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the behavior systems would exist as identical entities (or, as my friend 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Giu P. would say, *shadows*) across the similar &quot;sections.&quot;   Employing a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;little math, the behavior system could exist as an object in Z space--not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;too different than a fibre bundle in topology.    Differences among the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;realized probabilities among these &quot;shadow worlds&quot; might show up at each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;end of the normal distribution, but may be still be perceived by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;behavior system as guesses or hunches, depending upon where the primary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;centre of the behavioral bundle is at the time.  Psychology experiments 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in the 1980s suggest (to me anyway) that a psychological mechanism has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;evolved that helps the behavioral system &quot;negotiate&quot; this territory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If this has anything to do with the basic laws of physics we have to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;replace QM.
</em><br />
<br />Well, of course I would never suggest we &quot;break&quot; any of Newton's laws; and 
<br />
I don't recall either Bohr or Everett ever drafting any.  QM is predictive; 
<br />
the math fits the results, so the results naturally fit the math.  No one 
<br />
knows why it works that way, but it does.   So, there is no need to replace 
<br />
anything.   I'm not suggesting anything as outlandish as a particle 
<br />
traveling forward in time, then reversing itself and traveling backward 
<br />
(that's been done), or a light photon communicating with itself in the 
<br />
past.  I'm only suggesting that we take a closer look at the measurement 
<br />
issue--and how the behavior system interacts with the world.  A model of 
<br />
the behavior system as a topological object may explain things a bit.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Personally it sounds to me like great SF and very duff science.
</em><br />
<br />Great SF requires the author of the novel to explain how the weird things 
<br />
happen.  By those standards, QM is not even great SF.   Just because we can 
<br />
predict something to a ten-digit accuracy shouldn't imply we know what is 
<br />
going on--any more than the Tribriand Islanders know why the sun comes up 
<br />
every morning. Worse, we seem to have largely given up on trying to 
<br />
understand QM--almost to the point where we're treating it like we treated 
<br />
Newtonian physics.  Things happen that way because they happen that 
<br />
way.  QM has become the new Classical Physics.
<br />
<br />Coming soon to a theatre near you:  &quot;The Laws of Quantum Physics.&quot; Break 
<br />
them at your peril.
