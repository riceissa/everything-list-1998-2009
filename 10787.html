I have the feeling that we are discussing words. Everybody tries how to
<br />
'make sense' of them, in a personal &quot;taste&quot;.
<br />
Colin expressed it in his usual sophisticated ways, Ben more
<br />
comprehensively, in many more words. The fact is: we observe the observer
<br />
(ourselves) and want to describe it to others.
<br />
The American 'slang' comes to mind: Consciousness Smonciousness - do we get
<br />
anywhere with it? whether a device 'looks at' or we see if somebody
<br />
understands what he sees?
<br />
During the early 90s I gave up thinking ABOUT consciousness, it seemed a
<br />
futile task with everybody speaking about something else. Now I see a
<br />
reasonable topic behind it: &quot;ourselves&quot; - the object with which I struggle
<br />
lately to identify (for myself about myself, which is the crux of the
<br />
problem). I see no point to explain it to others: they will not get the
<br />
'real' image (only the interpreted (their) 1st person view of me).
<br />
We all (excuse me to use 1st pers form) are well educated smart people and
<br />
can say something upon everything. It is a rarity to read:
<br />
I was wrong you are right - period. (I cannot keep my mouse shut either).
<br />
Happy debating!

<br />
<br /><br /><br />Colin, Stathis, Brent,
<br />
<br />1. I think we need to distinguish a cybernetic, self-adjusting system like a
<br />
sidewinder missile, from an inference-processing, self-_redesigning_ system
<br />
like an intelligent being (well, not redesigning itself biologically, at
<br />
least as of now).
<br />
<br />Somehow we're code-unbound to some sufficient extent that, as a result, we
<br />
can test our representations, interpretations, our systems, habits, and
<br />
&quot;codes&quot; of representation and interpretation, rather than leaving that task
<br />
entirely to biological evolution which tends to punish bad &quot;interpretations&quot;
<br />
by removal of the interpreter from the gene pool.
<br />
<br />There's something more than represented objects (sources), the
<br />
representations (encodings), and the interpretations (decodings). This
<br />
&quot;something more&quot; is the recipient, to whom falls any task of finding
<br />
redundancies and inconsistencies between the message (or message set) and
<br />
the rest of the world, such that the recipient -- I'm unsure how to put
<br />
this -- is the one, or stands as the one, who deals with the existential
<br />
consequences and for whom tests by subjection to existential consequences
<br />
are meaningful; the recipient is in a sense a figuration of existential
<br />
consequences as bearing upon the system's design. It's from a design-testing
<br />
viewpoint that one re-designs the communication system itself; the recipient
<br />
role in that sense is the role which includes the role of the
<br />
&quot;evolutionator&quot; (as CA's governor might call it). In other words, the
<br />
recipient is, in logical terms, the recognizer, the (dis-)verifier, the
<br />
(dis-)corroborator, etc., and verification (using &quot;verification&quot; as the
<br />
forest term for the various trees) is that &quot;something more&quot; than object,
<br />
representation, interpretation. Okay, so far I'm just trying to distinguish
<br />
an intelligence from a possibly quite vegetable-level information processs
<br />
with a pre-programmed menu of feedback-based responses and behavior
<br />
adjustments.
<br />
<br />2. Verificatory bases are nearest us, while the entities &amp; laws by appeal to
<br />
which we explain things, tend to be farther &amp; farther from us. I mean, that
<br />
Colin has a point.
<br />
<br />There's an explanatory order (or sequence) of being and a verificatory order
<br />
(sequence) of knowledge. Among the empirical, &quot;special&quot; sciences (physical,
<br />
material, biological, human/social), physics comes first in the order of
<br />
being, the order in which we explain things by appeal to entities, laws,
<br />
etc., &quot;out there.&quot; But the order whereby we know things is the opposite;
<br />
there human/social studies come first, and physics comes last. That is not
<br />
the usual way in which we order those sciences, but it is the usual way in
<br />
which we order a lot of maths when we put logic (deductive theory of logic)
<br />
and structures of order (and conditions for applicability of mathematical
<br />
induction) before other fields -- that's the ordering according to the bases
<br />
on which we know things. The point is, that the &quot;ultimate&quot; explanatory
<br />
object tends to be what's furthest from us; the &quot;ultimate&quot; verificatory
<br />
basis tends to be what's nearest to us (at least within a given family of
<br />
research fields -- logic and order structures are studies of reason and
<br />
reason's crackups; extremization problems in analysis seem to be at an
<br />
opposite pole). Well, in the end, &quot;nearest to us&quot; means _us_, in our
<br />
personal experiences. Now, I'm not talking in general about deductively
<br />
certain knowledge or verification, but just about those bases on which we
<br />
gain sufficient assurance to act (not to mention believe reports coming from
<br />
one area in research while not putting too much stock in reports coming from
<br />
another). We are our own ultimate points of reference. Quine talks somewhere
<br />
about dispensing with proper names and using a coordinate system spread out
<br />
over the known universe. Which universe? The one we're in. As a practical
<br />
matter, the best answer to the question &quot;which planet is Earth&quot; is &quot;the one
<br />
we're on.&quot; What's more, we do have experiences bearing upon our experiences.
<br />
We get into that sort of multi-layered reflexivity -- and I don't mean just
<br />
in an abstract intellectual way. Experiences vary in directness, firmness,
<br />
reliability, etc., among other things. In these senses and more, Colin is
<br />
right.  One unmoors oneself from personal experience only at grave risk.
<br />
<br />3. The problem is that it seems possible to distinguish verification,
<br />
verificatory experience, etc., from consciousness. We learn sometimes
<br />
unconsciously, we infer conclusively yet sometimes unconsciously, etc., we
<br />
test and verify sometimes unconsciously, non-deliberately, etc. &quot;Reasoning&quot;
<br />
is what we can call conscious inference. Testing doesn't have to be fully
<br />
conscious and deliberate any more than interpretation does. The point is, is
<br />
the system of a nature to learn from that which tests the system's
<br />
character, its design, structure, habits, etc.? Learn, revise itself, etc.,
<br />
consciously or unconsciously. Any time one enters a situation with
<br />
conjectures, expectations, understandings, memories, one is testing them and
<br />
even testing one's ways of &quot;generating&quot; them, testing oneself, aside from
<br />
one's having some overriding purpose of verification -- one may have some
<br />
very different purpose in the given situation. And it's really quite as if
<br />
we have experience unconscious as well as conscious. Maybe there's a
<br />
question of the definition of the word &quot;experience&quot; as including the idea of
<br />
consciousness, but the point is that, when we look at the things that make
<br />
for a genuinely intelligent process, we find in our own experience that
<br />
consciousness is associated with its working very intelligently in some
<br />
respects, but not associated in every case with its working. Indeed there
<br />
are persistent cases of intelligent, inferential processing going on
<br />
unconsciously. Even leaving aside the phenomenon of somewhat autistic
<br />
musical prodigies, and leaving aside the complex and not entirely conscious
<br />
dynamics of interpersonal relationships, I think most of us have heard of
<br />
Poincare's discussion of unconsciously working on a problem till, in a
<br />
moment of unexpected illumination, the solution came to him, as he stepped
<br />
onto a bus. Well, I don't really know what to make of this
<br />
distinguishability between consciousness and verificatory experience which
<br />
may be conscious or unconscious, as regards what Colin is saying, but it
<br />
does seem a real question.
<br />
<br />Best, Ben Udell
<br />
<br />(P.S. Also, there is perhaps more than one &quot;flavor&quot; of
<br />
less-than-consciousness -- there's a difference between slowly,
<br />
unconsciously working on a problem, and lightning-quick though sometimes
<br />
iffy insights which one has, one &quot;knows not how.&quot; -- and while one can
<br />
suppose that the latter are simply the outcomes of the former, I think that
<br />
the latter can interact with each other in a darting and hard-to-follow way
<br />
that's like the extreme opposite of the former. End of digressive
<br />
postscript.)

<br />
<br />This is a mind-blowingly irrelevant diversion into the usual weeds that
<br />
fails to comprehend the most basic proposition about ourselves by an
<br />
assumption which is plain wrong. You presume that the missile stares and
<br />
then attribute it to humans as equivalent. Forget the bloody missile. I am
<br />
talking about YOU. The evidence you have about YOU within YOU.
<br />
<br />Take a look at your hand. That presentation of your hand is one piece of
<br />
content in a visual field (scene). Mind is literally and only a collection
<br />
of (rather spectacular) phenomenal scenes.
<br />
<br />Something (within your brain material) generates the visual field in which
<br />
there is a hand. You could cognise the existence of a hand _without_ that
<br />
scene (this is what blindsight patients can do - very very badly, but they
<br />
can do it). But you don't. No, nature goes to a hell of a lot of trouble to
<br />
create that fantastic image.
<br />
<br />You have the scene. Take note of it. It gives you ALL your scientific
<br />
evidence. This is an intrinsically private scene and you can't be objective
<br />
without it! You would have nothing to be objective about.
<br />
<br />PROOF
<br />
Close your eyes and tell me you can be more scientific about your hand than
<br />
you could with them open. This is so obvious.
<br />
<br />To say consciousness is not observable is completely absolutely wrong. We
<br />
observe consciousness permanently. It's all we ever do! It's just not within
<br />
the phenomenal fields, it IS the phenomenal fields.
<br />
<br />Got it?
