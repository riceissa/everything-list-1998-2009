Bruno Marchal wrote a 10-point argument about determining whether or not we 
<br />
are simulated by some massive computer. Here is point 9 from that post:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;9) Now, from computer science and logic, startlingly enough perhaps,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we can isolate a measure on the 1-person comp histories, and this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;give us the laws of physics (this is too technical to be put here, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actually I have derived only the logical structure of the probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one, but I got something non trivial and very close to a quantum logic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(which can be seen as the logic of the quantum probability one, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;von Neumann has shown).
</em><br />
<br />Bruno, I agree with everything in points 1-7 of the post I'm referring to. 
<br />
I think I understand the main thrust of points 8 and 10, but they both 
<br />
depend on the truth of the quoted point 9. I find this point highly 
<br />
dubious, and I'm interested to hear more about why you believe it (or 
<br />
whether I'm actually interpreting it correctly).
<br />
<br />Is it your contention that if we start only with the idea of Platonia 
<br />
(which contains all possible computational structures and &quot;events&quot;), and we 
<br />
analyze the structure of all possible 1st-person histories weaving their 
<br />
way through this Platonia, we would see that a majority of them find 
<br />
themselves in universes like the one we currently inhabit, with stars, 
<br />
galaxies, relativity, quantum physics, etc.? I find that extremely hard to 
<br />
believe; there are an infinite number of multi-dimensional 
<br />
cellular-automata worlds that contain nothing like stars, galaxies, or the 
<br />
familiar physics we know, and I don't see any reason to believe that all 
<br />
the 1st-person histories weaving their way through these computational 
<br />
structures (which surely exist in Platonia) have less measure than those 
<br />
that weave through the structures more resembling our own universe.
<br />
<br />I find it much easier to believe - in fact, it seems almost necessarily 
<br />
true - that, when we analyze the structure of all the 1st-person histories 
<br />
weaving their way through Platonia, we see that virtually all observers 
<br />
observe indeterminacy. This in itself seems like a non-trivial finding. It 
<br />
would be even more non-trivial if one could analyze the structure of the 
<br />
indeterminacy that virtually all 1st-person observers must observe, and 
<br />
find that it is very much like &quot;quantum logic&quot;. This seems to be one of 
<br />
your claims, and it certainly seems possible (though I don't know enough 
<br />
yet to judge the issue for myself). However, it's a much further leap to 
<br />
conclude that we can go on to derive &quot;the laws of physics&quot; from the 
<br />
analysis of 1st-person histories weaving their way through Platonia. In the 
<br />
quote above, you acknowledge that you haven't actually done this - 
<br />
&quot;actually I have derived only the logical structure of the probability one, 
<br />
but I got something non trivial and very close to a quantum logic&quot; - but 
<br />
you seem to believe that it can be done. Why?
<br />
