<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but generally I don't have any &quot;sense of identity&quot; to be affected.  That's

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the problem I see with OMs.  They are usually conceived as what people not

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on this list call &quot;thoughts&quot;, the sort of thing expressible in simple

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sentence.  They don't come with a subordinate clause, &quot;and this thought is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by Brent Meeker.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />It's true that we are not always conscious of a sense of identity, but that
<br />
just means we don't have to worry about this when considering most OMs. An
<br />
analogy would be representing visual information in a simulation. There is
<br />
no need to simulate what is going on behind a person's back as long as any
<br />
shadows or reflections affecting his visual field are taken care of. Of
<br />
course, the simulation must instantly create the new visual information when
<br />
the person turns his head, and similarly it must provide information
<br />
pertaining to memory and personal identity if he should decide to focus on
<br />
this.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Suppose some unconscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; factor X were partly responsible for placing my last second of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness in sequence. That means that if X had been different, my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conscious experience would have been different. I can't claim that X
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; plays a role while maintaining that I would not have noticed anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; different without X.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Depends on what you mean by &quot;notice&quot;.  The brain implements a physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes, of which you are not conscious.  It causes your next thought to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pop into consciousness.  If the brain's process had been a little different,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say it was perturbed by a cosmic ray particle, your next conscious thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have been different.  You would have a different thought - but you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wouldn't *notice* it was different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Could something, a shower of cosmic ray particles, cause you to suddenly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have the thought, &quot;I am Brent Meeker.&quot; and if it did, would your &quot;sense of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuity of identity&quot; have been affected?  If the &quot;I&quot; referred to Sthathis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Papaioannou that would be a discontinuity of identity.  But if &quot;I&quot; referred
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to me, it would just be an instance of your brain having one of my thoughts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and would not affect your identity.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If I started experiencing your thoughts, then I would be you. It would be
<br />
like a duplication experiment in which you can expect an equal probability
<br />
of finding yourself in your original position or in my position. While this
<br />
was happening, I (Stathis) would be unconscious. After it was over, if I
<br />
were left with no memory of the event, I might notice a discontinuity in the
<br />
external world, things apparently having moved substantial distances
<br />
instantaneously etc., but it wouldn't affect my sense of identity.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;You could use that as a definition of unconscious:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if it were removed, you would not notice any change.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Of course you can deny that there is any chain and think of it more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     like network of paths with marked stepping stones.  Once in awhile
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     there's a stone that's marked, &quot;Remember you're Brent Meeker.&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     every path that includes one of these is &quot;me&quot;, even if the path also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     includes some marked &quot;Remember you're Stathis Papaioannou.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How could you tell the difference, from the inside, between such a path
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and a chain?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You couldn't, but neither is there any reason for them to form a sequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of any kind. In the metaphor the stones are arranged on the ground and have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adjacency relations.  But in the OM picture each one exists in isolation and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are no adjacency relations.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Computationalism implies that a stream of consciousness survives
<br />
fragmentation of the process generating the stream. If it did not, then
<br />
there would be some change in experience as a result of fragmentation. For
<br />
example, if an experience supervenes on past computational states as well as
<br />
on the present instantaneous state, then arbitrarily slicing up the
<br />
computation will change and perhaps completely disrupt the stream of
<br />
consciousness. Consider a time interval t1t2t3 in which a simulated subject
<br />
perceives a light stimulus (t1, t2, t3 are according to the clock within the
<br />
simulation). The light is shone into his eyes at t1, and he presses a button
<br />
at t3 to indicate that he has seen it. Now, suppose that the computation is
<br />
cut at t2, so that the interval t1t2 is run several real time days before
<br />
t2t3, or several days after, or not at all. Then since the experience during
<br />
t2t3 is dependent not only on the computational activity going on in that
<br />
interval, but also on what has gone on before, perhaps by excising t1t2 from
<br />
its normal position in relation to t2t3 the subject will not perceive the
<br />
stimulus, or not perceive it in time to press the button at t3. But that
<br />
would mean the same computation (and same physical activity in a computer)
<br />
in t2t3 would in one case result in the subject pressing the button and in
<br />
the other case not; moreover, this could be a third person observable effect
<br />
on the screen. Hence, the only reasonable way to look at it is to say that
<br />
consciousness supervenes on the instantaneous computational state (or more
<br />
simply, consciousness *is* the computational state), which makes it
<br />
impossible to know from the inside whether your computation has been
<br />
fragmented.
