<br />The induction-friendly universe with so much detectable rubbish that a wide variety of phenomena cannot be unified into a simple theory sounds like a universe where induction works but surmise, or inference to the simplest explanation, faces grave difficulties and too often fails. In other words, in difficult cases, efforts toward surmise -- i.e., &quot;rambling speculations about half-formed ideas that probably won't pan out to anything&quot; -- really will lead too often too far astray to be practicable, and cogent everyday surmises would be few and far between -- not everyday or quotidian at all. A greatly increased difficulty in the formation of explanatory hypotheses would, it seems, hamper not only science but SASs in general. Would intelligence and commonsense perception tend, on balance, to be useful in such a world? It sounds like a world which would allow vegetable-like systems (i.e., essentially mindless in the usual sense) but be severely punitive toward SASs inclined to t!
<br />
&nbsp;ry to be shrewd or clever and to try, for instance, to infer particular entities or events or universal laws (as opposed to prolonged tendencies) as explanatory reasons, or to try to play architect instead of subsisting on the continuation of tendencies. It also sounds like the evolution or &quot;natural architecting&quot; of even merely vegetable-like systems would likely be under pressure to play it a lot safer than it does in our world, so that the systems thus evolved would tend to be not only vegetable-like but also a lot more &quot;generic&quot; than those which we see. I guess I'm trying to argue (unconfidently) or suggest, for what it's worth, that induction-friendly but much-detectable rubbish universes with SASs are induction-friendly but surmise-unfriendly universes with SASs, and that their measure would be rather small.

<br />It's the second point where I think you conflate two problems.
<br />
<br />My distinction is a little different from Lewis' anyway. From my pov, it's a matter of degree, but one which makes a qualitative difference:
<br />
<br />* Failure of induction: the past fails to predict the future. This occurs in universes a la Hume where physical laws only appear to have been followed by some massive fluke. Also in universes which always had no, or very little, regularity. I claim that as soon as regularity breaks down to this extent, SAS cease to exist, so no matter how common these cases are, we never observe them. No problem. (Lewis' defence is different).
<br />
<br />* White Rabbit: cognizable universes require a high degree of regularity for the survival of SAS (not to mention evolution), as above. Hence induction in any cognizable universe will work most of the time (which is all it does anyway), for a sufficient set of properties of the world. The key point is that this is not *every* property, and not all of the time. Hence there should be universes in which SAS can survive pretty well, but contain a wide variety of phenomena which cannot be unified into a simple theory.

<br />
<br />Of course on objective state-reduction models of QM, our universe does have &quot;snow&quot; in the form of random quantum jumps. But this is a very regular form of snow, which does &quot;unify&quot; into the basic physical laws. The argument is that for some plausible measures (not yours, obviously), even macro-scale snow is much more likely than not.
