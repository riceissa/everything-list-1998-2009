<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Again, I'll just ask a simple question to try to understand this, bit by

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What about the &quot;OMs&quot; in the past?  I don't think we even have to appeal to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolution to explain why we think planning/working for the future is worth

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it.  If it were not for the sacrificial planning and working of the OMs of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the past, we would not be where we are today.  It's simply a matter of what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has worked in the past should work in the present and future.  Or have you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;abandoned so much of the scientific method, and even simply explanation and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;prediction, that this is no longer logical to you?  What happened to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;impression of continuous consciousness?  A nuclear bomb going off every 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;second and continuous consciousness don't seem to go together, in my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;impression.
</em><br />
<br />If you wander into the middle of one of our discussions, it might seem that 
<br />
we've all forsaken common sense. As a general rule, bizarre-sounding 
<br />
physical scenarios are proposed as &quot;thought experiments&quot;, to explain, 
<br />
explore or clarify a theory by applying it to a concrete example.
<br />
<br />What the post you have quoted deals with is basically the philosophical 
<br />
problem of personal identity. On the face of it, it may not seem that there 
<br />
is much of a problem, because in the situations we are all familiar with 
<br />
continuity of consciousness and continuity of identity are both firmly 
<br />
attached to a particular organism, from its birth to its death. However, it 
<br />
isn't difficult to come up with a number of situations, some actual and some 
<br />
just theoretical possibilities, which may lead you to question this common 
<br />
sense notion. For a start, a person literally is not the same physical 
<br />
person throughout his life. The matter comprising his body is constantly 
<br />
being turned over by the cellular machinery, rather like a building project 
<br />
where the wreckers are continually smashing things and removing debris while 
<br />
the builders are continually bringing in new material to repair the damage. 
<br />
What this means is that almost all the matter that was in your body in 2001 
<br />
(say) has been broken down to small molecules, excreted, and distributed 
<br />
evenly around the planet. In its place, new matter has been used to 
<br />
construct a person who looks very similar to and has most of the memories of 
<br />
your 2001 self. In other words, although it has happened gradually, the 
<br />
person you were 4 years ago has utterly disintegrated - which is where my 
<br />
sitting on a nuclear bomb analogy came from - and has been replaced by a 
<br />
copy. And you never even noticed what was happening!
<br />
<br />OK, that's a start. I'm sure you can think of all sorts of problems and 
<br />
paradoxes the above news leads to (if it is news to you; sorry for my 
<br />
presumption if it isn't). I'll have a go at answering some of your specific 
<br />
questions if I have time in the next few days.
