<br />Russell, If you believe that a particular thought is poorly expressed
<br />
or sloppy, I would appreciate any help you might offer in making it
<br />
more precise, rather than 'bashing' it.  Sometimes conversations on
<br />
the list feel more like talking past one another, and this in general
<br />
isn't 'a useful exercise'.  My comment to Brent was motivated by a
<br />
perception that you'd been countering my 1-personal terminology with 3-
<br />
person formalisms.  Consequently, as such, they didn't strike me as
<br />
equivalent, or as genuine 'counterexamples': this surprised me, in
<br />
view of some of the other ideas you've expressed.  So I may well have
<br />
been too swift to assign certain motives to you, not having detected
<br />
any pedagogically-motivated intent to caricature, and I would welcome
<br />
your more specific clarification and correction.
<br />
<br />I should say at this point that I too find the 'terminology' task very
<br />
trying, as virtual any existing vocabulary comes freighted with pre-
<br />
existing implications of the sort you have been exploiting in your
<br />
ripostes, but which I didn't intend.  I would welcome any superior
<br />
alternatives you might suggest.  Trying or not, I'm not quite ready to
<br />
give up the attempt to clarify these ideas.  If you think the exercise
<br />
misconceived or poorly executed, it's of course up to you to choose to
<br />
'bash', satirise, or ignore it, but I would particularly welcome open-
<br />
ended questions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brent is also doing exactly this, sometimes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; satirically.
</em><br />
<br />Again, I don't mean to seem humourless, but my basic intention is a
<br />
genuine exchange of ideas, rather than satire or caricature.  So I do
<br />
try to empathise as best I can with the issues on the other side of
<br />
the debate, before deciding if, and how, I disagree.  How successful I
<br />
may be is another matter.
<br />
<br />I'd be more than willing, as ever, to have another go!
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />David
