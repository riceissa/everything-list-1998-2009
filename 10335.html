<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If grandmother asks for recalling the main difference between Plato and
</em><br />
Aristotle's theories of matter, I would just say that in Plato, the
<br />
visible (observable, measurable) realm is taken as appearances or
<br />
shadows related to a deeper unknown reality.
<br />
<br />BTW Plato followed Heraclitus, who was already onto this.
<br />
<br />Surely Plato's view more astute model to assemble an understanding of the
<br />
natural world than the assumption of Aristotlian/atomism thinking... that
<br />
the universe is made of chunky bits of stuff that literally are the
<br />
appearances we get and our descriptions of it....furthemore
<br />
<br />The arisotlian view is clearly anatomically untenable anyway! If the
<br />
universe was literally made of appearances then when we opened up a brain
<br />
we would see them. We do not. What we see is the brain in the act of
<br />
delivering appearances. No 'appearance' of a brain is in any direct
<br />
relation to the appearances it delivers to us in the 1st person. Ergo the
<br />
structure and the appearances are not the same thing or at least are
<br />
validly explored on that basis.
<br />
<br />This is empirical proof that at least in this small piece of thought
<br />
Plato's position was correct and Aristotle is just plain wrong. And Kant
<br />
too. The noumenon is most definitely real and scientifically
<br />
tractible.(see below)
<br />
<br />The practical upshot of this is that the universe does not,  for example,
<br />
have atoms in it. It is made of some underlying structure behaving
<br />
&quot;atomly&quot; within our appearances. It is only us that insist on making it a
<br />
'thing'. That structure also behaves 'neutrino-ly' outside the scope of
<br />
our direct perceptions (qualia). The appearances (qualia) are likewise
<br />
delivered as behaviour of the very same structure. Plato's position
<br />
unifies matter and qualia as different behaviours of the same underlying
<br />
structure. So simple and obvious and practical and fits the evidence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A question from grandma:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since this deeper, unknown reality must forever be inaccessible to our
</em><br />
direct probing, I agree when you suggest that this may better be thought
<br />
of as theology, or at least metaphysics.
<br />
<br />Juicy stuff here:
<br />
<br />&quot;Since this deeper, unknown reality must forever be inaccessible to our
<br />
direct probing&quot;
<br />
<br />The words 'direct probing' assume that indeed we are at some point
<br />
&quot;directly probing&quot;. If you can justify any account that we directly probe
<br />
(whatever that means!) anything I'd like to see it! I would hold that the
<br />
'apprearances' we have and the 'underlying structure' are on an _equal_
<br />
epistemological footing in that
<br />
<br />a) Depictions of regularity in appearances
<br />
b) Depictions of structure of a putative underlying natural world
<br />
<br />both have equal access to qualia as evidence. It is the underlying
<br />
structure that delivers qualia into the brain. The two descriptive realms:
<br />
appearances and structure are on an equal footing and qualia unifies them
<br />
into a consistent set. The 'evidence', qualia, is evidence for BOTH
<br />
domains. Whatever the structure is, it must simultaneously a) deliver
<br />
qualia and all the rest of the structure in the universe and b) deliver
<br />
the contents of qualia (appearances) that result in our correlations of
<br />
appearances that we think of as empirical laws.
<br />
<br />Therefore we have not one but 2 scientifically accessible realms of
<br />
scientific description of the natural world:
<br />
<br />1) Statistics that are correlation of appearances
<br />
2) Statistics that are depictions of structure
<br />
<br />Qualia are produced by 1) and enable 2) and tie both descriptions
<br />
intimately together as a consistent set. Currently we call 1) science and
<br />
slag off at 2) as 'mere metaphysics' or theology. This is just soooo
<br />
wrong! Indeed at least in a linguistic sense 2) is physics and 1) is
<br />
meta-physics (about it)! :-)
<br />
<br />So...
<br />
<br />&quot;Since this deeper, unknown reality must forever be inaccessible to our
<br />
direct probing&quot;
<br />
<br />...is quite correct, but that does not stop us doing valid science on the
<br />
structure! Put another way this limitation in access does not justify
<br />
calling attempts to formulate theories of the structure as non-science.
<br />
<br />Can you see how riddled with historical baggage our thinking is, how
<br />
biased our language is? This crazy situation has been going on for 2500
<br />
years. enough already!
<br />
