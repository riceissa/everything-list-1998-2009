<br />Please, spare me the physico-mathematical imperialism!  You say
<br />
&quot;interaction is in terms of fields'&quot;.  I think what you might claim
<br />
more modestly is something like &quot;there is a mathematical formalism in
<br />
which interaction is modelled in terms of 'fields'&quot;.  Fair enough. But
<br />
implicitly the formalism is a projection from (and reference to) a
<br />
*participatory* actuality which isn't simply 'mathematical' (pace
<br />
Bruno - and anyway, not in the sense he deploys it for the purposes of
<br />
COMP).  And I'm not of course imputing 'sensing' to the formalism, but
<br />
to the 'de-formalised participants' from which it is projected.
<br />
<br />'Participatory' here means that you must situate yourself at the point
<br />
of reference of your formalism, and intuit that 'thou-art-that' from
<br />
which the projection originates.  If you do this, does the term
<br />
'sensing' still seem so 'soft'?  The formalisms are projections from
<br />
the participatory semantics of a 'modulated continuum' that embraces
<br />
you, me and everything we know.  When you situate yourself here, do
<br />
you really not 'get' the intuitive self-relation between continuum and
<br />
modulation? Even when you know that Russell's 1-person world - an
<br />
'emergent' from this - indeed self-relates in both sense and action?
<br />
If not, then as Colin is arguing, you'd have to erect a sign with
<br />
'then magic happens' between 'emergent' and 'reductive' accounts.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sensing to me implies some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form of agency at one end of the interaction. I don't attribute any sort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of agency to the interaction between two hydrogen atoms making up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a hydrogen molecule for instance.
</em><br />
<br />Same illustration. 'Hydrogen atoms' are again just projective
<br />
formalisms to which of course nobody would impute 'agency'.  But
<br />
situate yourself where I suggest, and intuit the actions of any 'de-
<br />
formalised participants' referenced by the term 'hydrogen atoms' that
<br />
are implicated in Russell's 1-person world.  From this perspective,
<br />
any 'agency' that Russell displays is indeed inherent in such lower-
<br />
level 'entities' in 'reduced' form.  This is a perfectly standard
<br />
aspect of any 'reductive-emergent' scheme.  For some reason you seem
<br />
prepared to grant it in a 3-person account, but not in a participatory
<br />
one.
<br />
<br />The customary 'liquidity' and 'life' counter-arguments are simply
<br />
misconceived here, because these attributions emerge from, and hence
<br />
are applicable to, formal descriptions, independent of their 'de-
<br />
formalised' participatory referents.  But you can't apply the
<br />
semantics of 'sensing' and 'agency' in the same way, because these are
<br />
ineluctably participatory, and are coherent only when intuited as such
<br />
'all the way down' (e.g. as attributes of 1-person worlds and the
<br />
participatory 'sense-action' hierarchies on which they supervene).

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; David, I was unable to perceive a question in what you just wrote. I

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Really?  I'm surprised, but words can indeed be very slippery in this

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intuition that a 'primitive' (or 'reduced') notion of 'sensing' (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; please substitute anything that carries the thrust of 'able to

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; locate', 'knows it's there', etc.) is already inescapably present in

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the notion of 'interaction' between fundamental 'entities' in any

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; feasible model of reality.  Else, how could we claim that they retain
