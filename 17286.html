<br />Are you saying that you find my argument to be incoherent?  Or that
<br />
you get the gist of what I'm saying, but that my presentation left a
<br />
lot to be desired?
<br />
<br />In the latter case:  Point taken.  I will try to be more careful in my
<br />
use of those terms.
<br />
<br />In the former case:  Well.  Hmm.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that one can always ask &quot;Why?&quot; as children sometimes do; and the ultimate answer

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is, &quot;Because I say so.&quot; So you may well say, &quot;Things are just what they are.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />So, a nice rhetorical flourish in comparing me to a child, but at a
<br />
substantive level there's a significant difference between &quot;Because I
<br />
say so&quot; and &quot;things just are what they are&quot;, right?
<br />
<br />&quot;Things just are what they are&quot; means that no further explanation is
<br />
possible, even in principle.  And at some point that actually becomes
<br />
the case.  Wouldn't you say?  It can be said and meant literally.
<br />
<br />&quot;Because I say so.&quot;  Well, I'm not sure what this means.  Obviously
<br />
it's not meant to be taken literally.  Right?  Or do you suffer from a
<br />
god-complex of some sort?  If so, my condolences for your affliction.
<br />
(see?  I can be condescending too!)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; that doesn't mean that we cannot have and explanation of QM and gravity and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, and after than an explanation of the explanation ad infinitum.
</em><br />
<br />Well, with respect to QM and gravity, I think this is in keeping with
<br />
my previous point about putting conscious experience at the base of
<br />
the ontological/epistemological stack, rather than at the top.
<br />
<br />So yes, I agree with you are saying here.  It seems reasonable that
<br />
the explanatory process could go on ad infinitum, where by
<br />
&quot;explanatory process&quot; I mean the process of generating narratives that
<br />
are consistent with what we observe.  And this process doesn't depend
<br />
on what really exists.  It only depends on what we observe.  If we are
<br />
in a physical world, a computer simulation, or Platonia, the process
<br />
is the same.
<br />
<br />The process is one of generating narratives that are meaningful in the
<br />
context of your subjective consciously experienced observations.  The
<br />
process is a subjective process.  The meaning that you get from the
<br />
process is subjective meaning...it means something TO YOU.  It means
<br />
nothing in an absolute sense.  If it meant something in an objective,
<br />
absolute sense then the process wouldn't produce the same results in a
<br />
physical world, a computer simulation, and in Platonia.
<br />
<br />As for consciousness, the above applies, but let me also take this
<br />
opportunity to deploy this great argument that I heard somewhere:  An
<br />
explanation must be of something less known in terms of something
<br />
better known.  Since nothing can be better known than our own
<br />
subjective experience, it cannot be explained.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I guess I'm unclear on your point. Are you advising that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we give up all explanation and just chant &quot;It is what it is.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />So originally I came to this list to clarify my thinking on what
<br />
causes conscious experience.  BUT, as a result of the discussions here
<br />
and elsewhere, I have concluded that if consciousness is caused, then
<br />
it just is what it is.  Which, incidentally is also true of
<br />
consciousness if it is uncaused.
<br />
<br />This point is most clear if you think of the physical universe in
<br />
static &quot;block time&quot; terms (regardless of whether it is actually static
<br />
in this way).  The block in it's entirety just exists, with whatever
<br />
properties it came into being with.  If it is all that exists, then
<br />
you can't go outside of it for further explanation.  Nothing more can
<br />
be said.  Maybe it has a regular, predictable structure that extends
<br />
all the way through.  Maybe it is riddled with random uncaused
<br />
transitions (QM anyone?).  But either way, there's no explanation for
<br />
these things.  Only description.
<br />
<br />And if this physical universe is the cause of our conscious
<br />
experiences, then they also just exist.
<br />
<br />So as for the chanting, well no.  The scientific narrative process
<br />
that we engage in (described above), caused or uncaused, will continue
<br />
or it won't...we have no choice in that, or in anything else.  But
<br />
under all imaginable circumstances I think it is clear that it is a
<br />
subjective process with subjective meaning.  It provides no access to
<br />
the absolute view of what actually exists...the pursuit of such access
<br />
is futile.  The veil of conscious experience (if it is a veil covering
<br />
something more basic, and isn't itself fundamental as I believe),
<br />
can't be pierced, even theoretically.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I know it's circular. Thats the point.  But I think it can be a virtuous rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a vicious circle, and the wider the circle the more virtuous.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think my views as outlined above are necessarily in direct
<br />
conflict with this.  It just depends on how things are interpreted.
