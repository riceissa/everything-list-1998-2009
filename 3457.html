<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;No, it's very helpful. I'll have more feedback after digesting the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information and reading the books on metamathematics.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. Note that UDA needs only some passive knowledge of Church thesis.
<br />
This is need to understand that the Universal Dovetailer is *really*
<br />
universal. More elaborate Metamathematics is need for the Arithmetical
<br />
translation of the Universal Dovetailer Argument: AUDA.
<br />
My thesis is really just UDA + AUDA. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;A couple of suggestions in the meantime. In your future papers you may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;want to define some of the terms that you use. For example what you mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by &quot;computationalism&quot; seems to be a very specific kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computationalism, as the term is commonly used. This page
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(<a href="http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/local/books/computers-and-thought/gloss/node1">http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/local/books/computers-and-thought/gloss/node1</a>.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;html)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;defines computationalism only as:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The notion that the operation of the mind can be explained entirely in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; terms of the formal, or functional, properties of a computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; system.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thank you for the suggestion. In CC&amp;Q comp is defined in a footnote: 
<br />
bad idea I understand. Different form of comp are of course related. 
<br />
We can discuss it later. Perhaps I should use another acronym, 
<br />
like &quot;icomp&quot;?    (for &quot;I&quot;-comp, or Indexical-Comp)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You should also get a local colleague to review your papers before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;publishing them.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The version which has been published has been so reviewed. I realise
<br />
the one in my web page has not. Oops. (Thanks for making me
<br />
realise that).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The best book is Boolos 1993 &quot;The logic of provability&quot; (ref in my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thesis, or look at &quot;Boolos&quot; in the archive). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A good intro is Boolos and Jeffrey.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A textbook is Smorynski &quot;Self-reference and Modal logic&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A popular introduction is Smullyan's &quot;Forever Undecided&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What about _Introduction to Metamathematics_, by Stephen Cole Kleene. Is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that any good?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Oh! It is my favorite &quot;pre-lobian&quot; one. It precedes the 1955 discovery by 
<br />
Lob of the truth of the propositions which assert their own provability.
<br />
And of course it preceeds the work by Solovay (1976). Solovay has shown
<br />
that metamathematics can be formalised in Modal Logic, notably by the
<br />
modal system G and G*. G captures (soundly and completely) the abstract
<br />
pattern of what a sound self-referential machine can prove, and 
<br />
G* captures, crazily enough, all the true, even if not provable by the
<br />
machine, self-referential propositions (at some propositional level).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2) Church Thesis:  Anything computable is Turing computable. I give
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the conceptual reason for this at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3344.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3344.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You refence a &quot;G*&quot; in this post. What does that mean? May I suggest that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you put a list of such terms and definitions on your web site for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reference? You probably defined it in an earlier post, but again it's hard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to read 500 posts. Perhaps you could also give a list of essential posts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that explain your ideas as concisely and clearly as possible and the order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that is best to read them in, and put that on your web site as well.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have still some technical problems for modifying easily my iridia
<br />
web page, but I will take your suggestion into account. In the 
<br />
meantime, for G and G* you can look at
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1417.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1417.html</a>
<br />
and its errata:  <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2840.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2840.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Also, when you say that QM should be the shortest algorithm, I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; afraid you share with Schmidhuber a proposition on the mind body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relationship which I show to be inconsistent with comp. You seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to believe that the mind brain relation is one-one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;No I don't believe that. What I meant was that QM plus a translation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;algorithm (into some abstract description of observer-moments) is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shortest algorithm. I think that multiple distinct brains can translate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the same abstract description.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Nice. That will help for the sequel.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;On the other hand, from a decision theory perspective, this question may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be irrelevent or just a subjective value judgement. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think it will be relevant, not only with respect to some
<br />
computationalist practice (accepting a digital prosthesis made at
<br />
this or that level), but also because the reasoning I propose
<br />
should lead to our aknowledgement of a bigger form of ignorance, and
<br />
this could encourage us to be more cautious with judgments
<br />
and decisions in general. Shakespeare said that &quot;Conscience make us 
<br />
Coward&quot; (Hamlet), I believe comp justifies this in some way. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The reason I'm so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interested in a decision theoretic approach is that it may help us figure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;out which are the essential questions, and which may just be empty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophy.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree with you.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the answer to a question is irrelevent to choosing actions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does the question mean anything? If the answer only affects the utility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;function, does that mean it has no objective answer and there is no point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in arguing over it?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The answer to a question, or the absence of such an answer, can
<br />
be relevant in choosing actions for general reasons. I think that an
<br />
overview of &quot;reality&quot; can help in the shaping of beliefs and
<br />
decisions in some indirect and negative way. Because now we
<br />
can bet, with comp, that if our knowledge grows our ignorance grows
<br />
more. We become more fallible, we get more doubts, and at the same
<br />
time that necessary ignorance space got some invariant 
<br />
geometry related with that reality. Comp owes to Descartes who
<br />
sees the powerfullness of systematic doubting for raising solid
<br />
fixed point. Metamathematics can make this precise.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;P.S. Happy Thanksgiving everythingers. Right now I'm very thankful that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;live in a world that affords me the opportunity to think and talk about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these issues.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is a big pleasure sharing our interest. Deep thanks for giving us 
<br />
that opportunity, Wei. Happy Thanksgiving Everyone.
<br />
<br /><br />B.
