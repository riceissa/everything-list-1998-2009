<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Personally, I would prefer to assign a deeper significance to the notion

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;human rather than one of the vastly more numerous but less intelligent

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other animals seems like an observation that cries out for some kind of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explanation.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I am not sure about that. Suppose a teacher has 10^1000 students. Today
<br />
he says to the students that he will, tomorrow, interrogate one student of the
<br />
class and he will chooses it randomly. Each student thinks that there is only
<br />
1/(10^1000) chance that he will be interrogated. That's quite negligible, and
<br />
(assuming that all student are lazy) none of the students prepare the 
<br />
interrogation.
<br />
But then the day after the teacher says: &quot;Smith, come on to the board, I will
<br />
interrogate you&quot;.
<br />
I hope you agree there has been no miracle here, even if for the student, being
<br />
the one interrogated is a sort of (1-person) miracle. No doubt that this 
<br />
student
<br />
could cry out for an explanation, but we know there is no explanations...
<br />
Suppose the teacher and the student are immortal and the teacher interrogates
<br />
one student each day. Eternity is very long, and there will be arbitrarily 
<br />
large
<br />
period where poor student Smith will be interrogated each days of that period.
<br />
Obviously Smith will believe that the teacher has something special against 
<br />
him/her.
<br />
But still we know it is not the case ...
<br />
So I don't think apparent low probability forces us to search for an 
<br />
explanation
<br />
especially in an everything context, only the relative probability of 
<br />
continuation
<br />
could make sense, or &quot;ab initio&quot; absolute probabilities could perhaps be 
<br />
given for the
<br />
entire histories.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I think this is more of a philosophical difference, so that even if an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ultimate TOE was discovered that gave unique absolute and conditional 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probabilities to each observer-moment, people could still differ on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpretation of those &quot;absolute probabilities&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I am not yet sure I can make sense of them.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I think also that your view on RSSA is not only compatible with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the sort of approach I have developed, but is coherent with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;Saibal Mitra&quot; backtracking, which, at first I have taken
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;as wishful thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What is the &quot;backtracking&quot; idea you're referring to here?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />That if you put the probabilities on the infinite stories, any finite
<br />
story will be of measure null, so that if an accident happens to you,
<br />
and make you dead (in some absolute sense), you will never live that accident,
<br />
nor the events leading to that accident: from a 3-person pov it is like
<br />
there has been some backtracking, but it's seems linear from a 1-pov.
<br />
(pov = point of view)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;OK you make me feel COMP could be a little less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;frightening I'm use to think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, if I've spared you some sleepless nights I'm glad! ;)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Concerning consciousness theory and its use to isolate a similarity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;relation on the computational histories---as seen from some first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;point of view, I will try to answer asap in a common answer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Stephen and Stathis (and you) who asked very related questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Alas I have not really the time now---I would also like to find a way to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the consciousness theory without relying too much on mathematical logic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;but the similarity between 1-histories *has* been derived  technically in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of the theory which is the most counter-intuitive ... mmh  I will try 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;soon ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, I definitely hope to understand the details of your theory someday, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think I will need to learn some more math to really follow it well though. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My current self-study project is to try to learn the basic mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;details of quantum computation and the many-worlds interpretation,
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />It seems a good plan.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;but after that maybe I'll try to study up a bit on mathematical logic and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;recursive function theory. And even if I do, there's the little problem of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my not knowing French, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it...
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Nice, you will be able to read the long version of my thesis ...  It's 
<br />
almost self-contained.
<br />
In logic it is only the beginning which is hard, really. Nevertheless I 
<br />
will try to explain the
<br />
consciousness theory and the minimal amount of logic needed. The fact is 
<br />
that it is easy
<br />
to be wrong with self-applied probability, and using logic, it is possible 
<br />
to derive the logic
<br />
of [probability one] quasi-directly from the (counter-intuitive) godelian 
<br />
logic of self-reference.
<br />
There are already evidence that we get sort of quantum logic for those 
<br />
probability one.
<br />
I'm really searching how to justify the wavy aspect of nature.
