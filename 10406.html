<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, it makes a lot of sense, and reminds me of long hours over the

decades struggling to visualise how various 'observer perspectives' would

map in detail to my 1st-person experience (a career in software
<br />
engineering also presents many opportunities for meditative waiting!)
<br />
'Saving the appearances' was my point of departure, because it seemed to
<br />
be mostly ignored in standard theoretical treatments, apparently in
<br />
pursuit of some mirage of methodological 'rigour' - myopia, it seemed to
<br />
me. Also, all those 'quantum collapse' notions involving 'the observer'
<br />
seemed to be blind to the fact that this seemingly
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; influential chap was simply a non-isolatable element of the network of
</em><br />
interacting information under 'observation'.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My question about observing from the perspective of the 'gestalt' (maybe
</em><br />
this isn't the best word) was posed in this spirit. That is, each one of
<br />
my list of 'observables' makes sense to me from this perspective, but not
<br />
from that of a classical 'nameable' 1st person. QM/MW is just one way to
<br />
conceptualise the structural/ behavioural aspects of this, but my starting
<br />
point is: given these experiences, 'from what experiential perspective
<br />
would the situation look, feel, sound, taste, smell, like this?' And the
<br />
answer always seems to be 'from the point of view of the universe,
<br />
delimited by these information horizons.' This for me is the fundamental
<br />
1st-person perspective.

<br />How about this:
<br />
<br />When you have a hierarchical structure of a single posited primitive there
<br />
is a fundamental property that is inherent in the structure as a whole.
<br />
<br />This is as follows:
<br />
<br />Perspectival Ubiquity
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the perspective of any one instance of S(.) within the structure, no
</em><br />
matter how huge and complex it is, there is a 'perspective' view of any
<br />
other point in the structure. That 'view' is the view that is 'as-if' you
<br />
walked all the way down to the bottom of the hierarchy to a common
<br />
ancestor (parent) S(.) element and then walked all the way up the
<br />
structure to the S(.) that you are viewing from wherever you were. This is
<br />
a direct causal chain. Connected/organised S(.) literally are
<br />
causality/causal chains.
<br />
<br />This property is inherent or intrinsic or innate to any structure of S(.),
<br />
regardless of the details of S(.). I posit that this 'visibility', or at
<br />
least the potential for it, is fundamental to the generation of qualia. 
<br />
=======================
<br />
Additivity
<br />
If one S(.) has some sort of proto-experience, then cohorts of S(.) acting
<br />
coherently will combine their proto-experiences in the manner of the
<br />
collective behaviour of the cohort.
<br />
<br />Having arrived at this point we have said nothing about the nature of
<br />
&quot;what it is like&quot; i.e. that the visibility thus conferred has any
<br />
particular quality to it..light, sound, taste and so on. You can imagine
<br />
this is being cohorts of S(.) behaving in different ways for different
<br />
subjective qualities.
<br />
=========================
<br />
Here we have at least the basics of the production of a quale. There are a
<br />
raft of other issues before you can locate these things in brain material.
<br />
But at least the hierarchical structures have these innate possibilities.
<br />
=========================
<br />
Now consider this:
<br />
<br />A) The structure expresses an atom (a subset of collaborating S(.) behaves
<br />
atom-ly). The structure is not 'about' an atom. It 'is' an atom.
<br />
<br />Contrast this with:
<br />
<br />B) The structure expresses a quale. The structure behaves quale-ly. From
<br />
the perspective of being the structure that does this behaviour quale-ness
<br />
is experienced. In the direction of the quale is perceived a 'perspective
<br />
view' of character 'qualeness'. (tough language, this!) This is 'matter'
<br />
but has intentionality. It is intrinsically 'about' something elsewhere.
<br />
=========================
<br />
<br />We easily recognise A as being matter.
<br />
<br />Q1. What would we recognise as B?
<br />
<br />A1. It is not matter in the sense we know it. I'd call it 'virtual
<br />
matter'. From the point of view of being the structure behaving quale-ly,
<br />
it is acting 'as-if' some other part of the structure interacted with it.
<br />
More than that the interaction is transient. The structure has to
<br />
repeatedly behave as if interacting with the selected other part of the
<br />
structure. This suggests repetitious behaviour of matter will be
<br />
associated with the arrival of virtual matter.
<br />
==========================
<br />
<br />So you can see that with simple about the nature of hierarchical
<br />
structures we have made some headway as to how qualia may be possible.
<br />
<br />Have a think about it, anyway...
