<br />
Again travel has forced me to take an absence from this list for a while,
<br />
but I think I will be home for several weeks so hopefully I will be able
<br />
to catch up at last.
<br />
<br />One question I would ask with regard to the role of time is, is there
<br />
something about time (and perhaps &quot;causality&quot;) that goes over and above
<br />
the equations or natural laws that control and define a given universe?
<br />
<br />Let us imagine a Cellular Automaton based universe; for simplicity, let it
<br />
be a 1-dimensional CA such as those studied in detail in Wolfram's book.
<br />
We have an x dimension and a t dimension, and some rules which are the
<br />
&quot;natural laws&quot; of that universe.  A sample rule might be
<br />
s[x,t+1] = s[x,t] XOR (s[x-1,t] OR s[x+1],t]).  This means that the
<br />
state at position x and time t+1 is the exclusive-or of the state at the
<br />
previous time (s[x,t]) and the OR of the left and right neighbor states.
<br />
In other words, a cell reverses its state if either of its neighbors is
<br />
&quot;on&quot;.
<br />
<br />Wolfram investigates all 256 possible rules which determine a cell's
<br />
next state from the previous state of the cell and its two neighbors.
<br />
Some lead to surprisingly complex patterns and it is conceivable that such
<br />
universes might even be complex enough to allow life and consciousness
<br />
to evolve.
<br />
<br />So we have a notion of time, t, and space, x.  The question is this.
<br />
If we don't *call* it time, does that change things?  Suppose we have
<br />
a universe with 2 spatial dimensions, x and y.  But it is governed by
<br />
the same rule: s[x,y+1] = s[x,y] XOR (s[x-1,y] OR s[x+1],y]).  Here
<br />
I have replaced t in the rule above by y.
<br />
<br />Does this make a difference?  I think we will agree that it does not.
<br />
Changing the letter t to the letter y does not change the fundamental
<br />
nature of this universe.  It only changes how we describe it.
<br />
<br />Then we can ask, is this rather abstract description of the universe,
<br />
in terms of its natural laws, enough for us to know whether the
<br />
consciousnesses that exist in it are really conscious?  Or do we need
<br />
to know more?  Do we need to know details about how the universe was
<br />
created (whatever that means!)?  Do we need to know if there is a &quot;flow&quot;
<br />
of &quot;causality&quot; in this universe?
<br />
<br />My answer is that the natural laws ought to be enough.  If we can find
<br />
a reasonable interpretation (defined rigorously as a mapping whose
<br />
information content is significantly smaller than the pattern itself) of
<br />
a pattern in the universe as something that we would consider a conscious
<br />
observer in our own universe, then we would be right to say that this
<br />
CA universe has consciousness.  (More precisely, that this CA universe
<br />
contributes measure to these instances and kinds of conscious observers.)
<br />
<br />I don't think it makes sense to demand more information than the natural
<br />
laws (like, what kind of universal-computer is running to interpret
<br />
these laws, what algorithm it uses, how sequential is it, is it allowed
<br />
to backtrack and change things, etc.).  The laws themselves define
<br />
the universe.  The two are, in a sense, equivalent.  That is all the
<br />
information there is.  The laws should be, in fact they must be, enough
<br />
to answer the question about whether the consciousness which appears in
<br />
such a universe is &quot;real&quot;.  That's how it appears to me.
<br />
<br />In our own universe, we too have natural laws that relate to space and
<br />
time.  One such law is from Newton: d2x/dt2 = Force/Mass (i.e. F=ma).
<br />
Relativity and QM have their own laws that refer to x, y, z, and t.
<br />
Generally, t is treated differently than the other coordinates, which
<br />
are all treated the same.  But obviously we could substitute some other
<br />
letter, say q, for t and it would not make a difference.  A universe
<br />
with quime instead of time would be the same.
<br />
<br />So again, is it enough to look at the natural laws of our universe in
<br />
order to decide whether the consciousnesses within it are real?  Or do we
<br />
need more?  Can we imagine a universe like ours, which follows exactly the
<br />
same natural laws, but where time doesn't really exist (in some sense),
<br />
where there is no actual causality?  I have trouble with this idea, but
<br />
I'd be interested to hear from those who think that such a distinction
<br />
exists.
