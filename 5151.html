Just to be mischievous, I'll here pronounce &quot;the facts of life&quot; or more

precisely

<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />The Emergence of Life Via Weak (Stochastic) Physical Pattern Replication
<br />
==================================================
<br />
<br />Definitions:
<br />
<br />&quot;pattern&quot; a form of order or regularity, which can be described by a 
<br />
finite and usually simple set of constraints.
<br />
<br />&quot;living organism&quot; is a subtype of &quot;spatially organized pattern of matter 
<br />
and energy with some
<br />
distribution for a time period in some spatial region&quot; in otherwords, of 
<br />
&quot;physical pattern in space-time&quot;.
<br />
<br />&quot;ecosystem&quot; or &quot;supporting environment of an organism&quot; is also a subtype 
<br />
of &quot;physical pattern in space-time&quot;.
<br />
<br />&quot;species&quot; is also a subtype of &quot;physical pattern in space-time&quot;, ranging 
<br />
over a larger span of time than an
<br />
organism pattern, and which includes instances over time of the 
<br />
subpatterns of the &quot;species&quot; pattern
<br />
that constitute the individual organisms of the species.
<br />
<br />Abstract:
<br />
---------
<br />
The natural selection process that results in the evolution of lifeforms 
<br />
as we know them can be extended
<br />
backwards in time further than is traditionally assumed, to fully 
<br />
explain the emergence of life from
<br />
chance-occurring patterns of matter and energy. A model of the form of 
<br />
this earliest natural selection
<br />
process is presented, in terms of three specific weakenings of the 
<br />
self-replication and metabolism processes
<br />
that lifeforms exhibit.
<br />
<br />Characteristics of a living organism:
<br />
-----------------------------------
<br />
1. It self-replicates (aka reproduces).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of what this means is that the organism assimilates surrounding 
<br />
matter and energy so that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they become part of its species pattern, if not necessarily of its 
<br />
own &quot;individual organism&quot; pattern.
<br />
<br />2. It metabolizes. It ingests matter and energy and converts them to a 
<br />
form more directly usable for the maintenance
<br />
of the form and function of the organism pattern and for its reproduction.
<br />
<br />3. It is an autonomous agent (within some environmental constraints.)
<br />
The matter and energy that is &quot;inside&quot; the organism pattern can 
<br />
replicate the pattern, and metabolize
<br />
pattern-external matter and energy, in a relatively diverse set of 
<br />
surroundings, compared to its own form and function
<br />
constraints anyway, and it can do these things substantially &quot;by itself&quot; 
<br />
so long as an appropriate supporting environment 
<br />
(which may not itself qualify as an organism but has some form and 
<br />
function constraints itself)
<br />
is maintained near it. In a sense, this &quot;autonomous replicating and 
<br />
metabolizing&quot; criterion just helps us
<br />
define a boundary around what matter and energy is &quot;the organism&quot; to  
<br />
and what is &quot;its environment&quot;.
<br />
<br />Thesis
<br />
-------
<br />
1. Before there was &quot;strong&quot; &quot;individual-organism&quot; self-replication, 
<br />
there was &quot;weak&quot; (stochastic) replication
<br />
of &quot;weakly constrained&quot; (and possibly physically dispersed) 
<br />
&quot;pre-organism&quot; patterns of matter and energy.
<br />
The only property (constraint on form and function) that these patterns 
<br />
had to exhibit was just enough
<br />
probability and frequency of just as roughly accurate pattern 
<br />
reproduction so as to maintain the
<br />
order (i.e. the pattern constraints) of the &quot;pre-species&quot; pattern 
<br />
against the various forms of pattern-dissolution
<br />
attacks that occurred in its environment. These attacks don't need to be 
<br />
explained much. They are comprised
<br />
just of
<br />
a.. the natural tendency of any physical system to increasing entropy 
<br />
(disorder) and
<br />
b.  active processes of dissolution of the pattern or its resources in 
<br />
its supporting environment where those active 
<br />
processes are the result of the actions of competing weakly-replicating, 
<br />
weakly-metabolising physical patterns in the
<br />
vicinity.
<br />
<br />2. Before there was &quot;strong&quot; &quot;organism-internalized&quot;  metabolism 
<br />
process, there was &quot;weak&quot; (stochastic)
<br />
pseudo-metabolism. That is there were processes of energy conversion 
<br />
(and temperature regimes and
<br />
matter mobility regimes (e.g. liquid phases) ) IN THE VICINITY OF A 
<br />
WEAKLY REPLICATING PATTERN
<br />
which were such as to support the (at least probabilistic) carrying on 
<br />
of the weak replication process
<br />
of the pattern. That is, early metabolism could be defined as happening 
<br />
both within and in the environment
<br />
of the pattern. Since the weakly replicating pattern initially may have 
<br />
been somewhat spatially distributed, and
<br />
only stochastically present at various time intervals, it's just as well 
<br />
that we don't require that the pattern-supporting
<br />
energy conversion processes (heat-engine processes) be carrried out 
<br />
initially entirely WITHIN the pattern (pre-organism)
<br />
itself.
<br />
<br /><br />Weak Replication and Weak Metabolism Concepts
<br />
----------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Definition-weakening 1 : SPARSE-PATTERN MATTER/ENERGY ACCRETION AS A 
<br />
PRECURSOR
<br />
TO SELF-SUFFICIENT-UNIT SELF-REPLICATION
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />The minimal criterion for a self-sustaining physical-pattern-accretion 
<br />
process (or pattern self-replication process) is that
<br />
over time, and stochastically, more matter/energy be assimilated into 
<br />
(become governed by) the constraints
<br />
of the pattern (i.e. the form and function of the pattern) than the 
<br />
amount of pattern-dissolution (pattern information-loss)
<br />
that happens via the several processes of
<br />
a.  inevitable physical system entropy increase,
<br />
b. surrounding environment physical accident (part of a. really),
<br />
c. competition (for matter/energy organization) from other patterns
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e.g. being eaten by a predator or starved out by a competitive feeder).
<br />
<br />Present-day species patterns accrete surrounding matter and energy in a 
<br />
very specific way. The
<br />
species patterns have separate, discrete &quot;individual organism&quot; units 
<br />
(and individual cell units). These sub-patterns of the whole)
<br />
independently replicate (and metabolize). This architecture provides
<br />
robustness of the overall pattern-accretion-process against pattern 
<br />
dissolution. If a disastrous environmental
<br />
change happens, there's a good chance only some and not all of the 
<br />
replication-and-metabolism
<br />
units of the pattern will be destroyed. So the information in the species
<br />
pattern (that comprises the pattern, you could say) has little chance of 
<br />
being lost by accident.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
An obvious weakening of this &quot;individuation and 
<br />
self-sufficient-unit-replication process
<br />
is a single holistic, and yet possibly spatially dispersed and sparse 
<br />
physical pattern with the property
<br />
that it accretes or assimilates surrounding matter and energy into 
<br />
itself. However, in this weak pattern
<br />
replication process (or more generally, pattern-accretion process), the 
<br />
spatial and temporal distribution of the matter-energy
<br />
accretion need not be organized into discrete, complete replication 
<br />
events for
<br />
individual-organism or individual-cell units. More generalized, 
<br />
spread-out in space-and-time,
<br />
and stochastic matter/energy accretion will do.
<br />
<br />When the probability and rate (in some spatial region (some 
<br />
environment), for some time period, of pattern-accretion
<br />
on balance exceeds the rate of pattern-information-loss, and is great 
<br />
enough that the amount of pattern-information
<br />
in the region never becomes zero again, the pattern has achieved 
<br />
survival-threshold replication ability.
<br />
<br />While an individual-unit complete-replication process has obvious 
<br />
net-accretion-success-probability benefits, and would
<br />
thus likely be selected for in an ongoing natural selection process of 
<br />
pattern versus pattern
<br />
competition and pattern vs. environmental-accident competition, the 
<br />
accretion process need not start at this
<br />
level of sophistication. Simple sufficient-rate matter/energy accretion 
<br />
to pattern-governance is sufficient for there
<br />
to be some chance of pattern survival long enough for the pattern to be 
<br />
improved (and &quot;robustified&quot;)
<br />
by natural selection in its environment.
<br />
<br />Once a physical pattern reaches survival-threshold accretion/replication 
<br />
probability, natural selection would also
<br />
select for spatial contiguity of form in a weakly replicating/accreting 
<br />
matter/energy
<br />
pattern. The argument is simple. Spatially distributed, sparse patterns 
<br />
are more disruptable, dissolvable into
<br />
entropy, by environmental disruption/change occurring partially within 
<br />
or throughout the
<br />
pattern (or location where it &quot;weakly&quot; or &quot;sparsely&quot; exists). More 
<br />
spatially contiguous pattern or order is less
<br />
vulnerable to this sort of disruption, provided the pattern's own 
<br />
structure (matter/energy arrangement) is
<br />
inherently resistant to destructive re-arrangement. If the pattern 
<br />
&quot;glues itself together&quot; (as earth lifeforms and
<br />
their organic molecules do electromagnetically) then it will be more 
<br />
robust if it is spatially contiguous with less
<br />
random intervening environment. Spatial cohesiveness and contiguity 
<br />
then, is a physical pattern trait
<br />
that can increase the form-and-function survival probability of the 
<br />
pattern over any given time-slice.
<br />
In a competitive accretion/replication situation, spatially contiguous 
<br />
pattern forms with increased probability
<br />
of longer survival in diverse environmental conditions will eventually 
<br />
out-accrete/replicate other pattern forms.
<br />
<br />Definition-weakening 2: LOW-FIDELITY REPLICATION
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />DNA and RNA in the cells of present-day organisms replicate with an 
<br />
error rate of 1 / 10,000,000.
<br />
<br />However, the weakest possible criterion for 
<br />
physical-pattern-self-replication-process fidelity is that the
<br />
replication produces another pattern instance of  some pattern which 
<br />
shares a survival-threshold
<br />
weak-replication ability with the parent pattern. The successor pattern 
<br />
DOES NOT HAVE TO BE
<br />
IN ANY OTHER RESPECT SIMILAR TO THE PARENT PATTERN.
<br />
<br />So the subject of the weak-replication process is an EQUIVALENCE-CLASS 
<br />
OF PHYSICAL
<br />
PATTERNS, equivalent ONLY under the constraint all pattern-variants in 
<br />
the class are able to carry
<br />
on some form of pattern-class-survival-threshold replication and (in 
<br />
concert with their environment,)
<br />
pattern-survival-threshold metabolism.
<br />
<br />It is easy to see how natural selection would select for physical 
<br />
patterns capable of higher fidelity replication (matter-energy
<br />
accretion into the pattern form and function) processes. Higher-fidelity 
<br />
replication narrows the 
<br />
accreted/replicated pattern's equivalence class of successor patterns. 
<br />
This allows other advantageous traits
<br />
about a pattern's form and behaviour to be more rapidly and reliably 
<br />
accreted (replicated) once they arise
<br />
by chance and competition.
<br />
<br />Of course the optimum replication fidelity depends on a trade-off 
<br />
between the need to be able to change the pattern
<br />
(adapt) rapidly in response to changing environments, and the need to 
<br />
safeguard optimized patterns (by efficient, hi-fi
<br />
&nbsp;replication) once those optimized patterns are arrived at. Our 
<br />
present-day rate of high-replication-fidelity combined with
<br />
sexual reproduction (adaptive trait mixer/optimizer process) and 
<br />
radiation-induced or recombination-accident-induced
<br />
genetic mutation is just such a process of optimized-fidelity 
<br />
pattern-replication process.
<br />
<br /><br />Definition-weakening 3: ENVIRONMENT-DRIVEN METABOLISM
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />The metabolic process is the process by which a replicating/accreting 
<br />
physical pattern obtains energy to perform
<br />
its survival-necessary behaviours, (such as metabolism itself, and 
<br />
replication/accretion, and more eventually, more
<br />
refined processes like mobility, defense, cooperation, and 
<br />
environment-modification/optimization behaviours)
<br />
and the way in which the physical pattern obtains an external supply of 
<br />
matter to build its form and/or replace
<br />
entropically dissolved parts of its form (e.g. dead cells for a 
<br />
multi-cellular organism pattern, or dead individual
<br />
organisms for a species-pattern.)
<br />
<br />Present-day organisms guard their metabolic (matter/energy conversion 
<br />
i.e. fuel-burning or heat-engine processes)
<br />
by conducting them almost entirely spatially internally to the pattern, 
<br />
with only a relatively narrow and specialized
<br />
fuel-intake interface of the pattern to the environment (e.g. of 
<br />
interface - mouths of animals, photosynthetic surfaces of
<br />
plants.)
<br />
<br />But this is just an optimization of a process that could originally have 
<br />
operated in a more spatially distributed form,
<br />
and with more contributions of process drivers from the inherent 
<br />
energy/entropy disequilibrium properties of the environment
<br />
that surrounds the metabolizing pattern
<br />
<br />&nbsp;A concrete example of circumstances for possible weak metabolic 
<br />
processes (seen as properties of parts of the environment
<br />
as a whole) are the undersea volcanic vents on Earth, with supplies of 
<br />
elemental ingredients for organic molecules,
<br />
supplies of rapidly convertible-to-energy fuel (sulphur), and supplies 
<br />
of energy (the volcanic processes), all churning
<br />
together in sometimes physically contained (organization-trapping) 
<br />
regions (hollows in rocks) in a liquid medium permitting
<br />
high numbers of matter interactions and rearrangements and yet not the 
<br />
too-high, matter dispersing, equilibrium-forcing energies
<br />
and excessive degrees-of-freedom of gas-phase environments.
<br />
<br />The minimal criterion for a metabolic process to be occurring for a 
<br />
physical matter/energy pattern is that
<br />
a.  appropriate levels of work-usable energy (and thermodynamic 
<br />
disequilibrium) and  appropriate forms of matter
<br />
are available in the environment patterns of a pattern,  and that
<br />
b. the combination of the form and function of the pattern and the form 
<br />
and function of its environment are such that the
<br />
surrounding matter and energy can be applied in sufficient quantity, 
<br />
stochastically, over time, to the
<br />
form and function of the instances of the 
<br />
replicating-pattern-equivalence-class, such that
<br />
c. the pattern-equivalence-class can maintain (on balance) its 
<br />
survival-threshold accretion process/replication process
<br />
and its survival-threshold environmentally-involved metabolism process, 
<br />
overcoming the rate of spontaneous disordering
<br />
of the patterns that is caused by the tendency of any physical system to 
<br />
increasing entropy.
<br />
<br />Once an environment-driven or environment-involved metabolic process 
<br />
gets going enough to support stochastic
<br />
accretion of pattern information, it is easy to see how natural 
<br />
selection would select for more internalized metabolism
<br />
processes, for these processes are more protected against chance 
<br />
disruption of the  pseudo-metabolic operation
<br />
of the whole surrounding environment (there is less of the surrounding 
<br />
environment right there in the middle of the
<br />
metabolic process, in an internalized metabolic process, so the 
<br />
internalized process is less at risk from environmental
<br />
vagaries.)
<br />
&nbsp;Also, by spatially internalizing the metabolic process, more complex, 
<br />
specialized, self-sufficient, and more energy-efficient
<br />
metabolic processes can be physically structured, contained and 
<br />
protected from a more randomly varying external environment.
<br />
So it is easy to see how cell walls (and organism physical-form 
<br />
boundaries: tissue, skin etc) would be selected for.
<br />
<br />With metabolic internalization come other advantages like ability to 
<br />
specialize the organism's form for survival in
<br />
different environments, while maintaining a consistent metabolic process 
<br />
inside the form. So organisms that can
<br />
keep-together in, thrive in, and move to favorable parts of a liquid 
<br />
environment, for example, can evolve.

<br />
<br />&nbsp;A Generalized Description of a Specific Lifelike Pattern-Replication / 
<br />
Pattern Accretion Process
<br />
<br />PHYSICAL PATTERN ACCRETION/REPLICATION THROUGH ATTRACTION OF
<br />
COMPLEMENTARY FORM
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
When or how can weak pattern-accretion/replication processes occur by 
<br />
chance in the first place?
<br />
<br />Weak pattern-accretion/replication processes can at least
<br />
happen in any physical (or informational?) pattern-equivalence-class which:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
a. Can (by its physical form and its interaction properties) cause 
<br />
either parts of itself, or
<br />
the surrounding matter (or symbols) to be formed into a COMPLEMENT of 
<br />
the pattern's form. i.e.
<br />
The pattern's form, at least at some times and places, can cause the 
<br />
formation of a MOLD FOR
<br />
ANOTHER OCCURRENCE OF THE PATTERN OR PART OF THE PATTERN.
<br />
<br />An example of a form and interaction-property combination which leads to 
<br />
complement or &quot;mold&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;formation, is of course the molecular shape and distribution of 
<br />
electric charge along the exterior of
<br />
organic molecules like amino acids. These molecular shapes and charge 
<br />
distributions cause appropriate
<br />
binding (collection and collation by electromagnetic attraction and 
<br />
form-fitting in a soup of appropriate
<br />
and appropriately mobile atoms and molecular fragments) of complementary 
<br />
atoms and
<br />
molecules, which in some cases, form a complement that in turn can 
<br />
attract more atoms of the right
<br />
kinds to form a copy of the original amino acid.
<br />
<br />This kind of replication by form-complement forming requires certain 
<br />
environmental
<br />
regimes of particular combinations of particular types of commonly 
<br />
available atoms with particular
<br />
electrochemical binding and repulsion properties. It also requires the 
<br />
environment to exhibit a certain
<br />
range of thermodynamic disequilibrium (balance between disordering 
<br />
mobility and energy of atoms
<br />
and the need for the atoms and molecules to be  mobile and 
<br />
momentum-carrying enough to bind
<br />
and stick to each other. The appropriate thermodynamic disequilibrium 
<br />
range  (temperature range
<br />
and surrounding soup viscosity/pressure) is determined relative to the 
<br />
strength of the electromagnetic
<br />
force and gravitational force and the way that the atoms of different 
<br />
atomic elements exhibit and interact via
<br />
these forces.
<br />
<br />The work-ready energy balance and binding forces balance must be such 
<br />
that complementary
<br />
molecules can be attracted, bound and organized, but also occasionally 
<br />
freed-up to attract another
<br />
copy of the original form. It may be a fine balance, with relatively few 
<br />
modes for its existence in our
<br />
particular universe with its particular physical laws and available 
<br />
proportions of various kinds of
<br />
matter and coincident energy/entropy regimes.

<br />
<br />The META-EVOLUTION PRINCIPLE AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE
<br />
FORM OF LIVING ORGANISMS
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
The meta-evolution principle (applicable to matter/energy patterns and 
<br />
perhaps also or equivalently
<br />
to evolvable information patterns) runs as follows:
<br />
<br />THE CONTINUOUS AND IMPROVING ABILITY TO BE EVOLVED EFFICIENTLY IS A 
<br />
NECESSARILY
<br />
EVOLVED TRAIT OF ORGANISMS/SPECIES EVOLVED BY THE NATURAL SELECTION PROCESS
<br />
<br />All living organisms/species, whose form and function come to exist 
<br />
through the processes
<br />
of
<br />
a. initially chance alignment/ordering of matter and energy in 
<br />
appropriate thermodynamic regimes, and then
<br />
b. differential-replication/accretion-probability natural selection
<br />
<br />have a form (and behaviour regime) in their whole, and recursively in 
<br />
all of their parts, as those parts are evolved
<br />
subsystems, which is subject to the following constraints:
<br />
<br />1. The form (and its complementary behaviour regimes) must be functional 
<br />
(or at least not excessively survival-detrimental)
<br />
during the reign of EVERY VARIANT OF ITSELF WHICH OCCURRED DURING THE 
<br />
EVOLUTION OF THE
<br />
TYPE OF ORGANISM/SPECIES.
<br />
<br />AND ALSO
<br />
<br />2. The form (and behaviour)
<br />
must be READILY EVOLVABLE (FUNCTIONAL OR NOT EXCESSIVELY DETRIMENTAL
<br />
WHILE SUBJECT TO AND AMENABLE TO AVAILABLE FORMS OF INCREMENTAL ADAPTATION)
<br />
during the reign of EVERY VARIANT OF ITSELF WHICH OCCURRED DURING THE 
<br />
EVOLUTION
<br />
OF THE TYPE OF ORGANISM/SPECIES.
<br />
<br />At first this principle may seem like some kind of tautology. But I 
<br />
think it may be profound to some degree
<br />
and possibly new.
<br />
-------
<br />
The only forms that will evolve (while in competition with natural 
<br />
accident/entropy and with other resource-competitive forms)
<br />
will be those forms which are of such a form that they were 
<br />
survival-advantageous (or not excessively the opposite)
<br />
during ALL STAGES of their evolution of form. THIS IS AN EXCEEDINGLY 
<br />
STRICT DESIGN CONSTRAINT
<br />
ON FORMS!!!!
<br />
<br />Furthermore, the forms must (throughout their evolution, and if in 
<br />
competition, then increasingly as evolved),
<br />
be explicitly amenable to (increasing the probability of success of, and 
<br />
likely utility of)
<br />
some kind of mutation process which is readily available in either the 
<br />
environment or the form and function of
<br />
the organism/species itself.
<br />
-------
<br />
<br />This meta-evolution principle could, for example, explain properties 
<br />
such as the average level (and the ranges)
<br />
of viscosity (mobility versus stability of form and function) inside 
<br />
living cells, and inside living bodies as a whole.
<br />
<br />It could explain the tendency of living structures to be built from 
<br />
increasingly complex (increasingly spatially larger)
<br />
layerings or networks of &quot;fractally functional&quot; forms which expand 
<br />
themselves at their boundaries but retain
<br />
overall form constraints with slight variations allowed (a level of 
<br />
physical pliability/adaptability, both for adaptation
<br />
to the immediate environmental problems of the individual organism, but 
<br />
also to allow a dimension in which a
<br />
small, non-destructive form-difference can exhibit and be differentially 
<br />
reproduced if generally adaptive.
<br />
<br />It could explain why sexual reproduction is successful, for while it 
<br />
varies the forms (leading to adaptation/optimization
<br />
for different environmental problems), the variation in form is 
<br />
constrained to be in forms akin to those (or simple
<br />
combinations of those forms) of previously successful examples (two 
<br />
successful parent organisms) of the species.
<br />
<br />----------
<br />
Similarly with the evolved behaviours of the evolved forms.
