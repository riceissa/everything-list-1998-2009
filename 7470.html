<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but I contend that while there are two organisms present,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is only one person.  It's much as though some space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aliens kidnapped you and tried to say that Pete at spacetime
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coordinates (X1,T1) could not possibly be the same person as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Pete at coordinates (X1,T2) because the times weren't the same.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You'd have to get them to wrap their heads around the idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one person could be at two different times in the same place.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They might find this bizarre.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm trying to tell you a possibility that you think equally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bizarre: namely that Pete(X1,T1) is the same person as Pete(X2,T1),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; namely that the same person may be at two different locations at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same time.  That's all.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I like that idea, but if they are the *same* person then we are all the 
<br />
same person.
<br />
Or, perhaps you were just meaning that they are very close/similar; in 
<br />
which case you can say Pete(X2,T1) is much closer to Pete(X1,T1) than 
<br />
Bruno(x, now) is close to Lee(y, now). But then, strictly speaking 
<br />
Pete(X1,T1) is not the same person as Pete(X2,T1).
<br />
<br />In any case I am not sure that those distinctions have any bearing on 
<br />
the existence of first person indeterminacy and the problem to quantify 
<br />
that indeterminacy.
<br />
<br />Imagine you are duplicated iteratively. At the start you are in room R. 
<br />
You are scanned and destroyed, painlessly, and we tell you that you 
<br />
will be reconstituted in room 0 and in room 1.
<br />
Then Lee0 and Lee1 are invited in room R again and the experience is 
<br />
repeated.
<br />
Rooms 0 and 1 are identical and quite separate. The only difference is 
<br />
that in room 0 there is a big 0 drawn on the wall and in room 1 there 
<br />
is a big 1 drawn on the wall.
<br />
You are asked to bet on your immediate and less immediate future 
<br />
feeling. Precisely: we ask you to choose among the following bets:
<br />
<br />Immediate:
<br />
A. I will see 0 on the wall.
<br />
B. I will see 1 on the wall.
<br />
C. I will see 0 on the wall and I will see 1 on the wall.
<br />
D. I will see 0 on the wall or I will see 1 on the wall.
<br />
<br />Less immediate:
<br />
A'. I will always see 0 on the wall.
<br />
B'. I will always see 1 on the wall
<br />
C'. I will see as many 0 and 1 on the wall
<br />
D'. I will see an incompressible sequence of 0 and 1 on the wall
<br />
<br />And there are three versions of the experiences. In a first version you 
<br />
are always reconstituted in the two rooms.
<br />
In the second version we tell you in advance that once on 2 iterations, 
<br />
you are reconstituted in one room only, and this one is chosen by 
<br />
random with a coin.
<br />
In the third version we don't tell you if we choose the first version 
<br />
or the second version.
<br />
<br />We suppose obviously that you want maximize &quot;your&quot; benefit(s). Each 
<br />
Lee-i is offered 5$ each time his bet is confirmed, but loose 5$ if he 
<br />
makes a wrong bet.
<br />
<br />What will be your strategy in each version? Will your strategy differ? 
<br />
Note that I have purposefully avoided the use of &quot;first person&quot; in the 
<br />
question, and so &quot;C&quot; can be considered as a little ambiguous. My point 
<br />
will be to make you accept there is indeed an ambiguity in C.
<br />
<br />Bruno
