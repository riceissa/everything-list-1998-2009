<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno provides the exercise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I notice that many people seek refuge in the &quot;no-copying&quot; theorem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; QM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Exercise: 1) Show by a qualitative informal reasoning that if we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Turing emulable then a no-cloning theorem is a necessity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My best guess right now?  Your challenge would be a futile exercise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in word play!  &quot;no-cloning&quot; involves quantum mechanics.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I don't think QM has a copyright on the non copy theorems!
<br />
I have been prudent enough to talk on &quot;a&quot;, and not &quot;the&quot;  
<br />
Zurek-Wootters-Diecks non copy theorems. In france there is a law of  
<br />
non cloning of embryo. What are you saying?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So far as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know, computability theory (e.g. Rogers 1967) says ABSOLUTELY
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; NOTHING about quantum mechanics, and they are in two completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different intellectual domains.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Why does the David Deutsch FOR book mention comp/turing as an important  
<br />
thread of the book. Everett uses comp in its derivation of the  
<br />
collapse. I'm glad you mention Rogers' classical introduction to  
<br />
computability theory, which is excellent, but is a book on pure  
<br />
computability theory, not on applied computability theory. Since when  
<br />
is it forbidden to apply one field on another. I really don't  
<br />
understand your remark.
<br />
<br />All what I say is that someone who understands the 8 UDA steps should  
<br />
easily be able to convince him/herself that whatever matter could *be*,  
<br />
it cannot be cloned. This can be shown in a short sentence. It is  
<br />
almost trivial. (once UDA is thoroughly understood: this is probably  
<br />
less trivial, and  from your conversation with Stathis I can infer you  
<br />
have trouble at the step 3, in the SANE paper:
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/</a> 
<br />
SANE2004MARCHALAbstract.html
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me know when the newspapers announce that you've derived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; QM from computability theory.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have only show that if comp is true then QM is derivable from comp  
<br />
theory.
<br />
I do have derive a little bit of QM.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or any blasted physics equation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatsoever. (I'm sorry that I have neither the time nor the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expertise to digest your technical papers.)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Except the step 7 which need  a passive understanding of Church's  
<br />
thesis, there is nothing technical in the UDA reasoning. I agree the  
<br />
interview of the machine on UDA is more difficult, because it  
<br />
presupposes some background in logic and computability theory. But it  
<br />
is not necessary for the understanding of the UDA (universal dovetailer  
<br />
argument) which gives the main result.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In another thread, Bruno wrote
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; This is the central problem from those who are deeply concerned as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to *why* 1st person experiences exist.  Too bad that to me, it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; just obvious that they must.  I literally cannot conceive of how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; it could be different!  (Poor me, I suppose---in some ways some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of us just have too little imagination, I truly guess.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The problem is not so much &quot;why&quot; 1-person experiences exist, but how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; they are related to 3-person descriptions, and which one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; How do *you* explain the relation?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I were a great novelist, I might be able to convey certain 1st
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person experiences to you (but that is possible *only* because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two organisms Bruno and Lee are so similar).  But I'm not a great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; novelist, and so I can't.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Here you make the category error which is made by so many physicalists  
<br />
or materialists. I am not asking you to convey some of your first  
<br />
person experience (well actually with your aargh and other humbug you  
<br />
do succeed but that's beyond the poin :).
<br />
But at least you accept the existence of those 1-experience (unlike the  
<br />
materialist eliminativist a-la-Churchland). My question is how do you  
<br />
related them to third person describable things?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore, we can only talk about what is in the world, from tables
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to trees to mountains and stars.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah ? This is a so ambiguous statement that I cannot comment it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; *People* occupy an infinitesimal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; portion of what's out there. The maze of internal events which make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each one of them feel and think is interesting, but is a very difficult
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physiological problem.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is a physiological problem once you are both computationalist and  
<br />
physicalist, but UDA shows those two options are incompatible. Please  
<br />
tell me where I am wrong. If you want we can go step by step with  
<br />
little posts. I am afraid you take for granted, perhaps unconsciously  
<br />
Aristotle theory of mind and substance. It just does not work with  
<br />
comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I claim that it has nothing to do with serious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophy,
</em><br />
<br /><br />You talk of serious philosophy, but are explicitly against the use of  
<br />
definition and postulates (axioms) in some of your posts. How could we  
<br />
progress. Beside I don't believe in some clear boundary between science  
<br />
and philosophy. Those are, imo, purely conventional construct. In  
<br />
France and Belgium philosophy belongs to literature.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and is just a hideous distraction, possibly stemming from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confusion at the semantic level and disturbed sr. Bad epistemology,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a phrase.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I could agree if you give arguments. Without arguments it just looks  
<br />
like insults (almost).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; THERE ISN'T A PROBLEM!
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Yes, okay, to computer scientists and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physiologists there is, but not to philosophers or others interested
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in getting their ontology and epistemology straight.) The evolved
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creatures all have their responses and their internal workings;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that's *all* there is to it!
</em><br />
<br /><br />You do confuse here 1-discourse and 3-discourse. It is easy to build  
<br />
machine capable of reporting their internal states. But that does not  
<br />
explain the presence of qualia associate with those reports. On the  
<br />
contrary pure 3-explanation of those self-referential reports seems to  
<br />
evacuate the need of the internal and non communicable qualia. Note  
<br />
that this is really what I have solved in the comp-frame with the  
<br />
Lobian machine interview, and this, I accept, is more difficult to  
<br />
grasp than just UDA. I agree that for many, it is hard to understand  
<br />
the mind-body problem, but I think this is due to some blind  
<br />
acceptation of aristotle naturalism.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am an evolved creature; and if I can't understand that that same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusions apply just as much to me as to the creatures I study,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then I'm yielding to nonsense.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here I totally agree with you.  But that does not per se evacuate the  
<br />
qualia problem, which is a problem for me *and* for the Lobian machines  
<br />
I study, for exemple.
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
