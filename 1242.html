<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think one of the essential difference between Jacques' point of view and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some of the rest of us (James?, Bruno?, Russell?, Gilles? and myself) is that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jacques does not accept the principle of identity of indistinguishable and we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do. This principle, I think, was first enounciated by Leibniz. Depending if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is accepted or not, it leads to very different conclusions regarding how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is affected by the branching of the wave function. Other issues 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involve absolutism or relativism of measure and the linkage between worlds 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and consciousness. I will explore this issues in the following questions 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which may be the basis for further discussion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First Question. The principle of identity of indistinguishable applied to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wave function.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it possible for two (local) portions of the universal wave function 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; originating from different (local) pasts, to &quot;merge&quot; that is to become 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identical. The output merged &quot;measure&quot; of this process would then be the sum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the two input &quot;measures.&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So if the first input portion is X and the second input portion is Y then the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resulting wave would be X+Y. (This question ignores the Self Sampling issues)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I assume that &quot;measure&quot; is in some way related (or identical) to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability = Square(|X +Y|) of the wave function. 
</em><br />
<br />Yes this is quite possible, and corresponds to histories being
<br />
forgotten. For example, there are many details about the world of the
<br />
dinosaurs that will never be known, so many quantum histories in the
<br />
past have merged to form our present. Another point of view is that
<br />
the past trajectories are merged until such time as one performs an
<br />
observation (eg discovers a fossil, or whatever) that separates
<br />
them. At which point, we have a separation of the trajectories, each
<br />
with a different augmented history.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Second Question. Is there really branching?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure if the branching and merging processes are at all possible in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the first place or just an artifact of the way we look at the wave function. 
</em><br />
<br />Yes it is an artifact of the way we perceive the wave function.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the wave function is mapped in Wheeler's phase space, then, assuming 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purely deterministic laws, is it true to say that two trajectories in this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space could never cross (or merge except in the limit)? and for the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasons, could never branch? 
</em><br />
<br />Trajectories only exist in the classical projections made by concious
<br />
observers, the concept is meaningless (as far as I can tell) for the
<br />
universal wavefunction (which instead has a single (deterministic)
<br />
evolution). As such, the observer's trajectories do indeed branch and
<br />
merge, as discussed above.
<br />
<br />(I think this question is related to the 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lyapunov stability theorem) How is this absence of branching and merging 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconciled with the branching (and merging) that we take for granted in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MWI?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Third Question. The principle of identity of indistinguishable applied to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming that it is possible for two (local) portions of the wave function to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;merge,&quot; then, is it true to say that two different consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independently expressed by these two portions, become one and same at the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; merging point? 
</em><br />
<br />By merging trajectories, the histories of the conciousnesses are shared, and
<br />
mutually consistent. What does it mean to merge two conciousnesses?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fourth Question. Absolutism vs Relativity of measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is &quot;measure&quot; an absolute quantity, invariant with the observer, such as the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distance between two points along a geodesic in space-time? Or is measure a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relative quantity that depends on the observer, such as length, time, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; velocity? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that Jacques believes in the absolute version of measure and some of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the rest of us, in the relative version. This question raises a hornet's nest 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because, and depending on the answer, it leads to different conclusions 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regarding Quantum Suicide (QS). 
</em><br />
<br />I believe measure is an absolute quantity, as defined by
<br />
Jacques. However, it has little bearing on QTI, an opinion for which I
<br />
reamin in a state of disagreement with Jacques.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fifth Question. Measuring Your Own Measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can an observer observe or measure his own &quot;measure?&quot; How could one set up an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment to make such a measurement? Would that experiment involve 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; estimating how unlikely our world is? In other words if our world is found to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be very improbable then our measure would be low, otherwise our measure would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be high. 
</em><br />
<br />This idea has been explored in some sci fi books, but I'm not sure it
<br />
can be consistently done.
<br />
<br /><br />The problem here is that if we assume the Plenitude to be an 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite set of possibilities, then any world would have a probability of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zero. Absolutists would be satisfied with playing around with infinitesimal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilities and would fight tooth and nail for maximizing those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinitesimals at all cost thus shunning QS as a &quot;crackpot idea&quot;. Relativists 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would in a sense &quot;RENORMALIZE&quot; their own probability of existence by using 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the conditional probability GIVEN the existence of the self. Thus, accoding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to them, the probability that they exist given that they exist is one. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Relative Self Sampling Assumption (RSSA) is the conditional probability given 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the self,  and the Absolute Self Sampling Assumption (ASSA) is the plain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability.
</em><br />
<br />Again, I don't believe measure (at least the absolute measure as
<br />
defined by Jacques, and which is the only consistent definition IMHO)
<br />
has any bearing on decision theory. You see the measure is absolute -
<br />
it is unchanged by any decisions we may (perhaps only preceive to) make.
<br />
<br />In decision theory, we should just ask ourselves what history do we
<br />
want to follow, and bugger the other &quot;yous&quot; that have different ideas.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sixth Question. Linkage between worlds and consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am here venturing in an area in which I know very little. However, I think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it relates to the controversy betweenby David Lewis,&quot;On the Plurality of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Worlds,&quot; and Saul Kripke, a colleague of Lewis at Princeton University, who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the champion of ersatz modal realism. Is a particular consciousness linked 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a single world,  or is it kind of  &quot;spread out&quot; like a quantum cloud over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a multiplicity of worlds, for example like an electron is spread out in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilistic wave? (In fact maybe the quantum wave IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; WAVE). In other words, does consciousness have extension across worlds? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Related to this question is the issue of how much difference is required 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between two consciousness for them to cease to be identical. In other words 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is the TOLERANCE required by Leibniz principle of identity of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indistinguishable. How can we define this tolerance? Is this difference 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical or psychological? Is this tolerance defined by Planck's constant? Or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is it defined by a &quot;Turing type&quot; test in which the difference is significant 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to an individual ONLY IF HE PERCEIVES IT TO BE SIGNIFICANT? Who is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer for the &quot;Turing type&quot; test? The Self? Others?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Since each world is very much in the eye of the observer, the latter
<br />
type statement is perhaps the closest to the mark. However, one may
<br />
ask the question, how does an observer observe different worlds in
<br />
order to make a comparison, when by definition, the world is defined
<br />
by what the observer sees. It could be you're asking a meaningless question.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, as in previous issues, I think that some of us have championed the one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness - one world system and others have supported the one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness - multi-world system. And each point of view leads to radically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different conclusions regarding QS. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have raised many questions, I think enough work to keep busy far into the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next millenium. Forgive me if I attributed to you beliefs that you do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have. In the absence of a firm index of ideas with champions and challengers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find it difficult to know exactly what you are thinking.
