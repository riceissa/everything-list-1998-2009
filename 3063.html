<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it slowly, and without doubts it's too long).&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So it is a third person measure on first person experiences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ssssiiiiiigggggghhhhhhh!!!!!!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I read the sentence many times and it still does not make sense to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Should I read it again?
</em><br />
<br />Read it three times at breakfast, and one time in the evening
<br />
jumping the parenthesis.
<br />
<br />Ok, ok. My diagnostic is that either you have forget the question
<br />
7 or 8, (see below) or you are forgetting what the UD does.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;the union of all portion of UD*  in which my &quot;preparing coffee&quot; state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appear.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Suppose that the UD is written in Fortran. I guess you know what the
<br />
trace of a program is. 
<br />
<br />UD* is the infinite trace of the UD. It is describe by the
<br />
sequence of its subsequent states (as a program fortran). 
<br />
<br /><br />It is an infinite tree describing all possible computations in fortran.
<br />
(which includes fortran simulation of all program in Lisp, all Fortran
<br />
simulation of the COBOL version 5.3 emulation of all linear 
<br />
transformations,
<br />
all the unitary transformations, etc.
<br />
<br />Some of those computations will generate the 3-states corresponding to my 
<br />
&quot;preparing coffe 1-state&quot;. Because we accept comp. Now if I prepare a
<br />
cup of coffee, my brain will go through a sequence of states (third person
<br />
describable computational state, at the right level of description
<br />
of myself). and I have pick one of those state---like in a duplication 
<br />
experiment).
<br />
<br />So the UD generates that state eventually (by going through a computation
<br />
which emulates my doing or dreaming of doing that cup of coffe).
<br />
<br />The UD will generates that state eventually. Let us say in 10^googol
<br />
years (or steps). Our poor &quot;universe&quot; has disappeared, but we don't 
<br />
care because the UD run in Plato Heaven, or if you prefer, 
<br />
the whole UD* (the trace of the UD) lies staticaly but completely 
<br />
in Plato heaven). UD* is the block &quot;mindscape&quot; (mindscape borrowed to
<br />
Rudy Rucker's &quot;Infinity and the Mind&quot;.).
<br />
<br />And we don't care of the number of steps and of the time that UD would 
<br />
have
<br />
take to get that states because, as first person we cannot be aware
<br />
of those delays. Ok?
<br />
<br />Please reread ten billions times, after lunch, the question 7 and 8.
<br />
Especially 8. (copy and past from  
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2992.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2992.html</a>  below)
<br />
<br />Note in passing that a copy and paste is a duplication without
<br />
annhilation of the original. 
<br />
<br />The apparition in UD* of that third person description of the precise
<br />
state &quot;where is my cup now?&quot; (occuring when I am preparing my
<br />
cup of coffee (existing by comp)) is provided by the fact that
<br />
the UD generates all computations.
<br />
<br />Saying yes to 7 and 8, makes that &quot;event&quot;, executed by the UD
<br />
equivalent with a delayed reconstitution without demolition of the 
<br />
original.
<br />
<br />So with comp you *must* bet that at each instant you are copy and paste
<br />
somewhere in your domain of indeterminacy.
<br />
<br />But, after a much longer time (much 
<br />
longer that 10^googol (the DU *dovetails*, so that it has a lot of work
<br />
while generating and executing the other programs) it generates a new
<br />
reconstitution of that states, so he builds little by little your
<br />
entire domain of 1-indeterminacy. The fact that the DU builds the
<br />
reconstitutions so slowly does not change the first person
<br />
experience because of the non awareness of the delay.
<br />
<br />So when I am preparing my coffee cup, if I want to predict my next
<br />
possible instant, I must have a measure on the set of computational
<br />
histories generated by the DU going through the state corresponding
<br />
to my particular  &quot;preparing my coffee cup&quot; state. Or a measure
<br />
on all the &quot;reconsitution&quot; in UD*.
<br />
<br />We just cannot care that some of those reconstitution appears
<br />
at step n1, some other at step n2, other at step n3, ....
<br />
The domain of reconstitution will be the union of all the portion
<br />
(subset or substring or subspace, or whatever
<br />
depending on the choice of representation)
<br />
... portion containing the virtual (or arithmetical) reconstitution.
<br />
<br />Find a LISP interpreteur, run the UD at
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2793.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2793.html</a>
<br />
If you don't like LISP, write yourself a UD in COBOL (why not)
<br />
Run it.
<br />
Stop it after two days. You have a portion of UD*.
<br />
Stop it after three days, you get a bigger portion of UD*.
<br />
By comp there is a day it will generate (and &quot;reconstitute&quot; de 
<br />
facto) my coffee-state of mind (the 3-comp state corresponding
<br />
for that state which exist.
<br />
<br />If you answer yes to question 8, you should understand
<br />
why it is not necessary to
<br />
annihilate me when I am in that state, here in Brussels, for
<br />
making myself survive somewhere in UD*. 
<br />
<br />Even if there is a &quot;real physical universe&quot;, if you accept comp, 
<br />
you can bet the next instant that you have been copy and past in UD*.
<br />
So it is preferable to accept we have never leave it.
<br />
<br />The only way to hunt the white rhabbits is to extract
<br />
Turing tropically the stability of regularities.
<br />
<br />All this a priori. No doubt some equivalence quotient can be
<br />
attempted relatively, and some structure can exists on those
<br />
first person view of the computational neigborhood.
<br />
(And that happen indeed in the arithmetical translation of
<br />
the UDA).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is the cone in space, time, or what? Why three dimensions?
</em><br />
<br />3 = 2 (because of the two dimensionality of the chosen CA (for exemple
<br />
game of life)- + 1 (time step). Little more below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not four or five? Where are these dimensions coming from?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the choice of cellular automata for describing the &quot;programs&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The sentence is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not too long... it's just that it assumes too much background.
</em><br />
<br />Sorry. (I was talking to Joel, Please look Joel'CA animation
<br />
which illustrates. But no problem keeping COBOL. For running
<br />
a UD any UM is good enough ...). 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does UD* relate to UD? Is it the complement, the conjugate, the inverse, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what?
</em><br />
<br />Yes I should have recall that. See above. It is just the trace of the UD.
<br />
A description of its execution. An infinite tree, or graphe, or set,
<br />
or cone, according to the representation you prefer.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In any case, the whole issue of restricting an implementation to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;particular cellular automaton in any dimensional configuration is abhorrent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to me. 
</em><br />
<br />A particular universal one which generates all executions in all
<br />
language. The choice of the universal system does not matter. Why not
<br />
a CA?  
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If finite inputs are considered any  automaton can be replaced with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;huge look up table. 
</em><br />
<br />Not those with growing memories. In particular not the universal
<br />
one.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And as any electrical engineer knows, any automaton,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Turing machine or computer can be implemented by circuits consisting solely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of  NAND gates (with additional initialization levels of 0 and 1.) That's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it. Just NAND gates. Pure logic. No three dimensional cones or any other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;kinds of cones.
</em><br />
<br />Yes but please give it as much rubber, space, virtual memory, etc,
<br />
as long it generated UD*.
<br />
<br />This is just a question of language. I was talking CA with Joel, because
<br />
he talks CA.
<br />
<br />Do you know the game of life. The fact that the game of life is
<br />
universal makes it (for me) a perfect way for talking on UD and UD*.
<br />
<br />The UD, in the game of life,  is a finite life pattern. 
<br />
And its trace is just the sequence
<br />
of evolution step put on top of each other. Of course the pattern
<br />
extends itself 3-dimensionaly (it generates all programs, and 
<br />
runs more and more executions).
<br />
<br />You stop it after one day. You get a truncated cone.
<br />
Two day, a bigger one. etc.
<br />
UD* is the infinite cone. It is just a representation. No problem
<br />
choosing nand circuits, quantum nor circuits, or cobol version x.
<br />
<br /><br />I hope this helps. Tell me.

<br /><br />===================== Question  7  &amp;  8 =================
<br />
from <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2992.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2992.html</a>
<br />
<br />Question 7: You are at Brussels (let us say), ready for a duplication WM.
<br />
Let us consider the two following 3-experiments/1-experiences:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
1) just the simple duplication WM, where the W and M reconstitutions are
<br />
made simultaneously.
<br />
2) A duplication WM where an arbitrary reconstitution delay is made at 
<br />
Moscow.
<br />
<br />Do you agree that again the two sets of 1-experiences remains unchanged
<br />
(from a 1-pov), although they are 3-different?
<br />
Put in another way, do you agree that if we quantify the WM 
<br />
1-indeterminacy
<br />
by a uniform probability distribution, then you should do the same for
<br />
the second experiment.
<br />
<br />That question is a mix of question 3 and question 5.
<br />
The following question is question 7 with a null delay.
<br />
<br /><br />Question 8: Let us consider the simple teleportation Sofia Brussels.
<br />
Except that now we don't destroy the original at Sofia. Or, if you prefer
<br />
we detroy it and rebuild at the same place in zero time.
<br />
Do you agree that in case P(W) = P(M) = 1/2 in the WM duplication then
<br />
P(S) = P(B) = 1/2 in the Sofia Brussels teleportation without destruction
<br />
of the original?
