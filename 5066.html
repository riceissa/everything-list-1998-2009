Hal, I follow your line of thought. It makes sense.
<br />
<br />Intelligent life is very complex. So making it more prevalent in a universe
<br />
would mean adding complexity to that universe, thereby reducing its measure.
<br />
<br />Still, one could apply a doomsday-like argument to say that if conditions
<br />
for intelligent life are so hard to get right, intelligent life should
<br />
arrive at a fairly late stage in the evolution of the universe, like late in
<br />
the stelliferous era. That does not appear to be the case in current
<br />
cosmologies, so perhaps a universe's likelihood should depend on more than
<br />
just ability to support intelligent life or simplicity.

Subject: Re: Peculiarities of our universe
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There has been a huge amount written about the Fermi Paradox (why are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there no aliens) over the years, and I don't want to reiterate that here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can come up with scenarios in which intelligent life is common but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where they just aren't visible, but IMO such explanations are not very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural.  Instead I propose that for the purpose of our discussion here,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we accept the apparent fact that there are no other intelligent life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forms within the visible universe.  Then let us consider the implications
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with regard to the All Universe Hypothesis (AUH), which says that all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This observation points to the fact that with our laws of physics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the evolution of intelligent life is extremely unlikely.  The question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is, why?  Not, why do our laws of physics make it hard for life to form,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but why do we live in a universe whose laws of physics have this property?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Presumably, there are universes whose laws make life essentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible.  For example, they may be completely static, or equally bad,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; utterly chaotic.  But on the other extreme, there must exist universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where intelligent life is common.  At a minimum, we could create a such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a universe in an ad hoc way by letting it be born full of intelligent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life via forced initial conditions.  And probably there are other laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of physics which would be much more congenial for the formation and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sustenance of intelligent life than our own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So we have some universes which are full of life, others which are devoid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of life, and others where there is a chance for life to form but it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relatively small.  We appear to live in the third class.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We talk about measure with regard to universes, and however it is defined,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it seems that some such principle is needed to allow some universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be more probable than others.  Otherwise we have our flying rabbit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paradox where the universe could suddenly stop being lawful, or could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have arbitrary exceptions to lawfulness.  Since there are more ways for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things to go wrong than to go right, these exception-full universes would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; superficially be more numerous than those where the laws are universal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So there must be some property of the universal-law universes which makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it more probable for us to experience them than the others, and this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basically what we mean by measure.  Universes with more measure somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; play a larger role in the multiverse and we are more likely to live in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one of them.  If universes with more consistent and uniform laws have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; greater measure, then this explains why we don't see exceptions like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flying rabbits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, it seems that the measure of a universe is not the only factor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which should determine how likely it is to be observed; but in addition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there should be a factor related to how many observers there are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The obvious case is for high-measure universes where observers are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible.  No one will observe such universes.  This is the basic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anthropic principle.  But I would extend this principle to say that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability of observing a universe is proportional to the product of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its intrinsic measure and some factor relating to the number of observers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in that universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are a few different ways this factor might work.  The simplest would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be to count the number of observers.  A universe with similar measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but twice as many observers would be twice as likely to be experienced.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another possibility would be to use observer-moments.  If two universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had the same number of observers, but in one they lived for twice as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long as the other, then perhaps the second one would be twice as likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be observed.  Yet another alternative would be to base the factor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the fraction of the universe's total resources incorporated into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers, rather than just the number of observers.  This would give a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bonus to universes which were relatively efficient at creating observers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compared to universes which gained large numbers of observers merely be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being inordinately large.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question of why we live in a sparsely populated universe, then,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comes down to a comparison between the measure of a typical universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with many observers versus the measure of a typical universe with few.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The former universes would get a large bonus factor for their many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers, while universes like ours don't have that.  So for our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations to be consistent with the AUH, it must be that universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like ours have much larger intrinsic measure than universes with many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers.  And since, as far as we can tell, our universe is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just sparsely populated, but extremely so, the measure differential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in these two classes of universes must be extremely large.  That is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (turning to the Schmidhuber interpretation) it must be much simpler
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to write a program that just barely allows for the possibility of life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than to write one which makes it easy.  This is a prediction of the AUH,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and evidence against it would be evidence against the AUH.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the face of it, this prediction doesn't seem too plausible to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, no one has ever written a program which evolves intelligent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life, so we don't really know.  But our initial explorations towards
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; artificial life seem to indicate that it's not particularly difficult
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to achieve model universes just swarming with tiny and unintelligent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; replicators.  Whether they could take the additional steps to become
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fully-fledged observers is an open question, one to which I suppose the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AUH would have to predict the answer is no.
