Russell Standish, &lt;R.Standish.domain.name.hidden&gt;, writes, quoting hal:
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If we agree with this argument, we can have both supervenience and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computationalism, it seems to me.  We agree that Maudlin's machine changes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the program which is instantiated, but we claim that the new program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is also conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Hal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nice try, but I think a brain in a resting state listening to music is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so much more complex in its processing of &quot;counterfactuals&quot; than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Olympia example. There must be a dividing line somewhere between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two examples - where the nonconcious entity crosses a threshold to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conciousness.			
</em><br />
<br />This is certainly possible, but the point is that my example shows
<br />
that the conclusion of Maudlin's paper is technically incorrect.  It is
<br />
possible to have both physical supervenience (where consciousness depends
<br />
on physical activity) and computationalistm (where consciousness depends
<br />
on instantiating one of a set of conscious programs).
<br />
<br />And further, I showed that it is plausible that for at least some cases,
<br />
pruning the counterfactual tree would not eliminate consciousness.
<br />
By that I mean, if you consider all possible inputs to the program as
<br />
producing a tree of possibilities (like the familiar many-worlds tree),
<br />
then when we eliminate some counterfactuals it is like pruning the tree
<br />
(eliminating some branches).  I argued that it seems unlikely that
<br />
literally any pruning of any remote part of the tree would eliminate
<br />
consciousness, hence it can tolerate some amount of pruning.
<br />
<br />As you say, it is possible that &quot;light pruning&quot; would leave consciousness
<br />
intact, while &quot;heavy pruning&quot; would eliminate it.  But why would
<br />
you say that?  What motivates your belief that heavy pruning of the
<br />
counterfactual tree eliminates consciousness?
<br />
<br />Our reason for believing that was, I believe, based on an error in
<br />
understanding Maudlin's argument.  We agreed that the TM was conscious
<br />
in virtue of running its program.  When the change in counterfactual
<br />
circumstances made it so that it was no longer running *that* program,
<br />
we fell into the mistake of believing that made it no longer conscious.
<br />
What we forgot was that there is more than one program that can make
<br />
a computer conscious.  Showing that a superficial change makes it stop
<br />
running one specific program does not imply, as Maudlin suggests, that
<br />
the change also makes it stop being conscious.
<br />
<br />So it seems to me we need a new argument for why the computer sans
<br />
counterfactuals should not be considered conscious.
<br />
<br />You suggest that heavy but not light pruning eliminates consciousness,
<br />
but this faces the problem that Chalmers calls &quot;fading qualia&quot;.  It's one
<br />
thing to believe in zombies, beings which act conscious but are not,
<br />
as in a heavily pruned counterfactual tree.  But it's hard when we
<br />
have a continuous range of cases, from light to heavy pruning, with
<br />
consciousness at one end and zombiehood (or at least unconsciousness)
<br />
at the other.  What happens in the intermediate cases?
<br />
<br />Either consciousness is lost gradually, with sensations becoming
<br />
less intense and fading away as we prune more deeply, or it is lost
<br />
suddenly, and we have a case where one additional &quot;snip&quot;, one additional
<br />
counterfactual possibility eliminated, eliminates consciousness.
<br />
<br />The first seems impossible because people never comment on their loss
<br />
of consciousness.  We have to wonder what it would be like to be &quot;only
<br />
a little bit conscious&quot; but to continue to behave normally.  If it is
<br />
possible to be in that state, how would it differ subjectively from
<br />
our present state?  And why would be unable to comment on the effects?
<br />
<br />The second seems unlikely, as one counterfactual possibility is much like
<br />
another, and with the tree so dense it is hard to imagine that pruning one
<br />
little possibility from the astronomically numerous branches could make
<br />
a difference.  Coming up with a theory of which programs are conscious
<br />
is going to be difficult, but creating one which has this behavior is
<br />
going to be nearly impossible, especially since there is no hint in
<br />
the behavior of the computer as to when its consciousness &quot;winks out&quot;.
<br />
Any theory of consciousness which assumes such phenomena had better have
<br />
a good reason for believing that pruning must eliminate consciousness
<br />
eventually, and I'd like to hear what such a reason might be.
<br />
<br />Hal
