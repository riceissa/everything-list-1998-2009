2009/7/17 Bruno Marchal &lt;marchal.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, this general approach seems to me to have striking resonances
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with metaphysics such as Bohm's notions of implication and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explication, as well as MWI.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You may develop. I like very much Bohm, because he is an honest inquirer. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appreciate him as a respectable adversary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To keep his materialist philosophy he honestly posit a non-comp assumption,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and he is not attracted at all by the MWI. But many of its intuition fit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nicely with the comp hyp, as we can see by taking computer science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seriously. Bohm, like many, has still a &quot;pre-Godelian&quot; conception of comp,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so to speak. Well I should perhaps reread him because I don't remember how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far he is a (weak) materialist.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I've been reading Bohm quite a bit recently, and he was indeed an
<br />
open minded and fearless thinker.  I don't think he's really even a
<br />
'weak' materialist.  At least, he insists on the inexhaustible
<br />
unknowability that lies behind his ideas of matter-energy-meaning, and
<br />
of course he was a close confidant of Krishnamurti for many years, and
<br />
had a strong appreciation of Vedanta.  I can't relate his ideas too
<br />
precisely to COMP, but just a couple of points perhaps:
<br />
<br />1) He proposes that the quantum potential is replete with subtle
<br />
information that guides the 'particle', but that only a single 'path'
<br />
becomes determinate, with the rest of the information becoming
<br />
'inactive' - though not disappearing.  This observation seems
<br />
explicable in terms of the 1-person plural view of 'physical
<br />
evolution' implied by COMP.  However, I assume you would say that a
<br />
'single universe' option would be ruled out in principle by COMP?
<br />
<br />2) An analogy he gives of the relation between implication,
<br />
explication and super-implication is that of a video game, in which
<br />
the implicate order is the program, which acts on the explicate order
<br />
of the screen 'objects' and is in turn acted on by the super-implicate
<br />
order of the player.  This seems to correspond to levels of recursion
<br />
entailed in the emergence of the 1-person and the intuition of
<br />
'substitution levels'.  Indeed Bohm's views don't set any limit
<br />
whatsoever on the levels of implication/explication that could extend
<br />
in any direction and to any degree beyond what is knowable.
<br />
<br />That's about as much as I can say at present.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I comment your post with an apology to Kim and Marty, then I make a comment

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kim, Marty, I apologize for my bad sense of humor. Rereading some post, I

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realize some nuance in the tone does not go through mailings. Please indulge

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;            I appreciated this post because I'm more interested in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical implications (which I'm hoping to find at the end of Bruno's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA bridge to Valhalla) of these goings-on  ...than in the mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones. Best,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Marty, I can understand you. At the same time, many discussion have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more philosophical, and the problem here, is that without some amount of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; math, and of computer science, things will look like a crackpot-like thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is almost in the nature of the subject. Big statements needs big
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguments, and at least enough precise pointers toward the real thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can have a still more passive understanding of the UDA, if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand the first sixth steps. Then for the seventh, it is enough to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe in the existence of universal dovetailer (itself a quasi direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consequence of the existence of a universal machine).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then the 8th step alone can help you to have an idea why the Universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dovetailer is immaterial, so that physics has to be reduced to math and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;machine psuchology/theology&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then, I will not been able to answer some remark which have been done by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis, Russell, Brent and some others, and which are relalted to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference between a computation (be it mathematical or physical)  and a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description of a computation (be it mathematical or physical), and this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the key for understanding that when we assume brain are digitalizable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually we have to abandon the idea that consciousness supervene on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical computations, and to accept that it supervenes on mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You know, the discovery of the universal machine is the real (creative) bomb
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here. I could say that &quot;nature&quot; has never stopped to invent it and reinvent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it, like with the apparition of brain, of life and the possible other many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; big bangs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then, it is hard to explain, without learning a bit on numbers, functions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sets and mathematical structures, that arithmetic, simple elementary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic, already describes that universal thing which can't help itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to reinvent hitself again and again and again, and this in an atemporal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aspatial frames.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sri Aurobindo made once a nice summary:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What, you ask, was the beginning of it all?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And it is this ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Existence that multiplied itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For sheer delight of being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And plunged into numberless trillions of forms

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So that it might

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With Bruno and his mighty handful engaged in the undodgeable (though
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constantly dodged) task
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well said!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of working towards an elementary grasp of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technical underpinnings of COMP, and patently lacking the fortitude of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these valorous Stakhanovites, I have been spending my time lurking,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reading and musing. My philosophical position on possible relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between computation and mind has long (well before this list) been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it would indeed require something like Bruno's reversal of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'normal' relationship between computation and physics, so that mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could emerge in some at least comprehensible manner; certainly not -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; per impossibile - in the ghostly shrouds of the 'deus ex machina' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'computational materialism'. Consequently, parallel to the strenuous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effort ongoing in the other thread, I have been wrapping my mind more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; loosely around 'interpretations of COMP-mechanics' in order to attempt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a better personal grasp of what it might mean as a metaphysics. As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always, I need help, so here goes for starters.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This points to another problem I have. The UDA, and probably even more the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AUDA, has deeply changed my &quot;philosophy&quot;, up to a point where I think that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophy and metaphysics can be handled with the doubting attitude of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (ideal) scientist, and that this attitude is a vaccine against the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inhuman aspect of &quot;human science&quot;. But then I have reason to suggest that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything becomes far more clearer if we drop the expression &quot;fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science&quot;, philosophy&quot;, &quot;metaphysics&quot; (unless we use them in their original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; greek senses) and come back to the expression &quot;theology&quot;. If you want,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assuming comp, metaphysics becomes a theology, with its communicable and non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicable parts. Assuming comp we can already listen to the course on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine theology provided by the machines.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then I know that I look over-provocative.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At the same time, I feel that this is important, because, I don't see how we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could ever win the war against authoritative arguments and fundamentalism of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all kinds without bringing back modesty (that is science) in that field.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When you grasp comp, you can understand that those scientist who pretend not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doing theology are those who take Aristotle theology for granted. (Actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even a simplification of Aristotle. Aristotle was more Platonist than we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; usually imagine).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno has sometimes remarked (if I'm not misrepresenting him) that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP introduces us to machines and their dreams and I find this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphor very cogent and suggestive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You don't misrepresent me ... too much. Just that dreams is no more really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use as a metaphor, but as a literal thing. It is a point of using digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanism, and assuming it clearly, and not just a vague mechanist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuition, which is already at play in all rationalist approach to inquiry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If someone accept an artificial heart, he/she does not got a metaphor in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his/her thorax. It is the same for an artificial brain, and eventually for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purely arithmetical one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Certainly it seems to me that my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present state could coherently be characterised as a peculiarly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent dream - one that I nonetheless assume to be correlated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systematically with features of some otherwise unreachable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'elsewhere'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you are a critical realist. A &quot;believer&quot; in the large open minded sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nice.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The key lesson of UDA here is that, although you are right to bet that your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present state belongs to a consistent dream, the 'truth' (a theorem in comp)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that there is an infinity of consistent dreams matching your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations, and there is a sense in which you (first person you) actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belong to an infinity of them. It is the many dreams aspect of the comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory, partially confirmed by the quantum empirical MW observations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In COMP, the 'mechanism and language of dreams' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; posited to be those elements of the number realm and its operators
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that are deemed necessary to instantiate a 'universal TM' (i.e. one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that - assuming CT to be true - is capable of computing any computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function). Given this point of departure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well the point of departure is really that I can survive with an artificial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;physical&quot; brain. And the result is that &quot;physical&quot; can no more be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primitive notion, and that the physical appearance has to be explained from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the numbers, and indeed from their relative self-reference modalities. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads to the arithmetical 'hypostases'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it follows that machines so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiated would be capable of implementing any computable 'dream'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatsoever - including dreams instantiating yet further levels of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines and their dreams. With an additional dovetailing assumption,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we find ourselves in a position to construct a sort of hyper-threaded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; layer-cake of dreaming where, from any arbitrary level, recursively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nested dreams disappear towards infinity both 'upwards' and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'downwards'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All right. Except that the dovetailing is not an additional assumption. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dovetailing is already there, like the primes numbers are already there,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once you posit the sixth first axioms of (Robinson) arithmetic. Sorry for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being technical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As we 'drill down' into this gateau, we are looking for emergent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; patterns of invariance representing the self-referential viewpoints of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; layers of 'dreaming machines' - their experience and their 'external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is good idea to put 'external reality' in quote. It is a very ambiguous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion. It can be the simple pure third person provable relations among the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers, like it can be the first person plural emerging appearance of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse(s).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And it can be something in between, all that can depend, or not, of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitution level, and of the meaning &quot;we&quot; can give to words &quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously we do share a long and rich history.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The lowest level of recursion that any particular system of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dreaming requires for its instantiation is taken to constitute its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'substitution level'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess that I agree with what you want to mean, but I would have said &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; highest level&quot; level required, in the sense that there is no lowest level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In case of doubt, the doctor can always bet on a lowest level of comp, just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to diminish the probability that his patient become a zombie. Of course in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practice this will cost more money.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since which layer of the cake this corresponds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to must be unknowable from the viewpoint of any level we currently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occupy, we ineluctably take a gamble if we say 'yes' to any doctor who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claims to know what he's about. BTW, on this topic, I would refer you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to an interesting analogy that I append as a footnote below.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, what can we take 'reality' (i.e. real, as you will recall, &quot;in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense that I am real&quot;) to mean in this schema? We cannot know, but we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do want to say that it corresponds self-referentially - in some sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - to the number realm, and that the true language of the dreaming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines therefore corresponds - also in some self-referential sense -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to numbers and their inter-relations. This 'sense of correspondence'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be defined in two ways: 'truth', which is taken to correspond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-referentially to the unknowably 'real', and 'provability', which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is taken to correspond to what this reality can consistently claim,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; express, or represent to itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Good summary!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is about as far as I've got, and broad as it is, it seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point more or less in the direction of a detailed research programme
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such as Bruno has outlined.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, here I disagree in the probably looking immodest claim of mine that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the research has already be done up to the sad point that now, only math and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics remains. My initial goal, unless mistakes (fatal or not) has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attained: now we know that the &quot;comp theology&quot; is science, in the Popper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense that the &quot;comp theology&quot; has been shown refutable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What would be nice is that the Z1* logics leads to new quantum tautologies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so that the digital quantum nature can be tested against the quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirical one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can see that stipulations on 'reality'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such as universal computability make implicit claims that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirically falsifiable in principle, which is most encouraging.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is CT, and you are correct, that part of comp is also refutable. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this we already have good reason to believe that nature will not, and cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really refute it, unless quantum mechanics is wrong in the large proportion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, I believe that Church thesis can be proved in higher order logic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but this is a point I prefer to range out of the topic, because it is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; essential, and it can lead to confusions (and it needs even bigger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; familiarity with mathematical computer science).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The yes doctor is highly more doubtable, and the main goal consisted in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; showing that it leads to a refutable 'theology'. Indeed, like in Plotinus,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both the sharable and non sharable part of physics is completely determined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by that &quot;theology&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, this general approach seems to me to have striking resonances
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with metaphysics such as Bohm's notions of implication and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explication, as well as MWI.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You may develop. I like very much Bohm, because he is an honest inquirer. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appreciate him as a respectable adversary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To keep his materialist philosophy he honestly posit a non-comp assumption,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and he is not attracted at all by the MWI. But many of its intuition fit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nicely with the comp hyp, as we can see by taking computer science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seriously. Bohm, like many, has still a &quot;pre-Godelian&quot; conception of comp,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so to speak. Well I should perhaps reread him because I don't remember how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far he is a (weak) materialist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway - Bruno, I would be grateful as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ever - when you have a moment - if you would tell me which end of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong stick I've got hold of this time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Very nice post, David. The only general but key point where I would like to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; add precision, if not insistence, is that &quot;metaphor&quot; thing. Einstein would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not have been glad if people told him that energy is a good metaphor for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter, when all his work consists in a coherent theory (= clear refutable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption) where the relations between matter and energy are described by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; testable/refutable facts. The whole point of saying yes to the doctor, qua
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computatio, is for helping the understanding that the comp assumption is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphorical and that it leads to a theory which implies the reversal that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are most correctly intuiting.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are correct about truth and provability. You may have insisted a bit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more on the first person/third person important , and still unsolved, to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure, relationship, and the first person indeterminacy which follows. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly motivate me to explain better AUDA and its relation with UDA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am glad that Marty enjoy your post. At the same time, the point of my work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; did consist in making this utterly clear (if not shocking for those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Aristotelian fundamentalist). Clarity in an hot field has to be technical or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it looks too much provocative.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for this very clear post. You have a good intuition of the ultimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consequences of the comp hyp, I think.
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One day a group of scientists got together and decided that man had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; come a long way and no longer needed God. So they picked one scientist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to go and tell Him that they were done with Him. The scientist walked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up to God and said, &quot;God, we've decided that we no longer need you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We're to the point that we can clone people and do many miraculous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things, so why don't you just go on and get lost.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God listened very patiently and kindly to the man and after the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientist was done talking, God said, &quot;Very well, how about this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; let's say we have a man making contest.&quot; To which the scientist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; replied, &quot;OK, great!&quot; But God added, &quot;Now, we're going to do this just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like I did back in the old days with Adam.&quot; The scientist said, &quot;Sure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no problem&quot; and bent down and grabbed himself a handful of dirt. God
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just looked at him and said, &quot;No, no, no. You go get your own dirt!&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cute simple story illustrating a key point that most forget.
