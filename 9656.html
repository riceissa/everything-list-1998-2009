<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have cut out some of your detailed response to my post where I think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we basically agree.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Good idea. Of course it will looks like I disagree with all what you 
<br />
say, but just remember we are concentrating on those points where we 
<br />
disagree, or where we misunderstand each other. A case will be made 
<br />
that it could be a question of vocabulary, but perhaps also I am nearer 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to Lee Corbin on those points; we will see.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There remain some differences, and some failings on my part to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand more technical aspects of your work.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, sharing the memory is *not* the same as having the original 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience, but this applies to recalling one's own past as well.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Are you really sure? When two people share memories, they can only 
<br />
share third person information, which will trigger their respective 
<br />
unsharable first person identities/memories.
<br />
When recollecting our own memories, we do recollect (approximations) of 
<br />
our unsharable first person memories, which *does*, in the present, 
<br />
participate into our present first person identity.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You may argue that recalling our past is different because we have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just the right brain structure, other associated memories and so on to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; put it all in context, but in principle all of these might be lacking 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; due to illness or the passage of time, or might be duplicated in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very good simulation made for someone else to experience.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. Note that from a first person memory POV, perfect quasi memories 
<br />
are not distinguishable from &quot;real memories&quot; (if that means anythings: 
<br />
assuming comp &quot;real&quot; memories and artificial quasi memories are just 
<br />
equivalent).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The only way to unambiguously define a first person experience is to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make it once only; perfect recollection would be indistinguishable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the original experience, and it would be impossible for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiencer to either know that he was recalling a memory or to know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how close to the original the recollection was.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The postulate of a first person entity persisting through time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; violates the 1st person/ 3rd person distinction,
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure, although it makes sense, but only because eventually it 
<br />
is the whole idea of objective time which is &quot;illusory&quot;. Subjective 
<br />
time, I would say, cannot be illusory, nor can subjective pain be.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; since it assumes that I-now can have 1st person knowledge of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I-yesterday or I-tomorrow, when in fact such knowledge is impossible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; except in a 3rd person way.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I disagree. I do have a first person account of I-yesterday, and some 
<br />
first person feelings about possible first person feelings of myself 
<br />
tomorrow, all of which are non describable in any third person way. 
<br />
Again we could be in agreement here. If you want I have no doubt about 
<br />
my &quot;I-yesterday&quot;, even if I don't believe at all in some absolute third 
<br />
person describable notion of &quot;yesterday&quot;. But I do &quot;feel&quot; I-yesterday: 
<br />
I cannot separate it from &quot;I-now&quot; and &quot;I-tomorrow&quot;. This is completely 
<br />
independent of the fact that I may well die in a second.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I believe it is this confusion which leads to the apparent anomaly of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1st person indeterminacy in the face of 3rd person determinacy in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplication experiments.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't see any anomaly, to be sure. Only weirdness, relative to 
<br />
probable prejudices.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us assume as little as possible and make our theories as simple as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible. I *have* to accept that there is something special about my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences at the moment which distinguish them from everyone else's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences: this is the difference between the 1st person POV and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3rd person POV.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, but just remember that in the UDA thought experiment, the first 
<br />
person is almost defined by the content of a personal diary/memory. And 
<br />
what makes those experiences personal here is that they are destroyed 
<br />
together with the body during destructive teleportation or duplication. 
<br />
But the memories refers, in the present, to subjective (first person) 
<br />
past and future. We cannot have illusions about that, only about third 
<br />
person extrapolation *from* that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is tempting to say that my 1st person POV extends into the future 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the past as well, explaining why I think of myself as a person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persisting through time.
</em><br />
<br />I would say it is in the nature of the first person to persist in 
<br />
*subjective* time. I have more problem with (naive?) notion of time and 
<br />
space. So again I would agree it is an &quot;illusion&quot; that &quot;1-I&quot; persists 
<br />
through some notion of 3-time and 3-space, but somehow the first person 
<br />
is inextricably linked to a notion of 1-time and 1-space. The illusion 
<br />
would consist in believing in a sort of describable existence of myself 
<br />
in some describable notion of absolute space-time.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, this latter hypothesis is unnecessary. It is enough to say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the 1st person POV is valid only in the present,
</em><br />
<br /><br />But what could that means? Which present? Certainly a lasting present: 
<br />
it is part of my first person identity that I feel a sort of 
<br />
&quot;continuous&quot; time, which gives sense to all my first person willingness 
<br />
to to do anything. When I do a cup of coffee, I strongly believe that I 
<br />
will drink and taste that very coffee: it is part of &quot;me-doing coffee&quot;. 
<br />
I would have the feeling to lie to myself taking this as an illusion, 
<br />
again independently of the fact that I will &quot;really&quot; (in case that 
<br />
means something) drink and taste that coffee.
<br />
I still think I agree with you, or that I understand what you say, but 
<br />
in general what you call &quot;illusory&quot; is for me just living &quot;imagery&quot; 
<br />
(just *hopefully* well founded). Only third person extrapolations can 
<br />
be considered as being &quot;really illusionary&quot;, but then, this just means 
<br />
&quot;false and hopefully third person refutable&quot;. Then it is science 
<br />
(meaning doubts,  a-la Descartes/Popper).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and when I consider my future and past that is only 3rd person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extrapolation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree if you mean by &quot;future&quot; and &quot;past&quot; 3-future and 3-past. 1-past 
<br />
and 1-future is not extrapolation thy are feelings continuously lived 
<br />
in a lasting present. I can no more doubt of my feeling of past than I 
<br />
can doubt of a headache (say). Even if time by itself does not exist at 
<br />
all (which is the case with comp). The extrapolation would reside only 
<br />
in some third person projection of that time, space, ... (I think we 
<br />
agree, the problem could just be the term &quot;illusion&quot;).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I consider myself to be as a person is then explained as the set 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of 1st person experiences related in a particular way,
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. the word &quot;related&quot; is quite important here. One of the goal is to 
<br />
isolate that relation. Technically this is done by finding the (modal) 
<br />
logic of the (comp) first person and studying its Kripke or more 
<br />
general &quot;multiverse&quot; structure.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; such as believing themselves to be moments in the life of a single 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual, having memories or quasi-memories in common, and so on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I split into two that presents no problem for the 3rd person POV 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (there are two instantiations of Stathis extant where before there was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one) nor for the 1st person POV (each instantiation knows it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiencing what it is experiencing as it is experiencing it).
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  A problem does arise when I anticipate the split (which one will I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; become?) or look back at the split (*I* was the original!); there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no correct answer in these cases because it is based on 3rd person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extrapolation of the 1st person POV, which in addition to its other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; failings assumes only a single entity can be extant at any one time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (only a single 1st person exists by definition, but multiple 3rd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persons can exist at the one time).
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is a little weird. You say there is no correct answer, and then 
<br />
you give the comp-correct answer.
<br />
The first person is indeed just NOT first person-duplicable (unless 
<br />
some added artificial telepathic trick, but in genral I talk only on 
<br />
the usual simple teleportation or duplication).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not to say that my mind can or should overcome [Lee Corbin 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disagrees on the &quot;should&quot;] the deeply ingrained belief or illusion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I am a unique, one-track individual living my life from start to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finish,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here you really talk about the third person extrapolation, so I agree 
<br />
with you. But the first person is not deceive by its feeling of living 
<br />
uniquely in time and space. It could be dangerous to say so, because it 
<br />
leads to (materialism) eliminativism which eventually conclude that the 
<br />
whole first person thing is an illusion. This leads to a deeply wrong 
<br />
sense of &quot;human&quot;-irresponsibility. Well, it is a negation of the first 
<br />
person. I can be sure it is wrong, as I bet you can too.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is why in symmetrical duplication experiments I anticipate that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will become one of the duplicates with equal probability.
</em><br />
<br /><br />So you follow at least the UDA up to the third step included.
<br />
(For possible others we refer to the eight steps presentation of UDA 
<br />
summarized in the following slide (just one page PDF) and paper:
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.pdf</a>
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.htm">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.htm</a>
<br />
(The paper is available in pdf too:
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004Slide.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004Slide.pdf</a>)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In asymmetrical duplication experiments with partial memory loss or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; merging, it becomes very difficult to know what to expect.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK but the fourth step of UDA is just asymmetrical duplication without 
<br />
memory loss.
<br />
I don't count the destruction of the original+its personal diary as a 
<br />
memory loss, giving that the memory is thoroughly conserved in the 
<br />
reconstitution (by the hypothesis + default assumptions on the 
<br />
rightness of the substitution level and the reliability of the doctor's 
<br />
work, etc.)
<br />
What about that?
<br />
Oh.  I see you answer this below ...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; All right then. Except that I am not sure I really agree with the idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that the persisting &quot;I&quot;  is an illusion. Here, it is hard for me not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; taking account of the main UDA conclusion: the reversal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physics/bio/compscience/theology/numbers. So let me tell you what I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; believe, accepting comp and the UDA reasoning: The persisting &quot;I&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not an illusion, or is less an illusion than its body or time itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What could also be an illusion is the feeling that &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot; are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; absolutely different, when the difference is only relative.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; See above. Perhaps &quot;illusion&quot; is not the right word. Is a motion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; picture an illusion? It is a series of still pictures presented in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular way giving the effect of motion from the POV of a human 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer; better to be descriptive than use words like illusion and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delusion.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. &quot;illusion&quot; is a dangerous word, especially with comp. &quot;Illusion&quot; 
<br />
is the first person basic bread, and are real from its/her point of 
<br />
view. The first person error (the real illusion) consists in its third 
<br />
person extrapolation, from the movie or even from &quot;real life&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some of the above is very much tied up with the way we use language, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like the difference between saying there is motion on the screen or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is only the illusion of motion on the screen.
</em><br />
<br /><br />There is no 3-motion, but there is 1-motion. The first person really 
<br />
perceives motion, it cannot even doubt it intellectually, even if she 
<br />
believes there is no 3-motion at all here.
<br />
With comp, it will be highly undecidable that there is anything more 
<br />
than numbers and their relations so that even &quot;physical motion&quot;, even 
<br />
though possible first person *plural* sharable one, is &quot;illusionnary&quot; 
<br />
or let us say 3rd extrapolate. In that setting I use often the word 
<br />
&quot;dream&quot; but it convey also that &quot;wrong&quot; aspect of the word &quot;illusion&quot;. 
<br />
The whole point is that comp forces those illusions/dreams to obey to 
<br />
non trivial mathematical laws making them overlapping, glueing, etc. 
<br />
The physical realities (should) emerge from that (UDA's last 
<br />
conclusion).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I falter at step 7 of the UDA as given in your 2004 SANE paper, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; especially from the point after &quot;We are almost done...&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Perhaps you have not enough appreciate the importance of the invariance 
<br />
of the first person experience when reconstitution delays are added. It 
<br />
did help people to explicitly recall the delays in the drawing 5), 6) 
<br />
7) (and 8)).
<br />
Unless I am deadly missing something, it seems to me that what follows 
<br />
&quot;We are almost done ...&quot; can easily (?) be deduced from the six first 
<br />
steps. My experience with people who got problems in the seventh step 
<br />
is that they don't have really appreciate step 5).
<br />
It would help me if you could tell precisely where is the problem at 
<br />
the end of step 7; so let me quote it:
<br />
<br /><br />&lt;&lt;We are almost done. Indeed, let us try a simple physical experiment 
<br />
like dropping a pen. With comp, when we are in the state of going to 
<br />
drop the pen, we are in a Turing emulable state.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br /><br />All right? This follows directly from the comp hyp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&lt;&lt;Our more probable consistent extension is undetermined by the 1-comp 
<br />
indeterminacy on all the reconstitution of that similar states 
<br />
appearing in UD* (the infinite trace of the UD).
<br />
<br /><br />All right? This follows from the definition of the UD. And the UD 
<br />
exists once we assume Church Thesis, and UD* (the trace of the UD) 
<br />
exists thanks to Arithmetical realsim. Rememeber I defiune comp by 
<br />
mainly CT and AR (+ the &quot;yes doctor&quot;).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />This follows from 6, and the invariance of the uncertainty measure, 
<br />
notably for the arbitrary delay---including the null one, and the 
<br />
infinite set of states appearing with a arbitrarily large delay in the 
<br />
running of the UD[14]. This gives a huge set. &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br /><br />All right? You almost just said exactly this in your today's 
<br />
(29/june/2006) message to Brent Meeker.
<br />
And from this you can already conclude that comp entails a reversal 
<br />
between physics and computer science/number theory. The next sentences 
<br />
are there just for making easier the interface with the mathematical 
<br />
interview of the lobian machine, which is needed only to make explicit 
<br />
the manner we have to follow for extracting physics from computer 
<br />
science.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&lt;&lt;It can be argued that finite computations are of measure null, and 
<br />
that the only way to a measure on the states will consist in finding a 
<br />
measure on the set of maximally complete computational history going 
<br />
through those states, with obviously a rather hard to define 
<br />
equivalence relation among computations. Still, we can show that those 
<br />
(infinite) computations, as seen from some third person description of 
<br />
UD*, correspond to maximally consistent extensions of our (hopefully) 
<br />
actual consistent states. It is not necessary to be more precise here, 
<br />
giving the non constructivism of the collection of those consistent 
<br />
extensions, and the fact that we will make things utterly precise, by 
<br />
directly interviewing a universal machine on those extensions, and this 
<br />
by taking into account the 1/3 person point of view distinction. So, if 
<br />
we grant a sufficiently robust universe, we are completely done: 
<br />
physics, as the correct science for the concrete relative predictions 
<br />
must be given by some measure on our consistent relative states. 
<br />
Physics is, in principle reduced to a measure on the collection of 
<br />
computational histories, as seen from some first person point of views. 
<br />
We can say that in principle, physics has been reduced to computer 
<br />
fundamental psychology. &gt;&gt;
