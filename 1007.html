JH says:
<br />
&quot;I think we would live our lives differently if we believed MWI.
<br />
Firstly, our
<br />
philosopy would be more 'Buddhist' as described in
<br />
<a href="http://www.higgo.com/quantum/buddhism.htm">http://www.higgo.com/quantum/buddhism.htm</a>.&quot;
<br />
<br />I could not possibly disagree with anything more than this.
<br />
<br />What MWI tells us is that reality is WHOLLY OBJECTIVE, and rigorously
<br />
deterministic.  That some events appear probabilistic is a consequence
<br />
of the fact that we are embedded within the universal wave function and
<br />
not standing &quot;outside&quot; of it at some Archimedean point.
<br />
<br />Subjectivity has nothing to do with MWI, or any other interpretation of
<br />
QM for that matter.  It has to do with the way the brain operates, and
<br />
right now we don't have much in the way of understanding.  Given the
<br />
size and characteristic timescale of its functional components (neurons
<br />
and subcellular mechanisms within neurons), we can see with
<br />
near-certainty that the brains is basically a classical mechanism. 
<br />
Exactly how consciousness is generated is not known, and until we have
<br />
an experimental basis for talk about this, due modesty is required in
<br />
speculating.  At least people like Gerald Edelman, Francis Crick,
<br />
Christof Koch, the Churchlands, etc. are trying to create the
<br />
experimental base.  Sating that consciousness is computational may seem
<br />
lie the only possibility right now, but someone living in Athens in the
<br />
4th century B.C. might have thought that Aristotle's then-current ideas
<br />
on physics were the only possible ones.  Talk without experimental facts
<br />
is cheap.
<br />
<br />I am forever puzzled why people try to create mysticism out of QM. 
<br />
There is nothing whatever mystical about it.  Why didn't people a couple
<br />
of centuries ago try to do the same thing with Newtonian mechanics,
<br />
saying that action at a distance implied a mysterious unity of the
<br />
cosmos, confirming ancient religious insights?  Were they just more
<br />
sensible?
<br />
<br />Decision theory FOR AN EFFECTIVELY CLASSICAL OBJECT like a human being
<br />
has nothing whatever to do with MWI.  Why should you care any more about
<br />
your counterparts in other &quot;branches&quot; of the wave function than you do
<br />
about anyone in the ordinary quasi-classical world?  Even thinking this
<br />
way smacks of a not-so-hidden egalitarianism, and reminds me very much
<br />
of the arguments in John Rawls' crackpot boo &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;
<br />
(Harvard, 1971).  Just as with James Higgo's proposal, Rawls preaches
<br />
EXPLICIT and DELIBERATE economic inefficiency in the name of some
<br />
ill-defined &quot;fairness.&quot;
<br />
<br />JH says:
<br />
&quot;A full, deep understanding of physics is equivalent in some ways to the
<br />
Buddhist concept of enlightenment. The idea of
<br />
self is relinquished. The very fabric of reality is seen to be
<br />
subjective. The absurdity of attachments becomes clear.&quot;
<br />
<br />I say:
<br />
(a) the Buddhist concept of enlightenment is like mindlessness
<br />
(b) a full, deep understanding of physics is QUANTITATIVE and can be
<br />
used to manipulate the world to your benefit; to create incredible and
<br />
marvelous technologies, whereas the Buddhist concept of enlightenment is
<br />
mostly empty words and mere mumbo-jumbo, impotent to reshape matter
<br />
(c) the idea of your &quot;self&quot; is the basic data of existence you have--if
<br />
you relinquish it partially, you become what we call crazy
<br />
(i.e.,psychotic) , and if you relinquish it completely, you become
<br />
effectively dead
<br />
(d) The absurdity of NOT having attachments becomes clear when you think
<br />
about economics, which is the relevant subject area here.  Attachments,
<br />
and the desire for more things, drive people to achievement.  That's the
<br />
economic basis of civilization.
<br />
<br />Buddhism, like Christianity (and all traditional religions), has done
<br />
nothing in its long history besides acting as an anesthetic. 
<br />
Science--hard knowledge of objective reality--is the only thing that
<br />
counts.
