The scientist could prove that he is not alone by invoking the principle 
<br />
of sufficient reason: nothing is arbitrary and exist with no reason. If 
<br />
something exists in a particular arbitrary way (himself) with no reason 
<br />
for him to be in that particular way, then all other alternatives of him 
<br />
must also exist (the Plenitude). Hence he is not alone. Solipsism is dead.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-------------------------------------------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am a solipsist scientist in that I accept that my mind, which is producing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the dialogue you now read, is the one and only conclusively proven mind and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possibly the only mind. My mind is an image in a kind of mirror; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;phenomenal mirror. The image I see and feel and smell and taste is all I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have to enact my craft, my science. Modern neuroscience shows me my brain in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the act of being a mirror for me. The image is what philosophy calls my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;phenomenal consciousness or my phenomenality. I can experiment on my own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;phenomenality say, by closing my eyes, which I note has a dramatic effect on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my ability to do science. When I sleep dreamlessly my phenomenality is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;absent and when I awake the apparent external world in my mirror is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consistently behaving as if it recently had me asleep in it. Yet, as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;solipsist I am forced to question the actual existence of what is depicted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in my mirror. It is only an image, after all, and images can be fabricated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As a solipsist I attribute this apparent external world depicted within my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mirror to be the work of the 'magical fabricator'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;At the same time I must find it remarkable that my phenomenality somehow,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;via the mysterious solution to the 'hard problem', appears to intimately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;connect me to an external world. I know that my sensory data (nerve signals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from the peripheral nervous system that have no innate phenomenality) are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;used by my apparent brain to create my phenomenality. As a scientist my job
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is to extract and depict regularity in the appearances within my phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mirror's image as scientifically justified beliefs in the form of useful,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;predictive generalisations. I know that when I do science what I am doing is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;correlating the appearances of the contents of my phenomenality. The most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;obvious evidence of this in any of my scientific papers is that of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'test' subject in contrast to the 'control' subject. In the case of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Newtonian dynamics I would be correlating the behaviour of a mass and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;space it inhabits. All of this makes very good sense to me. Yet I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;troubled.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Within my mirror's image are what appear to be other scientists with brains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that look the same as mine. These scientists are merely fabrications in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;own mirror's image. Yet despite being mere fabrications they appear, to me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to do science on exquisitely novel things just as well as I do using my real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mind. At the same time I cannot see the image in their mirror and vice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;versa. All report seeing only brain material. I take this as lending support
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to my solipsism in that I can claim their minds not to exist, which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consistent with my conviction that the external world does not exist. If I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;am right, and my image(mind) is the only image(mind), then their science is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;done without any image of their own. The 'magical fabricator' of my image
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;goes to an amazing amount of trouble to make it appear 'as-if' the external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world shown to me in my mirror does exist. The scientists within it behave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'as-if' they had the kind of mind I know I must have to do science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To be a solipsist scientist in this circumstance is to live in cooperation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with this extravagant fabrication including apparent scientists as adept as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;myself. As a solipsist scientist, inwardly and silently I deny (remain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scientifically unable to confirm) that an external world exists. But as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scientist within this apparent world I am fundamentally conflicted. To be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consistent with the behaviour of all the other scientists, outwardly I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;forced to act 'as-if' there was an external reality. Also, inwardly I know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my mind is the only proven reality, yet to my scientist colleagues, to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;remain consistent I must deny my own mind as much as I deny theirs. I live
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in this situation of denial that I have something more than my colleagues
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have. I am thus doubly conflicted, for I must also act 'as-if' I have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mind, for to declare otherwise is to be inconsistent with my claims about my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scientist colleagues, to whom I am identical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yet despite this odd personal situation the system works, in a way. My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scientist colleagues continue to act as-if they had minds. Their scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lives - our lives - of appearance correlation go on as usual. The whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system is consistent. I, the solipsist, get to inwardly claim my own mind's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;existence and deny an external world. Outwardly I act 'as-if' there is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;external reality and deny my own mind and my colleagues'. They get to act
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exactly like I do. All along I know that it is actually the work of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;magical fabricator, a belief I must also withhold to maintain appearances to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my science colleagues, since within this fabricated world such a claim would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be rejected on the grounds of empirical parsimony. My savior is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'objectivity'. As scientists we get to agree what appearances we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;describing and in doing so it is 'as-if' we are accessing an external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality. The method is so successful scientists have a belief in an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'objective view' of the external world shared by all of them. The icing on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the solipsist's cake is that the inconsistency even works in the rather odd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-referential boundary condition of the science of mind where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scientific evidence system is pointed at the scientific evidence system to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do science. This unique science has taken the form of the Neural Correlates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of Consciousness. Scientists can correlate appearances of brain material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with hearsay reports of mirror image contents - phenomenal contents - quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;successfully and it has all the hallmarks of providing knowledge of the mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in exactly the same way as it has provided knowledge of everything else.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Provided the scientists go on acting as if this technique is delivering an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explanation of 'mind' (that I outwardly deny exists), then even in the face
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the obviously anomalous evidentiary paradox (looking for appearances and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instead finding brain material) the system self-perpetuates. The scientists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even invented a theorem called the 'mind-brain identity theorem' to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sure nobody went so far as to intuit anything like a magical fabricator or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;its proxy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This I know is all just 'as-if' behaviour but if I stay quiet about it the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whole system works. My internal life thus masked, the whole system gets to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;behave outwardly consistently. The only inconsistency is me and my unique
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mind. Late at night in the quietude I wonder about my mind. How do I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reconcile my solipsistic internal life as a scientist with my outward
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;behaviour? On reflection I can see there are two choices. Firstly (a) I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;accept my mind as conclusive proof supporting continued fervent adherence to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the belief in a magical fabricator. Alternatively, (b) I can let a real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;external world be responsible for my phenomenal mirror and all the contents
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it shows me. What would my life as a scientist be like if the laughably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implausible option (b) were real? As a scientist I would, in effect, be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;talking about mirrors, not images within them. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the case (b) world I would still lead a dual life as a scientist. On one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hand I can happily correlate the appearances within mirror images and do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;science like it has always been done. Nothing is wrong with it. After all it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is responsible for all the apparent technology we have. On the other hand I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also get to describe the external world in a completely different way. I get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to describe systems capable of creating what functions as mirrors, and not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only that, systems that appear to behave as they do when viewed with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mirrors it makes. I realise this is an extraordinarily constrained problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There simply cannot be many systems that can do all of this. If we could do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this kind of science then  'images in the mirror' act as support for both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;types of description - the description of image behaviour and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;description of systems that can make mirrors that appear like brains to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mirror. Whatever that system is, it is capable of construction of things in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the external world with appearances we observe as such as atoms, elephants
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and scientists and their phenomenal mirrors. In this alternative world my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mind is effective proof of the existence of an underlying reality. I no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;longer have to pretend. I can lead an outwardly honest dual life as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scientist within a world of scientists with minds like me. The magical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fabricator has been replaced by an external world. Not the external world of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appearances, but an underlying external world capable of generating mirrors
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with appearances that depict the natural world as it does to us. In this new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world of science seeing is evidence of mind and thus an underlying external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world. In contrast, that which is seen is empirical evidence of the behaving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;external world and also is evidence of seeing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If I am right to be a solipsist I live in the universe of the magical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fabricator forced to play a pretend life 'as-if' there is a real external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world with fictitious scientific colleagues, all doing the same thing. If I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;am wrong to be a solipsist and the external world is justified (which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scientists paradoxically behave 'is-if' true already), then all scientists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in that world, behaving 'as-if' there was an external world are actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also tacit solipsists in denial of all minds, just like me. So as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scientist I face a dilemma. I look around myself and what do I see universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evidence of? The world I live in is a case (a) world. No scientist anywhere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has, for any reason other than accidentally, ever looked at systems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;producing worlds with scientists in them complete with minds in it, built of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it. Indeed when they do the scientific world snaps back, declares the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;attempt irrelevant metaphysics consistent with an outward denial of mind. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this bizarre world of 'objective' scientists outwardly all acting 'as-if' an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;external world exists, all scientists are actually virtual solipsists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;outwardly acting 'as-if' there is no such thing as mind whilst being totally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reliant on their phenomenality to do science. And, like me, they are in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;effective (methodological) denial of their own mind, tacitly affirming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;belief in a magical fabricator. Scientists in this state will go on forever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;correlating appearances within their denied mirrors and never get to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;science on mirrors. Which one to choose? Perhaps I'll go where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fictitious money is. to the land of the virtual magical fabricator. and keep
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quiet.
