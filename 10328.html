</em><br />
<br />I had an interesting exchange with Julian Barbour about this a while
<br />
back. Originally I was convinced he was wrong that a time capsule was
<br />
sufficient to produce the subjective experience of the passage of time.
<br />
I called it a 'sleight of intuition' because all the time-related words
<br />
we use simply *assume* such a passage and hence slip this sense in by
<br />
the back door. He said a lot of people agreed with me, but his static
<br />
concept of Platonia meant he was committed to his view actually being
<br />
the case, without further arguments.
<br />
<br />However, I've changed my original view. I think the fact we don't
<br />
experience consciousness 'smeared' or 'overlaid' over the 4th dimension
<br />
is a function of memory, which delimits what information is available
<br />
to be made conscious at any given point. This source of information is
<br />
different in each (conscious) time capsule, and determines the
<br />
boundaries of the view from that capsule. This is analogous to why we
<br />
don't experience multiple versions in MWI, or in teleportation. The
<br />
relevant question is always 'what information is available to me
<br />
here?', where 'me' and 'here' are correlated within a discrete
<br />
structure (time capsule).
<br />
<br />But why does the information in a time capsule *feels* dynamic rather
<br />
than static? You will recall my view that qualia are the fact of
<br />
*being* particular structures within primitive substance. Structure of
<br />
course has a relational as well as a static aspect, and it may be that
<br />
the 'feel' of the relational aspect is temporal. It's as if there were
<br />
a dynamic figure/ ground tension between the substance instantiating
<br />
the capsules and their unfolding, memory-delimited, structural
<br />
sequence. Given that persons emerge experientially at the intersection
<br />
of substance and structure, it's not impossible to intuit that the
<br />
'feel' of this dynamism is what we experience as the 'flow of time'.
<br />
And the delimited nature of each step of the unfolding structure would
<br />
be central to this. A 'totalised' view would arguably not be
<br />
experienced as dynamic.

<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Timeless universe, universes where everything that can exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;does exist, are not well founded empirically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;So we should understand that you would criticize any notion, sometimes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;brought by physicists, of &quot;block-universe&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I certainly would! It is unable to explain the subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; passage of time. Dismissing the subjective sensation of the passge of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; as &quot;merely subjective&quot; or &quot;illusional&quot; is a surreptitious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; appeal to dualism and therefore un-physicalistic!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't see that problem.  In the block universe each subject is modelled as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; having different states at different times and hence subjectively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiences the passage of time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That doesn't follow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Time Capsules: Getting Flow from Sequence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Proponents of the Block Universe view believe that there is only a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B-Series. Some think that alone is adequate to explain the subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Flow-of-Time. It is easy enough to see how there could be a sequence in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the B series. If we consider a series of 3 dimensional &quot;snapshots&quot; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone's brain, each subsequent snapshot iwll contain information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relating back to previous ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But is this chain or sequence enough to establish flow ? A B-series
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without an A-series is like a spatial series. If you had a series of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clones arranged spatially so that clone 2 has all of clone 1's memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and more), clone 3 has all of clone 2's memories (and more) and so on,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you would not expect anything to be flowing from one clone to another.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The clones form a series of &quot;time capsules&quot;, and a such they have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural sequence, but that is all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Without an A series, there is nothing to justify the idea that only one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time capsule is conscious &quot;at a time&quot;. Either they all are, or none
