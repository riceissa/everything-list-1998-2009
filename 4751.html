<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The paradox consists of the fact that the theory of multiverses tells us
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that there must be infinite observers who experiment other physical laws.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not only the possibility of being wrong, it is the model itself
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;which proves to be wrong. In fact it tells us that there are infinite  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;places and times in this multiverse where, if any people observe the world
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;around them in the same way we are doing hic et nunc, they necessarly find
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;another model to describe the universe. So the outcome of the model is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that it must be wrong in infinite places and times, and the paradox is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that we have proved that it is wrong, but we have been able to draw this
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;conclusion because we have considered the hypothesis of applying the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;physical system itself. But if it was wrong, the conclusions would be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;wrong, too.
<br />
<br />Apologies to long-time list members for re-iterating like a broken record...
<br />
<br />I think when people speculate about other universes in the multiverse, 
<br />
they continually fail to
<br />
grasp the likely extremely constrained nature of OBSERVABLE universes. 
<br />
An observable
<br />
universe MUST be structured/defined so as to be capable of evolving 
<br />
self-aware substructures
<br />
(SAS's) such as ourselves, in order for it to be in-principle 
<br />
observable. I posit that these constraints
<br />
are EXTREMELY ONEROUS. No, this is not some naive anthropocentrism. I'm 
<br />
working from
<br />
intuitions about emergent systems theory, and notions of the highly 
<br />
constrained energy regimes
<br />
in which self-organization of systems can occur (At least, 
<br />
self-organization of systems that have
<br />
properties likely to lead to coherent observer-systems.)
<br />
<br />IT COULD BE that all alternative &quot;people&quot; MUST be seeing a universe very 
<br />
similar to ours, or indeed
<br />
possibly EXACTLY ours, simply because otherwise their self-organization 
<br />
would NECESSARILY
<br />
break down in their universe, and they couldn't observe.
<br />
<br />In other words, it COULD be that there is only one OBSERVABLE POSSIBLE 
<br />
world. Now that's
<br />
an extreme, I admit, but I think it's closer to the truth than imagining 
<br />
infinite numbers of really weird, unimaginable
<br />
observers in really weird, unimaginable alternative universes. The main 
<br />
point is that the constraints required
<br />
to produce EMERGENT SYSTEMS that can be classified as what we think of 
<br />
as OBSERVERS may
<br />
be, again EXTREMELY onerous, extremely possibility-constraining 
<br />
constraints.
<br />
<br />There may be, in the imagination, other weirdo observers coming up with 
<br />
a weirdo model of the universe, but maybe
<br />
some inconsistency in the notion of their existence (as complex, stable 
<br />
systems in a complex yet stable habitat)
<br />
in their world means that they simply CAN'T exist.
