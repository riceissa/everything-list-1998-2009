Wei Dai asks some question to Tim May which I would like to comment
<br />
taking into account some other posts.
<br />
<br />Wei Dai:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose I had the time for only one book, which would you recommend?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think you (Wei) decide to look for the book by Lawvere. Good choice
<br />
but you should know it is just an introduction. Now, that book is useful
<br />
even for learning algebra. Some who knows algebra (i.e. groups, rings,
<br />
fields, topological spaces and more importantly their morphism) could
<br />
look for more advanced material perhaps.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can you elaborate a bit more on the motivation behind category theory? Why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was it invented, and what problems does it solve? What's the relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between category theory and the idea that all possible universes exists?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Tim makes a very genuine remark (but he writes so much I fear that has
<br />
been unnoticed!). He said: read Tegmark (Everything paper), then learn
<br />
category, then read again Tegmark. Indeed I would say category theory has
<br />
emerged from the realisation that mathematical structures are themselves
<br />
mathematically structured. Categorist applies the every-structure principle
<br />
for each structure. Take all groups, and all morphism between groups: you
<br />
get the category of groups. It is one mathematical structure, a category
<br />
(with objects = groups and arrows = homomorphism) which, in some sense
<br />
capture the essence of group.
<br />
Note that the category of groups is too large to be defined in Zermelo
<br />
Fraenkel set theory (as almost any so called
<br />
large category). The usual trick of categorist is to mention the Von Neumann
<br />
Bernay Godel theory of set which has classes (collection of sets which are not
<br />
sets themselves). A much modern view is to make category theory in a well
<br />
chosen topos!
<br />
Note that some common mathematical structure *are* categories. A group is
<br />
a category (with one object: the set of group elements, and the arrows are the
<br />
action of the group on itself). Partially ordered set (set with a transitive,
<br />
reflexive, and antisymmetric relation on it) give other simple exemples:
<br />
object of the category are the element of the partially ordered set, and
<br />
the unique (here) arrow between object is the order relation). Automatically
<br />
Boolean Algebra, but also Heytingian lattices, etc... are categories.
<br />
Of course just a set can be made into a trivial category.
<br />
Other categories lives in between groups and lattices. They have lot of objects
<br />
and lot of arrows between objects.
<br />
Categories arises naturally when mathematician realised that many proofs
<br />
looks alike so that it is easier to abstract a new structure-of-structures,
<br />
then makes proofs in it, then apply the abstract proof in each structure
<br />
you want. So they define universal constructions in category (like the
<br />
&quot;product&quot;), which will correspond automatically to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &quot;and&quot; in boolean algebra
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &quot;and&quot; in Heyting algebra
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- group product in cat of groups
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- topological product in cat of topological spaces
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Lie product in cat of Lie groups, etc.
<br />
So Category theory helps you to make a big economy of work ... once you
<br />
invest in it, if you are using algebra. It saves your time.
<br />
But, to come back to Tim remark, it hints that a giant part whole of
<br />
mathematics is naturally mathematically structured, and this should be taken
<br />
into account. Also, as I have explained before, the whole of math cannot
<br />
be entirely mathematically structured in any consistent way (that's too big).
<br />
This can be shown with logic, but categories can give you a concrete
<br />
feeling of the bigness and endlessness of such an enterprise.
<br />
Another motivation for category is the realisation that elements of structures
<br />
are not necessary for defining those structures. Objects behavior are defined
<br />
(up to isomorphism) by their relationship (arrows) with other objects.
<br />
That's a  sort of functional or relational philosophy not so different from
<br />
comp. As exercice you could try to define injection and surjection
<br />
between sets without mentioning the elements!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Does it help understand or formalize the notion of &quot;all possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes&quot;?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't think categories can help in any direct way, although I doubt
<br />
indeed we can live without categories (nor without logic-modalities) in the
<br />
long run. You could try to define the category of (multi)universes.
<br />
What would be a morphism between universes?
<br />
Note that lawvere has try to provide math foundation through the category
<br />
of all categories (with functors as arrows) but this has not succeed.
<br />
He discovers toposes instead.
<br />
<br />Note that categories are difficult to marry with ... recursion theory.
<br />
(Despite so-called Dominical Categories, which does the job, but that is
<br />
too heavy math for me ...).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I know in logic there is the concept of a categorical theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meaning all models of the theory are isomorphic. Does that have anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to do with category theory?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not really. It is one of the reason it is better to use the adjective
<br />
categorial in algebra and categorical in logic. But not all scientist
<br />
follow this custom.
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
