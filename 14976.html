Hi folks,
<br />
<br />This post is long...you'd better get a cup of tea first.
<br />
<br />Following my recent dialog with Jonathon on dual aspect.. the book 
<br />
&quot;Mindful Universe&quot; by Henry Stapp reached the top of my reading pile. I 
<br />
confess to having just had a major fume-out. Chapter 2 did it. It added 
<br />
to my mood of exasperation recently fueled by frustration that a paper 
<br />
of mine has been in review for 2 years and counting ... a paper 
<br />
involving exactly the issues of dual aspect.
<br />
<br />My fume out was because Henry Stapp's book is beautifully depictive and 
<br />
totally explanatory of the insane state of science that I hold 
<br />
accountable for troubles in the scientific study of consciousness,.
<br />
<br />It's OK! I had a rest and calmed down. The smoke has cleared.
<br />
<br />It's just that I am so fed up with what I see as *the* major blockage in 
<br />
science preventing a science _predictive_ and explanatory of 
<br />
consciousness. Not '/a/' major blockage but '/THE/' blockage. This is 
<br />
the big one.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;For I find that I am inadvertently in a cult. A cult whose clerics are 
<br />
physicists. I didn't know I was in it. I was enrolled in it before birth 
<br />
and it has been around me, like poor Truman in the movie 'The Truman 
<br />
Show', the whole time. The young trainee physicist pups around me here 
<br />
chant the dogma.... The cult? Its directive says those who do science 
<br />
behave like ....'this' .... It's a cult where to do science is to do a 
<br />
certain dance, where the dance controls your mind. The golden rule? 
<br />
&quot;Thou shalt only make utterances of the following kind and that 
<br />
is....&lt;enter kind here&gt;&quot;. Before I describe &lt;kind&gt; I'd like to add 
<br />
empirical evidence collected by my own ears from an utterance made by my 
<br />
physics supervisor, which had me reeling in disbelief. Henry Stapp's 
<br />
book just completed the picture and caused my head to explode. BTW I met 
<br />
Henry at Quantum Mind 2003 in Tucson... This is not a personal thing at 
<br />
all. Henry is great. I hope he's in this forum, but doubt it. In 2003 I 
<br />
had no idea I'd be still thrashing away at this issue.. enough.
<br />
<br />Anyway...I had just outlined to my supervisor, a very competent quantum 
<br />
mechanic, the basics of a full dual aspect science. &lt;aspect 1&gt; = etc1. 
<br />
&lt;aspect 2&gt; = etc2. My supervisor looked up at me and said, in respect of 
<br />
&lt;aspect1&gt;:
<br />
<br />&quot;/But that is forbidden/&quot;.
<br />
<br />I couldn't believe my ears. Since when? Says who? Why? Things in science 
<br />
can be 'unwisely adopted', 'critically weak', 'arguably irrelevant', 
<br />
'refuted', 'subject to constraints', 'inappropriate in context' and so 
<br />
forth. But '/forbidden/' ??!!???...as in 'locked behind a closed door 
<br />
marked Do Not Enter?' (or &quot;beware of the leopard&quot;, if you are Douglas 
<br />
Adams). What fantasy science cult is this? /Not the one I signed up for/.
<br />
<br />More evidence.
<br />
<br />I said I had a paper in review at Foundations of Science for _2 years_. 
<br />
No rejections, not a shred of critical entanglement with the details of 
<br />
the work -- again the topic: dual aspect science analytically unplugged. 
<br />
In my most recent communications the editor seemed as puzzled as I was. 
<br />
It seems that the subject material involved some kind of taboo!
<br />
<br />/What?/
<br />
<br />Yes, a /taboo/. That's where 'what ever it is' is not wrong or bad or 
<br />
anything else... but we merely 'don't do that' because, well, we 
<br />
don't.... (i.e. critical argument has left the building).
<br />
<br />And now, in Henry Stapp's book I find the taboo laid out in plain view 
<br />
for all to see. It's dressed up as the 'Copenhagen Interpretation' and 
<br />
it's been adopted as a cult, which I will now outline by quotation: (see 
<br />
page 11).
<br />
<br />&quot;Let there be no doubt about this point. The original form of quantum 
<br />
theory is subjective, in the sense that it is forthrightly about 
<br />
relationships amongst conscious human experiences, and it expressly 
<br />
recommends to scientists /that they resist the temptation to try to 
<br />
understand the reality responsible for the correlations between our 
<br />
experiences that the theory correctly describes/.
<br />
<br />Italicised portion by me. This 'reality' is PRECISELY the &lt;aspect 1&gt; I 
<br />
described above! Having already made major progress with &lt;aspect 1&gt;, I 
<br />
'understand the reality responsible', at least to some extent.... 
<br />
....Can you believe the audacity of such a statement? &quot;In worship of the 
<br />
mathematics rapture, shou shalt not try to even UNDERSTAND the reality 
<br />
responsible.....&quot; In what way is this distinguishable from an utterance 
<br />
of the Church to Gallileo? 
<br />
<br />What the hell is going on?
<br />
<br />Here's more... it looks slightly different but it's actually the same 
<br />
cultish dogma at work... Gary Lisi
<br />
<br />Lisi, G. (2007) &quot;An exceptionally simple theory of everything.&quot; 
<br />
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0770">http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0770</a>
<br />
<br />&quot;We exist in a universe described by mathematics. But which math? 
<br />
Although it is interesting to consider that the universe may be the 
<br />
physical instantiation of all mathematics, there is a classic principle 
<br />
for restricting the possibilities: The mathematics of the universe 
<br />
should be beautiful. A successful description of nature should be a 
<br />
concise, elegant, unified mathematical structure consistent with 
<br />
experience.&quot;
<br />
<br />OK not withstanding all the blather about the literality of maths, of 
<br />
beauty and the general dominance by mathematics goggles... the key words 
<br />
are:
<br />
<br />&quot;... ... ... consistent with experience&quot;
<br />
<br />This 'theory' which purports to explain 'everything' implicitly fails to 
<br />
explain 'subjective experience'. It merely requires that it be 
<br />
'consistent with' (contents of) experience, not 'explanatory' or 
<br />
'predictive' of experience ITSELF. It seems that 'everything', to a 
<br />
physicist, is defined to be not the 'everything' that you and I think of 
<br />
as the ambit of science. They want to be 100% mathematical experts of 
<br />
half of a knowledge base. It's not that knowledge of an underlying 
<br />
reality is unattainable  or unknowable in some way, maybe imperfectly or 
<br />
incompletely.. but they literally choose /not to know/ or even to try to 
<br />
know. Nowhere is it apparent to any sane being that such knowledge is 
<br />
not approachable in some way. This is a */convention/*.... And I hold it 
<br />
and only it, to be the real culprit behind the entire failure of science 
<br />
to explain consciousness.
<br />
<br />This exact same attitude can be seen in Stapp's book: Read Chapters 1 
<br />
and 2. It's all over it. There is an egregious misunderstanding. It 
<br />
confuses/conflates the mere explicit recognition of 'situatedness' 
<br />
(recognising the observer is inside the system, like a voltmeter is 
<br />
inside the measured circuit ') with some sort of explanation of 
<br />
consciousness! The result is that all physicists enrolled in this system 
<br />
have accepted a metabelief that the mathematics are LITERALLY REAL. &quot;To 
<br />
explore the natural world is to explore mathematics&quot;. Unlike Lisi's 
<br />
statement, the natural world is NOT described by mathematics, nor is it 
<br />
made of abstract mathematics, it is described by SCIENTISTS and 
<br />
everything about description is justified only from that perspective.
<br />
<br />OK, enough. The dual aspect science (DAS) reality we inhabit:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />&lt;aspect 1&gt; A separate set of descriptions of underlying reality. (Eg an 
<br />
electron is 3456 instances of process A acting with any number of 
<br />
combinations of processes B, C, D adding up to 4567) so that the energy 
<br />
in a rest frame is Blah Joules. You get the idea.
<br />
<br />&lt;aspect 2&gt; is a description derived as an abstraction based on the 
<br />
appearances revealed within our consciousness. (Eg see any physics book 
<br />
on electrons -- standard empirical models galore).
<br />
<br />&lt;aspect 1&gt; describes the underlying reality, which is responsible for 
<br />
consciousness! It is actually the only thing 'reified'. We scientists 
<br />
are made of it, not literal 'appearances'.
<br />
&lt;aspect 1&gt; has been declared merely verboten!?!
<br />
&lt;aspect 2&gt; is all the usual empirical laws. This _includes_ quantum 
<br />
mechanics!
<br />
&lt;aspect 2&gt; and &lt;aspect 1&gt; must be 100% mutually consistent. This makes 
<br />
&lt;aspect 1&gt; quite knowable.
<br />
&lt;aspect 1&gt; and &lt;aspect 2&gt; are both 'about' the natural world. Neither 
<br />
are 'literally' the natural world. They are statements of abstract 
<br />
generalizations in respect of the natural world. Neither has precedence. 
<br />
BOTH have EQUAL right to empirical evidence (delivered into the 
<br />
consciousness of scientists)
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />Upon what crazy notion are we so fearful of &lt;aspect 1&gt;? I really don't 
<br />
get it. If anyone can construct anything like a plausible story that 
<br />
renders &lt;aspect 1&gt;  invalid. Tell me... for you'd be able to outright 
<br />
reject my Foundations of Science paper...something nobody else has been 
<br />
able to do. I could put myself out of my misery! :-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;I cannot stress how seriously flawed I see the situation is. I see it 
<br />
as the end game in a 350 year old story where QM is an interim delusion 
<br />
just as incomplete as the classical view QM is portrayed (see Stapp) as 
<br />
having replaced.
<br />
<br />I refuse to contribute implicitly or explicitly or otherwise be involved 
<br />
in a science that is actually ultimately a cult. If my PhD can't present 
<br />
a well informed critical argument of DAS for no other reason that that 
<br />
of a taboo... then that PhD, to me, is a club membership certificate in 
<br />
a bankrupt and deluded system. If I am expected to declare dual aspect 
<br />
science wrong then somebody needs to tell me exactly why -- with real 
<br />
critical arguments and logic, not the dogma of taboo.
<br />
<br />The evidence for this situation is everywhere....Is there anyone else 
<br />
out there who sees this situation as weird? Why should any of us have to 
<br />
put up with it?
<br />
<br />I'd love to workshop this at TSC2009 in Hong Kong....Jonathon? Would 
<br />
that be something of interest? That might help. How would it hurt?
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
Colin Hales
