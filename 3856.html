<br />Yes, and yes.

</em><br />
<br />Yes. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I thought the earlier experiments had a more direct connection, where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the people making the decisions were the same ones who were getting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the reward (or at least, future copies of themselves)
</em><br />
<br />The same reasoning applies to the earlier experiments as well. I thought 
<br />
this is simpler because it removes the issue of whether the value of an 
<br />
experience depend the experiences of one's copies. 
<br />
<br />BTW, evolution programmed us to value certain experiences, even if those
<br />
experiences no longer reliably indicate increases in inclusive fitness.
<br />
This is not going to last very long if we remain in an evolutionary
<br />
regime. Those who value only experiences that reliably indicate increases
<br />
in inclusive fitness will have an evolutionary advantage. That means the
<br />
same experience will have very different values depending on the subject's
<br />
background knowledge. For example the experience of eating a delicious
<br />
meal would not be valued if it's known that the experience is a computer
<br />
generated illusion and and no actual nutrition in being gained. In my
<br />
previous thought experiments, the experiences that were considered rewards
<br />
did not indicate increases in inclusive fitness. That doesn't mean it's
<br />
irrational to value them, just that most people in the future probably
<br />
will not value them.
<br />
<br />Similarly, if copying becomes possible, then people who care greatly about 
<br />
their copies will also have an evolutionary advantage.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure I understand this; since the payoff matrix is symmetric it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't matter if you are A or B so I don't see what the point is of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introducing amnesia.  Would there be any cases with symmetric payoffs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where an amnesiac would behave differently than someone who knew whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he was A or B?
</em><br />
<br />(*) I think they *shouldn't* behave differently. But if you consider
<br />
yourself to be both A and B when you don't know whether you are A or B,
<br />
then you *would* behave differently and choose Cooperate instead of
<br />
Defect. That's why I think it's wrong to consider yourself to be both A
<br />
and B.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tangentially, it seems that the PD is a case where the &quot;evidential&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vs &quot;causal&quot; principles of decision theory would show a difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The evidentialist would argue that by cooperating, it increases the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chance that the other person will cooperate (perhaps to a certainty, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some versions), hence cooperating can be justified.  This is basically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hofstadter's principle of super-rationality.  The causalist would reject
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the possible correlation of choices and choose the dominant strategy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of defecting.  Does that seem correct?
</em><br />
<br />There is some literature on this connection between PD and 
<br />
evidential vs causal decision theory. For example:
<br />
<br />Lewis, D.: 1979, 'Prisoner's Dilemma is a Newcomb's Problem'. In 
<br />
Campbell and Sowden: 251-255. Originally in Philosophy and Public Affairs 
<br />
8, 235-240.
<br />
<br />and
<br />
<br />NEWCOMB'S PROBLEM AND REPEATED PRISONERS' DILEMMAS
<br />
Christoph Schmidt-Petri 
<br />
<a href="http://logica.rug.ac.be/censs2002/abstracts/Schmidt-Petri.htm">http://logica.rug.ac.be/censs2002/abstracts/Schmidt-Petri.htm</a>
<br />
<br />Personally I think they are seperate issues. Causal vs evidential is about 
<br />
one-agent decision theory, and PD is about multi-agent decision theory 
<br />
(i.e. game theory). It doesn't make sense to use one-agent decision theory 
<br />
to analyze PD.
<br />
<br />BTW, I'm now having doubts about causal decision theory. Perhaps the extra
<br />
generality isn't really needed. See Huw Price's AGENCY AND PROBABILISTIC
<br />
CAUSALITY at
<br />
<a href="http://www.usyd.edu.au/philosophy/price/preprints/AgencyPC.pdf">http://www.usyd.edu.au/philosophy/price/preprints/AgencyPC.pdf</a> for an
<br />
argument against causal decision theory. I will try to summarize my own 
<br />
thoughts on this matter in another post.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What about this: you are going to be copied, and your two copies are going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to play a PD game.  You know this ahead of time and so you can decide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on whatever strategies you intend to follow during this time before the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copying occurs.  Do you think in that case it would be rational to firmly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decide beforehand to cooperate?
</em><br />
<br />I guess you're assuming that your copies are not going to care about each 
<br />
other, but it's possible to commit yourself to cooperate before you're 
<br />
copied? In that case I think it would be rational to make this commitment.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And would &quot;amnesia&quot; make a difference?  We might arrange for amnesia by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having the duplicates immediately play the game, without any knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of which they are; and remove the amnesia by simply telling them that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one is A and one is B, before they play.  Again, with a symmetric game
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see how the amnesia or its absence would be relevant.  Maybe I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am misunderstanding that aspect.
</em><br />
<br />See the paragraph marked (*) above.
