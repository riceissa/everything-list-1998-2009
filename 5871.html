<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As a Price, I give you the (known?) Smullyan McCarthy

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;puzzle. You are in front of three Gods: the God of Knights, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;God of Knaves, and the God of Knives. The God of Knight always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tells the truth. The God of Knaves always lies, and the God of Knives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;always answers by &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; randomly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You must find which is which, through some questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You can ask no more than three yes-no (answerable) questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Each question must be asked to one God, but you can ask
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more than one question to a God; only then there will be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;God you can no more ask a question).
</em><br />
<br />Playing around with this for a while, I realized you can always trick the 
<br />
knave into giving the same answer as the knight to any question &quot;X&quot; by 
<br />
asking the more complicated question, &quot;If I were to ask you question X, 
<br />
would you answer 'yes'?&quot; The knight will always give the same answer to this 
<br />
question as he would to the question X itself, while the knave will always 
<br />
give the opposite answer that he would if you had actually asked him X, 
<br />
which means he will always answer the same as the knight!
<br />
<br />With this trick, the problem reduces to a simpler one where you have three 
<br />
guys with different names--say, Huey, Dewey, and Louie--and you know Huey 
<br />
and Dewey always tell the truth while Louie always answers randomly, and you 
<br />
have to figure out each guy's name with only three questions. In this case, 
<br />
you could ask the first guy, &quot;is the second guy Louie?&quot; Then if he answers 
<br />
&quot;yes&quot;, you know the third guy must be either Huey or Dewey, so you ask the 
<br />
third guy &quot;are you Huey?&quot; and then ask &quot;is the first guy Louie?&quot; and you're 
<br />
set. On the other hand, if the first guy answered &quot;no&quot; to your first 
<br />
question, then you know the second guy is either Huey or Dewey, so you can 
<br />
ask the second guy the same two questions.
<br />
<br />Translating this back into the 3 Gods, problem, your first question should 
<br />
be to ask the first God &quot;If I asked you 'is the second God the God of 
<br />
Knives', would you say 'yes'?&quot; If the first God answers &quot;yes&quot;, you know the 
<br />
God of Knives is either the first or the second God, so you can ask the 
<br />
third God, &quot;If I asked you 'are you the God of Knights', would you say 
<br />
'yes'?&quot; and after that you can ask the third God &quot;If I asked you 'is the 
<br />
first God the God of Knives', would you say 'yes'?&quot; and this will be enough 
<br />
to tell you the identity of all three Gods. On the other hand, if the answer 
<br />
to your first question was &quot;no&quot;, then you know the God of Knives is either 
<br />
the first or the third God, so you would ask the *second* God the same two 
<br />
subsequent questions as above.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And (added McCarthy) I let you know that all the Gods, although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they understand English, will  answer the yes-know question by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;either &quot;JA&quot; or &quot;DA&quot;, and you are not supposed to know which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;means &quot;yes&quot; and which means &quot;no&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Ugh, I'll have to think about that some more...but again, this is equivalent 
<br />
to a problem where you have three guys named Huey, Dewey and Louie, and Huey 
<br />
and Dewey always tell the truth while Louie answers randomly, but they all 
<br />
answer with &quot;JA&quot; or &quot;DA&quot; and you don't know which word means yes and which 
<br />
means no. If anyone else can figure it out feel free to jump in.
<br />
