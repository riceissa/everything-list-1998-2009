<br />
I've been reading all of these posts on the &quot;tautology&quot; thread, and I've
<br />
been meaning for a long time to put my thoughts down, but it has seemed
<br />
like too large a task.  Well, rather than keep putting it off, I guess
<br />
I'll just do an incomplete job of it.
<br />
<br />Jacques' ASSA idea has considerable merit, IMO, but I still am quite
<br />
reluctant to adopt it.  It has made more and more sense to me as I've
<br />
gone along, gleaning dingy pearls out of Jacques' ranting and raving.
<br />
I guess he thinks he's being cute, but it gets old (it got old a long
<br />
time ago.)
<br />
<br />I still think, however, that he claims more for this concept than it
<br />
has in it.  Let me try to justify myself -- I'll put my current 
<br />
understanding of the ASSA in my own words.  Let's see if there's a 
<br />
match.
<br />
<br />Very simply, the ASSA states that for each of us, the observer moment
<br />
we are experiencing right now is chosen at random from the entire set
<br />
of observer moments, based on their measure.  Calculating the measure
<br />
is problematic, but it is related to the number of (physical?) 
<br />
implementations of that state within all possible universes.  Anyway,
<br />
the measure should, in principle, be calculable.
<br />
<br />With &quot;strict ASSA&quot;, it is meaningless to talk about what I'll observe
<br />
tomorrow, or at any future time.  All I can do to make predictions is
<br />
to calculate probabilities such as &quot;given that an observer sees the
<br />
time as t, and given that this observer has memories a, b, c, ...,
<br />
he can expect to observe M with probability P.&quot;  Thus, with what I'm
<br />
calling &quot;strict ASSA&quot;, I can't necessarily identify that observer with
<br />
myself, if the time t is not the current time.
<br />
<br />This resonates with me -- it reminds me of a cliche aphorisms like &quot;all
<br />
we really have is now&quot;, and &quot;yesterday is but a memory, tomorrow is but
<br />
a dream, ...&quot;.  One could certainly make the philosophical case that
<br />
it is only meaningful to talk about one instant of time.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, this definitely does defy common sense.  That's
<br />
not necessarily an argument against it, but I think it shifts the 
<br />
burden of proof.  I asked my wife (who is convenient for this sort of
<br />
thing), &quot;when you wake up tomorrow, do you expect that it will really
<br />
be *you* who wakes up?&quot;  I think I phrased it better than that, but
<br />
you get the idea.  She, of course, rolled her eyes, and said yes.  I
<br />
remember reading about a court case a few years back where the 
<br />
defendent tried to make the case, based on his philosophy, that the
<br />
person who committed the crime was really a different person than
<br />
the one going to court now.  Though the body had evolved gradually,
<br />
he tried to argue that he was sufficiently different that he should
<br />
be considered legally a separate person.  Needless to say, that 
<br />
argument didn't work, and I remember everyone I talked to about that
<br />
article had the same incredulous reaction.
<br />
<br />I have a strong sense that it is me who continues into the future.
<br />
This, of course, leads me to care about what happens tomorrow, etc.
<br />
<br />Now, Jacques himself has admitted that the &quot;strict ASSA&quot; can be
<br />
supplemented with a definition of &quot;you&quot;, in order that you *can*
<br />
make predictions about what you'll see tomorrow:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; one must first define &quot;you&quot;.  There are three reasonable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibilities in the ASSA:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.  One particular observer-moment.  You have no past and no future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2.  A set of observer moments linked by computation.  With this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     definition the problem is that &quot;you&quot; may be two (or more) people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     at the same time!  The advantage with this definition is that one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     can predict effective probabilities of what &quot;you&quot; will see at other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     times similar to what you want to do with the RSSA.  Thing is, if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     there is nonconservation of measure, the predictions start to differ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     from the RSSA about things like how old you should expect to be.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Remember, testable prediction do NOT depend on definitions, so it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     often better to use def. #1 to prevent such confusion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3.  A particular implementation of an extended computation. Similar to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     2; allows death, when that implementation ends.  I prefer this or #1.
</em><br />
<br />I'd submit (and I'm going to guess that this is anticipated) that the
<br />
ASSA with definition 2 (which I'll denote ASSA-2) is the same as what 
<br />
we've been calling the RSSA.   
<br />
<br />It's not ambiguous:  if you define yourself to be a set of observer
<br />
moments linked by computation, and you make a prediction of what you'll
<br />
observe tomorrow, then you are, by virtue of that definition and premise,
<br />
excluding the possibility of death.  I disagree that the &quot;predictions
<br />
start to differ from the RSSA ...&quot;, because this sort of prediction from
<br />
ASSA-2 would be of the form:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If I were to survive 1000 years, then I'd have a 50% chance of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being purple&quot;.
<br />
<br />And this says nothing about the absolute (the A in ASSA) chance of
<br />
surviving 1000 years.  But as Jacques vociferously points out, the 
<br />
ASSA itself predicts that probability to be low.
<br />
<br /><br />The other main thing I wanted to comment on is Jacques insistence that
<br />
the ASSA does not involve any randomness:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Jacques wrote:]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         NO.  In my view everything is deterministic.  There is NO
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; randomness.  Just a lot of observers with different observations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Effective* probability is proportional to the number/measure of those.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; [Russell:]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; What about what your observers actually observe? That is random.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     What we have here is a failure to communicate.  I don't know how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to convey an idea you don't seem to understand.  I hope I won't have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; keep trying.  The idea is very very simple after all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Suppose there are 1000 observers.  For simplicity, assume each can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be labeled by a brain state which we can number from 1-1000, and that each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sees a different observation, which we can label by the observer number N.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Consider number 463.  He sees an observation with various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; characteristics, which we have labeled #463..  There is NOTHING random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about that, not in any way, shape or form, at all.  Period.  I can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emphasize that enough.
</em><br />
<br />It's interesting that Jacques picked a pseudo-random number (463) to 
<br />
illustrate his point.  I keep thinking that maybe I'm missing something
<br />
here, but I'm not.  Of course what each of us observes, at this particular
<br />
moment (our little observer moment) is randomly SAMPLED from the set of
<br />
possibilities, hence the ASSA.  Any way you slice it, from a subjective
<br />
point of view, there is randomness.  Where there are probabilities, there
<br />
is randomness.  In the above example, observer 463 would say, &quot;my, 463
<br />
seems like a pretty random number, I don't think I could have predicted
<br />
that.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />A couple more comments below.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;     The ASSA, together with our theories of physics, very obviously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; implies that the effective probability of observing a large age is quite

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; low.  This is effectively a prediction, and most observers will find it to

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; be correct.  Using simple Bayesian reasoning, effective predictions are

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; just as good as any other predictions.  In particular, you can plug the

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; effective conditional probabilities into the Baysian formula to update

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; priors about proposed models of reality.  In this case to endorse ASSA and

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; reject RSSA.

<br />If I read you right, you're saying that you reject the RSSA because you're

not old.  But I'm more inclined to reject the ASSA because I'm not dead.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Incidently, it appears that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;possible to derive Occam's Razor, or something like it from the AUH
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;(as you call it - others call it the principle of plenitude). I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;currently writing this up as a paper, and will post this to LANL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;eprints when ready, but it largely draws upon arguments discussed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;this email list.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Sounds like circular reasoning, as stated above, because the AUH
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is itself justified only because of Occam's razor.
</em><br />
<br />I disagree.  I think the AUH could be argued for because it is a &quot;zero-
<br />
information theory&quot;, independent of Occam's razor.  Granted, it *is* the
<br />
simplest possible explanation, but that's not, in my opinion, the 
<br />
fundamental justification for it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  A more interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question is whether the experimentally observed apparent simplicity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical laws (which leads to sucessful use of Occam's razor) is predicted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the AUH; maybe that's what you meant.  In any case I hope that in your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paper you will give full credit where it is due to those who made the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguments.
