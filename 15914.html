<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Footnote  - (parenthetical digression): I know the above thought is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; native to your schema, and up to here Penrose appears to agree with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you.
</em><br />
<br />Penrose has been wrong on this issue in its first book (The Emperor  
<br />
New clothes), and corrected it formally in the second book &quot;The  
<br />
Shadows of the Mind&quot;. But, he is still incorrect on his general  
<br />
conclusion drawn from Gödel.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, this very singular quality of consciousness (to not know its  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emulability level but to be able to bet on it - via the Bayesian  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilities detector that is the mind) is precisely the reason  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Penrose and Hammeroff have decided that the mind is NOT computation;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because of the uncomputability of this issue.
</em><br />
<br />The fact that we cannot known which machine we are does not prevent us  
<br />
to be a machine, on the contrary. Note that Penrose and Hammeroff have  
<br />
split their mind on this issue. Indeed Penrose argues that we are not  
<br />
machine at all, where Hammeroff can conceive that we are quantum  
<br />
machine (and in that case comp is satisfied).
<br />
In general the non computability argument is wrong because  
<br />
computationalism explains why many things ABOUT machines are not  
<br />
computable. The universal machine &quot;lives&quot; on the frontier between the  
<br />
computable and the non computable.
<br />
<br />Note that Penrose, Maudlin and me, do agree that mind and matter  
<br />
cannot be both computable. But for different reasons, and Penrose's  
<br />
one are not correct.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why should the mind be limited to the computable?
</em><br />
<br />This sentence is ambiguous. In a sense, the comp hyp. makes the mind  
<br />
&quot;computable&quot; (Turing-emulable), yet it does not necessarily limit the  
<br />
mind to the computable (angels can think!), nor does it prevents many  
<br />
manifestation of the mind to be completely not computable. We will  
<br />
have the opportunity to dig a bit more on this.
<br />
By &quot;angel&quot; I mean a self-referential entity not emulable by a machine  
<br />
(this exists mathematically).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Clearly it is not. Could an AI conceive of Platonia?
</em><br />
<br /><br />?
<br />
Could *you* conceive of Platonia? If yes, then at least one AI can  
<br />
conceive of Platonia: you (assuming comp of course).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now that would perhaps be to go one better than any Blade Runner- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; style Turing Test!
</em><br />
<br /><br />This address the question: &quot;could a machine convinces another that it  
<br />
conceives of Platonia&quot;. This asks for an infinite Turing test indeed.
<br />
Well ... even a *big* infinity ... (depending on the precise sense you  
<br />
can give to &quot;conceive&quot;).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For Penrose, Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem is enough to lock the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; door against the thought that the mind is limited to the algorithms  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the computable.
</em><br />
<br />It is worse than that. Penrose believes that the mind needs an actual   
<br />
non computable components. His argument is just wrong. Many logicians  
<br />
have pinpoint on the mistakes made by Penrose. They are analog of the  
<br />
errors made by Lucas an half century before. Judson Webb wrote a  
<br />
formidable book on that issue (ref in the biblio of my Lille thesis).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The mind, apparently, can understand things outside the realm of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable. I guess it all depends on what you mean by &quot;understand&quot;.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would cite musical understanding as an example of something that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot be computed. There is information that appears in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (listening) mind that cannot be deduced from the notes, the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; melodies, the harmonies, the rhythms etc. All of the mechanics of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; music are of course computable, but my subjective interaction with a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular musical discourse is (probably) not.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Universal machines can grasp that there are many things that they  
<br />
cannot grasp. Penrose, like Lucas and the few people who still believe  
<br />
that Gödel incompleteness theorem does limit the power of machine,  
<br />
always forget that some machines can understand and prove that  
<br />
theorem, even about themselves. Godel's (incompleteness theorem)  
<br />
really shows how far a machine, betting on its own consistency, can  
<br />
study its own limitations.
<br />
Soon or later, any correct universal machine discover that &quot;its  
<br />
physical world&quot; is a product of that productive ignorance, and this  
<br />
without going into solipsism.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our world may be a giant hologram - space - 15 January 2009 - New

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Scientist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Very interesting! Thanks.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If consciousness is gravity (the wave selector), as Penrose find  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; plausible, the blurriness of the hologram could necessarily  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (asuming comp) prevent the observation of the gravitational waves,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; making them definitely undetectable. Just thinking aloud.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Isn't this like the Turing lock-out with respect to truth and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provability?
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is what I was alluding too, from Penrose's curious intuition that  
<br />
consciousness has something to do with gravity.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We &quot;know&quot; the gravitational waves are there, but we can never  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directly detect them. Perhaps our &quot;knowing&quot; such a thing is non- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable?
</em><br />
<br />If you accept to define, like Theaetetus, knowledge by true belief,  
<br />
and (scientific) belief by Godel's provability, then it is a theorem  
<br />
that the &quot;knowing of the machine M&quot; is even not definable by the  
<br />
machine M. But a machine M can know &quot;the knowing&quot; of a simpler  
<br />
machine, and then, betting on its own correctness, can lift the  
<br />
&quot;knower's logic&quot; of the simple machine to its own. That is what makes  
<br />
theology accessible by machines, both intuitively (knowing) and  
<br />
scientifically (proving).
<br />
<br />Have a good day,
<br />
<br />Bruno
