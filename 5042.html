<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;universes&quot; in the first place (instead of a measure on first-person

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need to be biased towards smaller program/rules, like the &quot;universal prior&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or the &quot;speed prior&quot; that have been discussed on this list by Juergen 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schimdhuber and Russell Standish (I think you were around for these

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussions, but if not see

</em><br />
<br />No doubt I am reiterating our earlier discussion, but I can't easily find
<br />
it right now.  I claim that the universal measure is equivalent to the
<br />
measure I described, where all programs are equally likely.
<br />
<br />Feed a UTM an infinite-length random bit string as its program tape.
<br />
It will execute only a prefix of that bit string.  Let L be the length
<br />
of that prefix.  The remainder of the bits are irrelevant, as the UTM
<br />
never gets to them.  Therefore all infinite-length bit strings which
<br />
start with that L-bit prefix represent the same (L-bit) program and will
<br />
produce precisely the same UTM behavior.
<br />
<br />Therefore a UTM running a program chosen at random will execute a
<br />
program of length L bits with probability 1/2^L.  Executing a random
<br />
bit string on a UTM automatically leads to the universal distribution.
<br />
Simpler programs are inherently more likely, QED.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the &quot;everything that can exist does exist&quot; idea is true, then every 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible universe is in a sense both an &quot;outer universe&quot; (an independent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonic object) and an &quot;inner universe&quot; (a simulation in some other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logically possible universe).
</em><br />
<br />This is true.  In fact, this may mean that it is meaningless to ask
<br />
whether we are an inner or outer universe.  We are both.  However it
<br />
might make sense to ask what percentage of our measure is inner vs outer,
<br />
and as you point out to consider whether second-order simulations could
<br />
add significantly to the measure of a universe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you want a measure on universes, it's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible that universes which have lots of simulated copies running in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high-measure universes will themselves tend to have higher measure, perhaps 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you could bootstrap the global measure this way...but this would require an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer to the question I keep mentioning from the Chalmers paper, namely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deciding what it means for one simulation to &quot;contain&quot; another. Without an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer to this, we can't really say that a computer running a simulation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a universe with particular laws and initial conditions is contributing more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the measure of that possible universe than the random motions of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecules in a rock are contributing to its measure, since both can be seen 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as isomorphic to the events of that universe with the right mapping.
</em><br />
<br />We have had some discussion of the implementation problem on this list,
<br />
around June or July, 1999, with the thread title &quot;implementations&quot;.
<br />
<br />I would say the problem is even worse, in a way, in that we not only
<br />
can't tell when one universe simulates another; we also can't be certain
<br />
(in the same way) whether a given program produces a given universe.
<br />
So on its face, this inability undercuts the entire Schmidhuberian
<br />
proposal of identifying universes with programs.
<br />
<br />However I believe we have discussed on this list an elegant way to
<br />
solve both of these problems, so that we can in fact tell whether a
<br />
program creates a universe, and whether a second universe simulates the
<br />
first universe.  Basically you look at the Kolmogorov complexity of a
<br />
mapping between the computational system in question and some canonical
<br />
representation of the universe.  I don't have time to write more now
<br />
but I might be able to discuss this in more detail later.
