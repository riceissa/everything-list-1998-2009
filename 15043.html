<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The seven first steps of the UD Argument show this already indeed, if

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you accept some Occam Razor. The movie graph is a much subtle

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; showing you don't need occam razor: not only a machine cannot

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; distinguish real from virtual, but cannot distinguish real from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; arithmetical either. Many people does not know enough in philosophy  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mind to understand why the movie graph argument is necessary to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; complete the proof, so I rarely insist. Maudlin's 1989 paper can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; said answering to the &quot;counterfactual- objection&quot; against the MGA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (Movie-Graph Argument).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno, I'm not sure why you de-emphasise step 8 of the UDA. The other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; steps are relatively straightforward and uncontroversial compared to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step 8. People who encounter the argument will naturally ask, how can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you have a computation without a computer or a mind without a brain? I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think I understand your reasoning (and Maudlin's) here, but it needs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be spelled out if the UDA is not to be dismissed on the grounds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it proves nothing about reality, assumed to be at the bottom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level comprised of hard physical objects.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Stathis, you see I  cannot doubt about consciousness, so I can doubt  
<br />
only matter, and  my research is in big part motivated by explaining  
<br />
what is matter without taking granted it exists or what it can be,  
<br />
i.e. my goal consists in explaining matter from non material entities  
<br />
which I can understand; like numbers and simple sets (of numbers). It  
<br />
took some time for me to realize that most people really take the  
<br />
existence of matter for granted. But then what is it? Despite  
<br />
appearance, physics never relies on the materialist assumption, except  
<br />
in the background, as an excuse for not dwelving into what they take,  
<br />
with Aristotle, as metaphysics. Physical theories are mathematical  
<br />
theories, with conventional and relative &quot;unities&quot;. To invoke &quot;matter&quot;  
<br />
as an explanation for actuality or reality seems to me as erroneous as  
<br />
using the notion of God for justifying the creation. At the origin,  
<br />
the Movie Graph Argument (MGA) was an attempt to explain the mind body  
<br />
problem once we assume comp, and to show the difficulties of the  
<br />
notion of matter to the materialists. But your remark is fair enough,  
<br />
and eventually we have to spelled out all the details for having a  
<br />
proof or completely convincing argument.
<br />
I will try to build an argument developed through little steps; like I  
<br />
have done for the UDA, but note that even for UDA it is rare people  
<br />
tells the step where they stop to understand. We will see. I guess  
<br />
sometimes that people are a bit anxious with those matter and I don't  
<br />
want to push them too much. yet I am very glad you understand it, so  
<br />
perhaps you will be able to help. I will send, in a new MGA thread, a  
<br />
first step. OK. I will go slowly (if only because I am a bit busy).

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To make a prediction on the future from the past you have to remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the past (or at least some relevant part of the past). If you allow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (partial) amnesia, it could depend on many things including the type
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of computations allowing the amnesia: it makes almost no sense a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; priori. It would be like asking what is probability to get six
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (subjectively or as first person experience, like we have to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assuming comp) when throwing a dice knowing in advance that once you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have thrown the dice you will forget that you have thrown the dice!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So I am not sure the question can even make sense. I said to George
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Levy a long time ago (in this list) that all first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; probabilities in self-multiplication experiments presuppose that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; level of substitution (of brain material) has been chosen correctly,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and thus serendipitously given that we cannot known for sure our own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; substitution level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your teleportation thought experiments seem quite straightforward and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuitive to me: if I am copied to two separate locations, then I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should have a 1/2 first person probability of finding myself in one or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other location. We can assume for the sake of the experiment that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copying is close enough to perfect, and dismiss the possibility that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the copies will be zombies. So, will the probability of finding myself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in each location still be 1/2 if one of the copies is perfect but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other is 99% or 50% or 1% faithful, by whatever criterion you care to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; define these percentages?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmmm... Sometime ago I would have refuse to answer this question. I  
<br />
know that for the exact and precise derivation of physics from  
<br />
computer (mathematical) science, we need to be able to answer this,  
<br />
but my point has never been to derive physics from comp, it consists  
<br />
just to explain why, assuming comp, we *have to* derive physics from  
<br />
comp (independently of the difficulty of the task).
<br />
But ok, perhaps I have make some progress lately, and I will answer  
<br />
that the probability remains invariant for that too. The probability  
<br />
remains equal to 1/2 in the imperfect duplication (assuming 1/2 is the  
<br />
perfect one).
<br />
But of course you have to accept that if a simple teleportation is  
<br />
done imperfectly (without duplication), but without killing you, the  
<br />
probability of surviving is one (despite you get blind, deaf, amnesic  
<br />
and paralytic, for example).  OK? What do you think?
<br />
Sometimes ago I would have equate total amnesia with death, but I have  
<br />
change my mind on this. What is your opinion on this, doctor?
<br />
<br />Note also that eventually the measure of uncertainty are not really  
<br />
probabilities but coefficient of credibility. They don't compose  
<br />
transitively. The notion of probability can be used only for the  
<br />
immediate experience, despite they are defined by a weight on, most  
<br />
probably, infinite histories (for not getting paradoxes we have  
<br />
already discussed).
