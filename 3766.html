<br />Thanks for the welcome. I've been occasionally reading the list via the 
<br />
archives for a while, and subscribed a couple of weeks ago to get a more 
<br />
direct feel.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But category could be a good move. After all it is a sort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of algebraic approach to a mathematical form of Everything ...
</em><br />
<br />It'll be interesting and useful or it won't be (the future is already 
<br />
set? Boolean logic really _does_ rule?).
<br />
<br />What I mean is that it's the particular area that's interesting to me 
<br />
now. In fact, it's the most interesting thing I've seen in many years.
<br />
<br />I mentioned it in some long articles on another list I've been active in 
<br />
(Cypherpunks, a crypto list), but their issues and concerns are pretty 
<br />
far-removed from logic, category theory, and math (other than number 
<br />
theory). This list seems to have more points of intersection. So, here I 
<br />
am.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my older version of my thesis (a very long french technical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; report) I have make many sections showing that topos is *the*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical structure needed to provide rich models for what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I call the first person discourse or the first person universe).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is quasi obvious if you know the relationship between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuitionist logic or Heyting algebra and toposes.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, in a hand-waving way it sounds obvious.
<br />
<br />There's a great book by Paul Taylor, &quot;The Practical Foundations of 
<br />
Mathematics.&quot; He covers a lot of ground, giving a lot of historical and 
<br />
anecdotal references (something I wish more math book authors would do, 
<br />
even if it inflated their dry texts by 20% in length). One thing he 
<br />
says, is, I'll quote:
<br />
<br />&quot;Category theory provides the technology for creating new worlds. This 
<br />
is quite simple so long as we do not require them to be classical. 
<br />
...One application is to provide the generic objects ...in such a way 
<br />
that we may reason with them in the ordinary way in their worlds, and 
<br />
then instantiate them.&quot; (p. 59)
<br />
<br />[Aside: I'm very intrigued by the possibility of building category-based 
<br />
class systems which go way beyond object-oriented class systems such as 
<br />
seen in Smalltalk, Java, ML, CLOS. Since categories are generalized 
<br />
objects, with more of a focus on _relations_ than objects, and since 
<br />
toposes are in some sense still more general (logical worlds instead of 
<br />
just worlds), I look for the computer languages of 20 years from now to 
<br />
look even more categorical, or even more toposophical, than today's 
<br />
crude cuts.]
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now concerning the third person discourse (the &quot;scientifically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicable&quot; propositions) I have been lead toward symmetric
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; monoidal categories not unlike those used as models of linear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic. Unfortunately I have very strong and non trivial constraints
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (due to the fact that I use the comp hypothesis in the &quot;philosophy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of mind&quot;) and I cannot really choose the mathematical structures.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually I have derived from comp a &quot;theory of physical reality&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Z1*) and I am in search of a semantics for it. It *should* be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a braided category in which I could use the Hopf-algebraic tools
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for solving a (re)normalisation problem in Z1*.
</em><br />
<br />Sounds interesting, but a paragraph obviously can't convey much. I'll 
<br />
look forward to hearing more &quot;shadows on the wall,&quot; more &quot;forgetful 
<br />
functors&quot; giving glimpses.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the &quot;new&quot; much shorter version of my thesis I have suppressed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all references to categories tough.
</em><br />
<br />I'm curious why. I know a handful of people still think of category 
<br />
theory as &quot;generalized abstract nonsense,&quot; but this is clearly not the 
<br />
case. At least no more so than algebra and topology are &quot;generalized 
<br />
abstract nonsense.&quot;
<br />
<br />Baez makes a point that the process of &quot;decateforification,&quot; the process 
<br />
of ignoring categories and concentrating on simple measurables, is now 
<br />
being reversed by a revolution in physics of categorizing. Geroch's 
<br />
excellent &quot;Mathematical Physics&quot; text, 1985, starts with categories in 
<br />
Chapter 1 and treats relativity, QM, and later physics exclusively in 
<br />
categorical terms. Wonderful for seeing the connections and 
<br />
commonalities.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Pearl, by the way, the UCLA professor who is the father of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; murdered journalist Danny Pearl (in Pakistan).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gosh! I didn't knew that! I tought PEARL was a common name.
</em><br />
<br />As soon as I heard mention on CNN that Pearl's father was a professor at 
<br />
UCLA, I suspected. A quick search confirmed the details.
<br />
Pearl's book is one that would profit immensely from a &quot;collision&quot; with 
<br />
other areas, especially the causal set work of Isham, Markopoulou, etc. 
<br />
(As in a lot of areas, the &quot;invisible colleges&quot; (communities of 
<br />
researchers) are often operating in micro-universeses of discourse, 
<br />
referencing from the same set of papers, using the same basic ideas. For 
<br />
example, the only real point of commonality between the universes of 
<br />
[Pearl-Dempster-Shafer-cognitive-AI]  and  
<br />
[Smolin-Markopoulou-Isham-physics] seems to be the term &quot;causality&quot; and 
<br />
varius references to Saul Kripke (who is better known in linguistic 
<br />
circles!).
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [SNIP] What's fascinating is that a topos is a kind of &quot;micro 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe.' Not in a physical sense, a la Egan or Tegmark, but in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sense of generating a consistent reality. More on this later [SNIP].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the sense of (brouwerian-like) mental construction?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I mean in the sense that the history of modern science seems to me to be 
<br />
a succession of &quot;throwing out the &quot;centered&quot; object,&quot; throwing out a 
<br />
world centered around the Sun, or centered around God, or centered 
<br />
around even Newtonian physics.
<br />
<br />A good example is throwing out Euclidean geometry. Or, rather, truly 
<br />
understanding that Euclidean geometry is just one of _many_ geometries.
<br />
<br />Euclidiean geometry, Riemannian geometry, Newtonian physics, Lorentzian 
<br />
transforms in a Minkowski space (aka Einsteinian physics), etc. are just 
<br />
special kinds of universes. Are they &quot;real&quot;?
<br />
<br />(This gets into Tegmark territory, about &quot;actual&quot; (whatever that means!) 
<br />
physical universes with different mathematics and then, obviously, 
<br />
different physical laws. Egan, in &quot;Distress,&quot; calls this the &quot;all 
<br />
topology  model.&quot;)
<br />
<br />Personally, I'm a partial Platonist (these things in mathematics have 
<br />
some kind of existence) and a partial formalist (we are pushing symbols 
<br />
around on paper and in our minds). I increasingly view the 
<br />
constructivist (Intuitionist/Brouwerian) point of view as being 
<br />
consistent with what we see in the world and what we can model or 
<br />
simulate on computers.
<br />
<br />There are aspects to the world which are Newtonian, which are Boolean, 
<br />
which use the discrete topology, which use only continuous functions, 
<br />
which are beyond Boolean, which are compact (in the compact space 
<br />
sense), which are non-compact, which are Banach, Hilbert, Fock, etc. 
<br />
spaces, and so on.
<br />
<br />While I think the Universe is remarkably understandable, I don't think 
<br />
it makes much sense to talk about what &quot;the&quot; topology or laws of 
<br />
mathematics of the Universe is/are. (I apologize if this is not 
<br />
clear...this is just a glimpse.)
<br />
<br />There is much, much more to say on all of these topics.
