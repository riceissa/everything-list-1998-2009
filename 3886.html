I  comment the first part of Hal's last UDA post.

(I put BM and HF because the archive does not print correctly my

quotes apparently)

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here is my response to Bruno's UDA argument as described in the links

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html</a>.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree with the general idea, that if we assume that a UDA program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exists in some sense (Platonic or otherwise), then each observer moment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is instantiated multiple times (probably a countably infinite number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;times) throughout the structure generated by the UDA.  In that case we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have to accept that our mental experiences are not unique to some universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(by &quot;universe&quot; I mean the output of one program being simulated by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;UDA) but are present in infinitely many of them.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM: OK.
<br />
<br /><br />HF:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However there are a few places where I would expand upon the steps, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;take issue with some of them.  First, as far as the basic idea of COMP,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do agree that functional substitution is enough for consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indistinguishable from my own.  I would expand on this to explain that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the reason for this belief is not due to philosophy, but to biology.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
To biology + some philosophy I would say. That's ok, my first feeling that
<br />
comp is plausible comes also from biology. Even microbiology ...
<br />
<br /><br />HF:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The way the brain works appears to be a matter of processing information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;via electrochemical signals transmitted by neural cells.  Each such cell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is acting as an information processor.  The collection of these cells
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the brain takes in information on incoming nerves, and sends out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;commands on outgoing nerves.  Everything is information.  So it seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;me that replacing this system with something that can process information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a functionally equivalent way would produce an equivalent system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If I didn't know that the brain worked in this way, I would probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not accept COMP.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
A belief in a reductionist account of cells, or even molecules, or even
<br />
just space-time-energy would have been enough for a reductionist
<br />
microbiologist, or chemist or physicist. But ok, knowledge
<br />
of the brain gives the feeling our level of substitution can be relatively
<br />
high. That help conveying the idea. But in the long run it is preferable
<br />
not having any *a priori* on the level. Comp assumes only the existence of
<br />
the level. (later we will have that we can only bet on a level).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />HF:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, based on some arguments which Wei Dai gave (and which I'm not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sure if he accepts), I believe there are some aspects of consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which are not fully captured by a purely functional substitution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Specifically, as we get into the questions about duplications, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe that some details of the functional substitution may affect the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first-person likelihood of experiencing that implementation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
If the details are functional and &quot;digitalizable&quot;, then this would be
<br />
equivalent to saying that the level of substitution has not been chosen
<br />
correctly. If those details are not &quot;digitalizable&quot;, this is equivalent
<br />
of rejecting comp. I think.
<br />
<br /><br />HF:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Issues such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as the speed, size and degree of redundancy of an implementation may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;affect how much &quot;measure&quot; it has, that is, how much of a contribution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it makes to the space of all my first-person experiences.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
I would agree, if the word &quot;implementation&quot; was not ambiguous in our
<br />
context. I agree if by implementation, you mean any digitalizable
<br />
implementation. Those belongs to UD*. (Trace of the UD).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />HF:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we jump to the end of Bruno's argument, step 10 or 11, and accept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that we are instantiated in multiple forms, it is obvious that not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all ways we could be instantiated are equally probable.  Otherwise the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe we observe would be chaotic.  So somehow it must be the case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that implementations which exist in simple and lawful universes are more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probable (in the first person sense) than those in random universes.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
I agree. Modulo the change of &quot;equally probable&quot; (at the end of the first
<br />
sentence) by &quot;relatively equally probable&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br />HF:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Given that we accept the reality of different measures for different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implementation states, I think we need to consider the possibility that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not all functional substitutions have equal measure (i.e. first-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability).  I won't go into the details here, but I think a detailed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;argument shows that different sizes and speeds of the functional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;substitution must make a difference in measure.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
&quot;relative speed&quot;. The invariance lemma makes the 3-person DU speed
<br />
entirely irrelevant. But relative speed is measure in internal space
<br />
time, the one which we must shown (by UDA) to emerge from the many
<br />
relative situation/history generated by the DU.
<br />
<br /><br />HF:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Several of Bruno's questions raise the idea of quantifying the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person probability of various duplication scenarios.  In the comment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;preceding question 7 in <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2992.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2992.html</a>,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;he writes:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  BM: The way to quantify the indeterminacy is the unknown. Although we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  argue that the {W, M} duplication gives a sort of perfect 1-coin, simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  probabilty reasoning leads quickly to hard problems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;HF:I think Bruno agrees here that you can't just say that if you have 2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;duplicates made, you therefore have a 50% first-person probability of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiencing each of them.  We have discussed various paradoxes and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problems that arise with this kind of reasoning.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
Actually I tend to believe that perfect duplication in distinguishable
<br />
environment gives a 1/2 uniform probability. But I don't use this in the
<br />
reasoning.
<br />
<br /><br />HF:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Nevertheless he asks in questions 7 and 8, *if* we accept a 50%
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability in one experiment, will we also see it in another?  I am not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sure how to answer these, because I don't have a good understanding of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;how to begin to quantify the probabilities.  So I cannot answer in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;affirmative, but I can't deny the possibility either.  I have to answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that I need to get a better understanding of what aspects are relevant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in understanding probabilities.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
I do a common mathematical trick: because I know that the &quot;quantifying
<br />
probability/credibility&quot; problem is huge, I just prove that, whatever
<br />
quantification you use it must be invariant for the situations involved
<br />
(with/without delays between reconstitutions, in real, virtual or just
<br />
arithmetical reconstitutions, etc.) *once you postulate comp!*.
<br />
We don't need to know the proba for understanding that comp forces them
<br />
to remain unchanged for those different situations. This is capital for
<br />
the sequel of the proof. It explains why we shall be obliged to take the
<br />
whole UD* into account. It is due to what I call the invariance lemma
<br />
(without doubt with some pompouslyness but it fixes the idea).
<br />
<br /><br />HF:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Likewise in question 10, where we assume a UDA is actually implemented
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the physical universe, I believe it is possible that the measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the implementations in the UDA may be smaller than the measure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;biological physical implementations.
</em><br />
<br /><br />And what is a biological implementations? And then, how could they
<br />
have bigger measure? Remember the UD generates also QUD (Quantum
<br />
universal dovetailer). Perhaps the QUD (or &quot;a QUD&quot;) wins in the limit
<br />
but with comp this still *must* be justified. Don't fall in Searle's
<br />
magic naturalism! By definition of comp: if that &quot;biologicalness&quot; is
<br />
needed, AND if that biologicalness is non DU accessible, it just means
<br />
comp is false. Unless that biologicalness, like the temporalness, or
<br />
the space-fillingness are extracted for *first person*, inside or
<br />
internal view, of the machines (DU generated) betting on their most
<br />
probable computations. Those machines anticipates their own consistency
<br />
first. (This could help for the translation UDA -&gt; AUDA).
<br />
<br /><br />HF:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So while the UDA machine will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;produce copies of my mental state, it might turn out that they make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an insignificant contribution in terms of first-person probability,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;compared to the contributions from the physical universe.  (For the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;purposes of question 10, we assume that the physical universe exists.)
</em><br />
<br /><br />But in *that* basic physical universe, with comp, the UD will provably
<br />
generate continua of variant of that basic physical universe and portion
<br />
of it corresponding to your actual states. All our consistent computational
<br />
continuations (extensions) count, &quot;biological&quot; (whatever that means) or not.
<br />
<br /><br />Hoping this makes clearer my previous comments about your summary of your
<br />
post. It seems that your summary points of your last post were
<br />
less &quot;magically-naturalistic&quot;. You can thrust comp *and* nature in the
<br />
sense that [if nature does not comes from comp, then comp is false!].
<br />
Variety of &quot;infinitesimal discretisations&quot; could defined weakening
<br />
of comp, in that case, making our level of substitution inaccessible.
<br />
<br />(In fact nature could perhaps be seen as a sort of consciousness' sharable
<br />
border, whith consciousness = stable self-consistency anticipation by 
<br />
(collection?) of machines.
