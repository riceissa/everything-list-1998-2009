Yablo and Gallois's paper &quot;Is ontology based on a mistake&quot; is quite
<br />
relevant to
<br />
the question of Platonism, specificall whether true matehmatical
<br />
assertions
<br />
of existence have to be taken literally.

<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
What is it?
<br />
<br />A paper criticising the Quinean view of ontology. Yablo does so by
<br />
introduces a metaphorical/literal distinction as to when it is
<br />
reasonable to posit the existence of entities. Thus in order to
<br />
determine our ontological commitments we need to be able to extract
<br />
all cases in which such entities are posited in a metaphorical way
<br />
rather than a literal one. If there is no way to do this, then it is
<br />
not possible to develop a Quinean ontology.
<br />
<br />Where does it fit in for me?
<br />
<br />For the thesis: if correct, it implies that Quine's fundamental
<br />
approach to ontology is flawed and this may have negative implications
<br />
for the Quine-Putnam indispensability argument.
<br />
<br />For the metaphysics paper: possibly details a way in which existence
<br />
cannot be held to occur (which would be interesting to look at in
<br />
terms of the relations proposed). At the very least it gives an
<br />
example of particular existence claims which can then be analysed in a
<br />
relational way.
<br />
<br />Reference
<br />
Yablo, S., Does ontology rest on a mistake?, Proceedings of the
<br />
Aristotelian Society, supp. vol. LXXII (1998), 229-261.
<br />
<br /><br />The Argument
<br />
<br />Carnap on existence
<br />
Carnap argued that the realist existence question/assertion was
<br />
meaningless. He did this by means of his concept of linguistic
<br />
framework. A linguistic framework lays down rules for the use and
<br />
meaning of some object term X in a linguistic sense. Thus there are
<br />
two ways in which one can question/assert the existence of X: internal
<br />
or external to the linguistic framework.
<br />
<br />If one questions the existence of X internal to the framework, one is
<br />
almost certainly guaranteed a yes answer (thus the statement &quot;there is
<br />
an X&quot; can pretty much be viewed as tautological when assessed
<br />
internally to a framework involving X). Hence the realist must be
<br />
making an external existence assertion. However, in this case the term
<br />
X has no meaning, as the framework within which it gains such is not
<br />
present. Thus the realist existence question/assertion is either
<br />
tautological or impossible to answer/assess.
<br />
<br />Quine on Carnap
<br />
Quine objected to Carnap's position in three ways: firstly, he held
<br />
that his internal/external distinction was reliant on an analytic/
<br />
synthetic distinction (because the concept of a linguistic framework
<br />
involves the rules inherent in that framework being viewed as
<br />
indefeasible (i.e. analytic) within that particular linguistic
<br />
practice). As Quine believed that the analytic/synthetic distinction
<br />
could not be made, he held that Carnap's internal/external distinction
<br />
breaks down: internal assessments are thus not just a matter of
<br />
following inviolable linguistic rules, it is indeed possible for these
<br />
rules to change in response to experience and thus for internal
<br />
practice to change too.
<br />
<br />Secondly, Quine argues that the external choice between linguistic
<br />
frameworks is much more influenced by observation than Carnap would
<br />
have us believe. For Quine, the decision to adopt a rule governing the
<br />
appropriate observational conditions under which one may assert the
<br />
existence of X is itself in part an assertion that X exists (if such
<br />
conditions obtain). He does not believe in making a distinction
<br />
between the linguistic truth and the factual truth of a statement.
<br />
<br />Finally, Quine objects to the claim that the choice of linguistic
<br />
framework existence rule is based on merely practical considerations
<br />
to do with efficiency, simplicity, etc with no metaphysical
<br />
implications. He does so on the basis that these are exactly the sorts
<br />
of things that scientists use to favour one theory (and hence in
<br />
Quine's opinion, a view of the world, complete with ontology) over
<br />
another.
<br />
<br />Yablo on Quine
<br />
Yablo argues that each aspect of Quine's critique is flawed. Firstly,
<br />
one does not need to hold that rules making up a linguistic framework
<br />
are analytic in order to be able to understand the need for a
<br />
framework in order to understand the meaning of terms. Not really sure
<br />
how this fits in and is related to Quine's second objection stage: One
<br />
does not need to render external talk of the objects within a
<br />
particular framework meaningless in order to save the internal, rule-
<br />
bound meaning. One can just make clear how such external statements
<br />
cannot be applied internally.;finally, Yablo points out that Quine
<br />
himself accepts the fact that a statement can be asserted purely for
<br />
practical advantage without the asserter actually holding that what it
<br />
entails metaphysically is actually the case.
<br />
<br />Saving the Framework
<br />
Yablo goes on to propose a linguistic framework modified in light of
<br />
Quine's criticisms in which a framework is adopted as a kind of &quot;game&quot;
<br />
where the players assess the truth and falsity of statements within
<br />
the framework without any belief in implications for truth and/or
<br />
falsity outside of the framework. Thus Yablo argues that there are two
<br />
ways in which a statement may be interpreted: literally (external to a
<br />
particular game or linguistic framework) or as a metaphor (internal).
<br />
<br />The Framework Strikes Back
<br />
This distinction regarding the way in which a statement may be
<br />
interpreted causes problems for the Quinean ontological regime. Given
<br />
that Quine does accept that assertions may be made in a metaphorical
<br />
sense, and that when one does so no ontological implications may be
<br />
drawn from such assertions, Quine needs to provide a clear demarcation
<br />
criterion to distinguish between metaphorical and literal statements.
<br />
As this has been much discussed without progress, it seems unlikely
<br />
that one will be able to distinguish between metaphorical and literal
<br />
usage and thus it is impossible to construct a certain ontology under
<br />
Quine's approach.
<br />
<br />Indeed, Yablo argues that for the most part when we make statements,
<br />
we are unsure as to whether they are strictly literally true or if
<br />
they are at least in part to be taken metaphorically. Thus the
<br />
Quiniean must argue that in time these metaphorical parts of our
<br />
statements will be eroded and eventually only the literal
<br />
interpretation will remain. However, this reduces the Quinean position
<br />
to the following: one should sympathise with the idea that Xs exist
<br />
iff the literal part of theories involve their postulation and one
<br />
should count the part of a theory that involves the postulation of Xs
<br />
literal iff there turn out to be Xs. Thus there is a circularity.
<br />
<br />Argument Outline
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Carnap proposes a conception of linguistic practice (involving
<br />
an internal/external distinction) under which ontological
<br />
investigations cannot meaningfully be undertaken.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Quine criticises this by linking it to the problems of the
<br />
analytic/synthetic distinction.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Yablo modifies Carnap's position so that the distinction is made
<br />
on metaphorical/literal grounds in instead.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* This new position requires that the Quinean provide a principle
<br />
of demarcation between metaphor and literal truth in order for their
<br />
ontology to prevail.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* No such principle has been provided and so the Quinean
<br />
ontological project fails.
