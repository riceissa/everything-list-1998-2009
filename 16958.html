</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is the powerset of {a, b, c}
</em><br />
<br /><br />I give the answer, and I continue slowly.
<br />
<br />1) What is the powerset of {a, b, c}?
<br />
<br />By definition, the powerset of {a, b, c} is the set of all subsets of  
<br />
{a, b, c}.
<br />
I go slowly.
<br />
<br />Is the set {d, e, f} a subset of {a, b, d}? No. None of the elements  
<br />
of {d, e, f} are elements of {a, b, c}. The question was ridiculous.
<br />
<br />Is the set {a, b, d} a subset of {a, b, c}? No. One element of {a, b,  
<br />
d}, indeed, d, does not belong to {a, b, c}, so {a, b, d} cannot be a  
<br />
subset of {a, b, c}. The question was ridiculous again, but less  
<br />
obviously so.
<br />
<br />Is the set {a, b, c} a subset of {a, b, c}. Yes. All elements of {a,  
<br />
b, c} are elements of {a, b, c}. {a, b, c} is included in {a, b, c}.
<br />
<br />Can we conclude from this that the powerset of {a, b, c} is {{a, b,  
<br />
c}}. No. We can conclude only that {{a, b, c}} is included in the  
<br />
powerset. It is very plausible that there are other subsets!
<br />
<br />Indeed,
<br />
<br />Is {a, b} included in {a, b, c}? Yes, all elements of {a, b} are  
<br />
elements of {a, b, c}. This take two verifications: we have to verify  
<br />
that a belongs to {a, b, c}. And that b belongs to {a, b, c}.
<br />
<br />Can we conclude from this that the powerset of {a, b, c} is {{a, b, c}  
<br />
{a, b}}. No, we could still miss other subsets.
<br />
<br />I accelerate a little bit.
<br />
Is {a, c} a subset of {a, b, c}? Yes, by again two easy verification.
<br />
<br />Is there another doubleton (set with two elements) having elements in  
<br />
{a, b, c}? Yes. {c, b}. It is easy to miss them, so you have to be  
<br />
careful. All two elements of {c, b} are elements of {a, b, c}, as can  
<br />
be verified by two easy verification.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Is {b, c} a subset of {a, b, c}. Yes, but we have already consider  
<br />
it. Indeed the set {b, c} is the same set as {c, b}.
<br />
<br />Is there another doubleton? No. Why? I search and don't find it.
<br />
<br />is there yet some subset to find?
<br />
<br />Yes, the set with one element, notably. They are called singleton.
<br />
<br />Here it is easy to guess that there will be as many singletons  
<br />
included in (a, b, c} that there is elements in {a, b, c}. So the  
<br />
singletons are {a}, {b}, and {c}. This can be verified by one  
<br />
verification for each.
<br />
<br />Are there still subset? Yes. We have seen that the empty set { } is  
<br />
included in any set. This can be (re)verify by 00 verifications, given  
<br />
that there is 0 element in { }..
<br />
<br />Conclusion:
<br />
There are 08 subsets in {a, b, c}, which are { }, {a}, {b}, {c}.{a, b},  
<br />
{a, c}, {c, b} and {a, b, c}. And thus,
<br />
<br />The powerset of {a, b, c}  is the set { { }, {a}, {b}, {c}.{a, b}, {a,  
<br />
c}, {c, b} {a, b, c}}.
<br />
<br /><br />2) What is the powerset of {a}?
<br />
<br />Answer {{ } {a}}. It has two elements.
<br />
<br />3) What is the powerset of { }
<br />
We could think at first sight that there are no subsets, given that  
<br />
{ } is empty. But we have seen that { } is included in any set. So { }  
<br />
is included in { }. Again you can verify this by zero verification!  
<br />
But then the powerset of { }, which is the set of sets included in { }  
<br />
is not empty:  It has one element, the empty set. It is {{ }}. Think  
<br />
that {{ }} is a box containing that empty box.
<br />
<br /><br />Attempt toward a more general conclusion.
<br />
<br />The powerset of a set with 0 element has been shown having 01 elements,  
<br />
and no more.
<br />
The powerset of a set with 1 element has been shown having 02 elements,  
<br />
and no more.
<br />
The powerset of a set with 2 elements has been shown having 04  
<br />
elements, and no more. (preceding post)
<br />
The powerset of a set with 03 elements has been shown having 8  
<br />
elements, and no more.
<br />
The powerset of a set with 4 elements has been shown having 16  
<br />
elements, and no more. (older post)
<br />
<br />In math we like to abstract things. Let us look at the preceding line  
<br />
with all the words dropped! This gives
<br />
<br />--- 0 ---- 1 ---
<br />
--- 1 ---- 2 ---
<br />
--- 2 ---- 4 ---
<br />
--- 3 ---- 8 ---
<br />
--- 4 ---- 16 ---
<br />
<br />On the left, we see, vertically disposed, the natural numbers,  
<br />
appearing with their usual order.
<br />
On the right, we see, vertically disposed, some natural numbers, which  
<br />
seems to depend in some way from what numbers appears on the left. It  
<br />
looks like there is a functional relation, that is a function.
<br />
<br />The notion of function is the most important and pervading notion in  
<br />
math, physics, science in general, and we will have to come back on  
<br />
that very notion soon enough.
<br />
<br />The idea that there is a function lurking there, is the idea that we  
<br />
can guess a general law, capable of providing the answer to the  
<br />
general line:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The powerset of a set with n element has been shown having ?  
<br />
elements, and no more.&quot;
<br />
<br />Can we determine ? from n. Surely it depends on n.
<br />
<br />In this case, a simple guess can be made, by meditating on the  
<br />
sequence of numbers which appear on the right. Those are, when written  
<br />
horzontally:
<br />
<br />1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
<br />
<br />I guess you see what happens. Each number in that sequence is the  
<br />
double of the preceding one. So the next one can be obtained, by just  
<br />
continuing the multiplication by two.
<br />
<br />1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384,  
<br />
32768, 65536, 131072, ... that is,
<br />
<br />1, 2x2, 2x2x2, 2x2x2x2, 2x2x2x2x2, 2x2x2x2x2x2, ...
<br />
<br />We will write a possibly lengthy expression like 2x2x2x2x2x ... x2, as  
<br />
2^n, where n is the number of occurence of &quot;2&quot; in the expression.
<br />
<br />So you can guess that in the &quot;general line&quot;:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The powerset of a set with n elements has been shown having ?  
<br />
elements, and no more.&quot;
<br />
<br />? does indeed depend on n, and is actually equal to 2^n.
<br />
<br />Here is the general law, that we have guessed by experience (counting  
<br />
in the simple case) and generalized by intution:
<br />
<br />The powerset of a set with n elements has been shown having 2^n  
<br />
elements, and no more.
<br />
<br />When we found a law in such a way, we could ask if we couldn't prove  
<br />
it from facts we are already believing (or guessing).
<br />
<br />Here, the theory is the intuitive basic  knowledge of logic, numbers  
<br />
and sets. And the question is really: can you prove, or justify, or  
<br />
explain WHY the powerset of a set of n elements has 2^n elements?
<br />
<br />What happens which could explain why, when we add an element to a set,  
<br />
its powerset becomes two time bigger. is there a reason for that  
<br />
special happening. Can I convince myself that it has to be like that?
<br />
<br />I let you think.
<br />
<br />Hints. We have already see a &quot;doubling scenario&quot;. Indeed, I often  
<br />
mention at the step 3 of the UDA, the iterated self-duplication. Some  
<br />
is cut and paste in Brussel, and copy at place W and M. Then both  
<br />
individuals come back, by train, in Brussels and both do the  
<br />
duplication experience again, and again, and again. The number of  
<br />
individuals grows like 2, 4, 8, ... that is 2^n, with n the number of  
<br />
iteration of the experience. After n iteration, each has written in  
<br />
its &quot;first person diary&quot; the sequence of places they have visit, which  
<br />
look like a string of W and M of length n.
<br />
<br />No question? If everything is clear, I continue asap.
<br />
<br />Oh! I have a question myself. If the law above is correct, it looks  
<br />
like 2^0 = 1. It is the laws applied to the first line---the case of  
<br />
the powerset of the empty set. Is it true that 2x2x2x...x2 is equal to  
<br />
1 in case the number of occurence of 2 is 0? How come?
<br />
