Hi,
<br />
<br />----- Original Message ----- 
<br />
From: &quot;Frank&quot; &lt;logical.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hello,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A few comments on your post.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I interpret correctly, you are basically distinguishing &quot;dualistic&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretations from a &quot;materialistic&quot; ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When we talk of a materialistic viewpoint, what *are* we talking about?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it our vague conception that everything is made of atoms what
</em><br />
constitutes
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a materialistic view of the universe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As we all know, not even the deepest theoretical physicists know what the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hell they are talking about, in a fundamental sense, when they talk about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter, energy, quarks, gravity, etc. They only describe the result of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measurements and abstract mental models that somehow, accommodate or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;shadow&quot; the results of these measurements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where does this leave dualism? If the &quot;material&quot; world is just a mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construct of man, created to accommodate our sensorial input, there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suddenly no more &quot;dual&quot; in &quot;dualism&quot;, only experience, or whatever we want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to call our sensorial life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, one can hypothesize that there is no need to define a mysterious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;material basis&quot; for what is just sensorial experience.
</em><br />
<br />Sounds like Schopenhaeur...
<br />
Even though I like that view to some extent, I am sure that the
<br />
great majority of professional physicists do work with the idea
<br />
that matter - the stuff that is measured and detected in their
<br />
experiments, is all that 'is'. And that although we have no idea how
<br />
to describe this phenomena of consciousness, it must
<br />
in the end be a byproduct of a material organ - the brain.
<br />
But before this discussion turns to &quot;what do physicists think&quot;, let
<br />
me stress that what  I want to argue is that a materialistic view is
<br />
inconsistent with QTI - never mind who actually defends a
<br />
materialistic position. Further, if we do not assume a materialistic
<br />
framework, there is still less reason to suppose QTI.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If windows 98 where considered conscious AI,  would a version
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of windows 98
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; running on two different computers be one entity or two
</em><br />
<br />I would say they would be two entities. One is not aware of the
<br />
other's &quot;sensorial inputs&quot;, even if they would act the same given the
<br />
same inputs. Awareness is what matters here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why would the universe create two souls, when one will suffice?
</em><br />
<br />I didn't understand the question... You are considering the factual
<br />
existence of a soul, and associating it with the AI running win98?
<br />
If that is the case, I think I made a point that the AIs are two
<br />
entities, therefore they should have a soul of each's own.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we consider ourselves to be just a sequence of states in a mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe (a fairly modest hypothesis), the only condition for us having a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense of identity from one state to the next is not necessarily to pertain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the same &quot;material&quot; substrate (which may not even exist), but that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two states be related by some continuity, or memory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After all, my personal &quot;viewpoint&quot; always prefers to stick with me instead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of switching back and forth with my dog, since his states our not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuation of mine, memory-wise.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If this interpretation is correct, it can be argued that we'll never &quot;be&quot;
</em><br />
in
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the null state of death, because death is not a state which will remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any previous &quot;me&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, it follows that if there exists a plausible state or configuration
</em><br />
which
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a valid continuation, memory-wise, of my current state, then my
</em><br />
personal
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;viewpoint&quot;, will prefer this path over the &quot;death&quot; state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ergo, immortality !.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PD: definition of &quot;viewpoint&quot;: an artificial construct to help visualize
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; succession of states that constitute my identity,
</em><br />
<br />Let me put forth some arguments:
<br />
I have seen a movie (can't remember the name, but if my
<br />
memory isn't wrong, I think the governor of California was in it...
<br />
How odd...)
<br />
Well, in this movie they made perfect clones of people and
<br />
copied their memories so that they could perfectly reproduce one's
<br />
mental state at the instant of the copying in the clone.
<br />
When the clone was &quot;awakened&quot;, he/she felt just like that person who
<br />
died. For an individual who was seeing that clone, and even to the
<br />
clone himself, there was no way to know if that was or was not a
<br />
clone (except for a detail in the ear, or something, that was put to
<br />
make a certain story possible, but never mind) so if continuity of
<br />
memory is all that matters, you would say that the clone WAS the
<br />
original person. But in the movie a clone of the governor is made
<br />
BEFORE he is dead. So both have the true belief that they are the
<br />
'real' one. Even though it could sound fun to say that they both are,
<br />
it certainly does not make sense, since they are not aware of each
<br />
other's experiences, no matter how similar they look. If one dies,
<br />
he should find no comfort in knowing that his/her clone will survive.
<br />
<br />Let us run that slowly to make sure: if the clone is made before one
<br />
dies, then one will not experience the clone's life. For all practical
<br />
purposes, he is NOT the clone. If the clone is made at the exact
<br />
same time of his death, (though simultaneity is a hard thing to define)
<br />
there should still be no reason to suppose that he will be aware of
<br />
the clone's mental states. Not even if the clone is made after his
<br />
death. So I think we can safely say that *we are not our clones*.
<br />
<br />Now let us remember that what I am trying to find is the practical
<br />
answer to the question: &quot;will we survive a severe car accident due
<br />
to QTI?&quot; Any answer to that should tell what is the probability that
<br />
' I ' experience a posterior state. Not that the multiverse contains
<br />
some entity which looks like me and will experience it. Just like I
<br />
am not interested in knowing if there will be a clone of me with my
<br />
perfect memory reinstalled. I won't be aware of what it sees!
<br />
<br />So in the multiverse clones are created all the time. At every moment
<br />
there are multitudes of clones of me doing different things. But I am
<br />
not aware of any of them. So, in the definition that ' I '  is what I
<br />
experience, when we talk about the multiverse, it is still true that
<br />
*I am not my clones*. I am not happy with the fact that many clones
<br />
are winning the lottery right now!
<br />
<br />So the same with death. If there is nothing external to the material brain,
<br />
then death is just another state of that organ. If we die, it simply means
<br />
that that organ will have no more sensorial or mental experiences. No
<br />
reason for us to jump to the closest clone in order to have some
<br />
experience. If we are no more than the matter that the brain is composed
<br />
of, we should not leave that brain. Even though the brain is decomposing,
<br />
it is still there. It is just not aware of anything anymore.
<br />
To say that we MUST have an experience is a very strong
<br />
assumption which should not be justified for the materialist. It is no
<br />
surprise to be unconscious. People are unconscious when they are
<br />
anesthetized, as someone here pointed out. Death is then just
<br />
permanent unconsciousness.
<br />
<br />-Eric.
