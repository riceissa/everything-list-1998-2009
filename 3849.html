<br />
I'm reading David Lewis' book, &quot;Plurality of Worlds,&quot; 1986.
<br />
<br />Lewis argues that not only are all possible worlds possible, but that 
<br />
they actually exist. He does not claim they exist in any form we can 
<br />
visit, or communicate with, but that the most economical philosophical 
<br />
position to take is that they do in fact actually exist.
<br />
<br />Lewis is no dummy. (Actually, Lewis _was_ no dummy: he died last year. 
<br />
My very usage above and here of the present tense, as in  &quot;Lewis argues 
<br />
that,&quot; is a kind of illustration of the weaker form of the plurality of 
<br />
worlds thesis. Namely, it is natural to take a subjunctive (&quot;had it been 
<br />
the case&quot;) or possible world and treat it as a real world. For example, 
<br />
arguing in the present tense by treating even a dead author as if he 
<br />
were amongst us: &quot;Aristotle tells us...&quot;
<br />
<br />This is recommended reading for Everything subscribers. Lewis has _some_ 
<br />
familiarity with the MWI, and cites Niven's 1968 story, &quot;All the Myriad 
<br />
Ways.&quot; But Lewis is not depending on a physics interpretation for his 
<br />
thesis, although the physical (MWI or Tegmark/Schmidhuber/etc.) theories 
<br />
of mulitiple realities would fit in as a subset of Lewis' plurality of 
<br />
worlds.
<br />
<br />The strong form of the thesis, that all possible (no violations of 
<br />
logic) worlds have actual existence is dubbed &quot;modal realism.&quot; A weaker, 
<br />
more common-sensical form is called &quot;ersatz modal realism.&quot; This is form 
<br />
in which we can temporarily instantiate possible worlds, as, for 
<br />
example, &quot;In a world where Microsoft had never existed, the software 
<br />
industry probably would have....&quot;
<br />
<br />I'm deliberately not choosing whether to believe the strong form, though 
<br />
it seems natural that everyone would believe the weak form. What's more 
<br />
useful at this point is to learn the methods of reasoning these analytic 
<br />
philosophers use, at least in this one world of counterfactuals and 
<br />
possible worlds. (As you may recall, I am very interested in the links 
<br />
between possible worlds and toposes, notably that the natural logic of a 
<br />
possible worlds model is Heyting logic. A colleague/fellow writer of 
<br />
Lewis's is Saul Kripke, who did interesting work in the 1960s showing 
<br />
the connections between Intuitionism and possible worlds semantics.)
<br />
<br />The weaker form of modal reality is used by nearly every person to 
<br />
describe the possible worlds of the future: &quot;Tomorrow it may rain.&quot; &quot;I 
<br />
can see a world in which peace exists.&quot; And so on for millions of 
<br />
examples. We also use possible worlds semantics when discussing 
<br />
alternative theories of how things happened: &quot;Maybe the way it worked 
<br />
was like this...&quot; and &quot;Had the Second World War not happened, the atom 
<br />
bomb wouldn't have been developed.&quot;
<br />
<br />Alas, David Lewis uses some math in his books, especially in an earlier 
<br />
one I also have called &quot;Counterfactuals,&quot; but the math is somewhat 
<br />
lacking in its generality. (Reading &quot;Counterfactuals,&quot; 1973, all I could 
<br />
think was &quot;This man is reinventing parts of point set topology! Give him 
<br />
a copy of Kelley's &quot;General Topology&quot; and let him use the accepted 
<br />
jargon for his inventions.&quot;)
<br />
<br />It seems to to me that there are several communities (worlds) of writers 
<br />
and researchers in this general area of &quot;multiple realities&quot; and they 
<br />
have only tangential and fleeting communcation with each other:
<br />
<br />* the &quot;traditional&quot; world of MWI, Everettistas, consistent histories, De 
<br />
Witt, Hartle, etc., with newcomers like Tegmark and Schmidhuber (adding 
<br />
models of computation)
<br />
<br />* the philosophical world of Kripke, Lewis, Montague, and others, with a 
<br />
focus on possible worlds semantics, reasoning in different worlds, 
<br />
ontology, etc. This world somewhat intersects the above world through 
<br />
the medium of fiction. Novels are examples of possible worlds, and &quot;What 
<br />
if&quot; novels are a staple of science fiction. Larry Niven, Phil Dick, Rudy 
<br />
Rucker, Greg Egan, and many others have even written thoughtfully about 
<br />
what MWI means. Their novels discuss possible worlds and are in fact 
<br />
themselves possible worlds.
<br />
<br />* the world of topos theory and study of synthetic realities derived 
<br />
from propositions, with the work of Lawvere, Johnstone, Kock, and 
<br />
others. This world intersects the possible worlds semantics world 
<br />
through the work of Kripke, as I said. It also is beginning to intersect 
<br />
the MWI world through the work of Chris Isham -- cf. that streaming 
<br />
video presentation I mentioned, at the URL:
<br />
<a href="http://www.newton.cam.ac.uk/webseminars/hartle60/1-isham/">http://www.newton.cam.ac.uk/webseminars/hartle60/1-isham/</a>
<br />
<br />Now it is my current interest to unify these three worlds, at least in 
<br />
my own mind.
<br />
<br />I do recommend taking a look at David Lewis's work. It's a bit off the 
<br />
beaten track for most MWI thinkers, but it clearly deals with the same 
<br />
general ideas. And it offers new language and new tools.
