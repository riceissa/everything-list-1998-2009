<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is my definition: a decision I make is &quot;free&quot; when I feel that I could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have decided otherwise.
</em><br />
<br />Is the question of &quot;free will&quot; just a matter of definitions?  Definitional
<br />
arguments are sterile and have no meaning.  If I define &quot;free will&quot; to be
<br />
a 14 pound bowling ball, then there, I've proven that free will exists.
<br />
But it's not a very useful approach.
<br />
<br />It is important to understand that there is more to the free will problem
<br />
than just definitions.  Before trying to define away the problem, it is
<br />
necessary to clearly state it and understand it.  The page I pointed to,
<br />
&lt;<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/</a>&gt;, goes on to do so in
<br />
the very next paragraph after the one I quoted:
<br />
<br />: 1.5 The Free Will Problem
<br />
:
<br />
: If we are to understand compatibilism as a solution to the free
<br />
: will problem, it would be useful to have some sense of the problem
<br />
: itself. Unfortunately, just as there is no single notion of free will
<br />
: that unifies all of the work philosophers have devoted to it, there is
<br />
: no single specification of the free will problem. In fact, it might be
<br />
: more helpful to think in terms of a range of problems. Regardless, any
<br />
: formulation of the problem can be understood as arising from a troubling
<br />
: sort of entanglement of our concepts, an entanglement that seems to lead
<br />
: to contradictions, and thus that cries out for a sort of disentangling. In
<br />
: this regard, the free will problem is a classic philosophical problem;
<br />
: we are, it seems, committed in our thought and talk to a set of concepts
<br />
: which, under scrutiny, appear to comprise a mutually inconsistent
<br />
: set. Formally, to settle the problem - to disentangle the set - we must
<br />
: either reject some concepts, or instead, we must demonstrate that the
<br />
: set is indeed consistent despite its appearance to the contrary.
<br />
: Just to illustrate, consider this set of propositions as an historically
<br />
: very well known means of formulating the free will problem. Call it the
<br />
: Classical Formulation:
<br />
:
<br />
:  1. Some person (qua agent), at some time, could have acted otherwise
<br />
:     than she did.
<br />
:  2. Actions are events.
<br />
:  3. Every event has a cause.
<br />
:  4. If an event is caused, then it is causally determined.
<br />
:  5. If an event is an act that is causally determined, then the agent
<br />
:     of the act could not have acted otherwise than in the way that
<br />
:     she did.
<br />
<br /><br />If you google on 'free will problem' you will find other
<br />
definitions and analyses which are similar.  Here is one from
<br />
the religious perspective, where these problems originally arose,
<br />
often in the context of God's omniscient knowledge of the future,
<br />
&lt;<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06259a.htm">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06259a.htm</a>&gt;:
<br />
<br />: The question of free will, moral liberty, or the liberum arbitrium of the
<br />
: Schoolmen, ranks amongst the three or four most important philosophical
<br />
: problems of all time. It ramifies into ethics, theology, metaphysics,
<br />
: and psychology. The view adopted in response to it will determine a man's
<br />
: position in regard to the most momentous issues that present themselves
<br />
: to the human mind. On the one hand, does man possess genuine moral
<br />
: freedom, power of real choice, true ability to determine the course
<br />
: of his thoughts and volitions, to decide which motives shall prevail
<br />
: within his mind, to modify and mould his own character? Or, on the other,
<br />
: are man's thoughts and volitions, his character and external actions,
<br />
: all merely the inevitable outcome of his circumstances? Are they all
<br />
: inexorably predetermined in every detail along rigid lines by events of
<br />
: the past, over which he himself has had no sort of control? This is the
<br />
: real import of the free-will problem.
<br />
<br />Another one, from the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy,
<br />
&lt;<a href="http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014">http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014</a>&gt;:
<br />
<br />: ... [I]n many human beings, the experience of choice gives rise to a
<br />
: conviction of absolute responsibility that is untouched by philosophical
<br />
: arguments. This conviction is the deep and inexhaustible source of the
<br />
: free will problem: powerful arguments that seem to show that we cannot
<br />
: be morally responsible in the ultimate way that we suppose keep coming
<br />
: up against equally powerful psychological reasons why we continue to
<br />
: believe that we are ultimately morally responsible.
<br />
<br />Maybe we don't like this way of formulating the problem, but if we are
<br />
going to continue to debate it, we ought to at least state what the
<br />
problem is.
<br />
