Yes I think this is correct.
<br />
<br />The theoretical zero amplitude region in the interference plane of the
<br />
wires is also of zero width, while on the other hand the wires are
<br />
obviously finite width. The wires do interact with the photons in
<br />
reality, or equivalently, diffract the waves coming from the slits. So
<br />
in the end each detector will detect photons coming from both slits. If
<br />
you covered up one of the slits, but left the wires in place, both
<br />
detectors will detect photons originating from the slit.
<br />
<br />So complementarity (if defined as exclusive particle/wave observation)
<br />
has not been disproven. The particle-tracking information from each slit
<br />
is destroyed by interaction with the wires.

Subject: Re: Quantum Rebel
<br />
<br /><br />It seems (to me, et al.) that the (supposed) information
<br />
Afshar gets about the &quot;which way&quot; at the screen, is
<br />
different from the usual information about the &quot;which way&quot;
<br />
one gets at the slits, or from the (probabilistic) information about the
<br />
&quot;which way&quot; one can have even before the slits (in case of asymmetry).
<br />
This seems to be the point.
<br />
<br />So there is a problem here. Because we know that information about the
<br />
&quot;which way&quot; at (or before) the slits does destroy the interference
<br />
pattern completely (partially if the information has a probabilitic
<br />
nature).
<br />
<br />On the contrary the &quot;which way&quot; information Afshar thinks he gets (via
<br />
those lenses) at the screen, does not destroy the interference pattern
<br />
(at the wires, which is a different place and time from the screen). So
<br />
how Afshar gets this information? Via optics, geometrical optics,
<br />
straight lines.
<br />
<br />That is to say that a photon goes following straight lines between the
<br />
slit and the detector, but (apparently) goes &quot;interferential&quot; at the
<br />
wires. (I wrote apparently because at the wires, imo, there is no
<br />
measurement, but a &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;non-demolitive&quot; or &quot;weak&quot;
<br />
measurement). All that seems not consistent. So the information  Afshar
<br />
gets at the screen, via those lenses, is not real, or proper. Because
<br />
the conservation of momentum (the conservation of distribution of
<br />
momentum) forbids all that, imo.
<br />
<br />----------------
<br />
<br />[fwding what Basil Hiley thinks ...]
<br />
<br />Thanks for the copy of the New Scientist's article about Afshar's
<br />
experiment.  Unfortunately it is no challenge to Bohr's position. How on
<br />
earth does he know the photons arriving at detector 1 come from pinhole
<br />
1 when both pinholes are open?  You cannot use ray optics in the region
<br />
where the light from the two pinholes overlap so you cannot draw any
<br />
such conclusion.
<br />
<br />Lets look at the claim a little more closely. Afshar is quoted as saying
<br />
&quot;According to my experiment one of the key assumptions about quantum
<br />
theory is wrong.&quot;  Ok what assumption?  The article doesn't say. It
<br />
mutters something about Bohr and goes on to say &quot;When faced with a
<br />
classical apparatus these mysterious quantum entities will either show a
<br />
particle-like or a wave-like face.&quot;  Where has this sloppy thinking come
<br />
from?
<br />
<br />Bohr never said any such thing.  What Bohr actually said was 'However,
<br />
since the discovery of the quantum of action, we know that the classical
<br />
ideal cannot be attained in the description of atomic phenomena. In
<br />
particular, any attempt at an ordering in space-time leads to a break in
<br />
the causal chain, since such an attempt is bound up with an essential
<br />
exchange of momentum and energy between the individuals and the
<br />
measuring rods and clocks used for observation; and just this exchange
<br />
cannot be taken into account if the measuring instruments are to fulfil
<br />
their purpose. Conversely, any conclusion, based in an unambiguous
<br />
manner upon the strict conservation of energy and momentum, with regard
<br />
to the dynamical behaviour of the individual units obviously
<br />
necessitates a complete renunciation of following their course in space
<br />
and time'. [Bohr, Atomic Theory and the Description of Nature, pp. 97-8,
<br />
Cambridge University Press, 1934]
<br />
<br />Notice the phrase 'following their course in space and time'. This is
<br />
not a discussion about particles 'behaving only like waves or only like
<br />
particles'. It is about 'following' or 'looking at' the process using
<br />
some suitable instrument.  So if you 'look at' each photon as it passes
<br />
through one pinhole you won't get an interference pattern. Even the Bohm
<br />
approach agrees with that.
<br />
<br />OK after that little rebuff we finally come to Afshar's real claim. It
<br />
is that his experiment is &quot;recording the rate at which photons are
<br />
coming through each pinhole&quot;.  If this statement was correct then it
<br />
would imply that &quot;there should be no interference pattern&quot; where the
<br />
beams overlap. &quot;But there is, Afshar says&quot;.
<br />
<br />Sure there is an interference effect simply because Afshar's experiments
<br />
do not 'follow' anything and they do not 'look at' each photon as it
<br />
passes through a pinhole. He is simply collecting and counting the
<br />
distribution of photon arrivals at his two detectors. Then he makes
<br />
inferences about what could possibly be going on and concludes,
<br />
incorrectly that a photon detected in the 'photon detector for pinhole
<br />
1' came from pinhole 1.  However that conclusion is based on the
<br />
assumption that the rays emanating from pinhole 1 arrive at the 'photon
<br />
detector for pinhole 1'. But the ray picture breaks down as soon as you
<br />
enter the region of overlap of the two beams and you cannot conclude
<br />
that the photon entering pinhole 1 arrives at the 'photon detector for
<br />
pinhole 1'. You haven't measured which pinhole each photon passed
<br />
through so you have not contradicted Bohr.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately Afshar's conclusion,  &quot;According to my experiment one of
<br />
the key assumptions about quantum theory is wrong&quot; is incorrect.  His
<br />
conclusion is wrong simply because he doesn't understand the physical
<br />
optics that lies behind the experiment he is doing.
