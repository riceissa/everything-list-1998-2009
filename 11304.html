<br />
Bruno,
<br />
I started to read [the English version of] your discourse on Origin of
<br />
Physical Laws and Sensations. I will read more later. It is certainly
<br />
very interesting and thought provoking. It makes me think of 'Reasons
<br />
and Persons' by Derek Parfitt. His book is very dry in places but
<br />
mostly very well worth the effort of ploughing through it.
<br />
<br />As a non-mathematician I can only argue using my form of 'common sense'
<br />
plus general knowledge. [En passant - I am happy to see that your
<br />
French language discourse features a debate between Jean Pierre
<br />
Changeaux and a mathematician. Changeaux's book 'Neuronal Man' was a
<br />
major influence in setting me off on my quest to understand the nature
<br />
of consciousness. He helped me to find a very reasonable understanding
<br />
which makes a lot of sense of the world. Merci beacoup a JPC. :-]
<br />
<br />I dispute the assumption that we can consider and reify number/s and/or
<br />
logic apart from its incarnation. It is like the 'ceteris paribus' so
<br />
beloved of economists; it is a conceptual tool not a description of the
<br />
world.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you assume a primitive world. From this I can already infer you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to distrust the computationalist hypothesis in the cognitive science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree. That is what makes the human mind &quot;turing universal&quot;. When it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lacks memory space it extends itself through the use of pebble, wall,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc.
</em><br />
<br />There are practical and in-principle limits to what can be achieved
<br />
computationally. Any computational device, however much it might seem
<br />
to be divine, has to BE somewhere, instantiated in some form. This
<br />
means that no computer is ever going to fully emulate a system in the
<br />
real world. Problems preventing total emulation include, truncation of
<br />
numbers in calculation, arbitrary cut-offs in the accuracy of
<br />
measurements, and entropy. [The latter will manifest as 'Murphy's Law'
<br />
.]
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, are you really saying that mathematical truth (not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical expression that humans have developed to talk about that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical truth) is a human's construct.
</em><br />
<br />MP: Yes. To assume otherwise is to believe in a 'Truth' or 'Truths'
<br />
beyond that which we can sense, feel or think. That is OK, as long as
<br />
it is seen for the religious practice that it is. But in reality [I say
<br />
:-] we are limited to asserting the existence of self and world,
<br />
although we are very safe to do so due to the contradictions involved
<br />
in denying the existence of either self or world. All the rest is
<br />
descriptions of one sort or another.
<br />
<br />Would you say that the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number 17 was not a prime number at the time of the dinosaurs?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In which case you distrust the &quot;Arithmetical realism&quot; part of comp, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are remarkably coherent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />If dinosaurs could count and think with sufficient levels of
<br />
abstraction, presumably they would have come across prime numbers in
<br />
their spare time. Otherwise, like trees falling in the forests of the
<br />
early carboniferous which made very little 'sound', prime numbers would
<br />
have been very thin on the ground, so to speak.
<br />
<br />That said, I read with interest a year or two ago about certain kinds
<br />
of insects [I think they are in North America somewhere] which lie
<br />
dormant in the earth in some pre-adult stage for a PRIME number of
<br />
years, 11, 13, were chosen by different species. Apparently the payoff
<br />
for this strategy is that few predator species can match this length of
<br />
time, and repeating cycles of shorter periods cannot 'resonate' so as
<br />
to launch a large cohort of predators when the prey species produces
<br />
its glut after waiting for the prime number of years.
<br />
<br />I suspect that this could have started happening way back in the
<br />
Cretaceous or whenever.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That so much of what occurs in 'the world' CAN be represented by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; numbers and other mathematical/logical objects and processes, is better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; expained by assuming that the great 'IT' of noumenal nature is actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; made up of many simple elements [taken firstly in the general sense].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This underlying simplicity which yet combines and permutates itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; into vast complexity, is something we infer with good reason - it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; works!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This would make sense if you can specify those simple elements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have you heard about Bell, Kochen and Specker and other weird facts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predicted and verified from quantum mechanics. I am afraid such simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elements are already rule out empirically, even, with the Many World
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptions.
</em><br />
<br />I fail to see what is the problem here. You cannot separate number from
<br />
that which is numbered, except as a mental trick, but within the brain
<br />
mathematical objects are instantiated within neural networks.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now even mentioning quantum mechanics, I refer to my work (see the URL)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for an argument showing that the hypothesis that we are turing emulable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at some level (whatever that level) entails the laws of physics have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be explained without assuming a physical primitive world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course this refutes the current Aristotelian Naturalistic paradigm,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but does rehabilitate Plato and the neoplatonist conception of matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Plotinus).
