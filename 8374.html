<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Stephen,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Can atoms exist in a 2D universe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I remember having read that 17 sort of atoms can exist in some natural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2-dimensional QM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know if this is related to the anyons and Hall effects where 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particles are squeezed in two dimensional trap (by powerful magnetic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; field).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems in line with my recollections. I have been looking into this 
<br />
idea of dimensionally contrained physics and there seems to be a huge amount 
<br />
of interesting features and properties that are very unexpected. One of 
<br />
which is the behavior of quasicrystals.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://srs.dl.ac.uk/Annual_Reports/AnRep01_02/pdf/26_27%20Quasicrystals.pdf">http://srs.dl.ac.uk/Annual_Reports/AnRep01_02/pdf/26_27%20Quasicrystals.pdf</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is diverging from the topic! It seems that if we are going to 
<br />
take seriously the idea of 1D or 2D, or whatever D universes, then we have 
<br />
to base our reasoning on models that do not start off by assuming that the 
<br />
universe is &quot;embedded&quot;; otherwise we are just pushing the supervenience 
<br />
question under the rug. It is far better, IMHO, to deal with these kinds of 
<br />
universes as completely independent and deal with the consequences of that 
<br />
independence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have independent reason that the 2-dim topological space (and 2 + 1) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuous deformation are quite important in fundamental physics. But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this has not yet been extracted from comp (to be sure).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; AFAIK, physics is very different when constrained to only 2D. My point is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that the notion of computation is meaningless if there is no possibility 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of a stable structure on and in which to implement the computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is false imo. A computation can be given a sense in pure arithmetic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (if only by Godel's arithmetization device).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, but if you are going to do this does it not make sense that all 
<br />
notions that involve or requires some notion of  &quot;time&quot; and &quot;perception&quot; be 
<br />
striped away from your notion of computation? If this is done faithfully, 
<br />
what happens to the notion of computation itself? It vanishes like 
<br />
Theaetetus'  boat infested with termites!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seem unable to understand how you can obtain a coherent notion of 
<br />
numbers interacting and 'knowing&quot; other numbers without some ansatz of 
<br />
physicality? It seems that you think that you can postulate a logical 
<br />
structure L that is coherent given some scafolding-like structure L* that 
<br />
can vanish after the construction is done and then turn around that L* was 
<br />
never really necessary for L to exist in the first place. Why not just admit 
<br />
that the scafolding of physicality is an a priori necessity?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you postulate a physical universe at the start, you need to postulate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some ad-hoc highly non comp thesis to attach the first person to it.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right back at you, Bruno! Your notion of computation requires some kind 
<br />
of perception ab initio in order to even be meaningful. You seem to not be 
<br />
able to go further than an inversion of your Ideal Monism. I salute you for 
<br />
appearing to defend the idea that the physical world is epiphenomena of 
<br />
Numb3rs, but I am not postulating anything: I am merely trying to not assume 
<br />
ideas that require more than I have available here and now in the physical 
<br />
world.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I am blinded by a Popperian bias, and thus I enjoy this exchange. 
<br />
I confess that I find your theory to be very elegant, with the tiny &quot;beauty 
<br />
mark&quot; of epiphenomenalism, but there is still a lot of hand-waving going one 
<br />
in it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Platonic Numbers or bit-strings have no ability to do anything by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; themselves (by definition!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But numbers can do things by themselves relatively to other (universal) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers. That is what computer science is all about, I think.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Bruno, your theory prohibits *any* kind of notion that involves 
<br />
*change*. That is its Achilles Heel.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and thus appeals to their existence are vacuous.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recap, it seems to me (and I am not even a tyro and thus very well 
<br />
could be merely a confirmed fool here) that in the thesis that Numb3rs are 
<br />
Everything and physicality is some kind of 1st person epiphenomenona of 
<br />
numbers is such that we can not smuggle into our postulates notions that are 
<br />
contrary to the definition of Numb3rs.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numb3rs are timeless unchanging and non-dependent of instantiations 
<br />
according to your Arithmetic Realism and thus it is your burden to show how 
<br />
*change* (even as a epiphenomena) can emerge from Changelessness.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg05450.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg05450.html</a>

<br />
etc.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must confess to be biased toward an inversion of this idea, in a 
<br />
sense, where changelessness is a &quot;fixed point&quot; aspect of fundamental 
<br />
Becoming, but am happy to be wrong.
<br />
<br />Onward!
<br />
<br />Stephen
