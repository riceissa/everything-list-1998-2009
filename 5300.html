<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The big difference between ethical and aesthetic axioms and the axioms of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;empirical science is that the latter are so widely accepted that they are

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not even recognised as axioms, for the most part. If I say &quot;water boils at

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;100 degrees celcius&quot;, this can be proved or disproved to the satisfaction 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of just about anyone by measuring the temperature of boiling water on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;several different occasions with several different thermometers. The means 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of verification contains as it were &quot;hidden&quot; axioms: that checking the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;boiling point several times with different equipment and obtaining 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consistent results allows one to generalise about the boiling point of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;substance under certain conditions. One could go a level deeper and point 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;out the (axiomatic) assumption that a physical law proved here and now 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;applies to all time and space, the assumption that a logical deduction 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;applies to all possible universes, the &quot;axioms&quot; of logic itself, including 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rules for using the term &quot;axiom&quot;, definition of &quot;rule&quot;, definition of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;definition&quot;... Fortunately, we hardly ever have to go to such lengths in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scientific fields because everyone agrees on the basic axioms. Now that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think of it, this could be used to define a field as a science: a field is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a scientific field when the underlying axioms are well-defined and not in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dispute by the scholars in that field.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This all stands in stark contrast to ethics and aesthetics, where 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;axiomatic statements (defined as statements taken as given, not dependent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on any more basic assumptions) are in dispute all the time. For the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;record, I am all in favour of being nice to people, opposed to torture and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;murder, etc. I take these as &quot;axiomatic&quot;, meaning that I cannot give a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more basic reason behind my acceptance of these beliefs. Some philosophers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;may push the axiom one level lower, and say, for example, &quot;murder is wrong 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;_because_ it decreases the net happiness in the world&quot;. In that case, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;axiom is the utilitarian belief that &quot;the good is the greatest happiness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the greatest number&quot;. However - and this is the point of this extended 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reply - there are many who would reject these axioms, especially if they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are not of a liberal democratic bent, and there is no way to argue against 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;them as being &quot;irrrational&quot; because if the axiom were rational or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;irrational it wouldn't be an axiom! If an advanced alien species decided 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to wipe us out because they regard us in the same way as we regard 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bacteria, do you seriously think you have a chance of convincing them they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are doing something &quot;evil&quot;? What will your argument be when they point out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the clause in the Handbook of Intergalactic Ethics which says (after the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;preamble where it says &quot;we hold these truths to be self-evident&quot;) &quot;...more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;advanced species have the right to enslave, consume or destroy less 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;advanced species.&quot; It isn't the same as if they got the boiling point of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;H2O wrong, is it?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />It is perhaps not as easy to get the H2O boiling point right, but you did 
<br />
not convince me of any fundamental impossibility of scientific ethic. 
<br />
Now,  I believe that if there is any scientific ethic
<br />
then it cannot be  normative and cannot give moral injunctions. It will 
<br />
only give theories, which can be applied to solve problems like &quot;if you 
<br />
agree with this and that principle of ethic then you should agree with such 
<br />
and such other principles&quot;. You tell me that there will be too much 
<br />
theories. But I can imagine that some will win, or that some will be 
<br />
deduced from other more basic principles.
<br />
<br />I don' t really believe that there are scientific fields, I believe there 
<br />
exists scientific attitude which consists in trying to be the clearest 
<br />
possible with oneself and the other, and I believe that is valuable 
<br />
relatively to any question pertaining either in the &quot;human&quot; or &quot;exact&quot; 
<br />
fields, which are today artificially separated (making both of them less 
<br />
exact and less humane).
<br />
<br />Anyone having some understanding of science know that it goes from the 
<br />
doubt to more doubts, from astonishment to more astonishment, from vanity 
<br />
to modesty; so that reason can only make bigger our possibilities, falsify 
<br />
our reductions and pinpoint toward the vastness of our ignorance; so that 
<br />
(and that's a theorem with comp) scientific attitude is ethical by itself 
<br />
by making you *ever* more modest, and cautious.
<br />
It is only a reductionist view of science which is in contradiction with 
<br />
the idea of scientific theology.
<br />
<br />The interest of Godel's theorem in this setting is that it demolishes in 
<br />
one strike a giant class of reductive views on &quot;just&quot; the world of numbers 
<br />
and machine. In the same vain deontic logic exemplifies the natural 
<br />
complexity and intractability of ethical questions: actually in any open 
<br />
rich domain science just gives negative hints of the type: it is not that, 
<br />
neither this, nor ....  With comp there could even be some metatheorem like 
<br />
&quot;any normative ethical theory&quot; is unethical, etc.
