<br />
Here is my response to Bruno's UDA argument as described in the links
<br />
from <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html</a>.
<br />
<br />I agree with the general idea, that if we assume that a UDA program
<br />
exists in some sense (Platonic or otherwise), then each observer moment
<br />
is instantiated multiple times (probably a countably infinite number of
<br />
times) throughout the structure generated by the UDA.  In that case we
<br />
have to accept that our mental experiences are not unique to some universe
<br />
(by &quot;universe&quot; I mean the output of one program being simulated by the
<br />
UDA) but are present in infinitely many of them.
<br />
<br />However there are a few places where I would expand upon the steps, and
<br />
take issue with some of them.  First, as far as the basic idea of COMP,
<br />
I do agree that functional substitution is enough for consciousness
<br />
indistinguishable from my own.  I would expand on this to explain that
<br />
the reason for this belief is not due to philosophy, but to biology.
<br />
<br />The way the brain works appears to be a matter of processing information
<br />
via electrochemical signals transmitted by neural cells.  Each such cell
<br />
is acting as an information processor.  The collection of these cells
<br />
in the brain takes in information on incoming nerves, and sends out
<br />
commands on outgoing nerves.  Everything is information.  So it seems to
<br />
me that replacing this system with something that can process information
<br />
in a functionally equivalent way would produce an equivalent system.
<br />
If I didn't know that the brain worked in this way, I would probably
<br />
not accept COMP.
<br />
<br />However, based on some arguments which Wei Dai gave (and which I'm not
<br />
sure if he accepts), I believe there are some aspects of consciousness
<br />
which are not fully captured by a purely functional substitution.
<br />
Specifically, as we get into the questions about duplications, I
<br />
believe that some details of the functional substitution may affect the
<br />
first-person likelihood of experiencing that implementation.  Issues such
<br />
as the speed, size and degree of redundancy of an implementation may
<br />
affect how much &quot;measure&quot; it has, that is, how much of a contribution
<br />
it makes to the space of all my first-person experiences.
<br />
<br />If we jump to the end of Bruno's argument, step 10 or 11, and accept
<br />
that we are instantiated in multiple forms, it is obvious that not
<br />
all ways we could be instantiated are equally probable.  Otherwise the
<br />
universe we observe would be chaotic.  So somehow it must be the case
<br />
that implementations which exist in simple and lawful universes are more
<br />
probable (in the first person sense) than those in random universes.
<br />
<br />Given that we accept the reality of different measures for different
<br />
implementation states, I think we need to consider the possibility that
<br />
not all functional substitutions have equal measure (i.e. first-person
<br />
probability).  I won't go into the details here, but I think a detailed
<br />
argument shows that different sizes and speeds of the functional
<br />
substitution must make a difference in measure.
<br />
<br />Several of Bruno's questions raise the idea of quantifying the first
<br />
person probability of various duplication scenarios.  In the comment
<br />
preceding question 7 in <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2992.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2992.html</a>,
<br />
he writes:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The way to quantify the indeterminacy is the unknown. Although we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argue that the {W, M} duplication gives a sort of perfect 1-coin, simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilty reasoning leads quickly to hard problems.
</em><br />
<br />I think Bruno agrees here that you can't just say that if you have 2
<br />
duplicates made, you therefore have a 50% first-person probability of
<br />
experiencing each of them.  We have discussed various paradoxes and
<br />
problems that arise with this kind of reasoning.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless he asks in questions 7 and 8, *if* we accept a 50%
<br />
probability in one experiment, will we also see it in another?  I am not
<br />
sure how to answer these, because I don't have a good understanding of
<br />
how to begin to quantify the probabilities.  So I cannot answer in the
<br />
affirmative, but I can't deny the possibility either.  I have to answer
<br />
that I need to get a better understanding of what aspects are relevant
<br />
in understanding probabilities.
<br />
<br />Likewise in question 10, where we assume a UDA is actually implemented
<br />
in the physical universe, I believe it is possible that the measure
<br />
of the implementations in the UDA may be smaller than the measure of
<br />
biological physical implementations.  So while the UDA machine will
<br />
produce copies of my mental state, it might turn out that they make
<br />
an insignificant contribution in terms of first-person probability,
<br />
compared to the contributions from the physical universe.  (For the
<br />
purposes of question 10, we assume that the physical universe exists.)
<br />
<br />To sum up, I agree with Bruno (I think) on the following points:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- Functional substitution is adequate to maintain consciousness
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- Mental states must be (in some sense) shared across all equivalent
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;functional implementations
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- The UDA program produces multiple functional equivalents of all possible
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observers
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- If we accept a certain view of Platonic reality of mathematics, then the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UDA exists even if it is not implemented in our reality
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- In that case our current mental states can be viewed as being created
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by a UDA or some similar program
<br />
<br />I may disagree on some points:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- Not all functional substitutions have equal measure
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- Universes are well defined: each universe is the output of one of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;programs which are simulated in &quot;dovetailed&quot; fashion by the UDA
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- Each observer-moment spans a specific set of universes - that is, those
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specific programs which functionally implement it
<br />
<br />And my very tentative theory for measure, which was first proposed by
<br />
Wei Dai:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- The measure of an observer-moment is proportional to the fraction of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;programs that implement it, and proportional to the fraction of each
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;programs' trace that it occupies.  That is, observer moments have
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;higher measure if they are implemented by more programs, and also if
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they use up more of the &quot;resources&quot; of the universe created by each
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of these programs.
