</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno, I agree with everything in points 1-7 of the post I'm referring to.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Cool.
<br />
(Kory is referring  to my post
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m5384.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m5384.html</a>  )
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think I understand the main thrust of points 8 and 10, but they both 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;depend on the truth of the quoted point 9.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not at all.  The point 8 follows only from the points 1-7. Actually the points
<br />
1 to 8 sum up the main result of my thesis, that is the reversal
<br />
physics/machine's psychology (once we assume comp).
<br />
This made the point 9 just a mathematical confirmation.
<br />
I will try to explain, but actually it is me who does not understand why
<br />
you don't see that the point 8 follows from the point 1-7.
<br />
The proof really stop at 8.
<br />
9 is a mathematical confirmation with
<br />
observer modelized (or even identify) with &quot;equivalence class&quot; of
<br />
states of sound universal Turing machines.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I find this point [9] highly dubious, and I'm interested to hear more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about why you believe it (or whether I'm actually interpreting it correctly).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />OK. I promise I will try to make it clear, but that will be possible
<br />
only if you realize that 8 follows from 1-7. Keeping we assume comp all 
<br />
through.
<br />
I will first continue to comment your post, as a sort of preparation.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is it your contention that if we start only with the idea of Platonia 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(which contains all possible computational structures and &quot;events&quot;), and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we analyze the structure of all possible 1st-person histories weaving 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their way through this Platonia, we would see that a majority of them find 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;themselves in universes like the one we currently inhabit, with stars, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;galaxies, relativity, quantum physics, etc.?
</em><br />
<br /><br />No. Such a contention is not mine. What you say here
<br />
does not follow from neither 1-8, nor 9.
<br />
Only the laws of physics follows, but the existence of the moon
<br />
or of galaxies are not necessarily &quot;laws of physics&quot;, but are
<br />
quite possibly &quot;geographical laws&quot; (like being in Moscow
<br />
instead of Washington). Now the stability of
<br />
the appearance of matter is related to the laws of physics,
<br />
and so, if (to talk like you) we analyze the structure of all
<br />
possible 1st-person histories going trough your actual
<br />
Kory-Heath state (including your memory of stars and
<br />
galaxies) then the measure of your computational
<br />
continuations in Platonia without stars and galaxies
<br />
will (or should) be negligible. The disappearance of galaxies
<br />
could be seen as a &quot;talking white rabbit&quot; event.
<br />
So, only worlds with entities very similar to Kory Heath
<br />
should contains galaxies. If this was false (in Platonia)
<br />
then comp would be false (and refutable).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I find that extremely hard to believe; there are an infinite number of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multi-dimensional cellular-automata worlds that contain nothing like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stars, galaxies, or the familiar physics we know,
</em><br />
<br /><br />But then they don't contain entities sufficiently
<br />
close to Kory Heath, (they don't go through Kory-Heath comp
<br />
states) and those world/stories don't belong to your
<br />
actual first person indeterminacy domain.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;and I don't see any reason to believe that all the 1st-person histories 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;weaving their way through these computational structures (which surely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist in Platonia) have less measure than those that weave through the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structures more resembling our own universe.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are right. No doubt there are worlds without stars
<br />
and galaxies, but having srats and gilixas instead, and
<br />
some Burno arguing to some Kyro about the geographical
<br />
nature of those objects. Nothing in 1-8 prevents this.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I find it much easier to believe - in fact, it seems almost necessarily 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;true - that, when we analyze the structure of all the 1st-person histories 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;weaving their way through Platonia, we see that virtually all observers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observe indeterminacy. This in itself seems like a non-trivial finding. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be even more non-trivial if one could analyze the structure of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indeterminacy that virtually all 1st-person observers must observe, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;find that it is very much like &quot;quantum logic&quot;. This seems to be one of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your claims, and it certainly seems possible (though I don't know enough 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;yet to judge the issue for myself). However, it's a much further leap to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conclude that we can go on to derive &quot;the laws of physics&quot; from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;analysis of 1st-person histories weaving their way through Platonia. In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the quote above, you acknowledge that you haven't actually done this - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;actually I have derived only the logical structure of the probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one, but I got something non trivial and very close to a quantum logic&quot; - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but you seem to believe that it can be done. Why?
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right, you miss something. As I said, I feel *I* miss
<br />
something because it seems to me that the point 8 follows
<br />
directly from 1-7. (I suggest people print the post
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m5384.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m5384.html</a>
<br />
for having the 1-9 points in front of the eyes). Point 10
<br />
is not necessary because it concerns the particular
<br />
question by Brett Hall. First let me copy the point 8,
<br />
and let me rewrite it more carefully (if not less
<br />
diplomatically!).
<br />
<br />Point 8: (original version from post 5384)
<br />
<br />8) So, if we are being simulated by a massive computer somewhere
<br />
in a real universe, then to make any first person verifiable prediction
<br />
we must take into account all the possible computations going through
<br />
our actual state. So &quot;the laws of physics&quot;, which we can temporarily
<br />
define as the laws of whatever we can predict consistently, should
<br />
be given by a measure on those 1-person computational histories.
<br />
<br />Point 8bis: (Attempt toward a clearer ameliorated version. I have
<br />
also make some emphases):
<br />
<br />8bis) So, if we are being simulated by a massive computer
<br />
somewhere in a real universe, then to make ANY first person
<br />
verifiable prediction, we must take as domain of 1-person
<br />
indeterminacy all the possible maximal consistent  computational
<br />
computations GOING THROUGH, AND FROM, OUR ACTUAL STATE,
<br />
and existing in Platonia (more precisely in UD*, which is the complete
<br />
infinite execution of the Universal Dovetailer).
<br />
Let us (re)defined the laws of physics as the laws we can
<br />
always predict and verify consistently (if any!).
<br />
Now, having accepted the 1-7 points, the occurrence of such
<br />
laws must have a measure 1, so the laws of physics must be
<br />
derivable from what has measure 1 relatively to the measure
<br />
on the computational histories. OK?
<br />
<br /><br />Let me illustrate a simple experiment in physics. Let us
<br />
decide to let a chalk fallen. And let us compare some theories.
<br />
A) The naive common sense theory: As far as I remember
<br />
chalk always falls on the ground, so I infer that this will
<br />
happen again.
<br />
B) The first physicist: giving the laws F=ma, and Newton's
<br />
gravitation law, I can predict with reasonable accuracy
<br />
that the chalk will fall on the ground about here and about
<br />
that time.
<br />
C) The second physicist: the chalk is a many body
<br />
quantum object in interaction with many bodies, so let us
<br />
apply some gravitationnal form of Feynman summation on
<br />
all quantum computational histories. After some phase
<br />
randomization I can predict the chalk will fall here and at
<br />
some time with more than 60 correct decimals.
<br />
(He has been quick! I guess he used a quantum pocket
<br />
calculator!)
<br />
D) The computationalist: first let me bet on a comp level
<br />
of substitution (which exists *hopefully*), and let me bet
<br />
on my actual comp states, that is the one which describes
<br />
my brain/body state in front of the chalk which I will let
<br />
fallen. Now giving 1-7 (through comp) I &quot;know&quot; that
<br />
my future first person experience is giving by a sum (average)
<br />
on all computations (existing in Platonia) going from and
<br />
through that state, and RELATIVE to that state.
<br />
Obviously to compute that you need to run the complete
<br />
UD in finite time and that's impossible, also you would be
<br />
unable to recognize your own comp histories when described
<br />
at other levels, so the computationalist will probably just
<br />
answer &quot;uncomputable&quot;.
<br />
<br />But &quot;platonistically&quot; it remains that if comp is true
<br />
the actual physical invariant must emerge as an average
<br />
on ALL the maximal consistent extensions relative to our
<br />
actual states (worlds, observer-moments, whatever ...).
<br />
Although that can be proved useless for actually predicting the
<br />
behavior of the chalk, it is enough for deriving physics.
<br />
And that derivation goes in the reverse sense, that is, the
<br />
more easy part will be the abstract logical structures, but
<br />
that is enough for giving the geometry of the multiple histories.
<br />
<br />Well I must go now, and if I hurry myself to much I will
<br />
begin to be unclear ;-) Tell me if you have understand that
<br />
keeping faith in comp through 1-7 leads necessarily to 8.
<br />
Don't hesitate to give me an objection.
<br />
The only difficulty in &quot;8&quot;, I think, is to remember that
<br />
we *assume* comp.
<br />
<br />Then all what is needed for 9 (the mathematical confirmation)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is to accept to &quot;modelize&quot; or
<br />
better &quot;identify&quot; a platonistic observer by a sound modest
<br />
(lobian) universal church-turing-post-markov-fortran-lisp-
<br />
java-whatever machine (including quantum one).
<br />
And to interview it about those relative consistent
<br />
extensions and its inferable platonistic geometries
<br />
and what is stable in their discourses. That has been
<br />
made possible by the discovery of incompleteness
<br />
(Godel 31) and its &quot;axiomatizability&quot; (Solovay  76).
