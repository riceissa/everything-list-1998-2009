<br />If you move the neurons around but keep their connections in place
<br />
(stretch them somehow), and take some kind of steps so that the timing
<br />
of a signal to get from A to B stays the same, then it should not make
<br />
any difference in the brain function.  The brain will continue to operate
<br />
as usual.  It will process inputs and produce outputs in the same way.
<br />
The person will not report any differences in his sensations, in his
<br />
consciousness, or in any aspect of his brain's functionality.
<br />
<br />Now, you can argue that he is simply mistaken, that his consciousness is
<br />
completely different but he is unable to report it for some reason, but
<br />
this is a very difficult position to support.
<br />
<br />If you are talking about breaking the neural connections when you move
<br />
the neurons around, then they will no longer fire with the same patterns
<br />
they would have.  Neurons with broken connections won't fire, or will
<br />
do so randomly or haphazardly.  They will not produce the same firing
<br />
patterns they would have if they were hooked up correctly.  So there
<br />
will be no simple mapping between the old firing pattern and the new one.
<br />
<br />If you are talking about using some kind of artificial means to force
<br />
the neuron to fire with the pattern it would have used if it were still
<br />
connected (say, a little mechanical device which gives the neuron a
<br />
&quot;kick&quot; when it is supposed to fire) then how could the device know when
<br />
to fire the neuron?  You would have to be doing some kind of &quot;replay&quot; of
<br />
an already-recorded consciousness, I think.  But as I have been arguing,
<br />
such &quot;replays&quot; are not perceptible to the consciousness involved.
<br />
I can't tell right now whether I am being instantiated just once or an
<br />
infinite number of times.
