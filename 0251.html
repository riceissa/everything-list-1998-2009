&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exchange between James Higgo and Vic Stenger is interesting,
<br />
but I don't see the relation with my question : can we chose the proportion
<br />
of universes in which we decide to act in a certain way ? Or is this
<br />
proportion determinated by the laws of physics ? 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to some theories (cf Penrose), the non-determinism of
<br />
quantum physics may act on our behavior. Some structures in our neurones
<br />
called microtubules might amplify the non-determinism of the level of a
<br />
particle to the level of neurons. The behavior of a single particle may act
<br />
on one neuron and then on our behavior. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the distribution of probabilities of the different possible
<br />
states of this particle is determinated by the laws of physics. So it seems
<br />
to me that the distribution of probabilities (and then also the proportion
<br />
of universes) of the different behaviors of the neuron and of the man is
<br />
also determinated by the laws of physics.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that to have a real possibility of chosing this
<br />
proportion, there must be another level of choice (for example : choice
<br />
between [choice between ride with care with probability 0.9 and ride without
<br />
care with probability 0.1] and [choice between ride with care with
<br />
probability 0.1 and ride without care with probability 0.9]. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate that : imagine that the world is a tree and you are an
<br />
ant climbing to it. In the Copenhague interpretation, you can chose to climb
<br />
to one branch or another. In Many Minds interpretation there are in fact
<br />
several ants and a given proportion of them climbs to each branch. The
<br />
choice could still have a signification if it means to chose which ant we
<br />
are.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In MWI, and if suppose that spirit does not exist in duration but
<br />
only in an instant, we could represent this as if there were some fixed ants
<br />
all over the tree. In this case the choice does not mean anything.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there could be a possibility of choice if there are several
<br />
potential trees (with different proportions associated to the branches, or
<br />
even a different structure of the ramifications) and if we can chose one
<br />
tree which becomes real. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the exchange between James Higgo and Vic Stenger, the
<br />
idea of time arrow pointing in different directions is interesting. I wrote
<br />
a text about this idea :
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in english :
<br />
<a href="http://members.rotfl.com/log/text/reflmph/english/temps.htm">http://members.rotfl.com/log/text/reflmph/english/temps.htm</a>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in french :
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metaphysical reflections - The arrow of time
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important question about the models of the universe is time.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time appears to us like a linear succession with a causality
<br />
orientation,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from causes to effects. But the physicists have discovered that the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fundamental laws of physics are temporally symetric. How could we
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explain this ? 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physicists explain this with what they call the second principle
<br />
of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thermodynamics, according to which the total entropy (physical
<br />
measure of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disorder) of a system can only increase. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine what are the deep causes of this dissymetry. Let us
<br />
take
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an example. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vase falls on the ground and breaks into pieces. During the
<br />
falling, it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obeys to an approximatively symmetrical law. If we thow it up it
<br />
will follow
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approximatively the same trajectory if we ignore the resistance of
<br />
the air.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it reaches the ground, the deceleration produces forces greater
<br />
than
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those making its cohesion, and it breaks into pieces. These pieces,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following symmetrical laws, fall down on the ground, producing
<br />
vibrations
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of sound (ordered agitation of molecules) and warmth (unordered
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agitation). At the microscopic level, the agitation of the molecules
<br />
also
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obeys to symmetrical laws. So where does the dissymmetry come from ?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Couldn't we imagine that this phenomene happens reversed in time ?
<br />
Let
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us see what would happen then. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A warmth and a noise would cause vibrations of the ground. But these
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warmth and noise would not be any agitations of molecules but very
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particular agitations, such that the resulting vibrations would
<br />
throw up the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;debris of the vase in such a way that they would gather and remake
<br />
the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entire vase which is thrown up. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an event is theoretically possible but we do not observe it.
<br />
Why ?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dissymmetry comes from the fact that the initial conditions of
<br />
the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reverse processare so particular a very small perturbation would be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to prevent the result, but for the breaking, if the initial
<br />
conditions
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are a little different, the event would happen with little
<br />
modifications. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us imagine what would happen if a perturbation occurs. For
<br />
example, a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fly flies near the falling vase. The resulting moving of the air
<br />
modifies a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;little the trajectory of the vase and the pieces will be little
<br />
differents. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the reverse case, the fly would modify the very particular
<br />
molecular
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agitation which cause the vibrations which throw up the pieces and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gathers them. This perturbated molecular agitation would not give
<br />
this
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result and will remain an ordinary warmth and noise. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can feel where is the dissymmetry. We spontaneously tend to
<br />
consider
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the perturbations propagate toward future, and not past. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we considef that the laws of physics are not totally
<br />
deterministic and that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a place remains for free will, we could conceive that this free will
<br />
could act
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on both directions of time. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience shows that this free will acts only toward one
<br />
direction that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we call future. Why couldn't it act toward past ? Maybe because past
<br />
is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fixed and future is free, the universe is fixed at a fixation point
<br />
in the past,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Big Bang. The past being fixed, freedom could only act on
<br />
future. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could also imagine that there could exist several fixation
<br />
points, the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nearer from now being in our past, our Big Bang. Some scientists
<br />
think
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the expansion phase of the universe could be followed by a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contraction phase which will terminate by a Big Crunch, a reverse
<br />
Big
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang during which the universe will go back to its original state of
<br />
primitive
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;atom. But during this contraction phase, the arrow of time will
<br />
probably be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reversed, so that in fact it will be an expansion for those who will
<br />
live at
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this time, then the Big Crunch would not be the end of the universe
<br />
but
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another beginning with a time in reverse direction compared to our
<br />
time,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these two universes going one toward the other and gathering in a
<br />
phase
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of temporal stagnation during which time would be approximatively
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;symmetrical. In fact, there would not be three separated phases but
<br />
a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continuity. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us imagine how things could be perceived by an hypothetic living
<br />
being
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which would cross this temporal stagnation phase. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, when he is nearer from the Big Bang than from what
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appears to him as the Big Crunch, time appears to flow in one
<br />
direction,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from what he calls past to what he calls future. Then he begins to
<br />
perceive
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of inversion time some phenomenes. We perhaps already perceive a few
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;phenomenes of this kind, for example divination which could be
<br />
memory of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;future. He could also observe inversions between perceptions and
<br />
actions,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then will become more and more these phenomenes frequents, and in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;progressively he the zone will enter where will seem stagnation
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the symmetrical time him. sense normal the being like perceive will
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the following exchange with Vic Stenger:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Vic Stenger:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose humanity never evolved. There still will be supernovas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that spew out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particles in all directions and we need to explain why, greatly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separated in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space and not in contact, at least for ten billion years or so, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens in the same time direction. That is, we do not have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some spewing out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and some where the same particles converge to make a nice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stable star, carbon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turning back to hydrogen and deuterium, and so on. Or, why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (apparently) black holes and no white holes (maybe the gamma
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bursters are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; white holes, now that I think of it). As Huw Price makes it clear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I'm reading
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his whole book a second time, and working on my chapter on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time's arrow), this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is an unexplained puzzle--why the universe has this highly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; improbable state at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one extreme of the time axis and not the other, thus setting a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal arrow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of time for macroscopic (but not microscopic) systems.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; James Higgo:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Like so many other paradoxes, the question Vic asks about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supernovas having an arrow of time is shown to be meaningless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when you adopt Deutsch's view that time is an aspect of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship between 'snapshots' (individual 3-d universes) in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'multiverse'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Time's arrow points forwards, backwards, everywhichwayyou like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the multiverse - it just depends on how you want to look at it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Supernovas would 'exist' without us, but only if someone chose to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; string snapshots together so they saw supernovas. It's an infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse, but unless someone is looking along some axis, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningless to say this or that exist. Everything possible exists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We ourselves only exist in some of the tiny fibres of inter-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe connections along which time's arrow happens to point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forwards, along which 'cause' precedes 'effect'. Because,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; although the multiverse is infinite, we could only exist in this sort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of stable environment, where lots of things don't 'decay' at once.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Decay is not the phenomenon; that any two particles appear to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be related is the rarity. But in an infinite multiverse...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is pointless to talk about 'supernovas' *per se* - they are merely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a function of the way we string universes together. But there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very few such strings that would result in 'environments' in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; llife would evolve; of those, most if not all involve supernovas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Vic Stenger : This explanation borders on solipsim. It explains everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by explaining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing. We see no white holes or imploding supernovae in our universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this could be because this is just a statisical fluctuation. The average
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe has half of each and we are way out on the tail of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distribution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is very unsatisfying. Just giving up. &quot;Everything is possible.&quot; You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; welcome to do that. I would prefer to keep trying to see if there is some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-random reason for what we see in our universe. I do not think the WAP,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you use it with your fibers above, is enough.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; James Higgo: Vic, you may say that recourse to the WAP (weak anthropic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle) is 'giving up'.  But in the context of MWI it explains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything, such as the absence of vacuum collapses and all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sorts of nasties. It is also the basis for the wacky quantum theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of immortality, which is another reason for you to be prejudiced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against it. You seem to be denying the validity of WAP, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes intuitive sense, as piously as most people deny time's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arrow can point both ways. It isn't as 'satisfactory' as a nice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experimental 'proof' but what if this is as good as it gets? Perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe was not designed for satisfaction.
</em><br />
