Stathis has another good thought experiment.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are in a room strapped to an electric chair with a counter counting down 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from one minute. There are two buttons accessible to you on the chair, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; marked A and B. Pressing button A will cause the chair either to release 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you, with Pr=0.4, or immediately electrocute you, with Pr=0.6.
</em><br />
<br />Okay, so we loyal adherents of the MWI understand that in .6 of my measure,
<br />
I die instantly, and in .4 of my (constant) measure, I go free. So far, 
<br />
then, pressing A cuts down on my measure by sixty percent. Not good.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Pressing button B will cause the chair to immediately release
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you (i.e. with Pr=1), 
</em><br />
<br />ah, that's better
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it will also teleport itself along with a copy of you still strapped to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the chair to another room, where the countdown will continue.
</em><br />
<br />Oh goody. More runtime. Where do I sign up?  (True, there is a little
<br />
predicament, but it's not at all serious to me!)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When the counter reaches zero, you will be electrocuted. Meanwhile, you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; press the buttons as often as you want.
</em><br />
<br />You are TOO KIND!  I see a wonderful panorama of vastly, vastly increased
<br />
runtime opening up before me. Already my finger is flexed to press the
<br />
button just as fast as I can humanly manage! Surely I can do so several
<br />
hundred times in a whole minute.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The obvious thing to do would seem to be pressing button B - guaranteed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; freedom. However, when you press B, nothing seems to happen:
</em><br />
<br />Ah, what *seems* to happen.  Oh! how people are so often deluded by
<br />
mere appearances. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are still strapped to the chair, and the counter continues
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its countdown. [Correction: one instance of me is still strapped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the chair but many more instances have already been freed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have brain, and accurate information, and I know this.]  On
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; closer inspection, it does look as if the room is a little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different, so you conclude that you have actually been the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teleported copy. Undeterred, you press the button again, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again, and... every time it is just the same: 
</em><br />
<br />Yeah, just like the character in my story who was trying to get out
<br />
of the pit, sort-of realizing and sort-of not realizing that he both
<br />
succeeded *and* failed on each and every press of the button.
<br />
<br />It only *seems* to be the same to the instance still in the chair!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are still strapped to the chair in a room almost indistinguishable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the last one!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Desperately, you press button B as quickly as you can,
</em><br />
<br />Desperately?   Are you kidding?  With the greatest joy I can imagine!
<br />
Winning the California lottery is nothing compared to this!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but after over 100 presses it seems clear that however many times
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you press it, you will still end up strapped to the chair.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but I have a brain.  I know that this is only the appearance.
<br />
I *know* that in reality I am in many places enjoying much much
<br />
more of life than was ever, ever possible before.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What are you going to do when the counter reaches one second? Will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you keep pressing B, or will you try button A?
</em><br />
<br />I would never press A.  The button A is for people who don't
<br />
understand that they're programs, who don't understand that 
<br />
they can be in two places at the same time. In the last tenth
<br />
of a second hopefully I will still get in a button-press or two,
<br />
and for each additional button-press I manage to squeeze in,
<br />
there will be a new, liberated instance that gets more life for
<br />
<br />Lee Corbin!
