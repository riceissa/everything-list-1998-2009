<br />
To continue the development of the FAQ I need to focus more effort on 
<br />
filling in responses along the lines of model threads other than my own.
<br />
<br />In keeping with some suggestions and my own current opinion I will attempt 
<br />
to develop these responses on line.
<br />
<br />By some chance and some necessity I have elected to start with a thread 
<br />
based on post <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html</a> by Bruno 
<br />
Marchal which discusses the UDA. If the model thread is indeed different 
<br />
from mine then the responses can be developed by discussing these 
<br />
differences. While preparing the successive posts in this project I may 
<br />
naturally make changes to my own model thread responses since this FAQ 
<br />
writing process seems to make one really sharpen one's pencil.
<br />
<br />I start at the second entry under &quot;Background&quot;.  Any comments on the 
<br />
history of the list I presented?
<br />
<br />However, for reference I also give below part of the new response under the 
<br />
definition of information.
<br />
<br />----------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />What is &quot;information&quot;?
<br />
<br />General: At lest two kinds of information are discussed in the threads: 
<br />
Relative and Absolute.
<br />
<br />Relative information is the structure of a given pattern, bit string or 
<br />
other such structure both within the structure itself which would be just 
<br />
the relative position and style of its elements, and between structures in 
<br />
a larger whole which would be the relative styles, quantities, and 
<br />
positions of elements/patterns.
<br />
<br />Absolute information is based on mathematical structure and selection.  An 
<br />
example of mathematical structure absolute information would be the 
<br />
resolution of : The Everything is stable; true or false.  An example of 
<br />
absolute information based on selection would be the selection of a single 
<br />
pattern, bit string or other such structure out of a collection of such 
<br />
structures.
<br />
<br />As an example of total information the selection of a bit string consisting 
<br />
of all zero's would be a maximum of selection based absolute information 
<br />
while the string selected contains no relative information.
<br />
<br />-------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Below is the response in question.
<br />
<br />------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />What are the principles of the Everything effort?
<br />
<br />a) The UDA approach is to select for consideration all packets of relative 
<br />
information that can be generated by a type of Turing Machine called a 
<br />
Universal Dovetailer.  The Everything is considered to be this UD.
<br />
<br />b)
<br />
<br />c)
<br />
<br />d)
<br />
<br />e) In the pattern model approach the principles used are:
<br />
<br />i) Individual physical universes are isomorphic to some form of 
<br />
representation of a packet of relative information called a pattern.
<br />
<br />ii) Structures having all relative information packets simultaneously and 
<br />
uncountably infinitely repeated contain no net relative information.
<br />
<br />iii) The Everything must be structured so as to contain no net relative 
<br />
information and no absolute information [no selection].
<br />
<br />Currently the approach to do the above is to place all patterns absent any 
<br />
selection in all possible relative locations into the Everything an 
<br />
infinite number of times.  Further each manifestation of the Everything in 
<br />
its cyclic oscillation with the Nothing is a different random configuration 
<br />
of the patterns.  Thus the Everything is not static.  It is describable as 
<br />
a seething foamy fractal with random successor states.  In this approach 
<br />
the Everything is timeless because it is extinguished at each cycle and 
<br />
leaves no history.  For each physical universe &quot;time&quot; is the tolling of the 
<br />
transfers of its physical isomorphism from pattern to successor pattern 
<br />
within the Everything.  Any apparent uniformity of its quanta is an 
<br />
illusion subjective to that particular universe.
<br />
