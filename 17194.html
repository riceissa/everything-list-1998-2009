2009/8/10 Bruno Marchal &lt;marchal.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But strictly speaking (I am also a stickler), the first person can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never identify herself to *any* representation, she share this with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 0-person ONE, or the non differentiate (arithmetical) truth. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knower does not know who he is. Relatively to probable histories, he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes bets &quot;all the time&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I agree with this.  This is why I've always said that the One is
<br />
'personal' to some minimum but not-eliminable degree (0-personal in
<br />
your terminology).  The first person inherits the &quot;I&quot; from the One:
<br />
this is essential to make sense of duplicability and teleportation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Beyond this, that the unique qualitative nature of the OFP *is* as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; appears, is in principle outside the scope of explanation itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No! This is the &quot;miracle&quot; of comp. Machine cannot not discover the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incommunicable part of their experience, but they can, assume of bet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on comp, and justify that why it has to be so. That is AUDA. The gap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is justified from inside. It is a consequence from the fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine can prove their own incompleteness theorems, and even study
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the geometry of their ignorance.
</em><br />
<br />Apparently we don't agree :-(
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The ultimate gap remains unavoidable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so you are right saying that the unique qualitative nature of the OFP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is outside the scope of the explanation, but that fact, is an &quot;easy&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theorem on and by  the machine which introspect herself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To sum up:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The unique qualitative nature of the OFP *is* beyond the scope of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation-comp theory. But that very fact *is* in the scope of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory.
</em><br />
<br />Apparently we DO agree :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  IOW - as Bruno says above - they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theoretical constructions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, but this does not mean those construction does not refer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; something real independently of us, and this is what I assume for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree, as above that it is the whole point of our endeavours to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that the construction *refers* to something real.  But I think perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that the something thus referenced is not best characterised as being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; real *independently* of us, but rather *constitutive* of us and our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (most general) environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with you, but this can be said among enlightened people who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand the whole stuff.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Before the reasoning, you could be suspected to put the horse behind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the car.
</em><br />
<br />Or &quot;put the horse before the cart&quot;, in our delightfully archaic
<br />
phrase.  I am doing this, would you say?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; With comp, numbers, or finite things like combinators etc. have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clearly a relation with us, but a priori it is simpler to state their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws without referring to us.
</em><br />
<br />I agree that simpler is better as long as we are clear on what is being assumed.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A number is even if and only its square is even. This is a law about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers. Those are the type of truth which we have to state as not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depending on us &lt;here and now&gt;, even if it depends on us, or are us,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;there&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />OK
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Even if the whole existence get annihilated, 17 would still be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; prime.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I understand that it is justifiable to take this as your point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; departure and don't really wish to make an argumentative point out of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it.  Nonetheless, in passing, perhaps I have a more radical intuition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of annihilation than you.  One can waste a lot of breath speculating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on 'nothing' because, strictly I guess, there can be nothing at all it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can refer to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This I do not understand. There are many nothing everywhere, and other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absence, and I am open that absolute nothingness could be conceivable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a bit like theories having no models. It seems you just point here on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a difficult open question.
</em><br />
<br />Yes
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  I could demonstrate this, given infinite time, simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; by flatly rejecting *any* survivor of such annihilation that you or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; anyone cared to propose, to the crack of doom.  On this basis, even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; '17 is prime' is a goner.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still don't see why or how you could do that, except by convincing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me that Peano Arithmetic is inconsistent.
</em><br />
<br />I think we're at cross-purposes, but it really doesn't count much for
<br />
our discussion here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Ah, but my argument attempts to distinguish a computation (immaterial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dynamic object) and an implementation of a computation (material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dynamic process) - again, per standard physical theory - as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; refutation of standard comp *in these strictly physical terms*.  My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; point is, that per physicalism, a computation must be implemented in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some physical mechanism in order to have any real - i.e. physical -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; effects (at least this was true the last time I did any programming).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hence the existence of 'immaterial objects' in this case is simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; irrelevant to any effects that would be strictly justifiable as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ontologically real, per physicalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually I do disagree with this, and Peter Jones made good point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here. If you were true, UDA could be simplified a lot. Physicalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not prevent dualism form/matter at all, like immaterial software
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and physical hardware. Physicalism can still explained the existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the many immaterial being like nations, countries, persons (being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fuzzy on the 1-3 distinction), games, music, etc.
</em><br />
<br />OK, I hadn't realised that this point was quite so elusive, so now I
<br />
will have to insist a little more. There are two absolutely crucial
<br />
differences IMO between the examples you cite above (which Peter also
<br />
appeals to) and computation - per strict physicalism - conceived as
<br />
*constitutive* of the OFP (as contrasted with 3-description):
<br />
<br />1) All of your examples are in principle hierarchically reducible (per
<br />
physicalism) to *specific* nameable physical entities and relations,
<br />
and any change in these specifications produces an identifiable change
<br />
in the collective entity (e.g. different notes = different music).
<br />
One can't simply say e.g. that 'nation' is invariant in the face of
<br />
different collections of persons, since any such change is
<br />
unquestionably material to the persons actually constitutive of the
<br />
nation - and this is the point (i.e. it's still different notes =
<br />
different music).
<br />
<br />2) None of your examples (and indeed NO immaterial entity other than
<br />
computation) is postulated to evoke a novel ontological category such
<br />
as the OFP i.e. a 'nation' isn't something with an ontology distinct -
<br />
and in a different category - from that of the persons who constitute
<br />
it.
<br />
<br />Computationalism (i.e. when assumed to supervene on the activity of an
<br />
ontologically privileged physical substrate) violates both of the
<br />
above criteria: it is *invariant* (i.e. different notes = same music)
<br />
under inumerable different physical reductions (i.e. it is defined
<br />
functionally); and yet any such state of affairs (again excluding mere
<br />
3-descriptions) is asserted somehow to evoke an *identical* - and
<br />
moreover completely *novel* - ontological category.
<br />
<br />Consequently IMO the foregoing criteria make the computational theory
<br />
of mind a mere dogma under the criterion of strict physicalism,
<br />
although the restrictiveness of this criterion usually passes
<br />
unrecognised precisely in consequence of this dogmatic blindness.
<br />
Indeed it is precisely the contradiction implicit in the conjunction
<br />
of strict physicalism with the computational theory of mind that step
<br />
8 seeks to expose and correct.  The reversal of number and physics, by
<br />
contrast, privileges as efficacious the precise number relations upon
<br />
which computational invariance depends.  In so doing it justifies comp
<br />
as an ontological category, and thereby eludes this criticism.
<br />
<br />BTW, when you refer to &quot;dualism form/matter&quot; I assume you aren't
<br />
appealling to mind-matter dualism in any literal sense, although this
<br />
is IMO actually implied by any (non-3-description) computational
<br />
theory of mind that uniquely privileges physical entities and
<br />
relations as ontologically efficacious.
<br />
<br />I'd like to dispose of this issue definitively, if possible.  Either
<br />
I'm wrong in some point of the analysis (which I would be happy to
<br />
concede if clearly demonstrated), or something is being missed here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But comp, pushed on its logical conclusion prevent physicalism to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain the 1-person stable observations. We have to explain the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearances of all observables protagonists from the relation between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers. There is a problem of vocabulary deciding if matter disappear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or not. It is easier to say that physicalism is shown inconsistent or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemologically empty. But this is not an entirely trivial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposition to demonstrate; it is full of traps, and without QM, nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Post or Turing, I would never have believed this, nor find the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument. UDA needs the universal machine concept.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA1-7 can be based on the physical implementation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the devices presented in the protocol of the thought experiment. UDA-8
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eliminates that assumption.
</em><br />
<br />When you say &quot;physical implementation&quot; here, do you mean in terms of
<br />
ontologically-primary physicalism?  Does this assume in this case that
<br />
UDA1-7 could still be coherent per *some* theory of mind, but *not*
<br />
under the assumption that &quot;I am a machine&quot;, as step 08 seeks to
<br />
demonstrate?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; When you say that &quot;activity is just a function from N to set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; states&quot;, you again seem to refer to 'immaterial activity'.  It seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to me that what you are saying amounts to this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If it is the case that, per comp, it is the 'immaterial' activity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the running program, regardless of specific implementation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Careful: the mind needs specific implementations, but below its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitution level, all implementations acts simultaneously, from its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective (in case it decides to take a look below its level, he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should see this).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Once the reversal is done the word &quot;physical&quot; is reduced to something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very specific, which includes a (perhaps to high) first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeterminacy.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I know, but at this point (i.e. before the reversal) I was
<br />
referring to the fact that because a computation is deemed invariant
<br />
in the face of different valid implementations its implicit 'ontology'
<br />
is immaterial as contrasted with an assumption of a basically material
<br />
ontology.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; implements the function and hence the mind, then this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; indistinguishable by the machine from it simply *being* the function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and hence the mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The mind (the 1-mind, not the numbers) is distributed in the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all computations, you cannot really attach it in any single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation, unless you have reasons to think it is correlated to your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own histories. Remember that at UDA-8 we abandon the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenience for a comp supervenience, which is hard to describe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without the minimum amount of math I was talking about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I may insist that the 1-person, nor its consciousness, is never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attached to any thing which can be represented. Only its third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vehicles are, and the person can make relative and local bets on those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vehices and their relative stabilities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is recover and made consistent by the nuance between the prover
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bp and the knower Bp &amp; p (and the feeler, Bp &amp; p &amp; Dt); which by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construction are the same, yet they cannot know that.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, forget 'mind', it's inessential to the argument here. How about:
<br />
<br />If it is the case that, per comp, it is the 'immaterial' activity of
<br />
the running program, invariantly under different implementations, that
<br />
implements the function, then this is indistinguishable by the machine
<br />
from it simply *being* the (equally immaterial) function. Standard
<br />
comp is then seen to refute - or at least make irrelevant - its own
<br />
basis in materiality.
<br />
<br />Is this acceptable?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Have I succeeded in answering my own question?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I let you judge.
</em><br />
<br />The jury's still out.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Vous avez raison cher maitre, j'en suis sur.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You mean &quot;Vous avez raison cher maître, j'en suis sûr.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stickler in French is &quot;pointilleux&quot;, which means literaly asking for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the correct accents!
</em><br />
<br />Thanks - unfortunately I don't know how to be pointilleux on my keyboard :-(
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I cannot wait for your questions on step 8 :)
</em><br />
<br />I cannot wait for your answers :-)
