is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very difficult to access.

<br />Yes, in principle you could observe such a thing. But it may be that generic
<br />
models exhibiting information loss look like model that don't have
<br />
information loss to internal observers. 't Hooft's deterministic models are
<br />
an example of this.
<br />
<br />I'm also skeptical about observers being able to make more efficient
<br />
machines. The problem with that, as I see it (I haven't read Lloyd's book
<br />
yet) is as follows.
<br />
<br />Consider first a model without information loss, like our own universe. What
<br />
is preventing us from converting heat into work with 100% efficiency is lack
<br />
of information. If we had access to all the information that is present then
<br />
you could make an effective Maxwell's Daemon.
<br />
<br />Lacking such information, Maxwell's Deamon has to make measurements, which
<br />
it has to act on. But eventually it has to clear it's memory, and that makes
<br />
it ineffective.
<br />
<br />To get rid of this problem Maxwell's Daemon would have to be able to reset
<br />
its memory without changing the state of the rest of the universe. This
<br />
could possibly be done in an universe with information loss, but that could
<br />
only work if the Daemon has control over the information loss process. If
<br />
information loss interferes with the actions of the Daemon, then it isn't
<br />
much use.
<br />
<br />You could also think of the possiblity of some ''physical process'' which
<br />
would be sort of a ''passive Maxwell's Deamon'' that could reduce the
<br />
entropy in such universe. Using that you could create a temperature
<br />
difference between two objects. To extract work you now need to let heat
<br />
flow between the two objects. So, at that stage you need an entropy to
<br />
increase again.
<br />
<br />So, to me this doesn't seem to be a generic world in which you have
<br />
information loss, rather a world in which it is preserved but where it can
<br />
be overruled at will. The benefits come from that magical power.
