Here's a summary of a wacky theory of consciousness I have come up with
<br />
which is really *really* out there ;) Crazy enough to be true? See what you
<br />
think. At the end I have given links to my blog on the 'Betterhumans'
<br />
e-zine. One blog entry is a brief popular explanation of the concept of
<br />
extra time dimensions, and I have also written a 'Short Short' sci-fi story
<br />
describing what it may be like to be able to *see* in three time dimensions.
<br />
&nbsp;Any comments or links about theories of extra time dimensions would be
<br />
appreciated. Cheers.
<br />
&nbsp;So here's the theory:
<br />
&nbsp;----
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed to me recently, that the idea of extra time dimensions could be
<br />
used to solve the mystery of the mathematics-mind-matter puzzle. My idea was
<br />
that reality has *three* time dimensions and I associated one time dimension
<br />
with the physical domain, another time dimension with the volitional domain
<br />
and the last time dimension with the mathematical domain. The idea is that
<br />
we generalize the notion of 'causality' to include mental and mathematical
<br />
concepts and we can then say for instance that a mathematical proof is a
<br />
'proccess in the third time dimension' :
<br />
&nbsp;A leading mathematician has posted the following very interesting quote on
<br />
his website implying the idea of a mathematical proof as a 'process' in
<br />
extra time dimensions:
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;In some previously unexplored context, the familiar 'shape' of the
<br />
sequence
<br />
of prime numbers is the result of a kind of dynamic or evolutionary
<br />
process.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~mwatkins/isoc/briefintro.htm">http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~mwatkins/isoc/briefintro.htm</a>
<br />
&nbsp;Physicists Stepehn Hawking has proposed the notion of extra time dimensions
<br />
in the form of 'Imaginary Time' (adding two I-time dimensions you can
<br />
recover one extra 'real' time dimension. Another physicist who has proposed
<br />
extra time dimensions is Cumrun Vafa who has proposed adding an extra time
<br />
dimension as part of string theory (he calls his 12-dimensional version of
<br />
string theory F-Theory).
<br />
&nbsp;In e-mail correspondence with the mathematician quoted above, he had this
<br />
to say to me
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;That 'big new idea' that's missing, I suspect, if it ever emerges, may
<br />
completely transform human ideas about 'number', the nature of mathematical
<br />
reality, the nature of physical reality, and how the two inter-relate. I
<br />
expect major philosophical repercussions. Something big is looming on the
<br />
horizon, but no one's got a vocabulary to describe it yet.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;This idea (of generalzing the notion of causality to include mental and
<br />
mathematical concepts as processes in extra time dimensions) is radical
<br />
enough but I combined it with another radical idea I had: the idea that
<br />
*time' itself* is an *emergent* property of a complex system. I had the idea
<br />
that when a 'global work-space' in a complex system imposes 'global
<br />
constraints' on the system, these global contraints *are* actually a
<br />
manifestation of the arrow of time... they impose a direction of
<br />
irreversible change on the complex system. Further this emergent 'time of
<br />
arrow' is something over and above the sum of the parts of the system - the
<br />
idea is that the time dimension is *generated* by the parts of the system,
<br />
but the time dimension cannot be completely reduced to the sum of the parts
<br />
so 'Interactionism' can take place whereby the emergent properties of a
<br />
complex system can 'feed-back' on the lower level parts.
<br />
&nbsp;I treated the universe as a complex system and then had the idea that the
<br />
physical time dimension is 'emergent' from but exists over and above the
<br />
individual relations between physical objects. I believe that in General
<br />
relativity, space-time as a whole has this property doesn't it?
<br />
i.espace-time is an entity in its own right, not just an abstraction
<br />
used to
<br />
describe relations between indivual objects. I added on my proposed extra
<br />
time dimenions... one for mental concepts, another for mathematical concepts
<br />
... this generated 'Mathematical' and 'Mental' universes analogous to the
<br />
'Physical' one.
<br />
&nbsp;My final radical idea was to equate qualia (conscious experience) with
<br />
these time dimensions. i.e The idea is that qualia ARE simply extensions in
<br />
these time dimensions.
<br />
&nbsp;Now here a summary of all my ideas combined, in the context of Baar's
<br />
'Global Work-Space' theory and Jeff Hawkin's 'Memory Prediction' framework.
<br />
Watch:
<br />
&nbsp;If I'm right, what's going in the brain is that there's an emergent
<br />
property of the complex system ( the brain) which trascends the sum of its
<br />
parts and this property is actually a sort of miniature space-time (or a
<br />
kind of 'pre space-time' ) if you like - there's a slight extension into the
<br />
extra time dimensions. It's exactly the same mechanism by the physical
<br />
space-time manifold is emergent from (and transcends) the sum of the
<br />
relations between physical objects in General Relativity, only on a smaller
<br />
scale.
<br />
Look at how it all fits: In the Baars model parts of the complex system (the
<br />
brain) that were seperate from each other get integrated and impose global
<br />
constraints on the complex system as a whole. These global constraints also
<br />
impose an 'arrow of time' on the system (a direction of
<br />
irreversible change). This is exactly what happens with the physical
<br />
universe when we consider the physical universe as a complex system. Parts
<br />
of the complex system (the individual relations between physical objects in
<br />
the physical universe) get integrated into an emergent property ( i.e the
<br />
space-time manifold in Einstein's General Relativity) which imposes global
<br />
constraints on the system as a whole and we interpret these global
<br />
constraints as a direction of irreversible change i.e a arrow of time.
<br />
The 'arrow of time' imposed on the brain by the Baars global workspace
<br />
allows us to interpret the brain as a memory-prediction system whereby past
<br />
experiences get integrated with current experiences to make projections into
<br />
the future.
<br />
We can extend Hawkins theory by generalizing the notion of causality to
<br />
include mathematical and mental concepts by postulating extra time
<br />
dimensions
<br />
&nbsp;then there are *three* different kinds of causality, corresponding to three
<br />
actual time dimensions in reality.
<br />
We can generalize Baars 'Global work-space model' by postulating that there
<br />
is something analogous to it in *all* complex systems, not just the brain
<br />
The Baars work-space is what imposes the 'arrow of time' (direction of
<br />
irreversible change) on the brain and the proposal is a variant of Type-D
<br />
Dualism (Interactionism) and strong holism (emergent,
<br />
non-reductive high-level properties feed-back on the system).
<br />
Qualia are then proposed to be identical to the 'global constraints'
<br />
imposed by the global work-space in the form an 'arrow of time'
<br />
(direction of irreversible change). Further this arrow of time is
<br />
proposed as an extension into actual real time dimensions.
<br />
The notion of causality has been generalized to include mental and
<br />
mathematical concepts. Since there are three different kinds
<br />
of causality, there should be three different general kinds of awareness.
<br />
The first kind of causality is the physical causality of functional systems
<br />
(the first time dimension). We can equate this with awareness of the
<br />
physical world.
<br />
The second kind of causality is -volitional causality - where choices made
<br />
by a moral agent alter the memetic system (the second time dimension).
<br />
We could equate this with *Self* awareness.
<br />
And the third kind is *mathematical* causality - where different kinds of
<br />
logical propositions get integrated (Consistency and Consilience). This last
<br />
kind of causality is the third time dimension. I propose that this is a
<br />
hitherto totally new kind of awareness that the human brain is
<br />
not capable of! This kind of awareness would involve *direct* perception of
<br />
mathematical entities!
