<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've been considering time travel in the context of quantum mechanics and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  parallel universes, and have come up with some thoughts and ideas about 
</em><br />
the 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  subject.  This might be a little off-topic, but it does have to do with 
</em><br />
the 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  theory of parallel universes, which seems to be a large part of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  discussion on this newsgroup.  I'm interested to know what you think of my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  thoughts/ideas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Most scientists agree that time travel is theoretically possible.  
</em><br />
Although 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  the task seems monumentous, many scientists also agree that it will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  eventually be possible.  Using MW theory, the paradoxes are resolved.  
</em><br />
Here 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  are some of my observations/ideas/theories behind quantum time travel.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I know from some of the research I did (and some reasonable assumptions) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  that travelling back in time would put you back to the branch in which you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  set your &quot;time machine&quot; to travel back to, and from there you would branch 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  into a universe in which you suddenly appear from the future.  From there, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  probability would remain as you expect it to using the SE, but since 
</em><br />
things 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  are initially different in this branch (you are there), things would turn 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  out differently in that universe than in one in which you didn't appear.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But how exactly is probability affected during time travel?  I assume one 
</em><br />
of 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  two possibilities:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  1.  Travelling back in time actually affects the probability of the people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  from that time suddenly seeing you appear from the future.  So, if 
</em><br />
normally 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  the probability of you appearing would be nil, then because in the future 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  you decided to travel back to that time, you actually made their 
</em><br />
probability 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  of seeing you appear significant.  Perhaps those people actually have a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  50/50 chance of seeing you appear.  Those who end up in the universe in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  which you didn't appear would eventually end up at the point in which you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  decide to go back in time.  Those who end up in the universe in which you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  did appear would probably follow an entirely different path.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  2.  Travelling back in time does not affect the probability of the people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  from that time suddenly seeing you appear from the future.  The only way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  they would see you appearing is if molecules from their universe suddenly, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  by pure chance, arranged themselves to create you.  Of course, you know 
</em><br />
that 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  this universe was very likely to be YOUR universe, but at the same time 
</em><br />
you 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  know that everyone else you see in it is in a universe that they had an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  absolutely nil chance of being in.  They are justified in claiming that 
</em><br />
you 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  appearing in their universe was an absolute miracle and fluke of nature, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  while at the same time you are justified in claiming that this universe 
</em><br />
was 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  very likely for you, and was not a miracle or a fluke of nature at all.  
</em><br />
In 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  other words, by time travelling you have managed to put yourself with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  virtual certainty into a virtually impossible universe.  If this was the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  case, then for us to see beings from the future visiting us would be no 
</em><br />
more 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  special, and in fact no different, than me suddenly appearing on the moon 
</em><br />
by 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  pure chance.  This would give an answer to Stephen Hawking's argument 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  against time travel, which was that if time travel were possible, we 
</em><br />
should 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  be seeing visitors from the future.
</em><br />
<br />Somehow Proposition #1 does not satisfy me. I believe that time is a first 
<br />
person experience, which is the result of the linkage between points in the 
<br />
plenitude. This linkage is perceived only when it is antropically allowed and 
<br />
results in the rationality of our consciousness exactly matching the 
<br />
rationality of the physical laws.  Proposition #1 according to which time 
<br />
travel can change the probability of the world we travel to, implies a third 
<br />
person (objective) effect which I find difficult to accept.
<br />
<br />Proposition #2 implies that the world we travel to is very highly improbable 
<br />
and therefore you discount it. 
<br />
<br />To put things into perspective, let me ask a question. How probable is your 
<br />
world? How likely is it that a sentient creature called Fritz Griffith with 
<br />
precisely the right height, weight, birth date, correct number of freckles 
<br />
and wrinkles, number of tooth cavities and hair on the head, profession, 
<br />
parents, siblings, nationality, number of chromosomes living on a planet with 
<br />
one moon, a solar system with nine planets,... exists anywhere in the 
<br />
universe? Isn't this a miracle just as unlikely as being transported to the 
<br />
moon? In fact I could come up with a scenario that could make being suddenly 
<br />
transported to the moon a *relatively* very likely event: imagine a race of 
<br />
extragalactic creatures, the %$&amp;nicks, who just set up a zoo on the far side 
<br />
of the moon to provide a cast for their movie &quot;Monster from Planet Earth,&quot; in 
<br />
which you, Fritz, will be the star. They descend on the Earth in their ultra 
<br />
compact insect like space vehicle and shoot you with their amnesia producing 
<br />
sting. A larger radar-invisible vehicle then transport you to the moon where 
<br />
you suddenly wake up, not being aware of your little interplanetary trip. You 
<br />
are then given your role in the movie in which you manage to survive long 
<br />
enough to eat, out of hunger, a large number of baby %$&amp;nicks until you 
<br />
encounter your nemesis when you meet their mother. 
<br />
<br />I won't go into the math to prove that such a scenario is more likely than 
<br />
you existing in the first place for the following reason:
<br />
<br />Even though our world seems to be quantized (discrete), I believe that the 
<br />
variations from world to world in the MW follow a continuum. This is 
<br />
something I cannot prove. However this appears to be the maximalist model in 
<br />
keeping with the idea of the plenitude and any other (finite or discrete) 
<br />
model would have to be justified. Because the MW is a continuum it should be 
<br />
possible to renormalize the measure at every point in the MW, and therefore 
<br />
the assertion that a probability is &quot;low&quot; is ambiguous and possibly 
<br />
meaningless.
