As we said it in Hungary: let the 'bartender' talk into it...
<br />
*
<br />
I feel it is a vague metaphor to have 'brain centers stimulated'-  HOW? - as
<br />
persuaded them to do something? There are physiologic activities translated
<br />
(somewhere, somehow) into mental events and so far we know(?) about electric
<br />
connections. But wait: before I try to express my ignorance of what (how) to
<br />
identify as &quot;consciousness&quot; (even, maybe 'conscious') - Galvani's frog legs
<br />
were not attached to the braincells and reacted to the 'pain' of the
<br />
electric shock. That goes back a step from crying 'OUCH' upon an electric
<br />
shock. So, while I do not deny the role of the 'pain centers', I cannot
<br />
assign their exclusivity in the process either. My view is &quot;complexity&quot; of
<br />
which both brain tissues, functions, mentality and the ambiance of the body
<br />
(human etc. 'live' beings) is interactively involved - and we are pretty far
<br />
from understanding HOW and: &quot;What else&quot;? We are not singularities, not our
<br />
mind, not our body - which could be envisioned (I didn't even dare say:
<br />
&nbsp;understood) independently by themselves.  Not even in THEIR (separated)
<br />
interaction.
<br />
Whatever we find is useful, unless we consider it as &quot;ALL of it&quot;.
<br />
*
<br />
I like Bruno's hint(?) about 'ethics' - I never had a reasonable idea what
<br />
may work in it, unless I identified it with the 'culture-related' morality.
<br />
I still question the sole effect of such ethics upon myself,. it would be a
<br />
very selfish ethics. May it be extended to include pain-centers' stimulus of
<br />
3rd persons???

<br />
As that arbitrary approach to consciousness goes in my mind (I consider it a
<br />
historical noumenon applied bt diverse authors to fit their theory) it
<br />
includes a mental side: awareness and direction of the body, response to
<br />
information we get. Total 'unconsciousness' is death. In anesthetic one
<br />
still controls not even the smooth muscles, but reflexes as well and a lot
<br />
more. Other things may be suspended (as on vacation), e.g. memory. When I
<br />
woke up after appendectomy I continued tp be angry: I argued angrily FOR
<br />
being put out instead of a local anesthetics. 'Conscious also has levels,
<br />
some within full awareness, some (partly?) hidden, yet within the active
<br />
mentality effects.
<br />
We use these words as they 'fit' what we want to express (as all others).
<br />
The yearly Tucsan Int'l. Conferences on 'Consciousness' (I follow them since
<br />
1991) still could not agree in definitions.
<br />
To the question: &quot; do you think *we* are conscious?&quot; my unsolicited answer
<br />
is: we can write defkinitions by which &quot;yes&quot; and ofher definitions by which
<br />
&quot;no&quot; and don't forget the intermedietes.

Bruno mixes acting with feeling. Actors 'feel' the paycheck and &quot;play - as
<br />
if&quot;. No fMRI involved for the role they simulate by the outside visible.
<br />
Even 'good actors' go on;y as far as the secondary phenomena of their
<br />
role-playing are involved. No actor died by the character's heart attack.
<br />
Only  if they had &quot;their own&quot; - personal, not acted -  illness. I was an
<br />
&quot;actor&quot; in my last job when the  international management made - in my
<br />
scientific thinking  - 'bad' decisions: I complied and had the next paycheck
<br />
in mind, reminding myself that I don't 'own' the company. Did not 'fire'
<br />
myself.
<br />

<br />
I still want to make some appreciative remarks to the &quot;asifism&quot;, but this
<br />
one goes to Bruno's post.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Could pain exist without consciousness?

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Do you agree that the sensation of pain is different from acting like

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  Pain is the same thing as the pain center in the brain being

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you are really unconscious or not conscious, you could say this,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are on the fringe of being an eliminativist philosopher. What I do

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; When movie actors behave as if they were feeling pain, then it is not
