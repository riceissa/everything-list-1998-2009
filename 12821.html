<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If you built a model society and set its citizens instincts, goals,

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; laws-from-heaven (but really from you) and so on, would that suffice to

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; provide &quot;meaning&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would not provide ultimate meaning for two reasons...
</em><br />
<br /><br />My answer would have been that the beings would have no way of knowing the
<br />
difference between the provided meaning and &quot;ultimate&quot; meaning, and would
<br />
live their lives just as we live our lives, some of them atheists and others
<br />
theists. In other words, the idea of ultimate meaning can have no objective
<br />
or subjective consequences: you can honestly, deeply believe in it and this
<br />
belief can change the way you live your life, but it would do so even if it
<br />
had no basis in reality. A child might behave well in order to receive
<br />
presents from Santa Claus, but this has no bearing whatsoever on the
<br />
question of whether Santa Claus exists.
<br />
<br />1) Logical reason, but still important and inescapable:  If the source
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of meaning was from within the &quot;system&quot;, i.e. the observable/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; controllable universe, then we can always ask the why question when we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find the source. This is not acceptable as part of a scientifically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observable causal universe, as it contradicts it.  A closed system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is supposedly totally explainable will always have at least one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fixed point that is unexplainable.  This is the old positivism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem.  This is actually part of the problem with a straw-man
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; caricature god, in our image, i.e. any thing that we (as part of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe) can think up.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You can always draw a circle around the system + externals and call it a
<br />
new, larger system: the universe, the multiverse, the plenitude, God + the
<br />
Plenitude, or whatever. Long before it was a problem for positivism it was a
<br />
problem for theism: Who made God? Who gives God meaning? Who tells God
<br />
whether his ethical principles are right or wrong?
<br />
<br />2) Spiritual reason, but no less important and inescapable:  Perhaps
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this one is more for people (like Bruno, and Jesse Mazer?) who accept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the possible existence of difference levels of reasoning, based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different ways of &quot;seeing&quot; truth (a la G and G*).  We just know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somehow that there is something inexplicable about personhood.  There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a hunger in us that wants to always ask the question why, a hunger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the meaning behind whatever layer of stuff we just discovered.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps it's like looking for our true home, or for the reason why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is or is not our true home.  It's like Neo in the Matrix.  And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there have been signs the meaning behind this existence poking in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence now and then, and seen by different people.  Yes, we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always imagine how someone could have thought these signs up, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretted them up, and thus explain everything back down to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purely logical level, dealing only with repeatable things.  Like a 2-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimensional shadow world can make up laws that somehow explain the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behavior of shadows and say that there are only shadows, but it is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seeing the whole reality.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree that there is something fundamentally inexplicable, irreducible
<br />
about first person experience, but you are basically challenging this idea
<br />
and saying there *can't* be any inexplicable things, hence God is postulated
<br />
to explain the inexplicable. But again, you are just delaying the
<br />
inevitable: how do you explain God's existence? How do you explain the
<br />
concept of necessary existence? How do you explain why God wanted to have
<br />
other conscious beings around, and why he decided to give just the amount of
<br />
evidence of his existence to those beings as he did? There are countless
<br />
such questions to which the answer is just, &quot;I don't know, that's just the
<br />
way it is&quot;.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Now we're startin' to talk!  I don't know much of the language,

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; but I think that when people experience what some may call words like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;enlightenment&quot;, &quot;cosmic consciousness&quot;, etc. they are experiencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; something that is really there.  In fact, they use words like &quot;seeing&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; reality as it &quot;actually&quot; is, etc.  They speak of &quot;wholeness&quot; and

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  Except that people would still have the same experiences whether or not

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; something were really there, just as they would still experience the sky

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a dome whether or not it is in fact a dome. In other words, if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagine a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; being in a universe without meaning, cosmic consciousness, enlightenment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all the other significant things which are supposed to be there, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; otherwise the same physical laws etc., can you think of any reason why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a being would or wouldn't come up with the same ideas as humans have,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is like saying &quot;If you imagine a being in a universe who cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see the true reality of the universe, but with otherwise the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality, can you think of any reason why such a being would or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wouldn't come up with the same ideas as humans have, assuming similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolutionary provenance?&quot;  If he/she cannot see the true reality, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ideas would not reflect the whole reality, regardless of how he/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; she came up with them.  The ideas may be locally useful, but as I said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above, there is more to it than that.  Humans are deeper than that.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tom

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<br />There is a difference between personal meaning and empirical fact.
<br />
Generally, it is a good idea to base personal meaning on empirical fact: if
<br />
you think the world is flat, you might decide to stay home for fear that you
<br />
will fall off the edge, thus missing out on encountering foreign cultures.
<br />
However, you belief and its effect on your behaviour has no bearing on
<br />
whether that belief is true. You would stay home if you believed the world
<br />
was flat whether or not the world was actually flat. The mistake of some
<br />
kinds of theistic/ mystical thinking is to take the fact that a belief makes
<br />
you feel and behave in a certain way as evidence for that belief being true,
<br />
whereas you would feel and behave in that way even if that belief were not
<br />
in fact true.
