<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;     As far as I am aware the fastest neurons in the body conduct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; messages  at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;around 170 mph. How do you reconcile this with the 'infinite  nesting'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;theory? Or, more fundamentally, the very fact that the two ends of  the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;'chain of command' you have postulated are indeed communicating somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;we are living testimony) surely precludes an infinite number of levels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;this would mean that:-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;a). the transmission velocity is infinite and  we therefore perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;instantly (not the case)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;b). the transmission  velocity is finite and we therefore don't perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;things at all (not the  case).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [JB--]  There could be an infinite chain of transmission with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;finite time at each level and a finite total time, for example if the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at level n is 1/2^n seconds, the total time would be 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...
</em><br />
=
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1 second.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />I accept your demonstration of how an infinite series can sum to a finite
<br />
number but I still feel that on a purely practical level you should
<br />
reconsider the infinite nesting hypothesis. How can you fit infinite levels
<br />
of perception, assuming they have a real physical presence (and if not, then
<br />
how are they represented?), within the confines of a human skull (I realise
<br />
there are mathematical shapes that have an infinite circumference
<br />
encompassing a finite area but I do not think this will be a valid analogy
<br />
since the brain is not an ideal (ie. virtual) geometric object)? How do you,
<br />
under this theory, explain the small but definite time delay between a
<br />
stimulus and its conscious perception? Is it your assertion that this delay
<br />
is only the time it takes for the neuron to transmit the impulse from the
<br />
point of contact to the first of your 'perceptive levels', and that from
<br />
there the transfer of information through the infinite hierarchy is actually
<br />
instant (and therefore exceeds the speed of light)?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [JB--]  It's important to understand the difference between spirit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Spirit is a metaphysically transcendental concept related al least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to consciousness which is an evidence, and probably also to free will (if
</em><br />
it
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exists), and perhaps also to creative intelligence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mind is the physical activity of the brain, the mental computations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;like manipulations of numbers, which are done by physical processes of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;neurons
</em><br />
<br /><br />I see no reason to introduce 'spirit' and 'mind' as two distinct concepts
<br />
because the ideas are already well represented in the notions of 'mind' and
<br />
'brain'. The brain is obviously an object, something that can be taken out
<br />
of the body and spread onto slides for our delectation, as can any other
<br />
organ such as the heart. However, we can also view these organs 'in
<br />
action' - we can monitor their electrical activity. Surveying the ECG of
<br />
someone's heart does not elevate it to a transcendental metaphysical state,
<br />
and so similarly nor should surveying an EEG. After all, no physician can
<br />
claim to look at the series of spikes and read the patient's mind. He is
<br />
still only looking at the brain, but an electrical interpretation of it. The
<br />
mind therefore remains a distinct entity and is not the physical activity of
<br />
the brain. It is somehow a sum of the neuronal processes but is not in
<br />
itself a neuronal process. There is therefore no need in this argument for
<br />
the concept of 'spirit'.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
&nbsp;An important point concerns the creative intelligence, which could
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be defined as the ability to perceive the regularities (see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://www.website2u.com/log/text/reflmph/english/regul.htm">http://www.website2u.com/log/text/reflmph/english/regul.htm</a>) :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Metaphysical reflections &lt;reflres.htm&gt; - Perceptions, regularities and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The only true reality is the present perception of our mental state which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contains the memories of our past sensations and actions. Everything else
</em><br />
in
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mental construction. Perception is a transfert of information from a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perceived reality to a perceiving spirit. Then it assumes the existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;spirit &lt;<a href="http://www.website2u.com/log/text/reflmph/english/exesprit.htm">http://www.website2u.com/log/text/reflmph/english/exesprit.htm</a>&gt;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The informations that we perceive are not random, they contain
</em><br />
regularities.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mathematically, that means that these informations could be described by an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;expression smaller than the one describing them trivially. For exemple, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sequence &quot;ABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABC&quot; which contains 30 characters can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be described by the expression &quot;ABC repeated 10 times&quot; which contains only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;21 characters. Perceived regularities permit us to suppose that raw
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perception is the unfolding of a smaller germ (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;ABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABC&quot; is the unfolding of &quot;ABC repeated 10 times&quot;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and that there exists an outside world which gives our perceptions
</em><br />
depending
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on the actions that we give it. This outside world is not directly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;accessible but only through this information exchange.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From this information exchange, we build a mental representation of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;outside world. So, for example, the child examining his memories realizes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that each time that he raises an object and drops it, he saw it go down. He
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;deduces that objects spontaneously tends to go down. So he introduces in
</em><br />
his
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mental representation the concept of gravity force. In the same way, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physicist builds this mental construct further in a more precize and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quantitative way, noticing that this object follows a trajectory of
</em><br />
equation
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;z = 1/2 g t² + z0. So he builds what he calls the laws of physics, but
</em><br />
which
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are in fact only mathematical models describing more and more precize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;approximations of reality, but always approximatives and limited to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;validity domain depending on the experimental conditions from which the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory has been built.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The regularities of our perceptions appear to us with such a strength that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we forget that we perceive only perceptions, that the physical universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;space, time, matter... are only mental constructions.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Mathematics is an interpretation of the natural world, a means of
<br />
translating what we peceive into something we understand. As with any
<br />
interpretation then, it is limited by the one's level of comprehension.
<br />
Hence in your example, the baby and the physicist perceive the same
<br />
phenomenon but at different levels of comprehension. It is not difficult to
<br />
argue from this that our apparent (or perceived) reality is wholly dependent
<br />
on our level of understanding. Hence, though I largely agree with your
<br />
comment &quot;the only true reality is the present perception of our mental
<br />
state&quot; I would put it a slightly different way - &quot;The only true reality for
<br />
an observer is the present interpretation (within the context of his
<br />
knowledge) of his perceptions.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This ability of perceiving regularities is also required for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;transfinite iteration of reflection principle (see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://www.byoc.com/homepage/134885/text/logic/logrefl6.htm">http://www.byoc.com/homepage/134885/text/logic/logrefl6.htm</a>) to produce a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sequence of transfinite ordinals getting bigger and bigger without being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;limited by a given ordinal. For this we need to perceive the regularities
</em><br />
in
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a sequence of ordinals x1, x2, x3... and to recognize that there is a f
</em><br />
such
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that xi = f(i), and then skip to x omega = limit of f(i). We must avoid the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;trap of thinking that we are in a creative process producing x1, x2, x3...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (see also <a href="http://www.website2u.com/log/text/logic/regular.htm">http://www.website2u.com/log/text/logic/regular.htm</a> (in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;french)).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Frankly, you have completely lost me here!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this creative intelligence a feature of the spirit or of the mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;? I am not very sure about it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; According to Hofstadter (Godel, Escher, Bach), this is an activity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the mind, subject to godelization, therefore limited, like any finite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system (formal system, machine), but in the case of the brain the limit is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fuzzy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another possibility would be that the ability of manipulating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical objects like transfinite ordinals is a feature of the mind,
</em><br />
but
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the enlightment of the recognition of the regularity may come from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;spirit, and our limitations might come from the limitations of the mind for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understanding complex mathematical objects.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am inclined to agree with your final point here, that we (ie. our minds)
<br />
are limited in our understanding of the world due to the limitations of the
<br />
brain in processing the interpretation we use, ie. mathematics. Furthermore,
<br />
the fact that we are aware that we do not understand certain phenomena
<br />
suggests this limitation is indeed more in the brain than in the mind.
