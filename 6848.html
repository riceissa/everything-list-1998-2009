<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I understand [Saibal's] point, but I think you are making an invalid

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about the relationship between a random sampling of all the OM's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;available
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to an individual and that individual's experience of living his life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Suppose a trillion trillion copies of my mind are made today on a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and run in lockstep with my biologically implemented mind for the next 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;six
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; months, at which point the computer is shut down.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, and I note that these are *precisely* identical instantiations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This means that most of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; measure is now in the latter half of 2005, in the sense that if you pick 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer moment at random out of all the observer moments which identify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; themselves as being me, it is much more likely to be one of the copies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the computer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What?  And I thought that I had understood how the term &quot;Observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Moment&quot; is used on this list!  :-(
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is the following true, or isn't it:  identical OMs are identified.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That is, N identical instances (say, running on N identical mainframes)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are thought of as *one* observer moment, because they are (1st person)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indistinguishable.  At least that is how *I* have been using the term.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(They're also 3rd person indistinguishable, of course.)
</em><br />
<br />You're right, I've been sloppy. If the OM's are the same, then from the 
<br />
first person perspective there is only one OM. One OM can have multiple 
<br />
instantiations,  but by definition there is no way for the OM to know this, 
<br />
otherwise they would be distinct OM's. There is no way to distinguish 
<br />
between them from a third person perspective either, although the fact that 
<br />
there are multiple instantiations may be obvious. This actually suggests a 
<br />
more elegant way to make my point, which is that the absolute measure makes 
<br />
no possible difference to the OM.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno wrote, incidentally, &quot;With comp the relative measure from one OM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is based on all comp histories going through [those] states. We should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not measure the OM by its finite description...&quot;, and so it's possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that he is agreeing with my usage of the term &quot;Observer Moment&quot;.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thanks for any clarification.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But what does this mean for my experience of life? Does it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mean that I am unlikely to experience 2006, being somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; suspended in 2005?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would say &quot;no&quot;. I would say that *you* must experience 2006
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in your experiment, and in fact, in any universe where you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;live through 2006.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we say that there are 2006 AD versions of Stathis running
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anywhere in the multiverse, then it is by definition true that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you get runtime in 2006 (or that you experience 2006). What a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number of us have tried to do, perhaps mainly so that our ideas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conform with our daily values of trying to stay alive, is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;regard the *benefit* one receives from a certain amount of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;runtime as the measure of the OM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hal has very satisfactorily described the idea that you get superior
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;benefit if your pleasant, even-numbered-days are given twice the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure of your odd, unpleasant days.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see how this follows. I can't even imagine what it might mean to get 
<br />
&quot;higher benefit&quot; from higher measure days. What I assumed Hal meant was that 
<br />
on even days his total measure was higher, so that double the usual number 
<br />
of versions of Hal were generated in other branches of the multiverse, who 
<br />
would go on to have separate and distinct lives. Aiming for more good 
<br />
experiences on even days would then be an altruistic thing for Hal to do, 
<br />
since it would result in greater happiness in the multiverse as a whole. If, 
<br />
instead, it was more like my example, where a copy of Hal's mind is run on a 
<br />
computer in lockstep with his biological mind on even days, and the computer 
<br />
switched off on odd days, then what possible difference could it make to Hal 
<br />
or anyone else, given what we have just said about the definition of an OM?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; More generally, if a person has N OM's available to him at time t1 and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;kN at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; time t2, does this mean he is k times as likely to find himself 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; t2 as t1?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To me &quot;to find oneself at X,t&quot; in spacetime means to make an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observation that one is at position X at time t, or perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;better, that one is alive at X,t, a very 1st person description.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But then, that would tend to distinguish the experience at t2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from the experience at t1, and that is contrary to your hypothesis.
</em><br />
<br />I did mean that t1 and t2 are distinct. This is basically the same question 
<br />
as Hal's about different measure on different days. I should have said &quot;N 
<br />
instantiations of an OM&quot;. Sorry, I've been sloppy again!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;By the definition I thought was in vogue here, &quot;from inside&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there is just one OM, even though it's manifested at a number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of spacetime locations (the entity doesn't know the difference).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;On a 3rd person objective bird's-eye view the greater number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instances do have, of course, a greater measure than does a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;single instance. So how does this translate to 1st person?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'd suggest that one's 1st person experience---though not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;memorably different---is &quot;richer&quot; and &quot;fuller&quot;, and of more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;benefit to one!  :-)   Admittedly, this sounds like nonsense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if one believes that one's memories capture all of one's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience.
</em><br />
<br />No, I can't agree with this at all. In fact, it's the first thing you've 
<br />
said since joining the list that isn't impeccably rational, IMHO. (Sorry, 
<br />
hope that comes across as a compliment :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I suggest that this is not the right way to look at it. A person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; only experiences one OM at a time, so if he has &quot;passed through&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; t1 and t2 it will appear to him that he has spent just as much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; time in either interval...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, but appearances can be deceiving!  And it won't be the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time that a patient is incorrect about which of two time intervals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actually provided him the greater benefit.
</em><br />
<br />Are you suggesting that, in general, the moment with greater measure will 
<br />
seem the same, but it won't actually be the same? If so, is there some test 
<br />
that could be done to prove objectively that there is a difference?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The only significance of the fact that there are &quot;more&quot; OM's at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; t2 [and I take it to mean that, using the terms as I do, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; OM at t2 has greater measure than the OM at t1] is that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person can expect a greater variety of possible experiences at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; t2 if the OM's are all distinct.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Again, to me, if the experiences are distinct, then it's not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same OM.
</em><br />
<br />Again, you're right. I was referring to the distinct OM's associated with an 
<br />
individual across the multiverse at a certain time point, captured by the 
<br />
term &quot;total measure&quot;. It is necessarily fuzzy, because we can't really 
<br />
define what OM is and isn't associated with an individual. As a person gets 
<br />
older, and it becomes increasingly likely that he will die from age related 
<br />
disease, I imagine that the effect of this is that more and more branches of 
<br />
the multiverse are &quot;pruned&quot;, decreasing his total measure and limiting his 
<br />
possible futures, even though he never actually dies.
