In reply to posts by Hal Finney and Bruno Marchal--
<br />
<br />Hal:
<br />
<br /><br />I found the paper you referred to, and it certainly has some very 
<br />
interesting ideas, for example the idea that the arrow of time is actually 
<br />
an anthropic artefact. I admit that I have much reading to do if I am to 
<br />
understand the paper properly, but I am not sure what I was proposing - that 
<br />
all possible worlds will at some stage exist - is the same thing as the 
<br />
Poincare recurrences discussed in this paper. It possible that only a subset 
<br />
of possible events (everything that has occurred so far, and then some) will 
<br />
cycle endlessly, and if so, as Nietzche commented, that'll suck (or words to 
<br />
that effect). I probably gave the wrong example when I proposed as my 
<br />
unlikely event the formation of an exact copy of our solar system and its 
<br />
inhabitants in far future interstellar space; much more interesting would be 
<br />
a rather different copy, where you would be resurrected with intact 
<br />
personality and memories of your past life, with enhanced intelligence and 
<br />
physical abilities, and a whole new civilization with scientific wonders, 
<br />
intelligent aliens, and things so strange that no-one today has even 
<br />
imagined them, all to explore. Of course, you will also experience burning 
<br />
in hellfire as the flipside to this happy state, but who was it that said it 
<br />
was better to burn than to disappear?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Bruno:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I agree that my four assumptions are dubious, but I chose them, for the sake 
<br />
of argument, as being (a) most inimical towards Many Worlds theories, (b) 
<br />
closest to what most people would think of as common sense, and (c) least 
<br />
controversial/ most conservative in the scientific community. I do think 
<br />
they are internally consistent, even if they are completely wrong. I do not 
<br />
understand your comment that by saying the universe is unique, finite, 
<br />
expanding and cooling forever, it is contradictory to allow that my example 
<br />
of an unlikely event will occur as time approaches infinity. The increase in 
<br />
entropy and cooling which go with the model I suggested are average trends 
<br />
over time. It is possible within this long term decline to have pockets of 
<br />
order/ decreasing entropy, both in classical statistical mechanics and 
<br />
quantum mechanics. It is a mathematical fact, independent of the actual 
<br />
physics, that given enough time (and eternity is certainly enough time), any 
<br />
event that is possible, however close to zero its probability per unit time, 
<br />
will occur with probability arbitrarily close to 1. What rather surprised 
<br />
me, however, is the fact that the last statement is only true in general if 
<br />
the probability per unit time stays constant or increases with increasing 
<br />
time; if it decreases, limiting towards zero as time approaches infinity, 
<br />
then it is possible that this event, which still always has non-zero 
<br />
probability per unit time, may never actually occur. For example, if 
<br />
Pr(P)=1/(t^2), as t goes from 2 to infinity, the cumulative probability that 
<br />
P will occur at some point is 1/2.
<br />
