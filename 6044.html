<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theories, but I would be interested to know what people *actually* believe

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on the subject of many/all worlds - what one would bet one's house or life

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on, given that one were forced to choose some such bet.
</em><br />
<br />I believe it is logically necessary that all possible worlds exist, based on 
<br />
a number of ideas that have been discussed many times on this list:
<br />
<br />1. Every possible world can be simulated by a computer program.
<br />
<br />2. It is not, in general, possible to distinguish between a simulated world 
<br />
and a &quot;real&quot; world.
<br />
<br />2a. If there is no empirical or logical way to distinguish with certainty 
<br />
between a real and a simulated world, one may as well say there is no 
<br />
essential difference between them [interesting, but not really necessary for 
<br />
the rest of this argument].
<br />
<br />3. Consider a computer running a simulation complete with conscious beings. 
<br />
This particular computer was designed by a now extinct civilization, and 
<br />
although the hardware still appears to be working, the compiler, instruction 
<br />
manual and computer language documentation have all been lost.
<br />
<br />3a. The result of (3) is that the simulated world continues to run on the 
<br />
computer, even though there can be no communication between it and us in the 
<br />
&quot;real&quot; world where the computer exists physically. (Idea for a story: maybe 
<br />
that's why the gods used to talk to us in ancient times but no longer do!)
<br />
<br />4. A computer need not be a box that runs Windows or Linux. Conceivably, a 
<br />
computer could consist of the idle passage of time, or the set of natural 
<br />
numbers, operated on by some hugely complex look-up table. In Greg Egan's 
<br />
1994 novel &quot;Permutation City&quot;, it is pointed out that a simulated being's 
<br />
experiences are the same if the computation is run backwards, forwards, 
<br />
chopped up into individual pieces and randomly dispersed throughout the 
<br />
world-wide network; the computation somehow assembles itself out of &quot;dust&quot; - 
<br />
out of omnipresent, apparently randomly distributed ones and zeroes.
<br />
<br />4a. In other words, no hardware, whether physical or simulated (if these are 
<br />
different things) is necessary for the implementation of a computation. 
<br />
Every possible computation is implemented out there in the realm of pure 
<br />
mathematics, so every possible world necessarily exists.
<br />
<br />Now, the above argument is sometimes taken as being self-evidently absurd. 
<br />
Hilary Putnam and John Searle have actually used it in this way to attack 
<br />
strong A.I. theories. The objection is that the effort and information 
<br />
needed to construct the look-up table in (4) is at least as great as that 
<br />
which would be needed to construct and program a computer in the 
<br />
conventional way. An analogy can be made with a block of marble: in a sense, 
<br />
it does contain every possible statue, but this is not any help to the 
<br />
sculptor. But all this means is that we cannot, in this world, communicate 
<br />
with or make any use of the type of computer described in (3) or (4). The 
<br />
other worlds may exist, but we can never know this directly.
<br />
<br />As for the &quot;failure of induction&quot; if all possible worlds exist, I prefer to 
<br />
simply bypass the problem. I predict that in the next few moments the world 
<br />
will most likely continue to behave as it always has in the past... Here I 
<br />
am a few moments later, and I am completely, horribly wrong. A zillion 
<br />
versions of me in other worlds are dying or losing consciousness as they 
<br />
watch fire-breathing dragons materialise out of nothing. So what? Those 
<br />
versions are not continuing to type to the end of this paragraph, while this 
<br />
one-in-a-zillion version manifestly is, and will continue to live life 
<br />
holding the delusional belief that the laws of physics will remain constant.
