Brent,
<br />
<br />1. are you sure about our conceptualization to fit 'nature(?)'s'? we are 
<br />
impeded by our figments to explain the world(?) as we CAN, material means, 
<br />
physical world,
<br />
excuse me: Bruno:) numbers, while all we see (and less we understand of it) 
<br />
is a little segment - one primitive universe among the innumerable  others 
<br />
(we cannot even 'see' them) in the interpretation of our individual 
<br />
(personalized) mindset, our personal mini-solipsism (Colin) controlled by 
<br />
the tissue-tool (brain) we use.
<br />
<br />2. According to 1.: are you sure that in the unrestricted World the 'time' 
<br />
concept is as we can imagine it? Sequence and consequence are human 
<br />
observations HERE.
<br />
We cannot include the totality into our thinking, not as a background and 
<br />
not as an interefficient relation of them all. So our conclusions are 
<br />
partial and forcible.
<br />
<br />3. R. Bertrand was in 1935 obsolete as compared to the views of 'this list' 
<br />
(or: the cognitive inventory accumulated up to date in our epistemic 
<br />
enrichment). His words have to be updated to the present thinking. (More so 
<br />
the ancient savants!). I don't argue with his statements, just mention 
<br />
'caution'!.
<br />
<br />4. I think what Abram said should reflect our dichotomy of 'continuum' vs. 
<br />
the quantized 'discontinua' - no matter in what scale one thinks. Dense?...
<br />
The only way we can imagine a change in a discontunuum (WE!!!) is to take 
<br />
two arbitrary points and compare the qualia. No explanation (so far) where 
<br />
and how they became different if you do not abide by a fixed scale. I think 
<br />
topology is in this respect underdeveloped (although I don't know topology). 
<br />
And so may be dimensions - thought of as diversely identified, yet possibly 
<br />
with continuous transition from one (named) to the other (named).
<br />
If the 'existence' is continuous (and we have no sign indeed to the 
<br />
opposite) then we are in deep trouble.
<br />

No, I'm saying that the time that appears in physics is a variable that
<br />
takes real values and so it has the topology of the real line. That
<br />
topology is continuous so every &quot;moment&quot; has other moments arbitrarily
<br />
close to it which are well ordered.  When I think about this it seems to
<br />
capture the idea of &quot;sticking together&quot;.  If I pick any two times there
<br />
is a dense set of times joining them. Of course time also includes the
<br />
idea of direction.  Most fundamental theories of physics are time
<br />
symmetric and the &quot;arrow of time&quot; is tied to expansion of the universe
<br />
by statistics.
<br />
<br />Bertrand Russell wrote a paper in 1935, which is reprinted in &quot;Logic and
<br />
Knowledge&quot; 1956 which considers how instants (i.e. moments) are
<br />
logically constructed from events (which have non-zero durations).  He
<br />
shows that &quot;...the existence of instants requires hypotheses which there
<br />
is no reason to suppose true...&quot;  It's rather technical, but you might
<br />
find it interesting.  I think Russell is right to regard events
<br />
(intervals) as fundamental and instants as idealized constructs.
