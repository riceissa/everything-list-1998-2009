</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Perhaps Hilbert was right and Physics ought to have been axiomatized 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; when he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; suggested it.  ;)  Then again, there might not have been a motivation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; until recently with Tegmark's MUH paper and related material (like by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; David
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Wolpert of NASA).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The logical positivists were motivated to axiomatize in the predicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculus the laws of scientific theories in the early 20th century,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first because they believed that it would guarantee the cognitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significance of theoretical terms in the theory (such as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unphysical ether of maxwell's electromagnetism), and then later
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because it had evolved into an attempt to specify the proper form of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific theory. In practice this had too many problems and was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually abandoned. One of the consequences of this program was that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axiomatizing the laws of a theory in first order predicate calculus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with equality was that such a formulation of a theory always implied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various unintended interpretations. The amount of effort needed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; block these unintended interpretations was out of proportion with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; benefit received by axiomatization.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is a bit weird because it is just logically impossible to block 
<br />
those unintended interpretations. And This should not be a problem.
<br />
The reason why physical theories are not axiomatize is more related to 
<br />
the fact that axiomatization does not per se solve or even address the 
<br />
kind of conceptual problem raised by physics.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I was trying to answer Bruno's objections regarding set theory being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rich to be the 'ultimate math' the MUH needs to propose what the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and I quipped that that was because math is invented or discovered to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; further its own end by logicians, for the most part, and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; metamathematicians such as Cantor had no apparent interest in physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; things or furthering the pursuit of Physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Another question of Bruno's was my motivation.  I started this quest 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hoping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that three truth values were sufficient to develop a set theory with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal set that was in a classical logic sense consistent to ZFC 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theory.  Or, if not true, prove that and figure out why.  Perhaps 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; values would solve that.  My main motivation has definitely not been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;rescue&quot; a major apparent shortcoming in the MUH as I started this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on-and-off quest in 2003 with no internet connection or resources 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; such as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; deluge of journals (ie, a good library).  How it started was that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; online in a place such as this used Russell-like arguments to -prove- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the Physic's universe -does not exist- for essentially the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasons a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal set can't seem to be non-antimonious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Suppose Everything is well defined along with its partner, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; containment (such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as the earth is contained in the solar system by the definitions of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; both).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Then Everything does not exist.  Proof:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Consider the thing, call it &quot;this something,&quot; that is the qualia of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; things that do not contain themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Then this something contains itself if and only if this something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; contain itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am suspect of the claim that a logical argument such as the above,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which relies on a paradox of self-reference, could be used to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; demonstrate the non-existence of the so-called Everything.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Indeed. It will just prevent the &quot;Everything&quot; to be a thing (to belong 
<br />
to Everything).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personally remain unconvinced that there is anything problematic about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the exitence of the universe of universes, or the ensemble of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible mathematical structures, thought it may not be well defined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at present. I don't believe that this is simply the union of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axiomatic systems. If trying to define the Everything as a set implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a contradiction, then fine -- it isn't a set, it's an ensemble, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't carry any of the connotations that are implied by the use of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;set&quot; in the mathematical sense. Therefore each entity in the ensemble
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a unique collection of n axioms that has no necessary relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to any other axiom collection. What happens in an axiom system stays
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in that axiom system, and can't bleed over to the next one on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list. Some of these may be equivalent to each other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A = The collection of all finite axiom systems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B = The collection of all consistent finite axiom systems
</em><br />
<br /><br />I guess you mean &quot;recursively enumerable&quot; instead of finite. You would 
<br />
loose first order Peano Arithmetic (my favorite lobian machine :).
<br />
Note also that SAS occurs very quickly. SAS occur in theories which are 
<br />
much weaker than the SAS themselves (ex: SAS occur in Robinson 
<br />
Arithmetic, i.e. when you can define successor, addition and 
<br />
multiplication. SAS themselves need induction.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;cardinality&quot; of B is not greater than the &quot;cardinality&quot; of A.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Scare qutoes since cardinality is a property of sets and these may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not be sets if that would imply contradiction.) It is B that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting from the point of this discussion since it is believed (I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't know of any proof of this) that only systems in B could produce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the type of rational and orderly physical existence capable of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; containing observers who can think about their existence as we do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (SASs, or Self-Aware Substructures). The collection of all those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems capable of containing SASs is the most interesting from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point of view of the present discussion, and must have a &quot;cardinality&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not greater than that of B, since many axiom systems are too simple to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain SAS, and the ones with them are expected to predominate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The idea of this ensemble so propounded does not seem to entail an ad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absurdum paradox such as you gave above. Further, didn't I see you say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhere that you don't even believe in sets? I apologize if I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mistaken, but if that is true, I can't see how that statement would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconcile with sincere belief in the validity of the agument you gave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If there is some genuine logical inconsistency in the above, please
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point it out to me as to me this (which is Tegmark) seems like a good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direction to go in trying to formulate a proper definition of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I suggest you read my papers (published in French a long time ago, in 
<br />
english a bit more recently) or my posts to this list. Those should 
<br />
help you for making clear what is missing in Tegmark or Schmidhuber 
<br />
(and many others): the fact that they do not take into account the 
<br />
first person (plural or not) indeterminacy.
<br />
With comp (and its transfinitely numerous weakenings) we cannot know 
<br />
which computational consistent histories (in case we bet there is one) 
<br />
do support our experiences, and this put total constraints on the 
<br />
nature of any observable and sharable realities.
<br />
This *changes* everything ... Like in Plato, the physical world can 
<br />
only be the border of &quot;our&quot; ignorance or first person plenitude (as 
<br />
George Levy called it). &quot;our&quot; is &quot;us the (hopefully) sound machines&quot;. 
<br />
(or alpha-machine, a constructive ordinal based weakening of the notion 
<br />
of machine, but I use &quot;omega-machine&quot; (that is: machine) for reason of 
<br />
simplicity).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; By a simple logical tautology (a variant of ad absurdum), this proves 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;Everything is well defined&quot; is a false statement.  It also raises 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; doubts as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to the existence of this so called Everything.  Maybe this google 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; group
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; should end?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I don't think so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; My quip was something along the lines of, &quot;however, in any ternary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; logic, ad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; absurdum is not a tautology and therefore, can't be used here.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That discussion got me going and while mostly off task, I've been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; about this on and off since then.  Basically, my motivation to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;rescue&quot; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal set is so that Cantor's dream of formalizing in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some type of deity could be realized.  The analogy would be Abraham 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Robinson
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is to Issac Newton (on infinitesimals) as Quinne (et al) are to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Cantor (on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal set).  Right idea, but never considered using fuzzy logic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be delved into much until Lukaseiwicz, Zadeh, and others revitalized 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; FL.  As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it took an army of giants to &quot;rescue&quot; Newton's intuition which was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; criticized by another philosopher (Berkeley, akin to Russell) to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; develop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; enough tools (compactness theorem), it is taking an army of logicians 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;rescue&quot; Cantor's intuition about God which, and this may be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; apocrypha, he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; believed to be his maximally infinite set.  He thought infinity must 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; attribute of God and therefore delved into infinite sets, hoping, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assume,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to reach some type of Omega set that contains all sets and would then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessarily the &quot;biggest&quot; infinity.  Cantor proved that the power set 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; set is &quot;larger,&quot; however, and settled his own quest in his own way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; though
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm guessing he -desired- the opposite conclusion to have been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reached.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Others in the FL army are trying to reach that conclusion which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Cantor,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; chronologically, would have to have re-discovered much mathematics to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; realize in the way this army is doing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So the basic motivation is to find some type of thing with maximality 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some important sense and study it.  With the MUH, now I suspect that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Everything would be a likely candidate for a literal God and atheism 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have to suddenly be the irrational side to be on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So on this note, the works of David Hawkins (a psychiatrist and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; spiritualist) inspired me to ponder the following question, along with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Tegmark's articulation of the MUH, of course.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Which mathematical structure -is- the universe in Physics?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I suspect it might already exist and has been studied.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree. We could exist in the Mandlebrot set for all we know.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />*assuming* comp, we do. This follows from comp and result by Blum, Shub 
<br />
and Smale I have conjecture this, as Penrose did for a slightly weaker 
<br />
statement.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Determining which mathematical structure is our own universe is likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practically impossible, though determining which classes of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical structures are more likely candidates may be doable.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I think we have no choice in the matter (once we assume the 
<br />
&quot;unbelievable comp hyp.&quot;). The physical is not just a mathematical 
<br />
structure among others. The physical emerged from a sort of sum 
<br />
pertaining on the whole of the mathematical possible histories. If this 
<br />
does not give the empirical physics, then comp will be refuted. But 
<br />
preliminary results give already a sort of quantum topology. The one I 
<br />
have more or less extracted from the comp hyp, at the modest 
<br />
propositional level, has not yet been prove to be be equivalent to 
<br />
universal quantum topology, but they are clues indicating that comp 
<br />
could be the promising path. It is quasi obvious that comp entails many 
<br />
consistent histories, and the math gives reasons why such histories 
<br />
interferes statistically in a &quot;quantum way&quot;, i.e. with a 
<br />
perpendicularity relation on the possible incompatible states/stories.
<br />
Ah yes the &quot;truly&quot; parallel realities are perpendicular, but this is 
<br />
already the case with quantum mechanics and its &quot;scalar product&quot;.
<br />
What is hard, and on which I am stuck since years is to find the 
<br />
(arithmetical) needed tensor product, or how does a first person plural 
<br />
reality occur. Mathematically it is enough to assume at some place a 
<br />
linearity condition. But this is cheating; we have to justify that 
<br />
linearity from comp only, as comp justifies we have to do. Sorry if I 
<br />
am a bit short.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the correct non-Euclidean Geometry applicable to the universe we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; gets us to a GR that coincides with observation (for the most part?). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; guessing that the universe must have an MV-algebra 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; structure.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV-algebra">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV-algebra</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I was trying to rejoin Bruno's &quot;too rich&quot; -valid- (imho) objection to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Tegmark's approach in his MUH paper by concocting a theory that was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; far less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rich.  All I need are things and a notion of containment.  I was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; going to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; call it container theory.  Then there'd be no need to develop 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; strong enough to do numbers, infinite sets, and such, so with those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; goals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; gone, so much more is available to Physics without having to squeeze 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; any set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theory or logic into Physics.  It's there, I suspect, in -classical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; logic-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and recent -algebra- in the guise of MV-algebra.  This area is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exactly what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I mean by thing and containment.  Now if you look at the wiki article 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; above,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; observe, firstly, how little there is reliance on sets or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; non-classical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Secondly, I could view all the letters that would normally be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; variables as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; things in the &quot;container theory&quot; I was trying to work on.  In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MV-algebras,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the variables represent truth degrees and the carrier of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MV-algebra is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the truth set, the set of all truth values which has cardinality two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; classical logics.  But this seems promising for my 'container theory' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I was assuming someone had done that I just had to find somewhere. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Now if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; each variable is now a worldline, one think of it that way.  The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; carrier of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the MV-algebra is the set of all worldlines in one parallel universe. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  An
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ideal could be a sub-universe that isn't parallel.  The circle-plus 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; notion of joining and the circle-times is the notion of intersecting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; meeting (to use Boolean terminology which is much more compatible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; natural languages).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The 0 in the MV-algebra could be intuitively compared to that which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; contains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nothing or the empty container.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The notion of containment is given by the ordering induced by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; circle-plus and negation operator, listed in detail in Siegfried 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Gottwald's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;A Treatise on Many-Valued Logics&quot; in section 9.2.1 on pages 215-234.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So if each variable represents a world-line consistent with -some- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; laws of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some Physics, which vary from parallel to parallel (a parallel would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ideal of an MV-algebra), then maybe this way to view MV-algebras 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; interesting to a Physicist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To glue MV-algebras together into what the multiverse might be, not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more complex than a simple union would suffice, I think (not having 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; along those lines yet)?
