<br />I don't think most of our versions of multiverse theories depend on the
<br />
assumption that present-day physics is close to being right.  It's true
<br />
that we have some efforts such as those of Russell Standish to derive QM
<br />
from a multiverse model, but (no offense to Russell) I don't think most
<br />
of us have found those very convincing.  If it should turn out that QM
<br />
is not right, is only an approximation to a deeper theory, I don't think
<br />
that would be seen as invalidating any of our models.
<br />
<br />In fact, I don't see present day physics as being very likely to be right,
<br />
from the context of the multiverse theories I favor.  I would expect
<br />
our universe's physical laws to have a simple mathematical/computational
<br />
formulation; in fact, they should be among the simplest such laws that
<br />
could allow life and consciousness to evolve.  Does string theory or LCG
<br />
or other exotic variants of QM meet this criterion?  It doesn't seem so,
<br />
to me.
<br />
<br />In Wolfram's book A New Kind of Science he emphasizes the important role
<br />
of simple computational systems (i.e. systems which can be simulated
<br />
with short programs, which means that they would have a large measure
<br />
in the Universal Distribution).  Wolfram was trained as a physicist and
<br />
he makes an effort to sketch a computationally oriented physical model
<br />
that might be consistent with observation.  IMO what he comes up with
<br />
is highly complex and not particularly physical.
<br />
<br />In short, if there really exists a simple mathematical explanation
<br />
of our universe, which IMO is a prediction of multiverse theories, I
<br />
don't see our present physical models as being very close to that goal.
<br />
That doesn't mean that multiverse theories are wrong, but it illustrates
<br />
an inconsistency between multiverse models and the belief that we are
<br />
&quot;almost there&quot; towards a ToE.
