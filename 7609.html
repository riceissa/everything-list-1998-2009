I clarify and progress a little bit. Then I jump a little bit.
<br />
(Sorry for quoting myself)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OBJECTION?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah! but Lee could have build an objection by saying that in Stathis' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory we die, or can die, at each &quot;instant&quot;, or at each teleportation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment. He told us this in its death thread.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The objection is that the idea that &quot;Bp true in world w&quot; represents 
<br />
&quot;Probability(p) = 1 in world w&quot;, although quite obvious in &quot;ideal 
<br />
multiverses&quot; (multiiverse where all worlds or observer-moments are 
<br />
transient), is not obvious at all in &quot;Stathis multiverse&quot; where we die 
<br />
or can die at each observer-moment (that is, all transient world leads 
<br />
to (at least) a cul-de-sac world).
<br />
This led us to the following problem &quot;Bf is true or false in a 
<br />
dead-end&quot;. I will come back to it below.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis was doing Kripke semantics, perhaps like Jourdain was doing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prose. He suggests to define a state (world, OM, ..) as being &quot;alive&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when it is &quot;transient&quot;:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The state/world/OM... x is &quot;alive&quot; when there is a y such that xRy
</em><br />
<br /><br />Note that x could be equal to y, in which case the world x reaches 
<br />
itself. Such a world/state/OM is of course transient, or alive.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and a state is &quot;dead&quot; when there is no such accessible world from x. x 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is terminal, or cul-de-sac, dead-end, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now in Stathis' theory, we die at each instant and this means that all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transient states reach dead-end worlds!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Let me give you examples of a &quot;Stathis's multiverse&quot; (&quot;near death&quot; 
<br />
multiverses)
<br />
<br />1)  {w1, w2} with the accessibility relation w1Rw1, w1Rw2  (and nothing 
<br />
else).
<br />
There is only one alive state (w1), and one dead state (w2). It follows 
<br />
stathis&quot; rule that all alive states reach a dead-end. I suggest people 
<br />
(interested) do the drawing. Drawing does not survive the archive 
<br />
without coming up a little surreal!
<br />
<br />2) {w, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, ...} with accessibility relation:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w1 R w2,  w2 R w3, w3 R w4, etc., together with for all i wi R w.
<br />
Note that w is here a cul-de-sac world reached by all transient worlds 
<br />
wi
<br />
<br />exercise: Draw 5 examples of finite &quot;near death&quot; multiverse, and 5 
<br />
examples of infinite one (drawing &quot;...&quot; is permitted).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now suppose x is alive. This means there is y such that xRy. But the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposition true, t, is true in all world, and thus it is true in y. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This means Bf is false in x (by KRIPKE IMPORTANT LINE). It is just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; false that f is true in all accessible world from x, giving that in y 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; t is true (and xRy). So in any world x which is alive, Bf is false. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This means that  ~Bf is true (worlds obeys classical logic). and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; giving that f equivalent with ~t, this means that ~B~t is true in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alive state.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Is that OK for everybody?  (among those interested)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What about ~B~t, or ~Bf,  in a dead-end state?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What about Bf in a dead-end state?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Is that question clear? Nobody wants to propose an answer?  ( the 
<br />
answer is below).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a little bit tricky and I let you think (I must go now). It is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important also for getting a &quot;theory&quot; (set of propositions through in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all worlds in some multiverse, where a multiverse is just a set of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds (OMs) with some specified accessibility relation among worlds 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (OMs).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ouh la la!!!  Please read &quot;true&quot; instead of &quot;through&quot; !
<br />
<br />The idea that a theory (set of propositions) should be true in all  
<br />
worlds is natural among physicists. SWE is supposed to be true 
<br />
&quot;everywhere in the quantum multiverse&quot;.  If a law changes it is 
<br />
arguably not a law. Many expected that my way to isolate physics would 
<br />
lead to &quot;classical propositional calculus&quot;. The only laws would be the 
<br />
(classical) laws of logic! Well, my answer was that if that was the 
<br />
case (with comp) that would mean that physics is empty (no physical law 
<br />
at all). Only history and geography. A little like Smullyan describes 
<br />
the difference between math and physics in FU (Forever Undecided) page 
<br />
47, when he says:
<br />
<br />&quot;Given any possible world, the set of all propositions that are true 
<br />
for that world, together with the set of all propositions which are 
<br />
false for that world, constitute the state of affairs holding for that 
<br />
world. A tautology, then is true, not only for this world, but for all 
<br />
possible worlds. The physical sciences are interested in the state of 
<br />
affairs that holds for the actual world, whereas pure mathematics and 
<br />
logic study all possible states of affairs&quot;.
<br />
<br />Comp makes this statements false, even staying in classical logic (in 
<br />
Platonia). That's not obvious. Would Smullyan's statement be a 
<br />
consequence of comp, then, as I said, physics would be a branch of 
<br />
geography, and all physical laws would be contingent.
<br />
<br /><br />Bf ?
<br />
<br />Let us come back to the question of the truth or the falsity of Bf in a 
<br />
dead-end observer moment w. (f = false, and a dead-end world/state/OM 
<br />
is an OM without reachable world, or without &quot;successor&quot; as Stathis 
<br />
said). Here w stands for an arbitrary cul-de-sac state.
<br />
<br />Bf true in w would mean that for all y such that wRy, f is true in y.
<br />
This means that for all y :  if wRy then f is true in y.
<br />
But w is a cul-de-sac so wRy is always false, and &quot;f is true in y&quot; is 
<br />
also always false, so
<br />
Bf true in w is equivalent with &quot;for all y false -&gt; false&quot;. But that is 
<br />
always true!!!
<br />
<br />So Bf is true in any cul-de-sac world.
<br />
<br />And this jeopardizes the reading of Bp as a probability statement. We 
<br />
have Bf true in w (cul-de-sac world), but to say that the probability 
<br />
of the falsity is one in a cul-de-sac would be ridiculous.
<br />
<br />So the probability reading of a modal box, which I used in my 
<br />
explanation to Lee, is just irrelevant unless we make the &quot;no 
<br />
cul-de-sac hypothesis&quot;.
<br />
<br />But &quot;Stathis' theory&quot; says that there are cul-de-sac reachable from all 
<br />
transient worlds!
<br />
So my answer to Lee is incompatible with my assessment to Stathis' 
<br />
theory on observer-moment!
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So what ?
<br />
<br />And when you interview the Lobian machine, the first theory you get is 
<br />
Papaioannou's theory, which I recall says that if you are alive then 
<br />
you (can) die. (All transient OMs reach cul-de-sac OMs).   [This will 
<br />
be explained, but also has been explained see links in my url]
<br />
<br />Bf can be true only in cul-de-sac worlds (easy consequences of the 
<br />
KRIPKE IMPORTANT LINE in the preceding posts in this thread. Please 
<br />
verify by yourselves).
<br />
And Bf  is true in all cul-de-sac worlds (by the reasoning above).
<br />
<br />So the &quot;necessity&quot; of the false, Bf,  is the signature of the 
<br />
cul-de-sac world.
<br />
<br />And so the negation of Bf,  ~Bf, is the signature of the alive Oms, or 
<br />
transient worlds.
<br />
<br />If all transient worlds leads to cul-de-sac worlds, in any world ~Bf -&gt; 
<br />
~B(~Bf), meaning that if you are in a transient state/OM/world you 
<br />
cannot bet you will reach a transient worlds.
<br />
<br />Please verify that    (~Bf  -&gt;  ~B(~Bf)) is indeed true in all the 
<br />
worlds of any &quot;Papaioannou's multiverse&quot;. Verify at least on the two 
<br />
examples above.
<br />
<br />Please verify that, whatever the truth value of p is any world, (~Bp  
<br />
-&gt;  ~B(~Bp)) is also true in all &quot;near death&quot; multiverse.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />let me jump a little bit:
<br />
<br />Theorem: The following theory C, formalizes soundly and completely the 
<br />
&quot;Papaioannou's tautologies (the proposition true in all worlds of all 
<br />
&quot;mear death&quot; multiverse):
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Axiom 1  B(p-&gt;q) -&gt; (Bp -&gt; Bq)
<br />
Axiom 2  (~Bp  -&gt;  ~B(~Bp))
<br />
Inference rule 1: if you can justify both p and (p -&gt; q), then you can 
<br />
justify q
<br />
Inference rule 2: if you can justify p, then you can justify Bp
<br />
<br />This is C.
<br />
<br /><br />We have the following &quot;metatheorems&quot;:
<br />
Soundness: C proves only &quot;near death&quot; multiverse tautologies.
<br />
Completeness: all &quot;near death&quot; multiverse tautologies are provable in C
<br />
<br /><br />A cute theory, which alas proceeds from comp which motivates it (as 
<br />
illustrated by Stathis' thread), but which has just the problem that my 
<br />
&quot;obvious&quot; answers to Lee Corbin; which invokes naive probabilities,  is 
<br />
just meaningless in Stathis' theory.
<br />
<br />And the problem remains when you interview the lobian machine, it gives 
<br />
Stathis' theoy too!!under the form of the G and G* extensions of C, and 
<br />
this makes even worse the work to get a notion probability on the 
<br />
observer-moments.
<br />
<br />Well, I have been stuck on that problem for *many* years ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Look how lucky you are, I give you the solution in two words: 
<br />
Theaetetus (Plato).
<br />
<br />I said I jump,
<br />
<br />:-)
