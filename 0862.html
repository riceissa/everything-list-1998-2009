I will comment here Chris Maloney, James Higgo and Hans Moravec.
<br />
<br />Chris Malloney:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[...] yet, about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;terminology used on this group, in particular, relative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strong-Self-Sampling Assumption (SSSA)&quot; and &quot;Strong SSSA&quot; (did you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;really mean &quot;strong strong self-sampling assumption, Bruno?).
</em><br />
<br />Have I write that ? In any case, I mean only absolute SSSA versus 
<br />
relative Strong SSA.
<br />
SSA = Nick Bostrom's Self Sampling Assumption.
<br />
Strong = the domain is the set of observer-instant or kind of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instantaneous state of consciousness (but not on people)
<br />
Relative = we only try to define a conditional measure, like
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everett relative states (in fact).
<br />
<br />Chris Malloney:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[...] we need to establish some kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure over the set of possible universes, and thus, in theory, over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the set of all existing observer-moments (I just made the assumption 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that possible == exists, which is a tenent of this group).  This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brings us to the question which was posed in the very first post to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this group, by Wei Dai:  how do we establish this measure?
</em><br />
<br />This is indeed the fundamental question. With the computationalist 
<br />
hypothesis, it is almost the only question. Those who will answer that
<br />
question with comp will:
<br />
<br />1) solve the flying rabbit problem,
<br />
2) complete the reversal (anthropic or better Turing-tropic) between
<br />
&nbsp;physical science and theoretical computer science,
<br />
3) solve the problem of the origin of the *consciousness of the apparent 
<br />
physical laws*.
<br />
<br />In chapter 1-4 of <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal</a>, I argue
<br />
that comp implies the necessity of solving the reversal problem. In 
<br />
chapter 5, just to illustrate precisely my point, I make an attempt to 
<br />
solve the
<br />
reversal (alias the rabbit, alias the measure) problem by making
<br />
a sort of infinite interview of a self-referentially correct universal 
<br />
machine. 
<br />
<br /><br />Chris Malloney:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So the &quot;flying rabbit&quot; problem is just a restatement of the &quot;why are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there physical laws&quot; question, which has also been debated on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;list myriads of times.
</em><br />
<br />Absolutely. It is also a restatement of the *measure problem* as I say
<br />
above. 
<br />
I guess we discussed it a myriad of times because it is so important.
<br />
The very formulation of the problem depends on the choice of the type
<br />
of SSA, strong or weak (Hal's and Wei Dai's terms), relative or absolute
<br />
(the immortality camp favours the &quot;relative&quot;, isn'it?).
<br />
And so one.
<br />
<br />Chris Malloney:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do agree with Jacques M. Mallah that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;group desperately needs a FAQ, especially to tie different approaches
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the same questions together.
</em><br />
<br />Why not create a SUMMARY thread in which all people could try, to sum up 
<br />
shortly, from time to time, their evolving mutual understandings and 
<br />
misunderstandings.
<br />
For exemple the group can be easily divided in:
<br />
<br />BEGIN
<br />
the computationnalist / the non comp. /  not yet decided or indifferent;
<br />
the immortality positive/the mortality positive/ not yet decided or 
<br />
indif.;
<br />
accept the use of the SSA/doesn't accept SSA/ not yet ...;
<br />
Strong SSA/ Weak SSA/ not yet ...;
<br />
Relative SSA/Absolute SSA/ not yet ...;
<br />
The cells obeys the laws of chemistry/chemistry obeys the laws of cells/ 
<br />
not yet ...;
<br />
...;
<br />
END
<br />
<br />But ...
<br />
I don't know. We can think about it. That could perhaps help to agree on
<br />
our disagreements. To accelerate a convergence toward a possible 
<br />
Everything FAQ, indeed.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;case it requires an explanation just as ours does.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;JH&gt;That's like saying the Mandelbrot set does not exist unless someone runs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the program on a computer outside that set to generate a graphic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;representation of oit on a computer screen.
</em><br />
<br />I agree with James Higgo here. That is why Tegmark can have a
<br />
O-information theory explaining how self-aware submathematical structures 
<br />
will define-discover their (relative) physical realities.
<br />
There is no need for a primitive reality to sustained a concrete dreaming 
<br />
computer because &quot;primitive realities&quot; could be defined by the possible 
<br />
computationnal histories.
<br />
Actually I believe, like Penrose (on this point!), that it is quite
<br />
plausible that the very Mandelbrot Set codes all computational histories. 
<br />
It would be a sort of projection of UD* (the complete execution of the 
<br />
universal dovetailer, the complete work of the great programmer, ...).
<br />
This can help for the measure problem, but I have not taken this path.
<br />
<br />Now, as I said before, I don't think Tegmark will succeed by taking
<br />
the whole Mathematics, which is a monster which has swallowed all
<br />
mathematicians who have try to give it a (mathematical) name.
<br />
The miracle, for the computationnalist, is that Church's thesis, permit 
<br />
to give a name to the effective equivalent of the whole Mathematics, 
<br />
namely the Universal Turing Machine (or his extended execution).
<br />
This makes effective (see also Wei Dai at the begining of the discussion) 
<br />
the derivation of the probabilities.
<br />
The fact that this concept does not lead to a contradiction is ultimately 
<br />
linked to the closure of the set of partial recursive functions (with or 
<br />
without oracle) with respect to the more transcending mathematical 
<br />
operation ever invented i.e. diagonalisation.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;On the one hand, an engineer who completely understands a robot has no

<br />It is possible that genuine intelligent behavior will appear when 
<br />
engineers
<br />
will build complex machines whith lot of independant layers of redondant
<br />
and self-repairing parts. By allowing indefinite iteration of 
<br />
self-modifications by the machines, during a possible long time,
<br />
it will be hard for an engineers to say that she understand completely 
<br />
what happen in the machine. Like surprising patterns appearing from 
<br />
simple rules (like in cellular automata), surprising behavioral patterns 
<br />
could emerge.
<br />
This is confirmed by the results in the field &quot;Computational Learning 
<br />
Theory&quot; where all theorems are necessarily highly non constructive.
<br />
We could still understand the main psychology of the machine. We can link
<br />
consciousness to the automatic ability to infer models (including 
<br />
unnameable self-models) for exemple. But if the machine get our (or more 
<br />
than our) intelligence, we will no more really understand it, will we ?
<br />
I guess this follows by what you are saying. This makes *third person 
<br />
attribution of consciousness* relative, it does not make necessarily 
<br />
*first person consciousness* relative (although the *content* of a first 
<br />
person consciousness is relative!).
