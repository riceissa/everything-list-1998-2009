<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anthropic predictions for neutrino masses
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is argued that small values of the neutrino masses may be due to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anthropic selection effects. If this is the case, then the combined mass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the three neutrino species is expected to be ~1eV, neutrinos causing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a non-negligible suppression of galaxy formation.

<br />Tegmark's has a brief page on this at
<br />
<a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/anthroneutrino.html">http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/anthroneutrino.html</a>,
<br />
where he adds, &quot;The taboo of the ``A-word'' seem to be weakening in
<br />
the physics community, as you'll see if you click
<br />
&lt;<a href="http://arXiv.org/find/hep-th,cond-mat,astro-ph,hep-ex,physics,gr-qc,math-ph,hep-lat,hep-ph,nucl-th,nucl-ex,quant-ph/1/fr:+anthropic/0/1/0/all/0/1">http://arXiv.org/find/hep-th,cond-mat,astro-ph,hep-ex,physics,gr-qc,math-ph,hep-lat,hep-ph,nucl-th,nucl-ex,quant-ph/1/fr:+anthropic/0/1/0/all/0/1</a>&gt;
<br />
to search for anthropic on arxiv.org. My last search gave as many as
<br />
77 hits, mostly recent work, providing a good entry point into the
<br />
literature.&quot;
<br />
<br />The idea of the paper is that if neutrinos are too massive, they will
<br />
carry away energy during galaxy formation and keep it from happening.
<br />
Then universes with too-heavy neutrinos won't have many galaxies, hence
<br />
less chance for life.
<br />
<br />Looking at it in the context of what he called the &quot;level 2&quot; multiverse in
<br />
his SciAm paper (multiple bubbles separated during the inflationary era),
<br />
he says that string theory offers the possibility that neutrino masses
<br />
derive from a field F_a, which will take on different values in different
<br />
level 2 universes.  This would suggest that the different universe-bubbles
<br />
would have relatively random neutrino masses.  Universes with too-high
<br />
neutrino masses would form few galaxies, so we don't live in one of those.
<br />
<br />Applying the galaxy-formation limit implies that the sum of the masses
<br />
of the 3 types of neutrinos must be less than approximately 3 eV.  Then
<br />
he assumes that the masses are otherwise more or less randomly distributed
<br />
within the range from 0 to 3 eV, and (taking some other factors into
<br />
account) he comes up with a 90% confidence prediction that the sum of
<br />
the masses are &gt; 0.07 eV.
<br />
<br />Current observations of solar neutrinos have been interpreted to
<br />
imply that the sum of the masses are &gt; 0.04 eV.  So the new prediction
<br />
is consistent with observations and is somewhat stronger.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that Tegmark is applying anthropic reasoning in a rather
<br />
bold way which actually weakens his conclusion.  If I am understanding his
<br />
charts, a neutrino mass sum of as high as 3 eV would exert considerable
<br />
suppression on galaxy formation, to the point that only 1/10 as many
<br />
galaxies would form as if the masses were less than about 0.1 eV.
<br />
He still considers this possible in his predictions, because life would
<br />
still have a good chance of forming in such a universe, and there are
<br />
particle-physics reasons to believe that higher neutrino masses are
<br />
more likely.
<br />
<br />So he's applying the AP from the perspective of all possible forms of
<br />
life throughout the universe.  He's saying, given that we are alive,
<br />
what are the possible neutrino masses?  And then they could be as high
<br />
as 3 eV.
<br />
<br />But we know more than this.  We can look out and see galaxies.  From this
<br />
we can derive some estimates on their formation rates.  Is it possible
<br />
that in our universe only 1/10 as many galaxies have formed as would
<br />
have happened at lower neutrino masses?  I'm not sure, but I am doubtful
<br />
of that.  I would think that this would be a well known and recognized
<br />
puzzle in cosmology - the &quot;missing galaxies problem&quot; - and I've never
<br />
heard of such a thing.  (Keep in mind that I am not a physicist.)
<br />
<br />Assuming this is true, Tegmark could have applied a more stringent form
<br />
of anthropic reasoning, asking not just what parameters are consistent
<br />
with the formation of life, but asking which ones are consistent with
<br />
our specific observations.  If I'm right about the lack of observational
<br />
evidence for suppression of galaxies, then he could lower his upper
<br />
bound on neutrino masses by perhaps an order of magnitude, and tighten up
<br />
his predictions.  (However, due to his methodology, lowering the upper
<br />
bound would correspondingly reduce his lower bound, perhaps eliminating
<br />
the advance over the already-known 0.04 eV.)
<br />
<br />Although his approach leads to a weaker prediction, it is more consistent
<br />
with the multiverse philosophy, where we anticipate living observers
<br />
arising in many different universes.  In that context it is natural to
<br />
seek limitations which would apply as broadly as possible.
