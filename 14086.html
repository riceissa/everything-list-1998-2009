<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;objective&quot; truths about the temporal flow between OMs from a 1st-person

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective (for example, an objective truth about the relative

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilities that an experience of OM X will be followed by OM Y vs. OM Z),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or whether there is no such well-defined and objectively correct theory, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the only thing we can say is that the memories of some OMs have purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualitative similarities to the experiences of others. Are you advocating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the latter?
</em><br />
<br />I believe that the idea of a self extended in time is a kind of
<br />
illusion, but it's an important illusion that I would like to
<br />
continue. What I can expect the next experience of this illusional
<br />
self to be can be objectively calculated using the measure and degree
<br />
of similarity of candidate successor OM's (to the extent that these
<br />
parameters can be determined), as you discuss below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;If you assume that the probability is determined by the ratio of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;measure of Y to Z, given that Y and Z are equally good candidate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;successor OM's, this takes care of it and is moreover completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;independent of any theory of consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the &quot;theory of consciousness&quot; is needed to decide whether Y and Z are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed &quot;equally good candidate successor OMs&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Oh, by &quot;theory of consciousness&quot; it seems you mean what I mean by
<br />
&quot;theory of personal identity&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, what if X is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moment of the actual historical Napoleon, Y is another OM of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; historical Napoleon, while Z is an OM of a delusional patient who thinks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he's Napoleon, and who by luck happens to have a set of fantasy memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which happen to be quite similar to memories that the actual Napoleon had.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is there some real fact of the matter about whether Z can qualify as a valid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successor, or is it just a matter of opinion?
</em><br />
<br />I would say that if Z is really just as good as the original
<br />
Napoleonic OM's, then it would have to qualify as a valid successor.
<br />
Of course the patient's brain would be far less likely to produce the
<br />
requisite OM's than Napoleon's brain, but in principle it is possible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also see no reason to think that the question of whether observer-moment Y
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is sufficiently similar to observer-moment X to qualify as a &quot;successor&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be a purely binary question as opposed to a &quot;fuzzy&quot;  one. After all,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you say the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, and if Y can be described in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical language as a particular computation or pattern of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cause-and-effect or somesuch, then you can consider making a series of small
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modifications to the computation/causal pattern, giving a series of similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OMs Y', Y'', Y''', etc...eventually you'd end with a totally different OM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that had virtually no resemblance to either X or Y. So is there some point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the sequence where you have an observer-moment that qualifies as a valid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successor to X, and then you change one bit of the computation or one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neural-firing event, and suddenly you have an observer-moment that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely invalid as a successor to X? This seems implausible to me, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes more sense that a theory of consciousness would determine something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like a &quot;degree of similarity&quot; between an OM X and a candidate successor OM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Y, and that this degree of similarity would factor into the probability that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an experience of X would be followed by an experience of Y.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this case, if I am currently experiencing X, the relative probabilities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that my next OM is Y or Z might be determined by both the relative &quot;degree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of similarity&quot; of Y and Z to X *and* the absolute measure of Y and Z
</em><br />
<br />Yes, you would need to do some sort of calculation with measure
<br />
multiplied by degree of similarity, or rather degree of
<br />
appropriateness as successor - since my OM's of a minute ago are very
<br />
similar to my present OM but would not qualify at all as my
<br />
successors.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be even more complicated; perhaps it would depend on some measure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the internal coherence of all the different infinite sequences of OMs which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain X and which have Y or Z as a successor).
</em><br />
<br />What does &quot;contain X&quot; mean? I think of X as the complete content of one OM.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you have time you might want to take a look at the discussion in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thread &quot;FW: Quantum accident survivor&quot; at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/23eq4g">http://tinyurl.com/23eq4g</a> which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; got continued in the thread &quot;Request for a glossary of acronyms&quot; that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; linked to earlier at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2wah5v">http://tinyurl.com/2wah5v</a> ...in particular, you could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; look at my posts at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/28fogw">http://tinyurl.com/28fogw</a> and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2hwdfz">http://tinyurl.com/2hwdfz</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on that thread (and possibly also the post <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3a6k7j">http://tinyurl.com/3a6k7j</a> from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 'Request for a glossary of acronyms' thread which builds on them) where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I talk more about this idea that the probability of a given OM being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experienced as my &quot;next&quot; one might depend on a combination of its absolute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure and its degree of similarity to my current one, and how this leads
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to my own pet theory of how one might get a TOE that assigns a unique
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure to each OM. But to summarize it here, my pet theory is that there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be a unique self-consistent solution when you impose the above rule
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the probability of my &quot;next&quot; OM,  along with a global constraint
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalent to the idea that all the &quot;tanks of water&quot; maintain a constant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amount of water in them (with the amount of water standing for the absolute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure of each observer-moment) even as they are constantly giving up water
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to other tanks (the tanks that stand for possible successor OMs, with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relative amount of water a tank X gives to tank Y vs. tank Z standing for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the relative probability that Y vs. Z will be the next experience after X)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and receiving water from other tanks (their 'precursor' OMs). This global
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constraint would give you something like the following system of equations:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P(A) = P(A)*P(A -&gt; A) + P(B)*P(B -&gt; A) + P(C)*P(C -&gt; A) + ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P(B) = P(A)*P(A -&gt; B) + P(B)*P(B -&gt; B) + P(C)*P(C -&gt; B) + ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P(C) = P(A)*P(A -&gt; C) + P(B)*P(B -&gt; C) + P(C)*P(C -&gt; C) + ...
</em><br />
<br />I don't see why they should sum up this way. Suppose A is you about to
<br />
toss a coin, B is you observing heads and C is you observing tails. If
<br />
the coin is fair, P(B) = P(C); let's say they both equal 1 in
<br />
arbitrary units of measure. Then S(A,B) = S(A,C) = 1 since either B or
<br />
C succeeding A are equally valid outcomes while all other combinations
<br />
are impossible and S(X,Y) = 0. P(A) could be anything at all; say
<br />
1000. We now have (from the cancelled out equation below):
<br />
<br />1 = P(A)*S(A, A) + P(B)*S(B, A) + P(C)*S(C, A)
<br />
1 /= 1000*0 + 1*0 + 1*0
<br />
<br />1 = P(A)*S(A, B) + P(B)*S(B, B) + P(C)*S(C, B)
<br />
1 /= 1000*1 + 1*0 + 1*0
<br />
<br />1 = P(A)*S(A, C) + P(B)*S(B, C) + P(C)*S(C, C)
<br />
1 /= 1000*1 + 1*0 + 1*0
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...where A, B, etc. are OMs, P(B) would be the absolute measure of B, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P(A -&gt; B) would be the probability that B would be the successor of A. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you then use the rule that P(A -&gt; B) would be something like S(A, B)*P(B),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where S(A, B) is some measure of the &quot;similarity&quot; of B to A which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determined by a theory of consciousness, and P(B) is again the absolute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure of B, then the above system of equations becomes:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P(A) = P(A)*S(A, A)*P(A) + P(B)*S(B, A)*P(A) + P(C)*S(C, A)*P(A) + ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P(B) = P(A)*S(A, B)*P(B) + P(B)*S(B, B)*P(B) + P(C)*S(C, B)*P(B) + ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P(C) = P(A)*S(A, C)*P(C) + P(B)*S(B, C)*P(C) + P(C)*S(C, C)*P(C) + ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And with each equation you can divide both sides by the expression on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; left side, giving:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1 = P(A)*S(A, A) + P(B)*S(B, A) + P(C)*S(C, A) + ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1 = P(A)*S(A, B) + P(B)*S(B, B) + P(C)*S(C, B) + ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1 = P(A)*S(A, C) + P(B)*S(B, C) + P(C)*S(C, C) + ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This might be enough to uniquely determine all absolute measures P(A), P(B)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc. if your theory of consciousness already told you all the &quot;similarities&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; S(A, B), S(A, C) etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; This leads me to the analogy of pools of water with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; water flowing between them that I discussed in this post:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/msg/07cd5c7676f6f6a1">http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/msg/07cd5c7676f6f6a1</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Consider the following analogy--we have a bunch of tanks of water, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;tank is constantly pumping a certain amount of its own water to a bunch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;other tanks, and having water pumped into it from other tanks. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;ratio
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;between the rates that a given tank is pumping water into two other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;tanks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;corresponds to the ratio between the probabilities that a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;observer-moment will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;succeeded by one of two other possible OMs--if you imagine individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;water
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;molecules as observers, then the ratio between rates water is going to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;two tanks will be the same as the ratio between the probabilities that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;given molecule in the current tank will subsequently find itself in one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;those two tanks. Meanwhile, the total amount of water in a tank would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;correspond to the absolute probability of a given OM--at any given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;time, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;you randomly select a single water molecule from the collection of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;molecules in all tanks, the amount of water in a tank is proportional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;probability your randomly-selected molecule will be in that tank.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Now, for most ways of arranging this system, the total amount of water
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;different tanks will be changing over time. In terms of the analogy,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;would be like imposing some sort of universal time-coordinate on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;multiverse and saying the absolute probability of finding yourself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;experiencing a given OM changes with time, which seems pretty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;implausible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to me. But if the system is balanced in such a way that, for each tank,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;total rate that water is being pumped out is equal to the total rate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;water is being pumped in, then the system as a whole will be in a kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;equilibrium, with no variation in the amount of water in any tank over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;time. So in terms of OMs, this suggests a constraint on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;between the absolute probabilities and the conditional probabilities,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;this constraint (together with some constraints imposed by a 'theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;consciousness' of some kind) might actually help us find a unique
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;self-consistent way to assign both sets of probabilities, an idea I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;elaborated on in the &quot;Request for a glossary of acronyms&quot; thread.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; So, the requirement that the system be in &quot;equilibrium&quot;, with the total
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; amount of water in each tanks not changing over time, means that if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; randomly select one of all the water molecules in the system &quot;now&quot;, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; probability it will be in any one of the various tanks (corresponding to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; different OMs with a measure assigned) will be the same as if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;randomly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; select one of the water molecules, then wait a while so that molecule
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; time to travel through a number of successive tanks, and want to know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the probability is that it will be in the given tank &quot;then&quot;. This means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; at any moment in a water molecule's history, it will always be likely to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; reach good conclusions if it considers itself to be randomly selected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the set of all tanks weighted by their &quot;absolute probability&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;(corresponding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; to the absolute measure on each OM), you don't have a situation where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; there's a special moment where they'll be correct if they reason this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; but their conclusions will grow more and more erroneous if they do so at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; later points in their history, or a situation where there is some global
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; notion of &quot;time&quot; and the absolute probability associated with each tank
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; changing over time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I don't understand how the probability that a water molecule will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;in a given tank stays constant over time. Sure, the probability that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;random water molecule is in a given tank is proportional to the volume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;in that tank, but once a particular water molecule is identified,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;isn't it increasingly likely as time increases to end up in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;downstream tank, regardless of the volume of the downstream tanks?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You misunderstand--I fully agree that once you pick a water molecule and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; note that it's in a given tank, say tank A, then finding the probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it will &quot;next&quot; be in some other tank like B or C is affected by your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge that it was last in A, and is not just proportional to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absolute measure (total amount of water) of B or C. What I was saying is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that if you pick a random water molecule, then give it enough time to move
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to another tank, and you want to know the probability that it will be in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given tank such as B, *averaged over all possible tanks it might have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in initially*, then this probability is exactly the same as the probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it was initially in B. This is equivalent to the idea that all the tanks'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in-flows and out-flows are in equilibrium, so the amount of water in each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't change over time despite the fact that any given water molecule is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constantly moving between tanks (which stands for the idea that the global
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure on each observer-moment is fixed, there's no notion of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse assigning a different absolute measure to the same OM with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; passage of some overarching time parameter). This is also equivalent to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; condition I expressed earlier with these equations:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P(A) = P(A)*P(A -&gt; A) + P(B)*P(B -&gt; A) + P(C)*P(C -&gt; A) + ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P(B) = P(A)*P(A -&gt; B) + P(B)*P(B -&gt; B) + P(C)*P(C -&gt; B) + ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P(C) = P(A)*P(A -&gt; C) + P(B)*P(B -&gt; C) + P(C)*P(C -&gt; C) + ...
</em><br />
<br />Again, I don't see why measure should be conserved in this way. My
<br />
present OM might be orders of magnitude higher in measure than its
<br />
predecessors or successors.
