</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />To write and implement a Universal Dovetailer, you have to fix a  
<br />
universal programming language (or machine). Then the UD will generate  
<br />
the list of programs P_1, P_2, P_3, ... and run them by little pieces,  
<br />
let us say of one running step, and this for each program in such a  
<br />
way that it dovetails on all the executions, including those who does  
<br />
not stop, which we cannot avoid.
<br />
<br />Let us assume tthat the sequence P_1, P_2, P_3, ... P_i  ...   is the  
<br />
sequence of the zero variable programs (this changes nothing). Now a  
<br />
computation, for example, the computation of P_0,  will itself be a  
<br />
sequence of computational steps, like
<br />
<br />P_1^1, P_1^2, P_1^3, etc ...
<br />
<br />To run the UD, we dovetail or zig zag on the programs and their  
<br />
computational steps. Exercise: add some relevant zig zagging to the  
<br />
following infinite diagram:
<br />
<br /><br />P_1^1, P_1^2, P_1^3, P_1^4, ...
<br />
P_2^1, P_2^2, P_2^3, P_2^4, ...
<br />
P_3^1, P_3^2, P_3^3, P_3^4, ...
<br />
P_4^1, P_4^2, P_4^3, P_4^4, ...
<br />
...
<br />
<br />A solution: P_1^1, P_1^2, P_2^1, P_3^1, P_2^2, P_1^3, P_1^4, P_2^3,  
<br />
P_3^2, P_4^1, ...
<br />
<br />Each computational step P_i^j, of the ith program up to the jth step  
<br />
is completely independent of any other computations P_k^h, when i is  
<br />
different from k. Such computations do not interact. The DU, if  
<br />
programmed correctly, will never let them share the memories or  
<br />
interact in any way.
<br />
<br />But for each couple (P_i, P_k) there is another program, P_h in the  
<br />
(infinite but enumerable) list P_i which is a mini-dovetailer of the  
<br />
pair of programs (P_i, P_k). This means P_h dovetails itself on the  
<br />
execution of the two programs P_i and P_k.  Indeed, trivially, the  
<br />
universal dovetailer execute all the possible dovetailing, the  
<br />
universal one and all the other one.
<br />
<br />Again, the two new computations of P_i and P_k does not interact.
<br />
<br />But that is not enough, for all couple of programs (P_i, P_k) there is  
<br />
third program P_g, which you can seen as a bad or buggy dovetailer on  
<br />
the pair (P_i, P_k), which will execute P_i and P_k again, but with  
<br />
just one shared memory, so that progress in the running of one of them  
<br />
will destroy the memory of the other. In that sense the buggy mini- 
<br />
dovetailer makes P_i and P_k interact, in one way.
<br />
<br />Given that any digital interaction process, it can be simulated by a  
<br />
program, and the UD will soon or later simulate that interaction.
<br />
<br />For another example, the UD will run all patterns of the game of life,  
<br />
but also all couple of such patterns, all triples, all quadruples,  
<br />
actually all finite pieces of possible &quot;Eden garden&quot; of possible  
<br />
cellular automata.
<br />
<br />You can actually imagine any ways of making two programs or machines  
<br />
interact, soon or later the UD will generate ONE computation which  
<br />
will run the interaction of those machines, yet such computation will  
<br />
not interact with the proper other UD-computations. The UD will even  
<br />
generate a universal buggy dovetailing computation which makes all  
<br />
programs interact with each other, in all possible ways. All right?
<br />
<br />Please ask if something is not clear. It is simpler to explain all  
<br />
this with conical drawings, and the internal zig zagging.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In particular each computation is &quot;entangled&quot; to dovetailing on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the reals,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What do you mean by this? How do the reals enter the picture?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Do you remember the iterated self-duplication experiment? Suppose I  
<br />
invite you to make that experience. But your boss asked you to do some  
<br />
computation P (and thus your computation looks like P^1, P^2, etc...  
<br />
(the number = the steps of your computation).
<br />
So, you will do your computation and simultaneously do the iterated  
<br />
self-duplication. To simplify I will assume that you do one step of  
<br />
your computation at each duplication.
<br />
I duplicate you iteratively in two rooms, one with the number zero  
<br />
written on the wall, the other with the number one on the wall. OK?
<br />
And during that time you make the computation (to please your boss).  
<br />
So you compute P, get the first step of the computation: P^1, go to my  
<br />
duplicator (where you are scanned---and this includes your &quot;step  
<br />
result&quot; P^1----annihilated, and reconstituted in the zero-room and in  
<br />
the one-room. The two of you come back, each one of you compute one  
<br />
step of the computation to get P^2, and enter the duplicator again.  
<br />
Both are scanned, including the P^2 step-result, and then annihilated  
<br />
and reconstituted again in the two rooms. The four of you come back,  
<br />
compute the third step of the computation, and enter again the  
<br />
annihilator ...., the eight of you come back, compute the fourth step  
<br />
of the computation, and enter the duplication again, ..... the 2^n of  
<br />
you come back, compute the nth step of the computation, and enter  
<br />
again in the duplicator, etc.
<br />
<br />Now imagine your boss was a bad guy wanting to annoy you so that your  
<br />
computation is infinite: he gives to you an infinite task. And, you  
<br />
are not very lucky that day, because for my scientific research, I ask  
<br />
you to iterate an infinite numbers of times the self-duplication  
<br />
experiment.
<br />
<br />In that case, I will say that I, with your kind help, have entangled  
<br />
the infinite computation (the one that was asked by your boss) to the  
<br />
reals.
<br />
<br />The infinite self-duplication generates the reals (all the reals, and  
<br />
this without naming them nor enumerating them: no contradiction with  
<br />
Cantor theorem). The *you* can remember their path in the rooms. A  
<br />
typical one will be, after 26 self-duplications:
<br />
<br />11011101000011010011000101
<br />
<br />and the &quot;you&quot; here will have computed 26 steps of the boss  
<br />
computation, ready to compute the 27th steps and enter the duplicator  
<br />
again.
<br />
You see that on each real number (well, between 0 and 1 like  
<br />
0,11011101000011010011000101 ...), the construction duplicates your  
<br />
boss computation on each decimal. There are 2^aleph_zero reals, so in  
<br />
the limit, your infinite computation get multiplied by 2^aleph_zero.
<br />
<br />Now all this was a computable process. The boss gave you a  
<br />
computation, and the self-duplication procedure and unlimited  
<br />
iteration is programmable. So such process is executed, soon or later  
<br />
(well, really later!) by the UD, and this is true whatever computation  
<br />
your boss decided to give to you, of course. So you see that the UD  
<br />
entangles all computation with the real as possible oracles (like if  
<br />
you decide to use the room data (0 or 1) in your computation. It is  
<br />
again a case of interaction/non interaction. The UD realizes all  
<br />
options.
<br />
<br />Those real generations never appears in the execution of the UD, as  
<br />
seen in a third person point of view where everything is countable,  
<br />
but they could and actually have to play a role from the point of view  
<br />
of the self-referential betting entities relatively generated by the  
<br />
UD computations. This come from the fact that the first person is not  
<br />
aware of the delays of reconstitution, so that the measure, which bear  
<br />
on the computations, is somehow defined in the limit (cf the steps 2  
<br />
and 4 of UDA).
<br />
<br />This is our fatal destiny of universal machine: our consciousness  
<br />
lives in the terrestrial neighborhood of zero (the realm of the  
<br />
finite), but the measure which differentiates our stable and solid  
<br />
histories is defined in the celestial neighborhood of the infinite!
<br />
<br />Tell me if this helps,
<br />
<br />Bruno
