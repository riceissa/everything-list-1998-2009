<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This scientific process works pretty well

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but is somehow loosy-goosy and unsatisfying. Do theories which replace

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Probably yes.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about which

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we theorize?

<br />Sometimes there is a refinement process which looks a lot like 
<br />
refinement of a computer program, in the sense that more and more of 
<br />
the desired specifications are met. (This is like a series of subsets 
<br />
of a set, with each smaller set converging on the &quot;perfect program,&quot; a 
<br />
kind of fixed point for the process. This set-theoretic view has an 
<br />
equivalent formulation in terms of a sequence of branch points, a type 
<br />
of lattice. Cf. &quot;Lattices and Order,&quot; by Davey and Priestley, for 
<br />
example.)
<br />
<br />Other times science proceeds via substantial paradigm shifts, 
<br />
well-covered by Kuhn of course. In these &quot;knowledgequake&quot; steps, the 
<br />
model of gradual refinement is essentially shifted to one where a 
<br />
change of basis occurs, where the very building blocks are altered.  
<br />
The transition from Ptolemaic to Copernican, for example, or from 
<br />
&quot;humors&quot; to &quot;microorganisms&quot; in medicine.
<br />
<br />Both relativity (special and general) and QM basically satisfy the 
<br />
correspondence principle by reducing to the classical theories at low 
<br />
relative speeds, with ordinary falling objects in gravity fields, and 
<br />
with macroscopic objects. (QM does not in the sense that many 
<br />
phenomena--slit and photoelectric, stability of atoms, etc.--have no 
<br />
classical theory. And electronics are all around us and need QM to 
<br />
explain. But QM reduces to classical in various obvious ways.)
<br />
<br />Hey, I'm not going to write a free-form essay here on science and the 
<br />
nature of theories, so I'll move on to your next point.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But hold on, most of the scientific revolutions tell us that we had a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory, but were theorizing about a badly-scoped, badly conceptualized 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;domain&quot; was. A better theory is usually a better set of formal, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interacting concepts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which map to a slightly (or greatly) differently defined and scoped 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external domain than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; last theory mapped to. None of this is very straightforward at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, would you go out on a limb and say that Einstein's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;best&quot; (and only &quot;true&quot;) way of modelling the aspects of physics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he was concerned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I would, with some caveats.
<br />
<br />His 1905 theory has not been significantly changed, and it has been 
<br />
tested at a wide range of energies (e.g., slowed decay of muons in 
<br />
cosmic showers and accelerators, as one example).  And his 1915 theory 
<br />
has been tested in various ways, with gyroscopes in orbit, 
<br />
astrophysical objects, lensing, etc.
<br />
<br />However, a new result could always force changes. So far, these have 
<br />
not been needed. (Also, there are new solutions to field equations, new 
<br />
mathematical formalisms like differential forms over standard tensors, 
<br />
and so on. Einstein did not wrap up all problems, even with 
<br />
gravitation. This is why much work was done later, and is still being 
<br />
done.)
<br />
<br />And quantum gravity and other &quot;theories of everything&quot; which unite the 
<br />
known forces, are very much up in the air at this time.
<br />
<br />So, yes, relativity was the &quot;best&quot; theory and remains so. Is it the 
<br />
&quot;only true&quot; theory for the things it covers? Certainly not.
<br />
<br />But science is an evolutionary process, in the evolutionary learning 
<br />
and selection sense. Until something challenges a theory, the theory 
<br />
lives. Until something better comes along...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If so, would you be equally confident that his theories cover 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;essentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the important issues&quot; in that domain? Or might someone else, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someday, re-conceptualize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a similar but not 100% overlapping domain, and create an even more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanatory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory of fundamental physics than he came up with? Can we ever say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for sure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; until that either happens or doesn't?
</em><br />
<br />No, and I know of no scientists who claim that a theory is complete and 
<br />
not subject to challenge or replacement by other theories. But theories 
<br />
which appear to be comprehensive in the way QM (and QED and QCD) and 
<br />
relativity are, in their domains, are not lightly challenged. 
<br />
Especially they are not challenge by metapoints about how maybe there 
<br />
are theories which will someday subsume them.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can interpret the history of science in two ways: either we were 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bad at it back then (in Newton's day) and wouldn't make those kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mistakes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in our theory formation today,
</em><br />
<br />No, I don't think this can be said at all. Classical mechanics _is_ 
<br />
what relativity reduces to at speeds found on earth and in laboratories 
<br />
prior to the past century.
<br />
<br />There's a parsimony issue at work as well. Newton, Laplace, Lagrange, 
<br />
and all of the other classical mechanics folks might have had some 
<br />
inkling that they could incorporate &quot;fudge factors&quot; into their 
<br />
theories, parameters left blank until they could be filled in, but NO 
<br />
EXPERIMENTS and NO OBSERVATIONS needed such fudge factors. Within the 
<br />
accuracy of the experiments, there were no epicycles or orbital 
<br />
corrections needed (not for a long time, not until slight deviations 
<br />
from theory in the orbit of Mercury showed up, as one example).
<br />
<br />And this correspondence is not accidental. This is not like saying the 
<br />
theory of epicycles is a limiting case of classical mechanics and 
<br />
gravitation, which it most certainly is not. Let Planck's constant go 
<br />
toward zero and classical mechanics happens. Let v &lt;&lt; c and classical 
<br />
mechanics happens.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or you can say, no we're about as good at it as always,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maybe a little more refined in method but not much, and we'll continue 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental scientific revolutions even in areas we see as sacrosanct 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory today.
</em><br />
<br />It took better tools to see into the regimes where the older theories 
<br />
failed. It will probably take substantial increases in accelerator 
<br />
energies to see into the regimes where quantum gravity is 
<br />
evident...some say that short of probing at Planck scales (of length, 
<br />
energy, time), we will have no way to distinguish amongst competing 
<br />
theories.
<br />
<br />More optimistic folks think we may see some kind of evidence within our 
<br />
lifetimes.
<br />
<br />Certainly we are not in a solipsistic situation where new theories are 
<br />
easily formulated and knock off older theories without experimental 
<br />
evidence or unexplained phenomena.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I don't understand your &quot;secret cause of asymmetry in the universe&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; point. We understand some things about symmetry breaking in particle 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physics theories, via gauge theories and the like. If you want more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; than this, you'll have to expand on what you mean here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is a Koan (kind of). A self-referential, absurd example of a notion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that an imbalance in a formal symbol system (the words I'm using, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the quotes) could possibly be the cause of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; asymmetry in the physical universe.
</em><br />
<br />Probably not, but I won't get into a debate with you on this.
