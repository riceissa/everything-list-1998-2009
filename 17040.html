</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 2x2x2 = 8.    I thought 2^3 meant   (2*2)* (4*2)* (8*2)= 16
</em><br />
<br />You have some weird thought.
<br />
<br />Think about this:
<br />
<br />2*3 =  2+2+2
<br />
2^3 = 2*2*2
<br />
<br />4*5 = 4+4+4+4+4
<br />
4^5 = 4*4*4*4*4
<br />
<br />Take care:
<br />
a*b = b*a   (for any a and b)
<br />
a^b is different from b^a (in general. For example 5^12 = 2441140625,  
<br />
but 12^5 = 248832).
<br />
<br /><br />(And how could &quot;(2*2)* (4*2)* (8*2)= 16&quot; be true? (2*2)* (4*2)* (8*2)  
<br />
= 4*8*16 = 32*16, which is 32 times bigger than 16).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; * &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; so a^n times a^m is equal to a^(n+m)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This extends to the rational by defining a^(-n) by 1/a^n. In that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a^(m-n) = a^m/a^n. In particular a^m/a^m = 01 (x/x = 1 always), and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a^m/a^m = a^(m-m) = a^0. So a^0 = 1. So in particular 2^0 = 1.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; From the above misconception you can perhaps get an idea of how  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; utterly alien these symbols are to me. I have never run across them  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; before in all my years (and you'd be surprised to learn how many  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; years I'm talking about).
</em><br />
<br /><br />It just means you don't have had to compute in your life (up to now!).
<br />
If I enter 999999999999 in my pocket computer (TI Galaxy 67, a very  
<br />
old one), the machine wrote
<br />
<br />1 E 12,
<br />
<br />which is its way to tell me the number I enter is about 1 times 10^12.
<br />
<br />Note that &quot;a^n&quot; is not the standard notation used by mathematicians,  
<br />
but it has become standard, we could say, in the electronic mails, or  
<br />
on some pocket computers. To write &quot;2^7&quot;, which I recall is given by  
<br />
2*2*2*2*2*2*2, they will wrote &quot;2&quot; with &quot;7&quot; as little upper index.  
<br />
Engineers use often other notations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; When you say that I &quot;could have found the mistakes by carefully  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reread the definitions&quot;
</em><br />
<br />I did not said that. I was really just asking a question. And you  
<br />
provide me now a very clear answer:
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it's like saying that given a table of cyrillic letters I should be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; able to translate a passage of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />So your answer is &quot;no&quot;. I could have read the definition ten times, I  
<br />
could remain wrong, because of the accumulation of seemingly senseless  
<br />
symbols.
<br />
<br />I have no problem to understand such difficulties. I can be blind  
<br />
myself on many things, not being able to find my pen on my desk,  
<br />
although it is in front of my eyes. I tend also to confuse bills and  
<br />
advertizing.
<br />
But those are only handicaps, which, if not too severe, can be  
<br />
overcome by some amounts of work. Such handicaps could be a reason to  
<br />
panick the day before the exam, but should not deter someone who  
<br />
inquires, either for fun or for personal interrogations, in an  
<br />
environment without deadline or social pression (like here).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A concept like  a^(-n) = 1/a^n   is like having to learn a new  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; polysyllabic word.
</em><br />
<br />Not just that. You have to understand that it is a generalization of  
<br />
a^n on the integers. You have to learn a new concept. You will not  
<br />
need to remember all such notions for the &quot;ultimate&quot; understanding of  
<br />
the seventh step. At some moment I will introduce &quot;many notions&quot; just  
<br />
with the goal to generalize. The difficulty will be more conceptual  
<br />
and related to abstraction. I face the problem of either overwhelming  
<br />
you with too much concrete examples, or abstracting too quickly. No to  
<br />
people share the same &quot;perfect&quot; pedagogical path, but there is a sort  
<br />
of least common path, which can take time, but there is no rush.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I see it and the next day I've forgotten it.
</em><br />
<br />Such a problem can be overcome by work and organization. I just hope  
<br />
you have enough fun, and personal curiosity for the result, or some  
<br />
results on the path. If you forget, I can recall. I really can sum up  
<br />
each time you want. And I can sum up what we have done, or what we  
<br />
will do (it is good to remember the real goal: to understand the UDA  
<br />
&quot;reversal&quot;, and its &quot;constructive&quot; aspect). The math is needed just  
<br />
for grasping what a universal dovetailer is, and why both the UD and  
<br />
its universal dovetailing are &quot;existing&quot; (and in which sense) in  
<br />
elementary arithmetic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Having said that, let me reiterate that I do appreciate your  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; efforts to simplify and explain every step of the way and I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; apologize for sometimes needing even more clarification. Your  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; patience is saint-like and in my case, unfortunately, necessary.
</em><br />
<br />I appreciate so much people who are able to say &quot;I don't understand&quot;  
<br />
and ask question.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which is why when I see you make a simple mistake, I don't feel so  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bad because I know how easy it is to do.
</em><br />
<br />Ah ah! I am teaching you patience :)  Thanks.
<br />
<br />I ask to all those who told me they were happy that I pursue this  
<br />
little teaching further the following question.  Are you ready that I  
<br />
pursue? Are you ready that I introduce a few bit of &quot;new&quot; material.  
<br />
Sometimes (actually most of the time) new materials can shed new light  
<br />
on what has been already seen.
<br />
<br />What do you prefer, that I continue with the sets (with the notion of  
<br />
couples, and then of cartesian products, and then of operation,  
<br />
relation, function, etc.)
<br />
Or do you prefer I prove first that the square root of 2, you know,  
<br />
that number which multiplied by itself gives 2, is irrational (= does  
<br />
not belongs to Q, = is not a fraction,  = is not a periodic decimal). ?
<br />
<br />I am sure many of you already know this, but this is an typical  
<br />
impossibility result, and somehow the whole machine 'theology' is a  
<br />
collection of impossibility results, so the irrationality of the  
<br />
square root of 02 is a good introduction to such type of result. Also I  
<br />
will give you a typical example of non constructive proof base on the  
<br />
square root of two. (And for those interested in the quantum  
<br />
confirmation of comp, the square root of 2 is the amplitude  
<br />
coefficient leading to the probability 1/2, which is rather important,  
<br />
if only for examples again).
<br />
<br />It is really like most prefer. You can tell me: &quot;do like you want&quot;,  
<br />
but I prefer to ask.
<br />
<br />Bruno
