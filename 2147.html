&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I have been busy.  I will be a Physics Instructor at Ferris 
<br />
State University this coming school year.  This will be my first real job, 
<br />
and I have to relocate.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: &quot;Bostrom,N&quot; &lt;N.Bostrom.domain.name.hidden&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jacques wrote:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     So I take it you don't believe in &quot;quantum immortality&quot; or the &quot;RSSA&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Given MWI, you know what happens if you commit suicide. You may affect an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;increase in your average well-being at the cost of a decrease of your total 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If qm suicide became common, creatures would evolve to care about their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;total measure. Such creatures would get a greater measure.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.  Of course, natural selection implies objective measure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose, without the MWI, he would know that on a usual day a deer is 1% 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;likely to turn up.  But since this is not a usual day, but the day that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will determine whether he gives rise to a race, he would think a deer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probably will turn up which then means he won't reproduce.  (And not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reproducing would give his own case more effective probability, which is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;why he thinks it's likely.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So far I'm with you...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If he believes the MWI however, then he knows there is a branch where a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;deer turns up and one where it doesn't.  He knows that for a usual day the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;effective probability of a deer turning up is about 1%.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Since he has no reason to believe the laws of nature are specially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;configured to correlate the amplitude of the wavefunction's branches with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;his actions (especially since such correlation would be hard to reconcile 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with QM), he will still believe the effective probability of a deer turning 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;up is just 1%.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You may be confusing subjective and objective probability.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope.  Why would you think I might do so?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both cases I have so far discussed, his Bayesian probaility 
<br />
distribution for the objective probability is sharply peaked about a 
<br />
(stochastic xor effective) probability of 1%.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common way this might occur is if he has observed, over the course of 
<br />
10 years (3652 days) that about 37 times a deer has turned up.  If he 
<br />
assumes that there is a fixed probability p, and initially has a uniform 
<br />
Bayesian distribution for p on (0,1), then his final distribution will be 
<br />
sharply peaked about 1%.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point, here, is that in such a case he *can't* suddenly assume 
<br />
&quot;today is different, so while on a usual day p=.01, I'll just have a uniform 
<br />
Bayesian prior for p_today.&quot;, and then apply the &quot;Adam paradox&quot;.  So, in 
<br />
both the non-MWI and the MWI case, p~=.01 is his prior probability before he 
<br />
considers his own situation regarding reproduction, but the effect of the 
<br />
latter is different.  So far I think you agree with that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;he may think that there is a 99% probability that the objective probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of deer is 0.000001% (&quot;no deer in the neighbourhood) and a 1% probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the objective probability being, say, 99.9%
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second thing about the MWI I discussed, for the case where 
<br />
he hasn't nailed down that objective probability to be sharply peaked about 
<br />
.01.  Here the preexisting branches must come into play.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In addition, in QM there will be many branches even before that day.  So 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it's also true that branches will exist, with about equal amplitude to his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;own where e.g. maybe the weather was different and he chose a different day 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to go &quot;deer hunting&quot;, where the Earth has two moons, or indeed where the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first man's name was Jack, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;These sort or branches do act exactly like regular old alien worlds for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this purpose.  Thus even if someone hands him a spin 1/2 particle, state 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unknown, he should not consider it just to have some wavefunction which he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could apply the &quot;Adam paradox&quot; to like a classical coin; he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;must also consider the already parallel branches where the equivalent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;particle has some other wavefunction, and there are other versions of him 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there to see it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If there are all these other fat branches in the world, then yes, I agree 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with that. However, Adam and Eve were there from the beginning, before 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there deer paths had begun to spread out much as a probability cloud over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the terrain. Or at least we can suppose they were - that's the nice thing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about thought experiments!
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it would be foolish of Adam to believe that.  Take his name, for 
<br />
example.  (Other examples are easily found.)  There are millions of other 
<br />
names he could have had.  The laws of physics (or initial conditions) would 
<br />
have to be set up in a very contrived way in order for the effective 
<br />
probability of just the one name for the first man, Adam, to be of order 
<br />
one.  Of course, in the biblical story things are very contrived because 
<br />
some guy (god) contrived it, and because this original guy was himself 
<br />
unique to start with.  It's not a coincidence that such a situation is 
<br />
implausible, and even if it was true, only a fool would believe it.  (Just 
<br />
as only a fool believes he won the lottery before he even checks the 
<br />
numbers.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And I do find the premise that he can be certain that no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;type of MWI can be true hard to swallow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;He wouldn't have to be certain about that.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, he would certainly have to assign a ludicrously high probability 
<br />
(e.g. 50%) to the idea that the MWI might be false.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Of course, everything I say in the thesis is compatible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with accepting R=Ru (i.e. setting the reference class equal to the class of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all observers) provided one is also willing to accept the Adam&amp;Eve paradox.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You still haven't presented any way to determine the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proper &quot;reference class&quot;.  I suggest you use the logical approach: include 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all observers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't see what's so particularly &quot;logical&quot; about that. In either case, we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have to deal with borderline cases and such, and make some seemingly rather 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;arbitrary postulations.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much less so if all observers are included.  And it's certainly simpler 
<br />
than any alternative.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, it is a priori possible that I could have been any 
<br />
observer.  Thus all observers must be included, by definition.  This is just 
<br />
basic Bayesian reasoning (applied to indexical information) and there is 
<br />
absolutely no question of an alternative.  This prior is then updated by 
<br />
considering the various characteristics I have, such as the particular 
<br />
observations that I have made, and comparing those with the various 
<br />
observers as usual.
