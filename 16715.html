<br />
Thank you for starting this discussion.  I have only joined recently and 
<br />
have little knowledge of your research.  To see it laid out in the 
<br />
sequence you describe should make it clear to me what it is all about.
<br />
<br />I'm particularly interested in the interaction between consciousness and 
<br />
computation.  In Max Tegmark's Ensemble TOE paper he alludes to a 
<br />
self-aware structure.  I take structure to be an object of study in 
<br />
logic (model theory, in particular) but am not at all sure how 
<br />
consciousness, which I envision self-awareness to be deeply tied to, 
<br />
connects to mathematics.  It seems you're going to build up to a 
<br />
statement such as &quot;consciousness is computable&quot; OR &quot;consciousness is not 
<br />
computable,&quot; or something about consciousness, at least.
<br />
<br />In light of that it seems a prudent fundamental step would be to define 
<br />
what it means for one structure to be aware of another.  This would 
<br />
apparently be some relation on the aggregate of all structures (which 
<br />
may be the entire level 04 multiverse in Tegmark's theory).  Perhaps some 
<br />
basic fundamental step would be to provide some axioms on what this 
<br />
relation could be but I'm almost convinced this can't be done in a 
<br />
non-controversial way.
<br />
<br />I know I'm putting the cart before the horse here so I don't expect all 
<br />
to be revealed for some time when it occurs in your exposition.  If 
<br />
there is some literature by yourself or others on the particular 
<br />
subjects and issues I mentioned, I'd appreciate links to them.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Kim, Hi Marty and others,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So it is perhaps time to do some math. Obviously, once we are open to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the idea that the fundamental reality could be mathematical, it is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normal to take some time to do some mathematics. Many people seems  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also to agree here that the computationalist hypothesis could be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting, and this should motivate for some amount of theoretical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer science, or recursion theory. This is a branch of mathematics  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which study computability, and mainly uncomputability, as opposed to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation theory which study all aspect of computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can easily show that something is computable, by giving an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explicit procedure to compute it. But to show that something is NOT  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable, you need a very solid notion of computability. Now,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalism suggest that the interesting and fundamental things,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like life, consciousness, even matter, &quot;lives&quot; somehow on the border  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the computable and the non computable, so that it is perhaps time  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to dig a little bit deeper in those direction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have already explain this on this list, but never from scratch,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having in mind those who are, for whatever reason, the mathematical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I guess that many of view will find those preliminaries a bit too  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much simple. yet, by experience, I know that difficulties will appear,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it is frequent that I met people with very big baggages in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics who have some difficulties to understand the final point.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I would encourage everyone to be sure everything is clear. For  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those who have already a thorough understanding of UDA1-7, and in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular have grasped the difference between a computation and a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description of a computation, I ask them to just be patient with the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list. There will be nothing new here, nothing really original, and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing controversial. All what I will explain has been anticipate by  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Emil Post in the 1920, and found or rediscovered by many  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematicians independently in USA, and in the ex USSR.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The present post just give a preview, and the beginning . I intent to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; send only short posts, or the shorter as possible. So here is the plan.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) Set (probably a dozen of posts)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Function (I don't know how many posts, could depend on the replies.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is the key notion of math)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) Language, machine and computable function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) Universal machine, universal language, universal function,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal dovetailer, universal number ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How will I proceed?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By exercise only. I will ask question, and I will wait for either the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer. I expect that those &quot;who know&quot; wait for Kim's answer, or for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer by those who are not supposed to &quot;know&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Kim seems to courageously accept the role of the candid, but if  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone else want to answer it is OK for me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will give only VERY SIMPLE exercise. The goal is to be short and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple, and as informal as possible. I will explain by examples, and I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will avoid as much as possible tedious definitions. And when we will  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meet a more difficult question, I will just solve it myself, and even  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain why it is difficult. So, those preliminaries will not be very  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; funny. I will of course adapt myself to the possible replies, and fell  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; free to comment or even metacomment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously this is a not a course in math, but it is an explanation  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from scratch of the seven step of the universal dovetailer argument.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is a shortcut, and most probably we will make some digression from  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time to time, but let us try not to digress too much.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kim, you are OK with this? I have to take into account the problem you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; did have with math, and which makes this lesson a bit challenging for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me, and I guess for you too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I begin with the very useful and elementary notion of set, as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explained in what is called &quot;naive set theory&quot;, and which is the base  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of almost all part of math.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ============================================= begin  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ===============================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) SET
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Informal definition: a set is a collection of object, called elements,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the idea that it, the collection or set, can be considered itself  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as an object. It is a many seen as a one, if you want. If the set is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not to big, we can describe it exhaustively by listing the elements,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if the set is bigger, we can describe it by some other way. Usually we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use accolades &quot;{&quot;, followed by the elements, separated by commas, and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then &quot;}&quot;, in the exhaustive description of a set.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Example/exercise:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) The set of odd natural numbers which are little than 10. This is a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well defined, and not to big set, so we can describe it exhaustively by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. In this case we say that 07 belongs to  {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exercise 1: does the number 24 belongs to the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) the set of even natural number  which are little than 13. It is {0,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}. OK? Some people can have a difficulty which is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not related to the notion of set, for example they can ask themselves  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if zero (0) is really an even number. We will come back to this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) The set of odd natural numbers which are little than 100. This set  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is already too big to describe exhaustively. We will freely describe  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such a set by a quasi exhaustion like {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ... 95, 97,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 99}.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exercise 2: does the number 93 belongs to the set of odd natural  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers which are little than 100, that is: does 93 belongs to {1, 3,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5, 7, 9, 11, ... 95, 97, 99}?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) The set of all natural numbers. This set is hard to define, yet I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hope you agree we can describe it by the infinite quasi exhaustion by  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exercise 3: does the number 666 belongs to the set of natural numbers,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is does 666 belongs to {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exercice 4: does the real number square-root(2) belongs to {0, 1, 2,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3, ...}?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5) When a set is too big or cumbersome, mathematician like to give  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them a name. They will usually say: let S be the set {14, 345, 78}.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then we can say that 14 belongs to S, for example.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exercise 5: does 345 belongs to S?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A set is entirely defined by its elements. Put in another way, we will  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say that two sets are equal if they have the same elements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exercise 6. Let S be the set {0, 1, 45} and let M be the set described  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by {45, 0, 1}. Is it true or false that S is equal to M?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exercise 7. Let S be the set {666} and M be the set {6, 6, 6}. Is is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true or false that S is equal to M?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Seven exercises are enough. Are you ready to answer them. I hope you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't find them too much easy, because I intend to proceed in a way  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such that all exercise will be as easy, despite we will climb toward  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very much deeper notion. Feel free to ask question, comments, etc. I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will try to adapt myself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Next: we will see some operation on sets (union, intersection), and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the notion of subset. If all this work, I will build a latex document,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and make it the standard reference for the seventh step for the non  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematician, or for the beginners in mathematics.
