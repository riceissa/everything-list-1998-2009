<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their similarity to one another, which allows (virtual) motion from one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state to the next.
</em><br />
<br />Let me explain in English what the Universal Dovetailer (UD) is.
<br />
I don't necessarily agree with all the conclusions which come from the
<br />
potential existence of such a program but it will be helpful if we are
<br />
all in agreement about it.
<br />
<br />First, the word &quot;dovetail&quot; originally comes from carpentry and refers a
<br />
kind of wooden joint in which the pieces are joined in an interlocking way
<br />
that holds them together, which is supposed to resemble a dove's tail.
<br />
See <a href="http://www.kellerdovetail.com/">http://www.kellerdovetail.com/</a> for a picture of wood joined in this
<br />
way.  You can see that in this case the two pieces of wood alternate
<br />
along the joint.
<br />
<br />The word then came to be used in cards.  What is commonly called a
<br />
&quot;riffle&quot; shuffle is technically known as the dovetail shuffle.  This is
<br />
the shuffle in which the deck is split into two parts which are each held
<br />
in a hand, and then the cards from the two halves are quickly sprung
<br />
together so that they interleave into a whole, a few cards alternately
<br />
from each hand.
<br />
<br />Dovetailing thus came to be known as any system which interleaves two
<br />
or more independent processes in this way.  This is the sense in which
<br />
we mean to refer to the Universal Dovetailer.
<br />
<br />The idea of the UD is simply to run all possible computer programs on
<br />
some particular type of computer in an interleaved way, so that all of
<br />
them make progress.  It's essentially no different from what is done on
<br />
every computer today, which runs multiple tasks at once via timesharing.
<br />
Each task gets a little slice of run time, and then the computer switches
<br />
to another task.
<br />
<br />The UD has the additional burden that there are an infinite number of
<br />
possible programs.  Unlike in Linux or Windows, it is not given a fixed
<br />
set of programs and asked to dovetail between them, it has instead a
<br />
virtual machine specification and needs to generate all possible programs,
<br />
and then make sure that all of them get run eventually.
<br />
<br />Generating all the possible programs is easy; they are just all possible
<br />
bit strings.  But if you did that first, you'd never get around to
<br />
running them.  So you also have to interleave the program generation
<br />
with the running.
<br />
<br />One approach is to generate all 1-bit programs, then run each of them
<br />
for one cycle.  Then generate all 2-bit programs, and run each of the
<br />
1- and 2-bit programs for one cycle.  Then generate all 3-bit programs,
<br />
and run each of the 1-, 2- and 3-bit programs for one cycle, and so on.
<br />
In this way you can show that every program of any number of bits will
<br />
eventually be run for as many cycles as you specify.
<br />
<br />So that's the UD.  In terms of your comments above, it does more than
<br />
enumerate all possible states for &quot;you&quot;; it runs all possible programs,
<br />
and therefore it runs all possible programs for universes which contain
<br />
you, including this one you're in right now.  What about the fact that the
<br />
programs are interleaved, so they start and stop?  Why are you not aware
<br />
of this, why does your consciousness stay stuck in this one program,
<br />
even though other programs are constantly being run?  Is it Is it a
<br />
matter of similarity of state which allows &quot;virtual motion&quot; from one
<br />
state to the next, even though the UD was doing other things in between?
<br />
<br />Here we appeal to our intuition from working with timeshare computers,
<br />
or to the logic of computation, and say that this doesn't matter.
<br />
I'm typing into a window here, talking to my word processor, and the fact
<br />
that there are 83 other things going on on my computer doesn't matter;
<br />
as far as my interactions with the word processor are concerned, it is
<br />
running as a logical unit.  The only affect from the other parts of the
<br />
computer is that it might slow down.
<br />
<br />I still think there is a philosophical issue about whether running *all
<br />
possible programs* has the same effect and implications as running a
<br />
single selected program.  It's perhaps analogous to the question of
<br />
whether emitting white noise (which includes all sounds) has the same
<br />
effects as emitting a particular sound.
<br />
<br />But I won't get into that here, I just wanted to explain the UD plainly,
<br />
in terms of what it means and where the term came from.
<br />
<br />Hal
