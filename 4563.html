<br />Tegmark is just very naive about what mathematical

reality can be. He has a 19th century philosophy of mathematics.
<br />
At least Tegmark, unlike Schmidhuber, is aware that we must
<br />
take into account some difference between point of views, but
<br />
he does not take those differences into account enough, and sweeps
<br />
(like so much &quot;scientist&quot;) the mind-body problem under the rug.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;More generally, _wouldn't variations in the suitable form of mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logic, information, &amp; probability &amp; uncertainty, more plausibly reflect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something pertaining to quantum coherence, decoherence, etc., which are at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the basis for the idea of Level III, than anything pertaining to the ideas 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for the other Levels?_  (Not that I know a great deal about quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;coherence!) But Level III seems like the place for such variations, if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anywhere. No?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Only if you presuppose physicalism (which, BTW, has been
<br />
shown incompatible with the computationalist hypothesis
<br />
in the cognitive science, Marchal 88, Maudlin 89, see the ref
<br />
in my thesis downloadable from my URL, below).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tegmark does discuss how different lightcone structures (reflecting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;variation across Level II) would affect one's capacity for inference, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inferential processes in an intelligent system are a different thing than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the subjects of mathematical theories of logic, information, probability, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&amp; uncertainty. I mean that differences of lightcone structure would affect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intelligent (including inferential &amp; other philosophically interesting) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;processes as they would affect cybernetic, stochastic,  &amp; sensitive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dynamic processes. But these differences would not necessarily reflect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different forms of *mathematical* logic, information, or probability or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(more generally) uncertainty.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This depends on many possible philosophical assumptions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't know whether variation in &quot;most-suitable&quot; forms of math-logic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(e.g., different numbers of truth values), math-information, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;math-probability across a multiverse would tend to lead to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;high-energy messes&quot; that Tegmark mentions.  I don't know whether they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would lead to qualitatively more universes in Level III than in Level II. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It seems to me like they might, but I'm no physicist! Maybe it would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;amount to a violation of ergodicity as Tegmark warns, but perhaps for some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quantum-related reason these particular alternate kinds of universes would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be counted differently by the theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As for information, probability, &amp; uncertainty, I don't know enough about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical theories of them, to know what element in them one might 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consider as perhaps varying across a multiverse. Sorry, I wish I could do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;better. As regards three- or higher-valued logics, where these prevail as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suitable, there perhaps they would start to impact the view of mathematics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;itself in strange ways, I don't even know that much. For all I know, if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;alternate forms of logic, etc., hold as most suitable in some places, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;maybe this impacts those places' view of the structure of the four-level 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multiverse itself. Maybe some places would regard there as being nine or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;27 rather than four levels? Should predicate logic, if the root of such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;radical variations, therefore be put, as Tegmark already puts it, at the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;base of the mathematical structure? (On the other hand, do the four levels 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have to have a rigidly Comtean hierarchy? They might have some kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;4-chotomical structure with a subtler kind of!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  hierarchicality. After all, some consider mathematical logic an applied 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; field while others regard it as Day One 8 a.m.)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Mathematical logic is just a branch of math, like topology or
<br />
geometry, etc. The idea that logic should be used as foundations
<br />
is known to be silly since the work of Dedekind, Godel, etc.
<br />
To study &quot;variant of logics&quot; two related roads can be used: either
<br />
by a weakening of classical logic (you can get
<br />
intuitionistic logic, quantum logic, intuitionistic quantum
<br />
logic, etc.), or by extending (classical) logic with modal connectives.
<br />
Some weak logics can be mirrored by modal logics and can
<br />
give epistemic or pragmatic interpretations to those weak logic.
<br />
Modal logic is a powerful tool to study invariant discourses
<br />
with respect to &quot;observer's possible trips&quot;. The main
<br />
problem is how to choose a modal logic. In my work I have
<br />
shown how extract the unique possible logic for the physical
<br />
propositions from the only possible psychological propositions
<br />
you get from Church thesis and some amount of arithmetical
<br />
realism, once you postulate the computationnalist hypothesis
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the cognitive science. In french: with the comp hypothesis
<br />
the aristotelian notion of substance evaporates and physical
<br />
realities emerge from the provable coherence of machine dreams,
<br />
where a machine dream is 2^aleph_0 computations seen
<br />
from inside, and where &quot;seen from inside&quot; is defined through the
<br />
complete (at some level)  and sound godelian logic of
<br />
self-reference.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What got me asking these questions was that Tegmark's four-level 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multiverse picture struck me as seeming to reflect, somewhat, a structure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the fields of research as I had pictured them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If all possible universes exist, &amp; if the idiosyncrasies of histories are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reflected at Level I, &amp; the far reaches of abstract mathematics at Level 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;IV, one might well wonder whether there is a reflection, a similarity to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be seen, between the set of the four Levels of multiverses &amp; the outlines 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the most general kinds of research -- science, mathematics, &amp; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intermediate fields. A similarity between multiverse &quot;constellations&quot; &amp; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the &quot;city&quot; of research. This would require at the least that researches 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;collectively have developed to a point where their &quot;natural&quot; (unplanned, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but persistent &amp; making some kind of sense) outlines could be seen. And of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;course who knows what multiverse-theory will be like (if it persists at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all) in even only a few years. So in a way this is a lark.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I doubt it. Not only there are too many evidences for multiverse
<br />
theories, but there are no evidence for 1 universe theory,
<br />
and strictly speaking there is only 0 universes-theory or
<br />
many-universes theory in the literature. Of course a lot of
<br />
people believes that classical physics, for example, is a
<br />
1-universe theory. But this is logically untenable, and is
<br />
just a form of wishful thinking in naive cosmology.
<br />
Reality is like the Chinese TAO. Give it a name and then
<br />
it multiplies.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I wanted to pursue the analogy, because it seemed to be roughly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;working  for Levels I, II, &amp; IV. Tegmark's III &amp; my &quot;III&quot;, if they do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;roughly match up, are less than obvious about it to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tegmark's multiverse levels:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I. Different initial conditions, different histories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;II. Different constants.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;III. Different quantum branches.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;IV. Different mathematical laws. STRUCTURES
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Arrangement of areas of research:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I.. Empirical sciences/studies  (from human/social studies to physics).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;II. Mechanical/systems/process theoretical research with generalized 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;applicability (e.g., philosophy itself?, cybernetics, statistical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mechanics, complex (conditions-sensitive) mechanics).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;III. Applied yet mathematically deep fields (math. theories of logic, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;info., probability, &amp; perhaps some other mathematical theories of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uncertainty, like possibility theory).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;IV. Pure mathematics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Actually I tend to put these fields of research in exactly the reverse 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;order, it's become a habit. My habits are a unusual kind of subject, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;marked as they are by the fact that, about them,  I actually know something.
