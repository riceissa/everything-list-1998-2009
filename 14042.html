Le 21-sept.-07, à 02:30, Russell Standish a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do take the reversal, but not as granted. It is essentially a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consequence of any ensemble theory of everything with a 1-3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction. This is most clearly enunciated from within a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalist position, which is why I think your UDA is so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important, (to convince the doubters) but in fact the result is much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more general, and computationalism per se is not needed.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. I do propose this as subject research, but it is full of 
<br />
(technical) traps.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I do consider that the discovery (by Babbage, Post, Church, Turing,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ...) of the Universal Machine is a major discovery of our time which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; changes almost all what has been thought about machine up to then. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is reflected in the computability theory, and I exploit those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theoretical consequences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course. But I also put Darwinian evolution up there with that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (variation/selection is a powerful theory).
</em><br />
<br /><br />This to vague for me. I have no (big) conceptual problem with Darwinian 
<br />
Evolution, but this is not something fundamental at all. This has to be 
<br />
derived from a more fundamental theory, as even today's Darwinist would 
<br />
say (thinking about physics but we know that is wrong).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As is stated in &quot;Why Occams Razor&quot;, and made more explicit in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Importance of the Observer&quot; and &quot;Theory of Nothing&quot;, what is the U
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used in computing the universal prior? It can be nothing other than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the observer. U needn't even be a machine, any partition of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strings into measurable subsets suffices.
</em><br />
<br /><br />?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And this identification turns an essentially 3rd person account into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1st person account. To talk about ASSA or RSSA one has to introduce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some notion of time, or at least successor states.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Which we have without ay physical time notion, nor subjective time 
<br />
notion with comp. Successor states are definable by use of numbers and 
<br />
successor of numbers. This can be important given that everybody agrees 
<br />
on numbers (except ultrafinitist, but I know only one in Russia), but 
<br />
nobody agrees on what &quot;time&quot; could be (even the third person physical 
<br />
one, or first person plural).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I have said, I have been taking David Deutsch's idea seriously, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; combining a many universes ontology, with information theory and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Darwinian evolution. (David also suggests Popperian epistemology as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fourth strand, but I consider this to be a special case of evolution).
</em><br />
<br /><br />... like I consider &quot;evolution&quot; as a special case of distributed 
<br />
interacting computations.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In order to do this, I need to assume whatever is needed to even make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense of these concepts. At a minimum it would seem to include some of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set theory, of measure theory and classical logic, but maybe it can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pared down to a more spartan set of axioms. The point is I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't really care what is involved, but someone else will bother 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with these details. That is why I say I'm acting like a physicist.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes. A problem (at least for communicating) in a non necessarily 
<br />
physical context.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One way of connecting with what you do is to say that I assume the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of UD*, without concerning myself about the existence of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UD.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This does not make sense at all for me, given that the UD is 
<br />
interesting only through the UD*. UD is just a rigorous definition 
<br />
(logical name) of the UD*.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The CT thesis comes into play to justify the use of information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory
</em><br />
<br /><br />Why? Actually information theory use CT only when it becomes 
<br />
&quot;Algorithmic Information Theory&quot;. CT is needed to give &quot;scientific&quot; 
<br />
meaning to expression like &quot;computable&quot; and above all expression like 
<br />
&quot;NON computable&quot;. And with comp this is important given that comp makes 
<br />
reality, whatver it is, partially but fundamentally NOT computable.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Regardless of what is really out there, all that we can know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about it must come to us in the form of strings, and so we can just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; start with considering sets of strings.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This reminds me the particular case of the iterated Washington-Moscow 
<br />
self-duplication. But in this case comp predicts random noise (even no 
<br />
white rabbits).
<br />
And this is completely different from the guy who is in front of a 
<br />
universal dovetailer (running in his reality to makes things straight). 
<br />
This leads to a infinitely subtle prediction. CT is a strong postulate, 
<br />
despite or because it admits deep weakening.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence computationalism is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumed, but your universal dovetailer provides a computationalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model. It remains to be seen whether computationalism is the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible model (I suspect not, but I don't know).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have proved and I have insisted that if COMP is true then COMP is 
<br />
either refutable, or unprovable, in which case comp justifies (and even 
<br />
more: comp classifies) all other possible model. The point here is that 
<br />
the logic G and G* (on which physics and theology eventually reduce) 
<br />
still apply. Only the big unnameable can be thought as escaping the 
<br />
laws of G and G*.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Guardian angel would seem to fit into this latter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; category. I have no problem with the use of colourful rhetoric like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this, but I have enough mathematical training to know that it simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refers to that which is true but not provable, and not something of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; greater significance.
</em><br />
<br /><br />G* \ G refers indeed, for any ieally correct machine, to what is true 
<br />
about that machine, but that the machine cannot prove, but can still 
<br />
infer, anticipate, bet on, gamble on, hope, pray, etc.
<br />
This gives machine's theology. Something of greater significance, imo. 
<br />
Physics has to be part of it. And it explains better qualia than 
<br />
anything suggested up to now (imo).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's consider a non-Brunotheological case. Your hypostases for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instance. I don't understand what makes some of them 1st person, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others 3rd person.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Good questions. It seems to me I have answered them, but don't hesitate 
<br />
to ask, or wait that I am going through again, and again ...
<br />
Here the real answer has to be long, so I will just say the key idea. 
<br />
In science, we never know and we always believe. That gives the third 
<br />
person objective frame. It is because it is objective that it can be 
<br />
shown to be wrong. But knowledge, by definition, is always directly in 
<br />
touch with the (already unameable truth): it is incorrigible. To go 
<br />
from third person scientific opinion, to knowledge, Godel's theorem 
<br />
shows that the only way to do that (this is proved in detail in 
<br />
&quot;conscience et mecanisme&quot;) consists in using the Theatetical definition 
<br />
of knowledge (By prove p and p is (serendipitously perhaps) true (the 
<br />
Bp &amp; p). Confirmation is provided by the fact that that doing this 
<br />
gives an unameable (by itself) self quite similar to Brouwer's theory 
<br />
of consciousness (which has given birth to intutionnist math and 
<br />
philo). Much much more can be said here.
<br />
Another good question nobody seems to ask is: what is the relation 
<br />
between this theatetical definition of knowledge/first person and the 
<br />
definition of first person used in the UDA? (I let this as exercice or 
<br />
subject of reflexion for now).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I understand it, they're axioms for systems of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical statements. The axioms proscribe what can and can't be stated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the given system.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Careful. Those are &quot;axioms&quot; of some modal logic. But those modal logic 
<br />
describe the discourse of self-observing machine. But this is a 
<br />
theorem. nobody has choose those axioms. The main axiom of G is Lob 
<br />
formula, for example. But the arithmetical interpretation of Lob 
<br />
formula is a theorem (Lob's theorem), capable of being proved by PA (as 
<br />
Lob shows). All precise correspondance are given in most of may papers 
<br />
(but the complete proof are in the theses).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But what does any of that have to do with experience?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Experiences are the roots of incorrigible knowledge.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connection with the dovetailer of the UDA?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Again a very good question. Please wait I explain this again when I 
<br />
will be convinced most people grasp what is needed to go through this 
<br />
without leaving the list in hurry for reason of math anxiety. Actually, 
<br />
I was close to make this point as clear as possible until I realize I 
<br />
need to use Church Thesis, but also the seven first step of UDA, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand that some of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the systems admit a representation in terms of Kripke frames, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again what does that have to do with time?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The cute reason is that the knower extract from the lobian interview 
<br />
gives a temporal logic of evolving states of knowledge (S4Grz). Indeed 
<br />
the Kripke frame is a temporal structure. This gives an arithmetical 
<br />
transparent interpretation of the theory of time by Bergson/Brouwer 
<br />
(and it clarifies the misunderstanding between &quot;scientist&quot; and Bergson 
<br />
(or even the one between Brouwer and Cantor, and the one between Goethe 
<br />
and Newton, and the one between Parmenides and Heraclite. That is the 
<br />
optimistic view of the lobian machine. The pessimist will say that it 
<br />
just show that lobian machine will develop the similar 
<br />
misunderstanding. They are true, for a while. But in the limit (= some 
<br />
day) lobian machine got the root of that misunderstanding too).
<br />
<br />(The knower is, again, the one defined by the logic of &quot;Bp and p&quot; like 
<br />
in Plato's Theatetus), B is the arithmetical Beweisbar of Godel, p is 
<br />
for arbitrary arithmetical proposition, (or other for those who does 
<br />
not like the numbers, but my attempt to use the combinators instead, in 
<br />
this list, has failed: this is another reason why I keep the numbers: 
<br />
people know them).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can understand that some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the systems might also be used to model a multiverse of observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moments,
</em><br />
<br /><br />What you say here corresponds to my old idea (in this list) to model 
<br />
the OM by the Kripke worlds. But as you know (I think), the fourth and 
<br />
fifth hypostases have no Kripke semantics (or quite deformed one). And 
<br />
also, OMs can vary themselves as you change the hypostases. So that you 
<br />
can have first person OM, third person OM, first person plural OM, etc. 
<br />
(for all the 8 hypostases).
<br />
That is why I have proposed to model the OM by the Sigma_1 sentence, 
<br />
and this is the subject of the current &quot;Observer Moment = 
<br />
Sigma1-Sentences&quot; thread (or the same with some amount of &quot;Rép : Rép :&quot; 
<br />
in front. I will come back on this. The importance of the Sigma_1 
<br />
sentences stems from the importance of Church thesis (even if we weaken 
<br />
the comp hyp). Roughly speaking the Sigma_1 sentences will classify the 
<br />
histories generated by the UD.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I don't see the connection between logical statement and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moments.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is just because I interview a machine which makes (logical, and 
<br />
arithmetical) statements, and then I interview her on the OMs. More 
<br />
exactly, for getting physics I restrict the interview of the machine 
<br />
(which gives the 8 hypostases) on the sigma_1 sentences. (cf: you refer 
<br />
to this in your book page 128-129, if we have the same edition ;)
<br />
We will come back on this.
<br />
<br />Must go. Will be rather more busy now. No time to reread (could this 
<br />
entails less spelling mistakes ...
