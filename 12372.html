SP: ' I don't thereby think it is OK for anyone to do any horrible thing 
<br />
they want. I have my own values, as it happens broadly in agreement with 
<br />
what you have outlined below.'
<br />
<br />MP: I assumed as such  :-)
<br />
<br />Furthermore I tend to think that we also will agree on a tenet I believe 
<br />
is attributed to Socrates:
<br />
'The unexamined life is not worth living!'
<br />
<br />Now there is an embedded assumption and a half !  :-)   And now I look 
<br />
at it a bit, it seems to embody both the truth of your assertion about 
<br />
the 'pure arbitrariness' of values, and the essence of what freedom we 
<br />
humans really have. [Note: I refuse to digress into discussions of 
<br />
'free  will'.]
<br />
<br />A key issue is self-reference. I think this is well illustrated by what 
<br />
may be the one true free gift of nature, after the fact of being born of 
<br />
course.
<br />
Doctors and researchers call it the placebo effect. I like to 
<br />
characterise it by its shortest expression in mantra format - in English 
<br />
anyway - the injunction:
<br />
'Think positive, it's better for you!'
<br />
<br />This can be confronting to those of us who may have been habituated to a 
<br />
negative disposition and all the rationalisations that entrench it: [one 
<br />
of mine was 'B negative, not just a blood group, but a way of life!' 
<br />
:-]. The evidence is good however, that positive thinking - choosing to 
<br />
say 'the glass is half full' rather than 'the glass is half empty' - has 
<br />
beneficial effects of one's general health and also on the breadth and 
<br />
quality of thought. It is not a criticism to say that it is just a 
<br />
matter of belief, because this in fact is the key point! If one believes 
<br />
that the placebo effect is a real process occurring in the real world, 
<br />
and it IS, then there is nothing illusory or otherwise false in choosing 
<br />
to 'think positive', because that is the key process involved. Tout 
<br />
simple, n'est ce pas! Everything else in life must be paid for: things 
<br />
are either made by people who must be paid or borrowed from nature which 
<br />
must be paid back.
<br />
<br />In the case of examining one's life, again there is an element of 'it 
<br />
pays for itself' but perhaps it is more in the nature of a surfboard 
<br />
ride [which I have observed but never done] or an endless roller 
<br />
coaster. I mean the energy source is the life giving energy of the sun 
<br />
which lifts us up and carries us along like the surfer's wave. The 
<br />
inevitable entropy of our progress can be passed off to the blackness of 
<br />
the night sky, so long as we determine to avoid harm to self and others 
<br />
where it is avoidable and avoid causing suffering to other creatures 
<br />
where that too is avoidable. I personally choose to believe that in the 
<br />
examination of one's own life, the interdependence of what is and what 
<br />
ought, become ever more clearly manifest. Not that we can impose 
<br />
anything of this on others - Hah! I can't even impose it on myself. BUT 
<br />
discovering the truth of what I am seems to lead ever more clearly to an 
<br />
inherited core [of genetic/memetic combination] which I share with 
<br />
others, and an ever wider sweep of life affirming possibilities which I 
<br />
can share with others. If I deny this then it seems to me that I am, in 
<br />
the final analysis, saying that I am of a different species from at 
<br />
least some other Homo sapiens around the world.
<br />
<br />The reflexive nature of our human experience seems to carry with it the 
<br />
necessity of choosing the 'truths' that we affirm. If we gain the 
<br />
ability to contemplate the bases of our actions and decisions and then 
<br />
say: 'Oh, I don't have time to do that.' or some such, then we are none 
<br />
the less choosing by default and making ourselves less than what we 
<br />
thought ourselves to be.
<br />
<br />That was longer than I expected but hopefully not too verbose.
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK Stathis, I happily concede your point in relation to our word 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'logical', but not in relation to 'reason'. Logic belongs to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; tight-nit language of logico-mathematics but reason is *about* the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; real world and we cannot allow the self-deluding bullies and cheats 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the world to steal *our* language!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I like the way Dr Dorothy Rowe, a psychologist and writer [ another 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; useful Australian export **] puts it: &quot;Power is the ability to get 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; others to accept your description of the world.&quot; The cynical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; manipulators and spin doctors have no qualms about abusing language, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in big part because they have no intention of accepting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; responsibility for all their actions. Of course none of us is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; guiltless in this regard but it falls to us who stand well away from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the levers of power to speak the truth. We who are forced to watch as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OUR hard earned tax dollars and investment savings [superannuation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; savings for example] get splurged on grand projects, invasions, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; so forth, have a duty to SAY what is right. We may be wrong about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some details but we sure as hell are not wrong when insisting that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the truth be told.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I certainly agree also that, in the case of the person standing on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the parapet, what he or she believes about what they are doing - if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we can find it out -  should cause us to try different methods of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; persuasion. Quite how one would tackle the 'logic' of the superhero's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thinking, I don't know, perhaps offer to make improvements to his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cape to improve the effect?  :-)   Whatever the details, I think that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one aspect of the interaction that either type would require is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; establishment of rapport, some degree of mutual empathy; not easy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The economist preparing to make war not love is very like the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; supposed scientists cooking up ever more 'attractive' tobacco 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; products 'for our smoking pleasure'. I think that the only way people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can bring themselves to do this is by cutting themselves off from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; those others who will become the victims. This is like so many other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; situations where a group or social class cuts it/themselves off from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; another class of persons. It may seem 'reasonable' where everyone 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; involved in the planning agrees that there is no real alternative, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that the potential disadvantages accruing from not doing so will be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; too heavy a burden to bear. But it also entails a denial of empathy, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and a closing off from a part of the world, an objective assertion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that 'they are not us and we are not them'. This contains within it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; also a diminution of self, something that may not be recognised to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; start with and perhaps never understood until it is too late.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Mark,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would still draw a distinction between the illogical and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; foolish or unwise. Being illogical is generally foolish, but the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; converse is not necessarily the case. The example I have given before 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is of a person who wants to jump off the top of a tall building, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; either because (a) he thinks he is superman and will be able to fly

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or (b) he is reckless or suicidal. In both cases the course of action 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is unwise, and we should try to stop him, but in (a) he is delusional 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; while in (b) he is not. It isn't just of academic interest, either, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because the approach to stopping him from doing it again is quite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; different in each case. Similarly with the example of the economist, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the approach to stopping him will be different depending on whether

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; he is trying to ruin the economy because he wants to or because he is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; incompetent or making decisions on false information.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And yet I persist ... [the hiatus of familial duties and seasonal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; excesses now draws to a close [Oh yeah, Happy New Year Folks!]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; SP: 'If we are talking about a system designed to destroy the economy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of a country in order to soften it up for invasion, for example, then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; an economist can apply all his skill and knowledge in a perfectly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasonable manner in order to achieve this.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We should beware of conceding too much too soon. Something is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasonable only if it can truly be expected to fulfil the intentions 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of its designer. Otherwise it is at best logical but, in the kinds of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; context we are alluding to here, benighted and a manifestation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fundamentally diminished 'reason'. Something can only be 'reasonable' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it its context. If a proposed course of action can be shown to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ultimately self defeating - in the sense of including its reasonably 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; predictably final consequences, and yet it is still actively 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; proposed, then the proposal is NOT reasonable, it is stupid. As far 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as I can see, that is the closest we can get to an objective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; definition of stupidity and I like it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Put it this way: Is it 'reasonable' to promote policies and projects 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that ultimately are going to contribute to your own demise or the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; demise of those whom you hold dear or, if not obviously their demise 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; then, the ultimate demise of all descendants of the aforementioned? I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; think academics, 'mandarins' and other high honchos should all now be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thinking in these terms and asking themselves this question. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; world we now live in is like no other before it. We now live in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Modern era, in which the application and fruits of the application of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scientific method are putting ever greater forms of power into the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hands of humans. This process is not going to stop, and nor should we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; want it to I think, but it entails the ever greater probability that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the actions of any person on the planet have the potential to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; influence survival outcomes for huge numbers of others [if not the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whole d*mned lot of us].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think it has always been true that ethical decisions and judgements 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are based on facts to a greater extent than most people involved want 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to think about - usually because it's too hard and we don't think we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have got the time and, oh yeah, 'it probably doesn't/won't matter' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; about the details of unforeseen consequences because its only gonna 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be lower class riff -raff who will be affected anyway or people of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the future who will just have to make shift for themselves. NOW 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; however we do not really have such an excuse; it is a cop-out to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; purport to ignore the ever growing interrelatedness of people around 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the planet. So it is NOT reasonable to treat other people as things. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [I feel indebted to Terry Pratchett for pointing out, through the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; words of Granny Weatherwax I think it is, that there is only one sin, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which is to treat another person as a thing.] I think a reasonable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; survey and analysis of history shows that, more than anything else, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; treating other people as things rather than equal others has been the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fundamental cause and methodology for the spread of threats to life 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and well being.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You can see where I am going with this: in a similar way to that in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which concepts of 'game theory' and probabilities of interaction 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; outcomes give us an objective framework for assessing purportedly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'moral' precepts, the existence now of decidedly non-zero chances of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; recursive effects resulting from one's own actions brings a deeper 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; meaning and increased rigour the realms of ethics and 'reason'. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; don't think this is 'airy-fairy', I think it represents a dimension 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of reasoning which has always existed but which has been denied, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ignored or actively censored by the powerful and their 'pragmatic' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; apologists and spin doctors. To look at a particular context [I am an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; EX Christian], even though the Bible is shonk as history or any kind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of principled xxxxxxological analysis, it is instructive to look at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the careers of the prophets and see how each involved a seemingly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conventional formative period and then periods or a whole life of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; very risky ministry AGAINST the establishment because being true to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; their mission involved the prophet denouncing exploitation, greed and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; corruption.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So let me wave my imaginary staff and rail from the top of my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; imaginary mountain:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'Sin is against reason! And that's a fact! So THERE! And don't you 
</em><br />
