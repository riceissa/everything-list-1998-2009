<br /><br />Exactly.

<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In any case, in classical logic X -&gt; Y can only be false if X is true in

<br /><br />X could be false in all possible world. &quot;if X then Y&quot; will then be true in

all possible worlds.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And like I said, I think the possible-world statement more accurately

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;captures the meaning of the natural-language statement.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Yes but it is here that you anticipate, relatively to the goal which we 
<br />
have ascribe to ourselves.
<br />
To sum up in a nutshell: the UD Argument shows comp transforms physics into 
<br />
a &quot;science of&quot;
<br />
a measure on all (relative) computational histories. Those comp histories 
<br />
are relatively
<br />
described in Arithmetical Platonia (the set of all true arithmetical 
<br />
propositions). In particular physics must appears in the discourse of a 
<br />
Self-Referentially Correct machine (SRC machine) when interviewed on the 
<br />
geometry of their (maximal) consistent extensions.
<br />
p belongs to a consistent extension of a machine M when the machine does 
<br />
not believe in -p (that is -B-p is true for the machine).
<br />
<br />The SRC machine is supposed to be:
<br />
1) platonistic (the machine believes the classical tautologies)
<br />
2) arithmetical platonistic (the machine believes in the theorem of PA, say)
<br />
3) computationalist (by UDA the machine believs p -&gt; Bp, with p atomic, 
<br />
that is the atomic
<br />
&quot;physical consistent state&quot; are those generated by the DU. I will come back 
<br />
on this
<br />
remember just that comp is translated by the modal formula p -&gt; Bp
<br />
<br />&quot;1)&quot; and &quot;2)&quot; makes the SRC machine a Loebian machine. It makes it, in FU's 
<br />
terminology
<br />
a consistent, stable, normal, modest reasoner of type 4. That is, a 
<br />
reasoner of type G.
<br />
So we get a modal logic, from which we can study the corresponding &quot;multiverse&quot;
<br />
(unlike those who want to capture directly &quot;ordinary natural language 
<br />
deduction&quot; by an ad hoc choice of a modal logic)
<br />
<br />&quot;3)&quot; forces us to add the comp axiom. I give the name &quot;1&quot; to the formula 
<br />
&quot;p-&gt;Bp&quot; (1 is a shorthand for Sigma_1). We get a new theory which is just 
<br />
G+1 (+and a weakening of the substitution rule: p can only represent an 
<br />
atomic proposition [do you see why?]).
<br />
Now A. Visser, from Utrecht (in Holland) has proved the arithmetical 
<br />
completeness for both (G+1) and its corresponding * logic (G+1)*. In honor 
<br />
to Visser I call often V and V* the logic G+1 and (G+1)*.  See the (big) 
<br />
bible for a proof.  Big bible = George Boolos 1993. (this is beyond FU 
<br />
little bible).
<br />
If you identify a logic with its set of theorems you have the following 
<br />
diamond where the edges represent inclusion:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V*
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G*       V    (except that I'm too lazy for drawing the edges)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G
<br />
<br />Going up in the north west direction is the non trivial godelian passage 
<br />
from provability (believability) to truth. Going up in the north east 
<br />
direction is the non trivial comp direction. Sometimes to fix the things I 
<br />
say that G gives science and G* gives theology, V gives comp-science and V* 
<br />
gives comp-theology. (But take this with some grain of salt).
<br />
Note that G* minus G (resp. V* minus V) gives all the unbelievable (comp) 
<br />
but true propositions.
<br />
<br />OK. At that stage we are not yet in a position to get physics. What is 
<br />
missing? People on the list should be able to guess giving I insist on this 
<br />
all the time.  What is missing is the fundamental distinction between the 
<br />
first and third person points of view, without which the UD Argument just 
<br />
doesn't start. The four G, G*, V, V* gives only 3 person descriptions. G 
<br />
for exemple gives a logic of self-referentially correct discourse, but the 
<br />
machine talk about itself only from some description made (by construction) 
<br />
at the right level. But the UDA shows physics appears through machine's 
<br />
first point of view.  Also G does not work for describing a probability 
<br />
logic. Although the box []p in G describes p as true in all accessible 
<br />
worlds, there exists necessarily (by Godel seconf theorem) accessible world 
<br />
which are cul-de-sac worlds. We would like to have []p -&gt; &lt;&gt;p, or in FU's 
<br />
notation Bp -&gt; -B-p.  If the proba that p is one, we would like the proba 
<br />
of -p being different of one!
<br />
<br />Why not define Pp (meaning proba of p = 1) by Bp &amp; -B-p ? We can: G* proves 
<br />
Pp &lt;-&gt; Bp, but
<br />
the view for the machine is different: G* proves -B(Pp &lt;-&gt; Bp). So it makes 
<br />
sense and it is the easiest way to cut out the cul-de-sac worlds. This is 
<br />
only one of the &quot;Theaetetus&quot; attempts to define knowledge. Actually the 
<br />
whole three main variants work in V*:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pp = Bp &amp; p
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pp = Bp &amp; -B-p
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pp = Bp &amp; -B-p &amp; p
<br />
<br />Work in which sense? In the sense that applying them on V* we get a modal 
<br />
quasi-quantum logic.
<br />
That is a modal logic which describes a (sort of) quantum logic, that is a 
<br />
logic where the probabilities are described by rays in Hilbert Space (and 
<br />
variants). More on this latter probably.
<br />
I take this as a confirmation of the plausibility of comp. The second and 
<br />
third Theaetetic variant
<br />
applied on V* minus V, describe the consistent (and true) measurable but 
<br />
uncommunicable (un-sharable) truth, so that &quot;qualia&quot; are themselves 
<br />
described by sort of quantum logics, although those should be more aptly 
<br />
called qualia logics. It's the main advantage compared to traditional 
<br />
empirical physics which methodologically put the 1-person under the carpet.
