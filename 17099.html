2009/7/30 Rex Allen &lt;rexallen314.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that the primary meaning of &quot;to exist&quot; is &quot;to be conscious&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But what causes conscious experience? Well, I'm beginning to think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that nothing causes it. Our conscious experience is fundamental,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncaused, and irreducible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do we think that our conscious experience must be caused? Maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this isn't a valid assumption. Maybe we are being led astray by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparent nature of the macroscopic material world that we perceive?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So on the surface this view of consciousness as fundamental may sound
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a bit off-putting, but I think it's not so radical compared to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; competing theories.
</em><br />
<br />Of course I'm in sympathy with what you say here.  I've recently been
<br />
picking the bones out of 'Panpsychism in the West' by David Skrbina
<br />
which is a pretty comprehensive review of the surprisingly large
<br />
number of thinkers who've actually held - or hold - some version of
<br />
this view; and that's just in the West.
<br />
<br />However, I actually think we can do better than this.  The extraneous
<br />
baggage attaching to 'mental' vocabulary really gets in the way of
<br />
clarity if we attempt to phrase it as you have.  It's open to anyone
<br />
reading what you say above to accept or reject based on the contents
<br />
of *their* 'consciousness portmanteau'.  But perhaps we don't have to
<br />
go this far: maybe we can say something more restricted which
<br />
surprisingly turns out to be more radical.  Without repeating the
<br />
whole analysis here, my view is that the heart of the matter lies in a
<br />
rigorous redefinition of the semantics of 'exist' and its cognates.
<br />
<br />These different senses get chucked about in such a variety of
<br />
ontological and epistemological guises that one is often at a loss to
<br />
know what any particular use is attempting to pick out in the world.
<br />
So my point is simply: let's start from the understanding that to
<br />
exist is just and only what it is to exist-for-oneself: the defining
<br />
characteristic of existence is 'taking everything personally'.  The
<br />
standard put-down at this point is something like 'well how personally
<br />
do you suppose an electron takes itself?' to which the riposte is
<br />
simply 'precisely as personally as it needs to exist'.
<br />
<br />Of course one might also ask 'how materially do you suppose an
<br />
electron take itself?' and answer 'precisely as materially as it needs
<br />
to exist'.  But in granting a 'material' ontology to ourselves and the
<br />
electron, we are immediately at a loss for somewhere to locate the
<br />
personal unless we add a second ontological category for it to
<br />
inhabit: and then any hope we might have a workable notion of
<br />
interaction is irretrievably dashed.
<br />
<br />So now you may legitimately enquire: fair enough, but how do we get
<br />
consciousness out of 'taking everything personally?'  Well, it depends
<br />
what you mean by.....  But no, it does - really.  This is already the
<br />
'easy problem' (tee hee) in that once you see that you're at large in
<br />
a context that takes everything personally - but no more than it takes
<br />
to exist-for-itself - you can work on your theories of 'consciousness'
<br />
with some expectation that somebody will be there to take it
<br />
personally when those great thoughts and feelings emerge.  It's a bit
<br />
like (in fact exactly like) the way we construct 'material' models in
<br />
the confident expectation that NOBODY will be there to take it
<br />
personally when all those great 'processes' and 'structures' emerge.
<br />
But now we can see - as you point out below - that these 'material'
<br />
entities can really only be elements of our personal
<br />
existence-for-ourselves.  Sure, we believe they refer to something
<br />
beyond their representational role, but that something else is taking
<br />
things personally in another part of the forest.  And if they do not
<br />
thus refer?  Well, then they're just zombies.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Take the brain. I haven't verified it myself, but I'm willing to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe that the structure and function of the brain is closely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlated with the mind. My brain represents the contents of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious experience. The activity of the brain over time maps to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the contents of my conscious experience over time. Fine. But the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not the cause of my conscious experience. A brain is something that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one is conscious OF, and thus has a secondary, derivative type of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence.
</em><br />
<br />Very well put.  I've mentioned David Bohm's model of a video game,
<br />
which actually got him thinking about the relationships inherent in
<br />
the above scenario, thus: there's a game taking place on a screen
<br />
(explicate order) being acted on by (but not itself acting on) a
<br />
program (implicate order), which in turn is being acted on by (but not
<br />
acting on) the feedback from a player (super-implicate order).  In
<br />
this analogy, the brain-body-world is akin to the on-screen
<br />
representation, which in fact emerges from, and is under the control
<br />
of, an underlying set of orderings that seamlessly incorporate both
<br />
player and game.  Subject and object then emerge as a heuristic
<br />
distinction in the guise of complementary poles abstracted from
<br />
feedback relationships.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can think about my brain, so it is something that I am conscious of,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and so it exists in that sense. To the extent that I can examine and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment on someone else's brain, that is also a perceived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience. But again, all of these things could happen in a dream, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hallucination, or to a brain-in-a-vat, or to someone in a computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, it could, but this may not be the version most conducive to sanity!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not the cause of my conscious experience. A brain is something that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one is conscious OF, and thus has a secondary, derivative type of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, and this 'secondary' existence is just a category of
<br />
existence-for-oneself.  The contents of consciousness are precisely
<br />
what we are taking personally, else they couldn't exist for us.  We
<br />
co-habit with them.  But they don't just sit there: they connect
<br />
seamlessly beyond our personal horizons, which is how we get to
<br />
justify the belief that they refer to something - as we tend to say -
<br />
outside our selves.  But that 'outside' of course isn't outside at
<br />
all; it's just as 'inside' as we are, taking things just as personally
<br />
as it needs to exist, just like us.  The external world we see so
<br />
clearly is a reflection of the inside-out surfaces of our mindworlds.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Similarly, science. I'm willing to believe that quantum mechanics and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relativity both describe my observations very well. But this is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fitting of various mathematical formulas and narratives to what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are conscious of. There's no deeper meaning to science than that. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't tell us about what fundamentally exists. It provides us with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stories that fit what our experiences: &quot;IF you were made from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subatomic particles in a physical universe, THIS system of particles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and forces is consistent with your current observations.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Yes, and of course WERE you thus made you wouldn't find anybody there
<br />
to take things personally.  The great value of COMP, I think, is that
<br />
it pumps the intuition that we can't take persons for granted: they
<br />
don't just map directly onto our representations, which I guess we
<br />
should have expected, because god knows they don't look like anything
<br />
that could be us.  Of course a computational narrative may turn out
<br />
not to be the way to go, but I strongly suspect that we still await a
<br />
revolution in - well not physics, but..what? being-science? (gawd) -
<br />
that will be in a primary sense generative of persons prior to the
<br />
generation of appearances.  IOW, there probably has to be some sort of
<br />
fundamentally implicate-explicate-superexplicate thingamijig going on
<br />
out there - er, I mean in here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Science is basically us trying to make sense of a dream.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So in this view, consciousness is very simple. What's complicated is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fitting &quot;explanatory&quot; scientific theories to what is observed, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identifying and understanding causal structures (e.g., a brain, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine, whatever) whose evolving state can be interpreted as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representing a series of &quot;connected&quot; or &quot;related&quot; instances of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness. But the observed physical system is NOT conscious, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just represents the contents of someone's conscious experience.
</em><br />
<br />Very well put.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So initially this view seems somewhat...solipsistic (?), but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ultimately I think it really isn't much more radical than any other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory on the table. For instance, any deterministic scientific theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entails that we have the experience of making choices without making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actual choices (in the free will sense). And so does any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeterminstic theory that is based on bottom-up causation.
</em><br />
<br />Well, of course it's solipsistic, but that's its strength.  You can
<br />
only know yourself: but that 'self', properly understood, extends
<br />
beyond merely perspectival horizons, to everything that is.  This is
<br />
the perennial philosophy, and in this case, perennial because
<br />
unavoidable.  And as for 'deterministic', if we want to deploy
<br />
causation in our narratives - and I don't see why we shouldn't - then
<br />
existence-for-self gives you a conveniently monistically-collapsed
<br />
version of the causal nexus that indivisibly unites perception,
<br />
intention  and action.  Since they're indivisible, they only work in
<br />
concert, and hence you can't get causal closure until the sense
<br />
necessary in context gains expression.  As to 'first' causes, I think
<br />
we've reached the end of the semantic road.  If you want, you can can
<br />
elect to be a mathematical Prospero and conjure us from the deep by
<br />
tautological force majeure, or you can accept the mystery of our
<br />
contingent 'necessity'.  Take your pick.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Beyond that, all theories eventually boil down to having to having to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take some set of fundamental entities and laws as unexplained,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unsupported brute facts. So whether it's one level down or twelve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; levels down, at some point they end up saying &quot;and these things just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist, created from nothing, supported by nothing&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, no matter which way we go, reality doesn't match our common-sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expectations. I think this view makes the fewest assumptions, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ultimately seems no more fantastical than any other theory on offer
</em><br />
<br />This is what my mother used to call 'having the courage of your lack
<br />
of convictions'.  I like it.
<br />
<br />David
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay, I've reworked my views a bit based on the discussion thus far.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that the primary meaning of &quot;to exist&quot; is &quot;to be conscious&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But what causes conscious experience? Well, I'm beginning to think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that nothing causes it. Our conscious experience is fundamental,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncaused, and irreducible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do we think that our conscious experience must be caused? Maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this isn't a valid assumption. Maybe we are being led astray by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparent nature of the macroscopic material world that we perceive?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So on the surface this view of consciousness as fundamental may sound
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a bit off-putting, but I think it's not so radical compared to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; competing theories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From a materialist perspective, what caused the universe (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse) to exist?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From a religious perspective, what caused God to exist?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From a platonic perspective, what caused the Numbers to exist?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And, of course, if anyone offers an answer to the above, the obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next question would be &quot;what caused THAT to exist?&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This drive to reduce our consciousness into smaller parts, I think is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maybe misguided.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that there may be a problem with the idea that we must explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious experience in terms of the things that we perceive, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things that we infer from what we perceive. Consciousness is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conduit through which we experience the world, BUT I think it's a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mistake to conclude that consciousness is a product of what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experienced.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe consciousness is fundamental, uncaused, and irreducible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, what we are conscious OF is reducible and representable.  A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; crucial difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Take the brain. I haven't verified it myself, but I'm willing to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe that the structure and function of the brain is closely
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That something is perceived is no guarantee that it has an existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on par with, or superior to, that which does the perceiving.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Similarly, science. I'm willing to believe that quantum mechanics and
