<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; No, it follows from the idea that anything can be a computation. I think this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; is trivially obvious, like saying any string of apparently random characters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; is a translation of any English sentence of similar or shorter length, and if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you have the correct dictionary, you can find out what that English sentence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; is.
</em><br />
<br />[Peter Jones]
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; But that is actually quite a dubious idea. For one thing there is an objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; basis for claiming that one meaning is the &quot;real&quot; meaning, and that is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; meaning intended by the writer.
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
[Stathis Papaioannou] 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There might have been a particular meaning intended by the writer, but remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; materialism: all you have really is ink on paper, and neither the ink nor the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; paper knows anything about where it came from or what it means. Suppose a stream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of gibberish is created today by the proverbial monkeys typing away randomly, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; just by chance it turns out that this makes sense as a novel in a language that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; will be used one thousand years from now. Is it correct to say that the monkeys' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; manuscript has a certain meaning today? Or is it meaningless today, but meaningful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in a thousand years? If the latter, does it suddenly become meaningful when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; new language is defined, or when someone who understands the new language actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reads it? What if the manuscript never comes to light, or if it comes to light and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is read but after another thousand years every trace of the language has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; disappeared?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't think it makes sense to say that the manuscript has intrinsic meaning;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rather, it has meaning in the mind of an observer. Similarly, with a computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; implemented on a computer, I don't think it makes sense to say that it has meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; except in its interaction with the environment or in the mind of an observer. 
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then, as you'v noted before, you can regard the environment+computer as a bigger 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer with no external interaction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You've used this argument as a reductio absurdum against the idea that a manuscript 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or any arbitrary object has a meaning.  Yet you seem to accept the similar argument 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that any object implements a computation - given the right 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;dictionary/interpretation/manual&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps I have been inconsistent in my use of terms. What I meant is that any object implements 
<br />
a computation, but in a useless/trivial/meaningless way unless it interacts with an environment or is 
<br />
understood by a conscious observer. But now that I think about it, we can arbitrarily say that the 
<br />
left half of the object is the computer and the right half is the environment with which it interacts - 
<br />
which is again true in a useless/trivial/meaningless way. The answer would seem to be that &quot;meaning&quot; 
<br />
is not a concept that is basic to physics, but exists only in the mind of a conscious observer. That can 
<br />
be an external observer or, if the computer is self-aware, itself. The same could be said of the terms 
<br />
&quot;trivial&quot; and &quot;elegant&quot; applied to mathematical theorems: they are only meaningful to mathematicians, 
<br />
not basic to mathematics.
<br />
<br />[Stathis Papaioannou]
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; string of characters or any physical process can be seen as implementing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; language or a computation, if you have the right &quot;dictionary&quot;. There is a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; interesting special case of this if we allow that some computations can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; self-aware, in the absence of any environmental interaction or external observer:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; by definition, they are their own observer and thus they bootstrap themselves into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  consciousness.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose some computation, such as what's happening in your brain, implements 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.  How much could it be changed and still be conscious?  Could we slice 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it up into segments and rearrange them?  How long a segment?  Is there &quot;something it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is like&quot; to be conscious and insane?  I think if we can answer this and then limit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our discussion to sane consciousness then some of these theoretical possibilities go 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; away.
</em><br />
<br />If every computation is implemented everywhere anyway, this is equivalent to the situation where every 
<br />
computation exists as a platonic object, or every computation exists implemented on some computer or 
<br />
brain in a material multiverse. This gives rise to the issues of quantum immortality and the white rabbit 
<br />
problem, as discussed at great length in the past on this list.
<br />
<br />One way to discredit all this foolishness is to abandon computationalism...
<br />
<br />[Stathis Papaioannou]
<br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; We might say in the above cases that the burden of the computation shifts from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the physical activity of the computer to the information in the manual. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; significance of this is that the manual is static, and need not even be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; instantiated if we don't care about interacting with the computer: it is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; mathematical object residing in Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the manual - or a look-up table - is timeless, while computation is a process. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depends on being presented a sequence of inputs.  I see no reason give up this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction between computation and mathematical object.  To equate them seems to me 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to beg the question of whether computation can be a mathematical object in Platonia.
</em><br />
<br />The dynamism part can be provided by a simple physical system such as the idle passage of time. 
<br />
If you allow for parallel processing you don't need much time either. This leads to a situation whereby 
<br />
every computation is implemented by universe with a single electron enduring for a nanosecond, for 
<br />
example. I can't quite see how to get rid of the electron, but Maudlin's and Bruno's conclusion from 
<br />
this seems to be that it is absurd and implies that the mental does not actually supervene on the physical.
