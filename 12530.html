<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; so on. These things are determined by how the computer is designed to interact

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with its environment, whether that mean outputting the sum of two numbers to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a screen or interacting with a human to convince him that it is conscious. But what

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if the environment is made part of the computer? The constraint on meaning and

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; syntax would then go, and the vibration of atoms in a rock could be implementing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any computation, including any conscious computation, if such there are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; John Searle, among others, believes this is absurd, and that therefore it disproves 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computationalism. Another approach is that it shows that it is absurd that consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; supervenes on physical activity of any sort, but we can keep computationalism and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; drop the physical supervenience criterion, as Bruno has.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have a view that seems to me to be slightly different.  Consciousness requires interaction with an environment; consciousness implicitly requires a distinction between &quot;I&quot; and &quot;the world&quot;.  So when you attribute consciousness to a rock, incorporating &quot;the world&quot; as part of the rock, while the remainder of the rock is &quot;conscious&quot; that raises problems.  We can say that this part of the rock is conscious of that part; making some arbitrary division of the rock.  But then it's not conscious in/of our universe.  
</em><br />
<br />That's right: if it's conscious, then it's conscious in its own isolated virtual universe. It's 
<br />
another means to a many worlds theory.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When you say there is no canonical syntax, which is what allows anything to be a computation of anything else, I think that is overstates the case.  Suppose a particular pair of iron atoms in the rock are magnetically aligned and the syntax counts that as &quot;0&quot; while anti-aligned counts as &quot;1&quot;.  Then what computation is implemented by &quot;0000000...&quot;?  The arbitrariness of syntax supposedly allows this to be translated into &quot;27&quot; or some other number.  But then the translation has to have all possible words in it and the relational meanings of those words; including the words for all the numbers in that world.  This places a pretty strong restriction on the size of the rock-world - there are only some 10^25 atoms to do all this representing.
</em><br />
<br />The rock can make numbers and universes as big as you want through the method of 
<br />
parallel computing. Suppose the rock had only a few distinct physical states. If we place 
<br />
no restriction on what these states can represent, then they can represent multiple 
<br />
binary strings or finite numbers or sentences or whatever - all in parallel. Any serial 
<br />
computation can be made up of multiple parallel computations, and vice versa. You 
<br />
can't say, aha, we've used that string for &quot;dog&quot; so we can't now use it for &quot;cat&quot;, because 
<br />
who is going to patrol the universe to enforce this rule? This is what you are left with if 
<br />
you eliminate the constraint that the computation has to interact with an external observer. 
<br />
<br />I am aware that this is a very strange idea, perhaps even an absurd idea, but I don't see 
<br />
any way out of it without ruining computationalism, as by saying that it's all bunk, or only 
<br />
computations that can interact with the environment at the level of their implementation 
<br />
can be conscious. Because if you insist on the latter, it implies something like ESP: the 
<br />
computer will know the difference between a false sensory stimulus and one emanating 
<br />
from the environment... possible, but not very Turing-emulable.
