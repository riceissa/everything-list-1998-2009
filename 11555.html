<br />Peter, I know from the above and previous comments you have made that
<br />
this notion of multiple compresent consciousness seems to you to
<br />
contradict your own experience, but I just can't see why. The crucial
<br />
point about our 1-person experience is that it's inherently
<br />
informationally self-limiting - i.e. we can only define ourselves in
<br />
terms of whatever information we have access to from a given pov. And
<br />
surely this is what prevents us from having the kind of 'multiple'
<br />
experiences you have in mind. In fact, it illustrates the fundamental
<br />
intension of the indexical term 'I' - other 'versions' of ourselves,
<br />
informationally separated temporally and/or spatially, could equally
<br />
validly be considered clones from any given 'present' pov. This is why
<br />
I have previously been so insistent about the 'global' nature of the
<br />
1-person (although I know this has led to terminological confusion).
<br />
Its 'globality' consists in the fact that *any* suitably constituted
<br />
region of reality equally partakes of this self-referential experience
<br />
of 'I'. But the *content* of each 1-person OM is inherently limited by
<br />
its information content. Doesn't this image do the trick for you?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; All I know is what I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiencing *now*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. That is the phenomenological fact that contradicts the BU.
</em><br />
<br />But it doesn't. What do you think you would experience in a BU
<br />
(focusing on the presence of observer moments, rather than the A-series
<br />
versus B-series issue)? What process exists that could coherently
<br />
totalise or synthesise in some way the informationally separated OMs?
<br />
You might as well say that you and I should somehow have overlapping
<br />
consciousness right now. Well, we don't, because we have different
<br />
information horizons - and just *this much* information crosses these
<br />
barriers to become part of our joint conciousness. I think the analogy
<br />
is pretty direct.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It could be a contingent natural law that certain properties never

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessity that the substrate endures through change; since all changes

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are changes in properties, a propertiless substrate cannot itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; change and must endure through change. In more detail here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why must &quot;change... be change in something&quot;? It sort of sounds reasonable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but it is our duty to question every assumption and weed out the superfluous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ones. If there is an object with (space, time, colour) coordinates (x1, t1, red)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and another object (x1, t2, orange), then we say that the object has changed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from red to orange.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; If we already know what distinguishes the time co-ordinate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; from the space co-ordinate. What is our usual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; way of doing that? The time co-ordinate is the one that is always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; changing...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Time and Possibility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine a universe in which there was no change, nothing actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; occurs. In the absence of events, it would be imposssible to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; distinguish any point in timw from any other point. There would be no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; meaning to time -- such a universe would be timeless.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Now imagine a universe which is completely chaotic. Things change so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; completely from one moment to the next that there are no conistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; things. This universe is made up solely of events, which can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; labelled with 4 coordinates . [ x,y,z,t]. But which coordinate is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; time coordinate ? One could just as well say [ y,t,z,x]. In the absence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of persistent ojects there is nothing to single out time as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; 'direction' in a coordinate system. So again time is meaingless.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; In order to have a meaningful Time, you need a combination of sameness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; (persisitent objects) and change (events). So time is posited on being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; able to say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Object A changed from state S1 at time T1 to state S2 at time T2.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You're just stating that time is different from space. Time and space are also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; different from colour, or any other property an object may have. If we didn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have time there would be no change, if we didn't have height everything would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be flat, and if we didn't have colour everything would be black.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it isn't an arbitrary difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't see how a physical multiverse would be distinguishable from a virtual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reality or a mathematical reality (assuming the latter is possible, for the sake
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of this part of the argument). The successive moments of your conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience do not need to be explicitly linked together to &quot;flow&quot; and they do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not need to be explicitly separated, either in separate universes or in separate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rooms, to be separate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I've never seen an HP universe. Yet they *must* exist in a mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; reality, because there are no random gaps in Platonia. Since all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; structures are exemplified, the structure corresponging to (me up till
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 second ago)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; + (purple dragons) must exist. If there is nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; mathematical to keep out of HP universe, the fact that I have never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; seen one is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; evidence against a mathematical multiverse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That you don't experience HP universes is as much an argument against a physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; multiverse as it is an argument against a mathematical multiverse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not &quot;as much&quot;. It depends on how constrained they are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physical multiverses can be almost as constrained as single universes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or almost as unconstrained as multiverses.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  If a physical MV
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; exists, then in some branch you will encounter purple dragons in the next second.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With a very low measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The fact that you don't means that either there is no physical multiverse or there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a physical multiverse but the purple dragon experience is of low measure. Similarly in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a mathematical multiverse the HP experiences may be of low measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physical multiversalists can choose measure to match observation (that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basically how the SWE is arrived at). Mathematical multiversalists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot choose an arbitrary measure, because nothing is arbitrary or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contingnet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in Platonia. Measure has to emerge naturally and necessarily for them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you died today and just by accident a possible next
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment of consciousness was generated by a computer a trillion years in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; future, then ipso facto you would find yourself a trillion years in the future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; That's the whole problem. I could just as easily find myself in an HP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; universe. But I never do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Not &quot;just as easily&quot;. If you are destructively scanned and a moment from now 2 copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of you are created in Moscow and 1 copy created in Washington, you have a 2/3 chance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of finding yourself in Moscow and a 1/3 chance of finding yourself in Washington.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What's that got to do with Platonia? Platonia contains every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; configuration of matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Snd no time). Configurations where I'm in Moscow, configurations where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm in Washington,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; configurations where I'm on the moon, configurations where I'm in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Narnia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no unaccountable fact to the effect that there is 1 copy of me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in Moscow,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2 in Washington, and 0 on the moon. There are no random gaps in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (That's the &quot;mathematical* mutiverse of course. A physical mutliverse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is an entirely different matter).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; real problem to explain why the HP universes are less likely to be experienced than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; orderly ones (see chapter 4.2 of Russell Standish' book for a summary of some of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; debates on this issue), but it is not any more of a problem for a mathematical as opposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to a physical multiverse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not at all. P-multiversalists can and do choose measure to match
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But if you had the successive moments of your consciousness implemented
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in parallel, perhaps as a simulation on a powerful computer, it would be impossible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to tell that this was the case. For all you are aware, there may not *be* any past
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moments: your present experience may include false memories of your past, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whole world may have been created a second ago.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; A simulation running on a computer is still a dynamic, temporal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; process. The point is that the passage of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; time tells me that I am not in Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Time Capsules: Getting Flow from Sequence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Proponents of the Block Universe view believe that there is only a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; B-Series. Some think that alone is adequate to explain the subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Flow-of-Time. It is easy enough to see how there could be a sequence in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the B series. If we consider a series of 3 dimensional &quot;snapshots&quot; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; someone's brain, each subsequent snapshot iwll contain information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; relating back to previous ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; But is this chain or sequence enough to establish flow ? A B-series
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; without an A-series is like a spatial series. If you had a series of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; clones arranged spatially so that clone 2 has all of clone 1's memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; (and more), clone 3 has all of clone 2's memories (and more) and so on,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; you would not expect anything to be flowing from one clone to another.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The clones form a series of &quot;time capsules&quot;, and a such they have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; natural sequence, but that is all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Without an A series, there is nothing to justify the idea that only one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; time capsule is conscious &quot;at a time&quot;. Either they all are, or none
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; are. We know we are conscious, so we must reject the &quot;none are&quot; option.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The Block Universe therefore predicts that all time capsules are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; conscious. This is in line with the way the Block Universe spatialises
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Time. It predicts that consciousness is a single 4-dimensional entity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I would not just be conscious now with memories of the past, I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; have a consciousness in the past overlaid on my present consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Whether the Block Universe model is right or not, the series of clones you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; describe, set up as an experiment, would still give the experience of being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; continuously conscious through time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is not that there would be gaps, the problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that they would all be conscious simultaneously.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I remember being conscious a second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ago but how could I possibly know that I didn't just pop into existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; complete with false memories half a second ago?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That isn't the problem. The problem is that if time is just like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space, as the BU theory states, you should have single consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spread across time, not a temporal sequence of one-at-a-time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; All I know is what I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiencing *now*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. That is the phenomenological fact that contradicts the BU.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is only because I have memories and a sense of being
