<br />
We exist in an infinite number of simulations. Any arbitrary number of 
<br />
simulations  less than infinity would require a reason. We are led to 
<br />
this conclusion by assuming a TOE which by definition has no a-priori 
<br />
reason. (This is the philosophical rationale for postulating the plenitude)
<br />
<br />Discreteness may be important in our world for the development of 
<br />
consciousness, but it is certainly not necessary across worlds. I 
<br />
believe therefore that the differences between the simulations is 
<br />
infinitesimal - not discrete - and therefore that the number of 
<br />
simulations is infinite like the continuum.
<br />
<br />Not only is the number of simulations infinite but the number of levels 
<br />
in simulation may also be infinite. The levels are discrete - I cannot 
<br />
imagine how they could be otherwise.
<br />
<br />Given the above, let's consider one particular conscious being. His 
<br />
awareness of his own states is likely to be uncertain. Another way of 
<br />
saying this is that several states transitions could generate the same 
<br />
consciousness stream. Modeling the state transitions as an algorithm, 
<br />
for example, there may be multiple algorithmic paths that could generate 
<br />
the same output.
<br />
<br />Hence his consciousness will have &quot;thickness across the multi-worlds,&quot; 
<br />
overlapping a set of  multi-worlds each slightly differing from the 
<br />
others. How many multi-worlds will it overlap? An infinite number since 
<br />
they differ as in a continuum. Everytime a &quot;measurement&quot; is made, the 
<br />
set of worlds spanned by this consciousness is defined more narrowly, 
<br />
but the number in the set remains infinite.  In addition, each 
<br />
simulation in the set need not belong to the same &quot;level.&quot;
<br />
<br />We're faced with the strange possibility that the consciousness spans an 
<br />
infinite number of simulations distributed over widely different levels. 
<br />
Each individual simulation implementation becomes infinitesimal and 
<br />
unimportant in comparison with the the whole infinite set of 
<br />
implementations that the consciousness covers. A particular simulation 
<br />
that stops operating (for example because the plug is pulled) will 
<br />
hardly affect or be missed by the consciousness as a whole. In fact I 
<br />
rather think of the &quot;simulations&quot; as static states in the plenitude, and 
<br />
consciousness as a locus in the plenitude linking these states in a 
<br />
causally and logically significant manner. We live in the plenitude, not 
<br />
in any  particular simulation. Each point in the conscious locus 
<br />
perceives the world that gives it meaning.
<br />
