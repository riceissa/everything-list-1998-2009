<br />
Moral and natural laws.
<br />
<br /><br />An investigation of natural laws, and, in parallel, a defence of
<br />
ethical objectivism.The objectivity, to at least some extent, of
<br />
science will be assumed; the sceptic may differ, but there is no
<br />
convincing some people).
<br />
<br />At first glance, morality looks as though it should work objectively.
<br />
The mere fact that we praise and condemn people's moral behaviour
<br />
indicates that we think a common set of rules is applicable to us and
<br />
them. To put it another way, if ethics were strongly subjective anyone
<br />
could get off the hook by devising a system of personal morality in
<br />
which whatever they felt like doing was permissible. It would be hard
<br />
to see the difference between such a state of affairs and having no
<br />
morality at all. The subtler sort of subjectivist (or relativist) tries
<br />
to ameliorate this problem by claiming that moral principles re defined
<br />
at the societal level, but similar problems recur -- a society (such as
<br />
the Thuggees or Assassins) could declare that murder is OK with them.
<br />
These considerations are of course an appeal to how morality seems to
<br />
work as a 'language game' and as such do not put ethics on a firm
<br />
foundation -- the language game could be groundless. I will argue that
<br />
it is not, but first the other side of the argument needs to be put.
<br />
<br />It is indisputable that morality varies in practice across communities.
<br />
But the contention of ethical objectivism is not that everyone actually
<br />
does hold to a single objective system of ethics; it is only that
<br />
ethical questions can be resolved objectively in principle. The
<br />
existence of an objective solution to any kind of problem is always
<br />
compatible with the existence of people who, for whatever reason, do
<br />
not subscribe. The roundness of the Earth is no less an objective fact
<br />
for the existence of believers in the Flat Earth theory.(It is odd that
<br />
the single most popular argument for ethical subjectivism has so little
<br />
logical force).
<br />
<br />Another objection is that an objective system of ethics must be
<br />
accepted by everybody, irrespective of their motivations, and must
<br />
therefore be based in self-interest. Again, this gets the nature of
<br />
objectivity wrong. The fact that some people cannot see does not make
<br />
any empirical evidence less objective, the fact that some people refuse
<br />
to employ logic does not make logical argument any less objective. All
<br />
claims to objectivity make the background assumption that the people
<br />
who will actually employ the objective methodology in question are
<br />
willing and able. We will return to this topic toward the end.
<br />
<br />Some people insist that anyone who is promoting ethical objectivism and
<br />
opposing relativism must be doing so in order to illegitamately promote
<br />
their own ethical system as absolute. While this is problably
<br />
pragmatically true in many cases, particularly where political and
<br />
religious rhetoric is involved, it has no real logical force, because
<br />
the contention of ethical objectivism is only that ethical questions
<br />
are objectively resolvable in principle -- it does not entail a claim
<br />
that the speaker or anyone else is actually in possession of them. This
<br />
marks the first of our analogues with science, since the in-principle
<br />
objectivity of science coincides with the fact that current scientific
<br />
thinking is almost certainly not final or absolute. ethical objectivism
<br />
is thus a middle road between subjectivism/relativism on the one hand,
<br />
and various absolutisms (such as religious fundamentalism) on the
<br />
other.
<br />
<br />The final objection, and by far the most philosophically respectable
<br />
one, is the objection on that moral rules need to correspond to some
<br />
kind of 'queer fact' or 'moral object' which cannot be found.
<br />
<br />Natural laws do not correspond in a simplistic one-to-one way with any
<br />
empirically detectable object, yet empiricism is relevant to both
<br />
supporting and disconfirming natural laws. With this in mind, we should
<br />
not rush to reject the objective reality of moral laws on the basis
<br />
that there is no 'queer' object for them to stand in one-to-one
<br />
correspondence with.
<br />
<br />There is, therefore, a semi-detached relationship between natural laws
<br />
and facts -- laws are not facts but are not unrelated to facts -- facts
<br />
confirm and disconfirm them. There is also a famous dichotomy between
<br />
fact and value (where 'value' covers ethics, morality etc). You cannot,
<br />
we are told, derive an 'ought' from an 'is'. This is the fact/value
<br />
problem.
<br />
<br />But, as Hume's argument reminds us, you cannot derive a law from an
<br />
isolated observation. Call this the fact/law problem. Now, if the
<br />
morality is essentially a matter or ethical rules or laws, might not
<br />
the fact/value problem and the law/value problem be at least partly the
<br />
same ?
<br />
<br />(Note that there seems to be a middle ground here; the English &quot;should&quot;
<br />
can indicate lawfulness without implying either inevitability, like a
<br />
natural law, or morality. eg you &quot;should&quot; move the bishop diagonally in
<br />
chess -- but that does not mean you will, or that it is unethical to do
<br />
so. It is just against the rules of chess).
<br />
<br />Sceptics about ethical objectivism will complain that they cannot be
<br />
exactly the same because moral rules like &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; contain
<br />
an 'ought', an irreducibly ethical element. Let's look at what sceptics
<br />
about natural laws say: their complaint is that a law is not a mere
<br />
collection of facts. A law cannot be directly derived from a single
<br />
observation, but it is not constituted by a collection of observations,
<br />
a mere historical record, either. A historical record is a mere
<br />
description; it tells you what has happened, but a law tells us what
<br />
will and must happen. A description gives no basis for expectation --
<br />
the territory does not have to correspond to the map -- yet we expect
<br />
laws to be followed, if we believe in them at all.
<br />
<br />I do not propose to answer this challenge in its own terms -- that is I
<br />
do not propose to show that a collection of mere facts does provide all
<br />
by itself the required lawfulness. On my analysis, all individual laws
<br />
depend on a general assumption -- a meta-law or ur-law -- that the
<br />
future will follow the same general pattern as the past. The sceptic
<br />
will object that this has been assumed without proof. My reply is that
<br />
each individual law is tested on its own merits. Since at least some
<br />
laws are thus shown to be correct a-posteriori, the lack of a-priori
<br />
proof of the meta-law is not significant.
<br />
<br />My further contention is that there is a different meta-law that needs
<br />
to be posited for ethical rules. Just as someone who is engaged in the
<br />
business of understanding the natural world needs a basic commitment to
<br />
the idea that nature has regularities, so someone needs a basic
<br />
commitment to moral behaviour in order to be convinced by ethical
<br />
arguments. Ethical arguments do not and cannot be expected to convince
<br />
psychopaths, any more than mathematical arguments can be expected to
<br />
convince the innumerate. Whilst it is essentially correct that an
<br />
evaluative conclusion cannot be drawn directly from a factual premiss,
<br />
such a conclusion can be drawn with the aid of a bridging principle,
<br />
(which is of course just our meta-law) e.g
<br />
<br />1 I do not want to be murdered
<br />
<br />2 I should do as I would be done by
<br />
<br />3 Therefore, I should not murder.
<br />
<br /><br />(2) is an example of a meta-law (or bridging principle or moral maxim),
<br />
As ethical objectivism is a work-in-progress there are many variants,
<br />
and a considerable literature discussing which is the correct one.
