<br />I think this situation is essentially hypothetical. No machine is
<br />
completely deterministic - computers are designed to be as
<br />
deterministic as possible, but still suffer bit errors through
<br />
chance. Human brains, however, strongly appear to be tuned to amplify
<br />
noise generated at the synaptic level to effect system level. (Fractal
<br />
structures in brainwave patterns, and the like).
<br />
<br />More important I think is to ask what is consciousness and free-will
<br />
for in an evolutionary sense. The theory that resonates most with me
<br />
in this context is Machiavellian Intelligence theory, that human's big
<br />
brains evolved to allow individuals to survive and prosper in a human
<br />
society. To do this it become crucial to predict what other members in
<br />
the society are going to do in response to your actions. Because this
<br />
is such an advantage, it is also an advantage not to be too
<br />
predictable yourself.
<br />
<br />This all has several consequences. It is possible, as you say, to
<br />
generate behaviour indistinguishable from randomness via deterministic
<br />
processes, however this is either computationally very expensive, or
<br />
relies on keeping the exact algorithm secret. Remember in human
<br />
societies, you opponents have access to the same computational capacity
<br />
you have (possibly more), and even parts of any algorithm you might
<br />
have if its genetically encoded. It seems more likely that brains will
<br />
tap into exploiting randomness at the synaptic level - this will also
<br />
work if you're a fairly dumb herbivore trying to outsmart an
<br />
intelligent predator.
<br />
<br />Another consequence of MI is that the most economical way of modelling
<br />
another human's behaviour is to study your own. Hence it is useful to
<br />
have a theory of the mind =&gt; self awareness as a useful evolutionary
<br />
feature. However, a theory of the mind is only useful if it can
<br />
predict what the other organism does - hence the mind must be in
<br />
control of the actions, not just along for the ride.
<br />
<br />Now for the age-old corny question of whether free-will is an illusion
<br />
or not. Mind is an emergent property - it is not to found among the
<br />
neurons making up the brain, however it is a useful predictive
<br />
model. This makes it emergent in just the same way as a glider is an
<br />
emergent property in the Game of Life. Just as the mind is emergent,
<br />
so is free-will, for the same reason. And just as you can argue (if
<br />
you want to) that GoL gliders are an illusion, you can argues that
<br />
mind and free-will is also an illusion - this does not preclude them
<br />
as a useful modeling concept for the organism. My personal preference
<br />
is to label these emergent concepts as real (when they're useful that
<br />
is), but it is a matter of taste. As an aside, I always considered the
<br />
high school explanation that centrifugal force was fictitious with
<br />
suspicion.
<br />
