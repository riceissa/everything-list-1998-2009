David Chalmers attempts to address the question of when a computation
<br />
is instantiated at:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://ling.ucsc.edu/~chalmers/papers/rock.html">http://ling.ucsc.edu/~chalmers/papers/rock.html</a>
<br />
<br />Jacques Mallah points out some problems with Chalmers and offers his own
<br />
ideas at:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://pages.nyu.edu/~jqm1584/cwia.htm#II3">http://pages.nyu.edu/~jqm1584/cwia.htm#II3</a>
<br />
<a href="http://pages.nyu.edu/~jqm1584/newideas.htm">http://pages.nyu.edu/~jqm1584/newideas.htm</a>
<br />
<br />I agree with Jacques that Chalmers' biggest problem is his simplistic
<br />
assumption that physical subsystems must occupy specific regions of space.
<br />
This would rule out people as conscious entities, since we move around.
<br />
You could patch this up but it is still far too limited.
<br />
<br />However Chalmers makes another mistake.  I don't think it is crucial to
<br />
his argument but he spends a lot of time on it.  That is the assumption
<br />
that a conscious state machine must have input, that an inputless system
<br />
cannot be conscious.
<br />
<br />I think this is clearly false, and any explanation of consciousness which
<br />
requires the existence of input is going to be wrong.  The reason is that
<br />
you can take an input-needing state machine and embed it in a larger
<br />
system which supplies the input.  The system as a whole instantiates a
<br />
conscious entity but has no input.
<br />
<br />We have seen examples of this in several recent sci-fi dramas, including
<br />
The Matrix.  People live in a simulated world with all their input
<br />
provided by the computer simulation.  (In The Matrix, people stilll had
<br />
organic brains, but in other fiction they are simulated as well.)  It
<br />
seems very plausible that if you can simulate a brain on a computer, you
<br />
can simulate an environment for it to interact with as well.  To oppose
<br />
this possibility you must give specific reasons why it cannot happen,
<br />
and Chalmers does not address the issue.
<br />
<br />Hence it is sufficient to consider an inputless state machine as posing
<br />
the problem of instantiation, and specifically of instantiation of
<br />
consciousness.  Chalmers' attempt to require input is not valid.
<br />
<br />However, I think that Chalmers' basic strategy of looking at substructure
<br />
of the mathematical process which is being instantiated, and trying to
<br />
map them to physical substates of the physical system which claims to
<br />
instantiate it, still works even with inputless systems.  So I think his
<br />
whole discussion of the need for input is in the end a red herring, but
<br />
does not ultimately detract from his basic argument.
<br />
<br />Turning then to the substate argument, Chalmers makes a good start but
<br />
founders on the difficulty of objectively, unambiguously defining what
<br />
is a substate of a physical system.  Physical position is the best he
<br />
can offer.
<br />
<br />Here is where Jacques attempts to improve the argument.  Rather than
<br />
a fixed physical region, he proposes that there is a program which
<br />
identifies physical points within the physical system which correspond
<br />
to each substate of the algorithm being instantiated.  This is called
<br />
the SMA, or Simplest Mapping Algorithm.
<br />
<br />This approach includes Chalmers' as a subcase, where the SMA would
<br />
simply choose a fixed location for each substate.  However, the SMA is
<br />
more general as it can accomodate motion and dynamics and change in the
<br />
physical system.  If it turns out that neurons grow and move around so
<br />
that they eventually don't overlap with their original location, Jacques'
<br />
method could allow for this.
<br />
<br />The main problem that I see with this approach is that Jacques proposes
<br />
to use Kolmogorov complexity to judge the simplicity of the SMA.  We want
<br />
the SMA to be uniquely defined, and in fact he has to add a few ad hoc
<br />
rules to deal with some possible ambiguities in order to get uniqueness.
<br />
We therefore need a measure over algorithms which describes simplicity,
<br />
so that we can take the simplest algorithm which satisfies the mapping
<br />
constraints.
<br />
<br />The problem is that Kolmogorov complexity (basically, shortest algorithm
<br />
length) is not a good tool for this, and in fact there may not be
<br />
any tool for this, in that it may not be a uniquely defined concept.
<br />
It may be that in trying to pin down the question of instantiation,
<br />
it has popped out as the question of algorithmic complexity, which is
<br />
equally unresolvable.
<br />
<br />There are two problems with Kolmogorov complexity.  The first is that
<br />
it is uncomputable.  See Chaitin's extensive work for more discussion of
<br />
this.  For anything other than very short strings, you can never be
<br />
sure of what the K. complexity is of a string or of a program.
<br />
<br />Now, you can bound K. complexity from above.  You can say that a program
<br />
has no more than a certain amount of K. complexity.  But there is always
<br />
the problem that it may have less.  This means that any attempt to
<br />
identify the SMA is impossible, because there could be another mapping
<br />
algorithm which turns out to be simpler.
<br />
<br />This is not actually a fatal blow to Jacques' idea.  It is possible that
<br />
although K. complexity is uncomputable and hence we can never know the
<br />
SMA, that in fact it does exist objectively and there is an objective
<br />
SMA.  We can never learn what it is, but its objective existence could be
<br />
enough to ground the instantiation question and therefore the question of
<br />
which systems are conscious.  This would not be a completely comfortable
<br />
result, that the objective consciousness of systems is forever unknowable,
<br />
but it would at least be consistent.
<br />
<br />However I think there is a worse problem.  That is that K. complexity is
<br />
not uniquely defined.  K. complexity is defined only with regard to some
<br />
specific universal Turing machine (UTM).  Two different UTMs will give a
<br />
different answer for what the K. complexity is of a string or program.
<br />
In fact, given any particular string, you can construct a UTM which gives
<br />
it an arbitrarily large or small K. complexity as measured by that UTM.
<br />
<br />I think this objection is probably fatal to Jacques' idea.  We need the
<br />
SMA to be uniquely defined.  But this cannot be true if there exist UTMs
<br />
which disagree about which mapping algorithm is simplest.  Within the
<br />
mathematical framework of K. complexity, all UTMs are equally valid.
<br />
So there is no objective preference of one over the other, hence there
<br />
can be no objective meaning to the SMA.
<br />
<br />In order to fix this, we have to identify a particular UTM which we will
<br />
use to measure the K. complexity.  There has to be some particular Turing
<br />
machine which is preferred by the universe.  You could choose one and
<br />
produce an &quot;objective theory of consciousness&quot;, but this would be yet
<br />
another ad hoc rule which would make the theory less persuasive.
