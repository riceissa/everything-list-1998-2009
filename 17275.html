</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This has no meaning for me. It is like saying &quot;don't ask&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmmmm.  You don't at all see what I'm trying to say?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay, how about this:  Reality is tautological.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;I exist&quot; could be, perhaps, tautological. But &quot;Reality&quot;? I don't  
<br />
think so. Certainly not from inside.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So if our conscious experience is caused by a rule-following system,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based on a sequence of determinisitc transforms applied to an initial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state...and this is true of both physicalism and your theory I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think...then our conscious experience just is what it is.  Tautology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything that follows was implicit in the setup.
</em><br />
<br />It is hard for me to understand.
<br />
First in the comp theory, consciousness is not caused by a rule- 
<br />
following system.
<br />
The most we can say is that &quot;my&quot; consciousness is preserved through a  
<br />
local substitution of my body.
<br />
This can be done with remaining agnostic on what is and where  
<br />
consciousness comes from.
<br />
The conclusion will be that consciousness, or anything apprehended by  
<br />
a person in some stable way has to be realted to an infinity of  
<br />
relations between numbers. And most are not &quot;caused&quot; by a rule- 
<br />
following system.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And there's no obvious reason that the &quot;unpacked&quot; version, where what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follows is made *explicit*, shouldn't be considered as a whole - with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the beginning, middle, and end states seen as existing simultaneously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and timelessly.  This makes the view that &quot;it just is what it is&quot; even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more obvious.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I can accept this for the true relations between numbers, and  
<br />
that is a motivation for a comp-like theory. But neither consciousness  
<br />
nor matter are tautological there. Important, and certainly  
<br />
fundamental in some sense: yes. But secondary and emerging from the  
<br />
numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Also, what do your theory say about accepting or not an artificial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; brain?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IF consciousness is caused, then whether you accept or not is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forgone conclusion, implicit in the initial setup (initial state +
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transformation rules) of the system that caused your conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience.
</em><br />
<br />I think, with all my respect, that you missed the movie-graph  
<br />
argument. Consciousness is not caused or produced by anything which  
<br />
could be described by a system or a theory. Consciousness is more a  
<br />
view from inside. It is a view of the border between the mechanical  
<br />
and the non mechanical, and it is not something caused by something.  
<br />
Locally it is more something causing something.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  So there is no real choice to &quot;accept or decline&quot;.  Only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the conscious experience of a choice.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If consciousness is UNCAUSED and fundamental, then...same answer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no real choice to &quot;accept or decline&quot;.  Only the conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience of a choice.
</em><br />
<br />I have the same opinion on the notion of causality and of &quot;free-will&quot;.  
<br />
Those are higher-order logical/semantical construction.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; More generally, how do you see the relation between brain and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conscience?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brains only exist as something that we consciously perceive.
</em><br />
<br />If by &quot;we&quot; you mean the universal machine, and really all of them,  
<br />
then I can make sense from your sentence.
<br />
If by &quot;we&quot; you mean the animal of the planet earth, I doubt it. In our  
<br />
plausibly shared long history, the moebas invented the cable even  
<br />
before going out of the sea.
<br />
Remember that with comp a brain is not a physical object. It is local  
<br />
summary of infinities of computational (in the math sense) relations  
<br />
between all the numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm sure that my brain can be viewed as representing the contents of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my experience.  And I'm sure that a computer program could also be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written that would represent the contents of my conscious experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and whose representational state would evolve as the program ran so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it continued to match the contents of my experience over time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this would not mean that the program was conscious, or that my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain is the source of my consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />We are in complete agreement here. But then you can say yes to the  
<br />
doctor, and follows the consequence of the hypothesis that your  
<br />
personal consciousness don't see any change.
<br />
<br />You see Rex, I have never been happy with the idea of those who say  
<br />
that matter or physics, is fundamental-basic, and to say that  
<br />
consciousness is fundamental-basic seems to me the same sort of &quot;don't  
<br />
ask principle&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The living brain and the executing computer program both just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; represent the contents of my conscious experience, in the same way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that a map represents the actual terrain.
</em><br />
<br />Assuming comp there is a big difference, which is that when you say  
<br />
&quot;yes&quot; to the doctor, you don't say yes because he put the right map in  
<br />
your skull, you say yes because it put the right relevant relative  
<br />
number. The artificial brain will just simulate your biological brain,  
<br />
but it will, supposing the doctor has choose the right level, emulate  
<br />
your first person (relatively to your infinity of most probable  
<br />
(normal) histories.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Uncaused things can't be explained.  They just are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; So what causes the complexity and structure of the things that I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; conscious of?  Nothing.  That's just the way my experience is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ? I can't accept this, because I am interested in the how and why of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; complexity of things and happenings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you can look for patterns in what you observe, and interesting ways
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to represent what you have observed in the past.
</em><br />
<br />Not just that. I look for understanding. I criticize enough the  
<br />
scientists who confuse description and prediction with explanation.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this is as far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as you can go I think.
</em><br />
<br />Hmm... read UDA with attention. I think you confuse this (new?) type  
<br />
of explanation and proof with the usual Aristotelian reductions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the reasons outlined above.  Your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations just are what they are.  There's no real explanation for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them...only pseudo-explanations.
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure you have grasped what I try to explain.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; No explanation can be given for uncaused fundamental events or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; entities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But what are your assumptions about those entities? You theory does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; look like what the guardian G* tells to the &quot;enlightened machine&quot; G:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you will not prove your consistency. But the machine can prove that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; IF
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; she is consistent, then G* is right about that. So, on one level, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; understand why you say so, and at another level I explain why you say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I lean towards the idea that only our conscious experiences are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;real&quot;.  Things obviously exist as contents of conscious experiences.
</em><br />
<br />I deeply disagree here. Even to understand a word like &quot;content&quot; I  
<br />
have to believe in some more basic entities which are not conscious.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't have any assumptions about them.  They just are what they are,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the conscious experience that &quot;contains&quot; them is what it is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tautology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I *think* I'm leaning towards saying that a lot of this stuff about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;knowing&quot; is just a type of qualia.  But I'm not sure.  I'm still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking that part out.
</em><br />
<br />Knowing, observing, feeling, conceiving, are type of qualia. But they  
<br />
are related, and eventually what I say, is that any rational and  
<br />
conscious agent saying yes to a digital doctor can understand why and  
<br />
how those qualia are related through numbers relation, most of them of  
<br />
the type universal numbers reflecting universal numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;understanding&quot; is a complex notion. Theories are not build to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; understand, but to get a coherent (hopefully correct) picture.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I think it's reasonable to speak as though quarks and electrons are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real, if that helps the process of developing mathematical/narrative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models that fit our observations.  There are *useful fictions*, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then there's what actually is.  Quarks and electrons are useful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fictions.  Conscious experience is what actually is.
</em><br />
<br />I follow you on the fact that my conscious experience here and now  
<br />
actually is. But I am already force, to give a personal sense to the  
<br />
act of writing this mail, to believe in your conscious experience.  
<br />
Now, I have reason for not taking *you* a mere useful fiction. Once I  
<br />
bet on another conscience, I get the notion of person, and on finding  
<br />
points of agreement.
<br />
Most people accept the arithmetical elementary truth, and I enjoy the  
<br />
fact that comp, that is the belief we are machine, entails a whole  
<br />
&quot;theology&quot; which is capable to explain where the useful fictions like  
<br />
quarks come from, behave in such or such ways, and participate in that  
<br />
infinite universal numbers reflective dreams, all this without  
<br />
eliminating persons and their will, and providing a fundamental role  
<br />
and a purpose to consciousness.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this is more obvious if you look at the system as a &quot;block
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; universe&quot;, where time is treated as a sort of spatial dimension, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; so all states of the system exist simultaneously, like my previous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; example of the block of granite.  Why does state B follow state A?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is slice B adjacent to slice A?  Because that's just the way  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; uncaused system is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is big amorphous blob. Weird theory. I don't see the relation with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the universe, nor even with consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I'm saying that IF physicalism is true, then our universe is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like that.  If physicalism is true then how else could it be?  And if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this physical universe is what causes our conscious experience, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our conscious experience is just like that.
</em><br />
<br />None sentences makes sense for me here.
<br />
Even if physicalism is true, the material world could still have a  
<br />
highly structured shape.
<br />
And if physicalism is true, then comp is false, and I have no more any  
<br />
clues about what to say, in third person ways, about consciousness. I  
<br />
would say it does not exist, because I don't see how to weaken comp as  
<br />
to make it reappears without making consciousness a force, and then it  
<br />
would need its particle. And they should escape comp. Why not? But I  
<br />
have no evidence, and again, consciousness would be even less  
<br />
fundamental. But it is the correct, by the UDA incompatibility  
<br />
theorem, way to envisage consciousness if we want to maintain  
<br />
physicalism. And Penrose is the only one I know following that kind of  
<br />
path, except that his forces has to violate QM. This should be related  
<br />
to the fact that his Gödelian reasoning, leading to &quot;the same result&quot;,  
<br />
was incorrect (less so in its second book than the first).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Why would arithmetical relationships result in conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; experience?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Because arithmetical relationship described the theology and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; science of self-observing machine. No machine can know as such its  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theology, but machine can get the theological science about simpler
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine, and then lift its logic on themselves (so they can remain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consistent in the process), and escape locally the incompleteness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am not saying that truth is like that, but that if you say yes to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; doctor and survive the graft, then it has to be like that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I can (sort of) see how a logical machine might symbolically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; represent reality in this way.  BUT, this doesn't answer the question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of why there should be a conscious experience associated with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine symbolically representing reality this way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does it?
</em><br />
<br />It does not. That is why it is the assumption of the theory. The  
<br />
working hypothesis. The light in the dark.
<br />
And then, the beauty of it, is that, ONCE the assumption is done, we  
<br />
can understand fully and rationally why we cannot understand how a  
<br />
symbolic self-representing relation individuate into an  
<br />
incommunicable, non doubtable, lived qualia.
<br />
The tools for that understanding being computer science and  
<br />
mathematical logic.
<br />
The quale itself remains out of the explanation, like truth. It  
<br />
concerns of form of possible consciousness:  consciousness, of any  
<br />
individual, be it the consciousness of the virgin universal machine  
<br />
(&quot;cosmic consciousness&quot;, or &quot;arithmetical consciousness&quot;) to the  
<br />
consciousness of any particular universal machine (bacteria?  
<br />
Protozoa,? Plant?, Planaria? cats? humans?, ...). None are reducible  
<br />
to any finite explanation, and all are distributed densely on the  
<br />
border between what is computable, and what is not. To be mechanical  
<br />
and universal makes you live on the border.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To put it slightly differently, the machine might be in a state that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could be 3rd-person interpreted as the machine representing reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this way.  BUT, this doesn't answer the question of why there should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a conscious experience associated with the machine being in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does it?
</em><br />
<br />It does not. But see above. It provides the &quot;meta&quot; explanation of why  
<br />
it does not. Why, if we are machine, there must be a quale (an  
<br />

<br />
