<br />
I want to follow up on the discussion we had last December about &quot;flying
<br />
rabbit&quot; universes.  Let me first recap my understanding of the issues.
<br />
<br />Suppose that all universes exist, and that they are associated with
<br />
computer programs that generate them.  The measure of a universe is
<br />
defined as 1/2^n, where n is the size of the smallest program that
<br />
generates a given universe.  Can we reconcile this theory with our
<br />
observations of the universe around us?  In particular, does it explain
<br />
why we seemingly live in a lawful universe?
<br />
<br />Broadly speaking, the answer is yes.  As it happens, it appears that
<br />
the laws of physics are relatively simple.  Stephen Wolfram guesses
<br />
that the entire set of laws for our universe could be reduced to about
<br />
5 lines of Mathematica code.  So apparently a relatively simple program
<br />
would be sufficient to generate our universe, with all its complexity,
<br />
including ourselves.
<br />
<br />Clearly even more complex programs would also be possible to generate
<br />
universes like ours.  With the additional complexity the laws of
<br />
nature could have more exceptions and allow for &quot;miraculous&quot; behavior.
<br />
Such universes are called &quot;flying rabbit&quot; universes, or sometimes
<br />
&quot;white rabbit&quot; (after Alice in Wonderland), &quot;dragon&quot;, or &quot;Harry Potter&quot;
<br />
universes.  The idea is that these universes are basically lawful, but
<br />
there are rare exceptions which can be manipulated to produce results
<br />
which violate the natural laws which hold otherwise.  The question is,
<br />
why don't we live in such a universe?
<br />
<br />The answer is that to change the program from one which just implements
<br />
the simple laws of physics to one which has the exceptions would greatly
<br />
increase its size.  To allow rabbits (but not other heavy, wingless
<br />
animals) to fly, for example, the laws of physics would have to encode the
<br />
definition of a rabbit.  And since these laws are presumably expressed at
<br />
the subatomic level, defining a rabbit from that perspective would take
<br />
an enormous amount of information.  Instead of 5 lines of Mathematica the
<br />
program would balloon to probably billions of lines or even more, most
<br />
of which was defining a rabbit.  Such a program would have infinitesimal
<br />
measure compared to our universe.  That's why we don't see rabbits fly.
<br />
<br />Back in December I raised an objection.  A white rabbit universe is less
<br />
probable than a simpler one by a factor of roughly 2^R, where R is the
<br />
information content in defining the rabbit.  However, by the same token
<br />
there are 2^R possible information patterns that can be described in
<br />
those R bits.  So if we consider the collection of all universes which
<br />
allow for exceptions, not just for rabbit-shaped objects but for all
<br />
possible rabbit-sized objects, then the total measure of all of these
<br />
is approximately as large as for the simple universe.  So we can't
<br />
really reject white rabbit universes, if we extend the notion to refer
<br />
to any universe which allows for miracles based on some special pattern
<br />
of information.
<br />
<br />The answer to this objection was basically that most patterns of
<br />
information are random.  So the vast majority of these universes, while
<br />
in principle allowing for miracles, would only have them be triggered
<br />
by a phenomenon which is so rare that it will never occur in practice.
<br />
You'd have to have a huge combination of particles take on some precise
<br />
configuration, and then maybe something bizarre would happen.  But the
<br />
chance of any such configuration arising would be so low, it would be
<br />
like waiting for random thermal motions to suck all of the air out of
<br />
your room.  You'd never see it in the lifetime of the universe.
<br />
<br />Now, my new idea is to look at somewhat less extreme violations of laws.
<br />
Suppose we have a universe which has simple natural laws like ours, but
<br />
does allow for violations based on certain patterns or configurations
<br />
of matter.  As before, the larger the pattern necessary to trigger
<br />
exceptional behavior, the lower the measure of the universe; but
<br />
countering that, there are just as many possible patterns which could
<br />
be used to trigger the lawless behavior.  So collectively the set of
<br />
universes with some exceptions does not have much less measure than for
<br />
universes with simple laws and no exceptions.
<br />
<br />It seems to me, then, that it is actually likely that we live in
<br />
such a universe.  Chances our that our universe has basically simple
<br />
natural laws, but has the chance for miracles to occur when the proper
<br />
arrangements are made.  And there's no inherent reason why the miracle
<br />
triggering configuration has to be huge as for a white rabbit.  It could
<br />
be as simple as a few subatomic particles coming together in a certain
<br />
way.  In fact, it's possible that such &quot;miracles&quot; happen at a relatively
<br />
high rate throughout the universe, events which violate natural laws.
<br />
I think our model even predicts that there is a reasonable likelihood
<br />
that such things happen.
<br />
<br />The only real limitation I see on the probability of lawless events
<br />
is based on the anthropic principle.  The universe has to be lawful
<br />
enough for intelligent life to have arisen.  If it were too easy to
<br />
generate energy, say, or to repel gravity, then the universe might be
<br />
chaotic and unstable.  Or perhaps life would evolve to exploit these
<br />
possibilities and it would make things so easy that there would be no
<br />
incentive for intelligence to evolve.
<br />
<br />This suggests that as we move forward with our investigations of physics,
<br />
exploring new realms of matter with new tools that could not have
<br />
been reasonably evolved naturally, we should expect, with a reasonably
<br />
high probability, to discover miracles.  We're not guaranteed to do so,
<br />
because after all even the collection of all miracle-containing universes
<br />
is still not quite as probable as the simple one that has no miracles.
<br />
But collectively I think they might be as much as 1/10 as probable,
<br />
and perhaps even 1/2 as probable.
<br />
<br />So it seems to me that this is another prediction which we can make based
<br />
on the all-universe principle (AUP): that natural law may well have rare
<br />
exceptions, and that once we begin exploring realms and configurations
<br />
that are unlikely to have occured naturally, we may find one.  It's hard
<br />
to say what the outcome is likely to be, but most likely it is something
<br />
that can be described simply, in whatever programming language most
<br />
efficiently describes our universe's natural laws.  Maybe there's a sign
<br />
reversal somewhere, or a constraint is simply skipped or added.
<br />
<br />We could get unlucky and blow up the planet with some kind of energy
<br />
release triggered by a particle accelerator.  Or maybe we'd get lucky
<br />
and find some way to exploit the miracle to our benefit.  But I think
<br />
the AUP gives us more reason than in conventional view of physics to
<br />
expect such miraculous behavior.
