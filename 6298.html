Russell,
<br />
<br />Thanks for your interest in this.  I did not make this any easier by 
<br />
bungling the initial concept a little in my first post.  To directly 
<br />
answer your question, I am assuming space-time is a single entity, with 
<br />
time representing the spatial area of the multiverse.  Therefore, the 
<br />
question you pose really wouldn't make sense.  It would be like drawing 
<br />
a square and asking why height is proportional to length.  The 
<br />
relationship is necessary. 
<br />
<br />Going back to all of our multiverse stacks with the cube on it, all 
<br />
these stacks would equal the time-area.  This is the &quot;depth&quot; of the cube 
<br />
in the multiverse, that would allow the cube to store 10^300 bits of 
<br />
information.  The time area equals the cube in it's totality in the 
<br />
multiverse.  So why, in our universe, can we only store information 
<br />
equal to the surface area?  Well we know we don't have access to the 
<br />
whole cube, because we are not in all of the universes that this cube 
<br />
exists in.  So we have to divide the cube by something to represent the 
<br />
fact that we are only on one stack.  The proper divisor would be the 
<br />
length of the cube, because we are existing on a time-line.  The 
<br />
information that can be stored is limited to a single set of outcomes- a 
<br />
line along the plane of the time area (a stack of pictures). 
<br />
<br />This leaves us with the Holographic principle. 
<br />
<br />Please note this is an interesting concept (to me) I am proposing 
<br />
because the geometry of it makes sense when I picture it mentally.  You 
<br />
or others much smarter than I will have to explain why this works or 
<br />
doesn't work mathematically in QM or TOR.  Colin Bruce suggests in his 
<br />
book that the cube volume contains multiverse information (as a 
<br />
speculative ending to his book), and when I started thinking about it I 
<br />
realized if you take the &quot;multiverse block&quot; concept seriously, and 
<br />
consider time a spatial dimension through the multiverse, a cube of 
<br />
space would only provide a full content of information before it was 
<br />
seperated out into all of the individual outcomes as it moved through 
<br />
time (or how about &quot;multiverse space&quot;?). 
<br />
<br />A cube of space really does hold it's volume in information.  But we 
<br />
have to divide by time.  Particularly, the length of the time plane 
<br />
because the rest of the time area has been lost to the other 
<br />
outcomes/universes/stacks (or whatever allows you to conceptualize it 
<br />
the best).  This is speculative (obviously).  I'd like to hear some 
<br />
feedback, as this explains a lot (to me anyway) if the concept is right.
<br />
<br />Danny Mayes
