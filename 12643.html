<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This raises the question again of &quot;what is the minimum duration of a conscious state&quot;?  You mention 5sec as being a long time for a coincidental match (would there still be two consciousnesses for that 5sec - I think not), but what about 300msec, or 100msec.  There's not much consciousness in 100msec; so little that it may be occuring hundreds of times over in different brains.
</em><br />
<br />Human brains, and the consciousness they produce are both very complex.
<br />
&nbsp;I've heard it said that human vision processes the quivalent of
<br />
hundreds of millions of  pixels and can distinguish millions of colors.
<br />
&nbsp;The optic nerves transfer information at a rate of about 1 Gbps.  So
<br />
for thought experiments and examples I find it useful to reduce qualia
<br />
to more simple cases.  Imagine a creature with very primitive sight,
<br />
capable of only distinguishing between white and black, and with visual
<br />
acuity so poor it is only able to perceive one pixel.  Sight for such a
<br />
creature would be equivalent to perceiving one of two states:
<br />
brightness or darkness.
<br />
<br />When this creature &quot;sees&quot; white, it would be equivalent to that
<br />
creature having an involuntary and vivid thought about white.  That
<br />
thought is objectively nothing more than the activation of a certain
<br />
group of neurons that react when having the thought about white.
<br />
Subjectively, the creature perceives an indescribable quale, and may
<br />
say that white is like warmth (in the same way humans rescribe red as
<br />
being hot).  This is likely due to links in the neural tissue between
<br />
the neurons that process seeing white and the ones that process the
<br />
sensation of warmth.
<br />
<br />Using this simplified example, it becomes easier to attack the question
<br />
of &quot;what is the minimum duration for a conscious state?&quot;, or &quot;How long
<br />
is an obsever moment?&quot;  One could say that for every planck time, there
<br />
an observer moment.  While those neurons are active there will be
<br />
observer moment's experiencing the quale of white at each instant.
<br />
However, since brain chemistry is so slow (compared to the speed of
<br />
light and plank scales) there will be a massive number of observer
<br />
moments that are subjectively indistinguishable.  So in this regard one
<br />
could also say that new observer moments are only created when the
<br />
state of the neural tissue changes, since otherwise they were
<br />
indistingushable from the observer's perspective.
<br />
<br />In this regard, there is no minimum amount of time an observer moment
<br />
must span, all that is required for the observer moment to exist is for
<br />
a brain in a certain state to exist.  Note however, that our brains do
<br />
not only contain information collected from a single instant, but
<br />
rather they contain and are in the middle of processing sensory
<br />
information collected over the course of perhaps a 10th - 20th of a
<br />
second.  This could explain why a flip book appears to have smooth
<br />
motion if you see more than 10 to 20 frames per second, and why a low
<br />
frequency sound below 10-20 Hz sounds like individal beats as opposed
<br />
to a tone.
