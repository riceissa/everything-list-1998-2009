<br />
I was actually thinking in terms of emphasising the *single* seamless
<br />
ontic status of 'out there' and 'in here' - i.e. the
<br />
contingency of 'boundaries'. The 'novelty' would be introducing
<br />
a second primary ontic status (this is IMO the point where the hard
<br />
problem appears). But you see what I mean about language? This is why I
<br />
don't insist on using my own terminology in this area, although
<br />
it's still the way I think about it privately.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My view is that the *fact of * the APV is 1-person, and everything else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is 3-person. That is, the 1-person is the unmediated intuitive grasp of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3-person information by the 'underlying reality'. What lies within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; APV, the AIV, or the 'external world' to which they refer, then depends
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solely on contingent boundaries emerging from 3-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information gradients and horizons.  Essentially this is categorising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ontology as 1-person, and the epistemology as 3-person. However, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realise that this is a minority approach, and has caused much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; confusion, so I've more or less given up trying to promote it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [COLIN]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How can this approach possibly be optional!
</em><br />
<br />[DAVID]
<br />
As, I've said, it's the specific language (perhaps) that's
<br />
optional, not IMO the analysis, or the intuition that lies behind it.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RE: COMP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have a calculus (a heuristic for one, really) called 'entropy calculus',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; EC, which I think (not sure yet but confidence rising) might be able to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought of an actual instance of COMP based on the real occurrence (rough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coincidence) of an extravagently huge number of identical primitives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which operate as axioms). Each axiom can be viewed as a 'mathematician'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The calculus is massively parallel mathematics (not singular/serial, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; driven by a lone classical mathematician pushing a proof along). The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current state of the cooperative efforts of all the mathematicians
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ....whose relationships are iterative rules of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inference/transformation.... literally is reality. There is one massive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rolling 'proof' unfolding without end.
</em><br />
<br />[DAVID]
<br />
Perhaps this could connect productively (metaphorically at least) with
<br />
cellular automata theory (cf. Wolfram et. al.)? There is some
<br />
convergence in the notions of primitive 'axioms' and massive
<br />
parallelism - and I suppose that if the operational space was
<br />
sufficiently 'extravagantly huge' (limit case: infinite), you might
<br />
argue for the recursive emergence of number, arithmetic, and the rest.
<br />
I guess there would be no discrete UD, its role (i.e. the stepwise
<br />
execution of all 'code' in rotation) being distributed over some
<br />
massively parallel assemblage of 'theorem provers'. How, or
<br />
whether, one could get comp to run on this 'machine', I am unsure.
<br />
<br />I'd be interested in your view of what the minimum axiomatic
<br />
constraints of such an approach might be, such as instantiations of
<br />
0-bit and 1-bit, plus some minimal set of state-based rules. This seems
<br />
a fruitful theoretical area, but one in which I possess no expertise.
<br />
<br />[COLIN]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; REALITY is a COMPUTATION on a natural axiom set?  YES.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMPUTATION manfactured of an existing reality constructs a REALITY?  NO.
</em><br />
<br />[DAVID]
<br />
This is a really confusing (to me) aspect of comp v. 'standard
<br />
computationalism' (and too often no clear distinction is made). Bruno
<br />
argues (8th step of the UDA) - and I follow him in this - that for
<br />
consciousness to supervene on computationalism, 'matter' can serve no
<br />
explanatory role other than that of a placeholder for the 'relata'.
<br />
Hence, under comp, 'matter' emerges from 'number', not vice versa. The
<br />
'yes doctor' argument appears to appeal to the possibility of 'actual
<br />
material hardware' being utilised to instantiate consciousness
<br />
computationally. But there is still the crucial issue of 'substitution
<br />
level' - instantiation must occur at the right layer of the hierarchy
<br />
of nesting / recursion, so I suppose that in terms of this hierarchy,
<br />
all notions of 'hardware' are themselves relational emergents. No final
<br />
theory of this appears to exist at present - at the last resort you are
<br />
left to choose in 'good faith'. So whether it constitutes an 'existing
<br />
reality' in your terms is moot.
<br />
<br />[COLIN]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you could help me relate EC to COMP it'd be a big help. I think there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be a TOE in here someplace via a reified COMP instantated as EC that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is empirically supported but ONLY testable in brain material. Just an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea.
</em><br />
<br />[DAVID]
<br />
Hmm..a simple task, perhaps, but where to begin...?? I'm not sure Bruno
<br />
would be very happy at the notion of 'reifying' comp, but I don't want
<br />
to fall into the quagmire of the interminable struggle between him and
<br />
Peter on this one. Maybe you could show how COMP could emerge from a
<br />
more primitive EC, possibly along similar lines to those I mention
<br />
above. At the end of the day, we can only work with relata and rules,
<br />
so whether this is physics, mathematics or logic is possibly a question
<br />
of taste, as long as one doesn't get hung up on academic definitions of
<br />
'existence'. For me, what we mustn't shrink from ascribing to what we
<br />
describe is Peter's 'reality in the sense that I am real'. So it must
<br />
account for the qualitative emergence of both 1- and 3-person povs, and
<br />
be clear on the hierarchies (or entelechies) entailed in this.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; a) assume that there is an 'objective reality in the Bruno sense: a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality exists. _any_ sort of reality will do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; b) draw a purely notional boundary around any portion of it at any

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spatiotemporal scale.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [DAVID]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Do you think it's possible *not* to start with this assumption?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [COLIN]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No. As a scientifically hypotheses you have a bunch of options, but for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this particular one:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; H1: &quot;There is a real world and our perceptions permit a level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apprehension of it&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ....you'd have to say that the existence and ongoing success of science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes it perhaps one of the most empirically supported scientific theorems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of all time. Every experiment ever done is an emplicit experiment on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothsesis. A philosophical argument questioning the existence of reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have to be an untestable/sophist waste of good words, no?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [DAVID]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; problem with natural language is that it implicitly assumes the AIV is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'out there' as the primary reality, and it can be tough to work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; back from this point of departure. I was trying to develop a language
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that started from the APV and worked outwards, as it were, so that it was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; easier to see how emergent information boundaries were shaping and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structuring the APV and the AIV while at the same time contingently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creating the 'not-X', without fundamentally creating novel ontic (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opposed to epistemic) categories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [COLIN]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure you need be so shy about creating the novel ontic categories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - after all, the set we have is entirely an organisation of appearances,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not the actual reality underneath. If there is ontic validity to be had,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontologies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [DAVID]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Somehow it's like:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a) we mentally step outside of the APV to see what it's like in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'external world'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; b) we make models of what we see out there (the AIV), including our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'brains'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; c) then we forget about step a), get stranded outside, and take the AIV
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for 'reality'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; d) leaving us in a panic about how to get back inside our 'brains'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [COLIN]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is an assumption of truth of the following hypothesis:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; H2: &quot;There is a real world an we literally access it&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This, I think, conflicts with modern neuroscience and is therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refuted. It makes use of an assumption about perception that is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proven. However, getting mainstream empirisism and consciousness studies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to realise it is another matter!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [DAVID]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Somebody once asked &quot;what is the external world 'external' to?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Do you know?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Damned good question! It seems that anything perceptually regarded as 'not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me' would do. I've found the terms by Derek Denton useful:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'INTEROCEPTION' as those phenomenal percepts constructed of qualia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intentionality(aboutness) directed at physical self (situational emotions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primordial emotions).  I would extend the definition to include internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagery of all kinds as a more complex form.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'EXTEROCEPTION' as those phenomenal percepts constructed of qualia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representing (intentional content/aboutness in respect of) the external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world or our physical interface with it (touch, taste, vsision, aural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I guess the external world is &quot;that part of reality depicted by and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore apprehended through exteroception&quot; would be as good a starting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition as any. It depends on whether the notion of 'self' includes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical self (I think it does).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [DAVID]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think the general view is that the APV is 1-person, and the AIV is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3-person. But then, the AIV *model* of the APV is 3-person, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction between this and the 1-person APV is confusing (the 'hard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem').
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [COLIN]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The mere idea of self referential model (the AIV *model* of the APV) is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IMO, an oxymoron at the heart of the (hard) problem. This is a cultural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption several hundred years old - it's use-by date is soooooo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expired. How do you get the message out?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [COLIN]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The easiest way to think of it is to regard X as a finger puppet. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'fingers' are behaving atomly in that the fingers are painted (appear -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; APV) to deliver the appearance of 'atom-ly (AIV) behaviour'. The AIV says
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; nothing about FINGERS. Then note that whatever the fingers are - you,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; observer - are made of the SAME FINGERS and those fingers are painting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; APV in your head. The reason no-one ever gets a physics of qualia is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; nobody EVER gets scientific about _fingers_ - the underling physics -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everyone thinks the AIV generalisations ARE the fingers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [DAVID]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Conventional physics, I think, denies that the fingers exist - all that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be said is what QM / string theory / model of the month describes, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is equivalent to saying that that's all there is folks. Comp,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; however, would say that the fingers are something like mathematical ontic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; / epistemic categories (see some of Marc Geddes' posts), and that these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; support the emergence of 3-person relata. Sets of these 1-person /
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3-person relationships can be nested recursively, the whole resting on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'turtle' of a tightly constrained
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'number reality' (e.g. AR+CT+UDA). The 'modest' assumption here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is that not to force 'faith' in comp, but rather study and test it for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its interesting and surprising results and generative power. The most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; powerful result would be to pin down the 'emergence direction' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1-person &lt;--&gt; 3-person once and for all.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. This denial really freaks me out. It makes cosmology a religion. As a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientist I cannot tolerate it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RE: COMP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have a calculus (a heuristic for one, really) called 'entropy calculus',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; EC, which I think (not sure yet but confidence rising) might be able to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought of an actual instance of COMP based on the real occurrence (rough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coincidence) of an extravagently huge number of identical primitives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which operate as axioms). Each axiom can be viewed as a 'mathematician'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The calculus is massively parallel mathematics (not singular/serial, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; driven by a lone classical mathematician pushing a proof along). The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current state of the cooperative efforts of all the mathematicians
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ....whose relationships are iterative rules of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inference/transformation.... literally is reality. There is one massive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rolling 'proof' unfolding without end.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My maths skills are not strong enough to deal with all the nuances of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno's ideas, but I have picked up on key relata. The main point: There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no abstraction/modelling going on. This is not a computation but a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMPutation. At least I think it can be viewed this way. What Bruno's work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does is to explore the general features of it. The only problem I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with it is if you say that COMP can happen as a result of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructing a computational 'as-if' substrate made of our reality - then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every practically useful thing about COMP dissappears (there is no 'actual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being' in the analyses of COMP, only notional indicators of those aspect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that might correspond to 'being').
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So on that proviso - that reality is a literal instantation of _a_ COMP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If reality = state of the proof, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (a) physical stuff = a proof in EC = matter. These are proven truths in EC.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (b) the unproven truths in EC are, in effect, 'virtual matter'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The pactical view:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2 mathematicians A, B working together(coherent) prove 3 theorems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (i) A (matter)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (ii) B (matter)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (iii) A with respect to B (virtual matter)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neither mathematician A nor B physically 'proves' (iii), it is implicit in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the act of (i) and (ii) that their relationship (iii) is just as well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined as (i) and (ii). It's just that no mathematician actually does the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proof. It's inherent in the parallelism of the situation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The relationship ME_AS_MATTER (proof) and NOT-ME (all the rest of matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as other proofs) is a massive collection of unproven truths in EC. This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 'latent perspective view' of NOT_ME from ME that I speak of. This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; NOT 1-person as discussed above, but latent 1-person, actually used by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain to construct 1-person. Parallelism is intrinsic to the situation -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so if a COMP implementation enforces any loss of parallelism COMP will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never be able to claim that the resulting system has any consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's I think is the essence of the only problem I have with COMP.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; REALITY is a COMPUTATION on a natural axiom set?  YES.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMPUTATION manfactured of an existing reality constructs a REALITY?  NO.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; btw...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ql. What if mathematician A, modifies (i) to 'act as-if' (ii) existed?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Voila QUALIA can be piggybacked off the 'latent view' = virtual matter =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; virtual proof (iii). Takes a while to get used to this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Q2. Does this not mean that &quot;associative memory&quot; is literally &quot;inductive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inference&quot; that creates a 'truth' in EC that could be regarded 'a useful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but unproven lie' about reality = empirical knowledge implemented in EC?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There you have an ontolgy and a derivative empistemology implemented in EC.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also.. re 'turtles'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The turtles in EC are merely fluctuations. They are what would could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; called 'loops' in QM. Recursivity = nested loops. Anything with a result =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1 loop can combine with any other loop...thus with loops you can make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything (including strings). The ultimate 'biggee' fluctuation = the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole universe. Everything is the same at all scales.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe bruno can calibrate the terms in COMP jargon so we're all on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same page. The EC, as an actual instance (or a class of instances) of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP, should be able to be expressed in COMP terms, but I don't know how.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'd like to write it all up - as it is predictive of the behaviour of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain material in the way that Bruno wants COMP to be empirically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; testable. At least that's what I am beginning to think, having beaten my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; head over his maths for a while (my brain hurts).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so when you say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;&gt; is that not to force 'faith' in comp, but rather study and test it for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its interesting and surprising results and generative power. The most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; powerful result would be to pin down the 'emergence direction' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1-person &lt;--&gt; 3-person once and for all.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is how I would look at it: I got to EC just via Godel/Church/Turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and thinking in real terms. Bruno has, I think, generalised the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process but not fully grasped the reification of it ...or more likely :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; .... I have not fully grasped his notions of reification. Calulus based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-numerics must seem weird to a mathematician, but there are no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'numbers' in our EC reality, only fluctuations in aggregate that have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties 'sufficiently like' numbers to create the local calculii we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identify as 'empiirical laws of nature'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you could help me relate EC to COMP it'd be a big help. I think there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be a TOE in here someplace via a reified COMP instantated as EC that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is empirically supported but ONLY testable in brain material. Just an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How'd we get here from the original thread question? Whew! I blame that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person! :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cheers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; colin hales
