I agree with what you say about the fragmentation of the first person. This is where the 
<br />
idea of the observer moment comes to the rescue as the smallest posible unit of conscious 
<br />
experience (are you aware that there have ben long discussions on this list in the past 
<br />
about OM's?). While there may be ambiguity as to whether this particular moment of 
<br />
consciousness is me, you, half me and half you, or whatever, we can at least describe its 
<br />
objective content; rather like falling back on a latitude and longtitude description when there is 
<br />
a dispute about which side of the border a piece of land belongs. 
<br />
<br />Having said that, there is a sense in which I remain me from moment to moment even though 
<br />
it cannot be made objective in the light of thought experiments such as you describe: I'm me 
<br />
insofar as I believe I am me, have my memories, and so on. Surviving to the next moment 
<br />
entails that there be at least one OM extant then (by whatever means this may come about) 
<br />
which thinks it is me in the same way that I think I am the same person of a moment ago. 
<br />
<br />What about when multiple equally valid OM's exist? I don't agree that they are all perceived. 
<br />
If I am to be duplicated and one of the copies tortured, I am worried, because this is subjectively 
<br />
equivalent to expecting torture with 1/2 probability. Post-duplication, I can only experience 
<br />
being one of the copies, and if I am not the one who is tortured, I am relieved, although I feel 
<br />
sorry for the other copy in the same way I might feel sory about anyone else who is suffering 
<br />
(maybe a bit more, given our shared past). This is no more than a description of how our 
<br />
psychology as beings who feel themselves to be embedded in linear time works. Arguments that 
<br />
this does not reflect the reality of the situation, that it does not make sense to consider I might 
<br />
&quot;become&quot; either copy prior to the duplication but only one copy after the duplication, do not change 
<br />
the way my brain forces me to feel about it. Lee Corbin on this list has argued that I should consider 
<br />
both copies as selves at all times, and perhaps we would evolve to think this way in a world where 
<br />
duplication was commonplace, but our brains aren't wired that way at present.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That is, once you are a conscious entity, you will follow a constrained branching

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; redefined at every branching point: the subjective probability of your next moment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Since the branches of the multiverse will never come to an abrupt stop, there will always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be a &quot;next moment&quot; and your stream of consciousness will never end. This the quantum

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think a lot of confusion comes from the use of pronounds such as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;you&quot;.  In the realm of multiverses, block time, and many-worlds, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; word &quot;you&quot; becomes much harder to define.  Consider time: since your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain is in a different state from one moment to the next how can you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be said to be the same person?  As you examine your branched selves in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more and more distantly branched universes, you will find a greater and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; greater discrepancy.  You could even imagine at the moment of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conception a different sperm may have fertalized you, would a copy of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;you&quot; with only one gene's difference still be enough like you to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you?  Where can the line be drawn as to who you are and who you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe that if one accepts that he or she will be conscious of their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective five minutes from now, they must accept that they will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceive conscious perspectives of their selves in other branched
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes.  If one accepts they will be conscious of and perceive these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other perspecties, they must also therefore be conscious of everyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else's perspective.  And if you accept that, then you must be conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of every conscious creatures perspective, in every point of time, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every branched history, in every universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To illustrate problems with personal identity, consider these thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. Imagine a technologically advanced race that created simulations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their brains that run on computers. If two brains were being simulated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the same computer by sharing time on the CPU, both individuals would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be conscious within the computer at the same time, but neither
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulated individual remembers being the other because the programs are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restricted from accessing each other's memory space. In the same way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those brains were simulated on the same computer, our brains are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computed by the physics of this universe. The universe experiences all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious perspectives simultaneously, yet we as individuals do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remember being conscious of these other perspectives since our memory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not shared.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. For a second example, consider that with each successive point in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time, a new copy of you is created in a slightly modified state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, if that state is constantly changing, you are essentially a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different person from one point in time to the next. If time is indeed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discrete, it should be even more apparent that we have no continuous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identity. If we have no continuous identity, by what means could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness be tied to one creature's perspective? There could be no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple rule to define whose brain state you will perceive from one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point in time to the next. All that could be said is that all conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspectives will be perceived, but no one could say who will perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. Imagine that using advanced technology, the current state of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; body was recorded and then an exact duplicate of you was constructed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Would you perceive the world from the viewpoint of your double? Common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense says no, but then consider this slightly different example: A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recording of your state is recorded, and then you are completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; destroyed. Every atom in your body is taken apart. Then the recording
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of your state is used to reconstruct you. Would you not have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brought back to life by this procedure? Would you not perceive the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; viewpoint of this recreation? In the first scenario we are less likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to claim we would perceive the duplicate's perspective, but it is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different from the second scenario where you are destroyed and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recreated. Now consider this even more bizarre scenario: Your state is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recorded, you are destroyed, and then 5 duplicates of yourself in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recorded state are created. Which one's perspective do you take? There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be only one answer: You take all of them.  The above scenario seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unlikely and you probably have doubts as to whether or not is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technically feasible. Nevertheless, duplicates of you are being created
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the time as the universe branches. In each case you end up in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slightly different universe, in some you end up slightly changed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yourself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To me this leaves two equally valid definitions for the term &quot;you&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Either it refers to one conscious observer's perspective, at one point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of time, in one universe, in one branched history line OR it could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refer to reality's single first-person perspective of itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For this reason I don't believe there can be a simple definition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;observers&quot;, there are only observer moments, but all are perceived.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no distinction between the consciousness that experiences any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular observer moment.  This is why I disagree with Bruno's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; version of comp which says quantum immortality is eternal agony;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considering all observer moments, reality's first-person experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; becomes more likely to perceive observer-moments of other individuals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than to continue along a branched history where one lives abnormally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long in a state of agony.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is why I see quantum mechancs as uncessesary anthropically, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; highly proabable given the disribution of observer moments among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes.  I think many-worlds is analagous to a mathematical function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or program) where each state mathematically defines many other states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Such a program is only marginally more complex than a program that has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a 1-to-1 mapping of states, but many more observers will find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves in a universe defined by such a program, as it defines so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many more states.  This is where I ran into the apparent conflict that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are conscious of perspectives that occur apprently early in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe's history, but I do like Stathis's point that any state we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceive has a probably very close to 0, and we should consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ourselves fortunate to be perceiving the states we currently find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ourselves in.
