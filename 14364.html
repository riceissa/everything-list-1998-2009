<br /><br />This is not the identity crisis question of why am I not that person
<br />
over there, nor is it circular, or solipsism (although if true it
<br />
could lead to a philosophy of solipsism).
<br />
<br />This is basic quantum theory applied to the macro-world. Ever since
<br />
Schrödinger disapprovingly amplified the uncertainty of atomic decay
<br />
and showed that quantum uncertainty extends to the macro-world, this
<br />
issue has been apparent. I am certain this &quot;observer over observed&quot;
<br />
issue has been discussed before. Someone has mentioned that John
<br />
Wheeler described this, describing a &quot;free floating&quot; observer that
<br />
dictates reality all the way back to the big bang. He just didn't
<br />
discuss the issue of pilots and puppets.
<br />
<br />In the instant I observe the contents of the box the uncertainty
<br />
collapses, however, the colleague who walks in the room one second
<br />
later in pilot form is not subject to my observation, for them the
<br />
outcome of the event is still uncertain until they open the lab door
<br />
and look in, at which point they branch into two futures defined by
<br />
different pasts, me in tears (I love cats) or the cat alive and me
<br />
happy. Their observation of me (tears or jeers) will correspond to
<br />
their observation of the cat. HOWEVER, the colleague I observe (their
<br />
observation) is predetermined (made measurably deterministic) by my
<br />
earlier observation. Their observation will correspond to my
<br />
observation, in a sense making them a puppet of the universe I
<br />
observe.
<br />
<br />It helps to imagine a person inside the box wearing a gas mask
<br />
watching the cat. They don't see a quantum uncertainty or a
<br />
probability cloud. But from your perspective outside the box the
<br />
indeterminacy of the cat as dead or alive now extends to what the
<br />
person in the mask observes. There are necessarily two copies of the
<br />
observer inside the box. When you open the box you connect to one of
<br />
them.
<br />
<br />Also, the cat experiment box can have two doors and be placed in
<br />
between two rooms, so that two observers in different rooms open their
<br />
own door at the same time to see the outcome of the event. The outcome
<br />
of one observer in one room has no influence on the outcome of the
<br />
other. But having observed an outcome, each observer interacts with
<br />
the colleague who observes the same outcome. This is a more
<br />
complicated example of the EPR paradox, i.e., spooky action at a
<br />
distance, or one outcome effecting a remote other outcome.
<br />
<br />The floating observer is constantly sampling a probability landscape
<br />
governed by the whole of what is possible for a given event or
<br />
situation. Each observation rules the entire scope of their o-region
<br />
by turning the uncertainty of infinite possibilities into a finite
<br />
observation. If lab personnel walk in every ten minutes each branches
<br />
into both dead-cat / live-cat time lines as they learn of the cats
<br />
demise. Same applies to what's behind every door in the macro-world.
<br />
Sub-atomic decisions add up and trace forward to extremely varied
<br />
possible worlds. Until we pick up and read the newspaper there is no
<br />
definite news. We still live with the uncertainty of history back to
<br />
the big bang every time we view deeper into the universe, or discover
<br />
other planets around stars. There isn't just one world out there, or
<br />
one history to select from, just as there isn't one future.
<br />
<br />Observations of what are naturally assumed to be other observers (how
<br />
they response to stimuli, behavior, belief systems, intelligence,
<br />
individual spontaneity) are inevitably subject to the same sampling
<br />
process which decides if the cyanide canister has been broken. There
<br />
of course might be a great deal of selection bias for various reasons,
<br />
in the same way what is observed corresponds to the laws of nature.
<br />
There is certainly room for Karma based upon the same symmetries that
<br />
dictate conservations, forces, laws and constants.
<br />
<br />So suppose we do put a colleague in Schrödinger's box instead of the
<br />
cat without the gas mask. The first sampling decides if they are dead
<br />
or alive when we open the box. A second sampling is of how they react
<br />
to having been put in the box and experimented on in a life or death
<br />
situation. For the survivor, there is a very wide but definite range
<br />
of possible reactions, anger, horror, crying, nervous breakdown,
<br />
hidden resentment, disinterest, objectivity, laughter, excitement,
<br />
exhilaration, enlightenment. Considering how a thousand different
<br />
colleagues would react, there are distinct probabilities, let's say
<br />
25% anger, 15% horror, 15% crying, 1% nervous breakdown, 8%
<br />
resentment, 1% disinterest, 2% scientific objectivity, 10% laughter,
<br />
17% excitement, another 3% are exhilarated, and wouldn't you know it,
<br />
just a meager 3% report experiencing enlightenment from their nde, or
<br />
64% negative, 3% neutral, and 33% positive. Pretending this is
<br />
accurate of what the observer experiences in others, the BIG question
<br />
I am wresting with is, do these same numbers describe how 1000 pilot
<br />
observers react. Could there possibly be a difference? Could there be
<br />
a difference between sampled behavior and the behavior of floating
<br />
pilots. Maybe observers are much more likely to react to situations in
<br />
a particular way. For example, maybe observers are more curious about
<br />
the world.
<br />
<br />This all becomes increasingly complicated and personal as we try to
<br />
localize the observer or consciousness, since our own bodies are
<br />
subject to quantum sampling. Most of the complications reduce to an
<br />
issue about the linearity of time. I don't know how the concept of
<br />
time can be maintained without some form of linearity, perhaps in the
<br />
background of space connecting objects, or linearity exists in the
<br />
observer or consciousness. Yet then here comes quantum mechanics and
<br />
splits up one's linear experience into states, and it seems we are
<br />
observing a movie film built of many individual 3D frames. As time
<br />
progresses particular frames are selected, or sampled, from the whole
<br />
of possible states.
<br />
<br />It is funny because we can write a letter for example, thinking it
<br />
will get to other pilots, as I am doing now, but we have to know then
<br />
that the response is made by quantum sampling. If we apply quantum
<br />
theory to the macro-world, we have to give up the idea that there are
<br />
single individuals in our environment who are continuously locked into
<br />
the one world we experience. Although it follows that the non-local
<br />
universe (the possible realm) is dictating what someone says and how
<br />
they react, at very least we are interacting with a living universe. I
<br />
have not suggested here that those person's who we observe are hollow
<br />
or not real. Not suggesting that at all. Rather we are interacting
<br />
more directly with the universe itself than we are used to imagining.
<br />
Of course some would describe this as the observer and God
<br />
interacting. I personally appreciate the idea of the Universe and God
<br />
being synonymous, and natural Karmic laws. But again, are puppets and
<br />
pilots existentially the same. Most recognize in a many worlds,
<br />
multiverse, or anthropic scenarios that two identical copies of a
<br />
given universe are the same universe. This to me is a simple
<br />
existential fact, so perhaps each observed person is identical to each
<br />
&quot;floating&quot; observer, so there would be no reason to differentiate.
<br />
This doesn't eliminate the sampling issue but it does with great
<br />
relief at least unite us together with other pilots.
