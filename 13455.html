<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible to correctly reason about cognitive systems at least well

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough to predict their behaviour to a useful degree and yet not care

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at all about what happens to them'.  But this is only pattern

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recognition and symbolic intelligence, *not* fully reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence.  Reflective intelligence involves additional

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representations enabling a system to *integrate* the aforementioned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstract knowledge (and experience it directly as qualia).    Without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this ability an AI would be unable to maintain a stable goal structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; under recursive self improvement and therefore would remain limited.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Are you saying that a system which has reflective intelligence would be able
<br />
to in a sense emulate the system it is studying, and thus experience a very
<br />
strong form of empathy? That's an interesting idea, and it could be that
<br />
very advanced AI would have this ability; after all, humans have the ability
<br />
for abstract reasoning which other animals almost completely lack, so why
<br />
couldn't there be a qualitative (or nearly so) rather than just a
<br />
quantitative difference between us and super-intelligent beings?
<br />
<br />However, what would be wrong with a super AI that just had large amounts of
<br />
pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning intelligence, but no emotions at
<br />
all? It could work as the ideal disinterested scientist, doing theoretical
<br />
physics without regard for its own or anyone else's feelings. You would
<br />
still have to say that it was super-intelligent, even though it it is an
<br />
idiot from the reflective intelligence perspective. It also would pose no
<br />
threat to anyone because all it wants to do and all it is able to do is
<br />
solve abstract problems, and in fact I would feel much safer around this
<br />
sort of AI than one that has real power and thinks it has my best interests
<br />
at heart.
<br />
<br />Secondly, I don't see how the ability to fully empathise would help the AI
<br />
improve itself or maintain a stable goal structure. Adding memory and
<br />
processing power would bring about self-improvement, perhaps even recursive
<br />
self-improvement if it can figure out how to do this more effectively with
<br />
every cycle, and yet it doesn't seem that this would require the presence of
<br />
any other sentient beings in the universe at all, let alone the ability to
<br />
empathise with them.
<br />
<br />Finally, the majority of evil in the world is not done by psychopaths, but
<br />
by &quot;normal&quot; people who are aware that they are causing hurt, may feel guilty
<br />
about causing hurt, but do it anyway because there is a competing interest
<br />
that outweighs the negative emotions.
