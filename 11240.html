<br />
Those who have read my past threads and seen the summary of my
<br />
metaphysics analysis (Mathematico-Cognition Reality Theory-MCRT) know
<br />
that I think that time is an irreducible property of reality and my
<br />
analysis suggests that even Barbour's configuration space (Platonia,
<br />
the Multiverse whatever you want to call it) isn't truly timeless.
<br />
<br />The trouble with a timeless multiverse lies in the notion of 'the space
<br />
of all mathematical possibilities'.  Unfortunately the notion of 'all
<br />
mathematical possibilities co-existing' is highly suspect, precisely
<br />
because it's so ill-defined.  There are some things in math for which
<br />
the quantifier 'existence' is suspect....   infinite sets in
<br />
particular.  If 'the space of all possibilities' is itself still
<br />
evolving as I suggested, then Platonia would not be timeless as Barbour
<br />
(and many here on this list) thinks.
<br />
<br />Another reason for suspecting that Platonia isn't truly timeless lies
<br />
in the fact that Barbour's Platonia is an attempt to totally remove
<br />
'boundary conditions' from science.
<br />
Note that no attempts to remove boundary conditions from science have
<br />
ever succeeded.  Why should Barbour's theory suddenly be the exception?
<br />
&nbsp;There's a very good reason for defining boundary conditions... because
<br />
without an 'inside and 'outside' to an entity, one simply cannot
<br />
analyze it as a dynamical system.  That's why no attempt to remove
<br />
boundary conditions from science has ever succeeded.
<br />
<br />Now when the 'system' under disussion is 'all of reality' it may seem
<br />
tautological that 'there exists nothing outside reality because reality
<br />
is everything that exists'.... but... well... this so called tautology
<br />
is not neccesserily true!  The trouble lies in the definition of a
<br />
'thing'.  If there are incomprehensible things, then it may actually
<br />
make sense to talk about them existing 'outside reality'.  Standard
<br />
philosophy only recognizes one quantifier for 'existence' but perhaps
<br />
thre are several different notions.  Again, Barbour's attempt to
<br />
'remove an outside to reality' also prevents us from analyzing reality
<br />
as a dynamical system, because any system analysis requires us to
<br />
define system boundaries and external actors.  Again, no attempts to
<br />
remove boundary conditions from science have ever succeeded.
<br />
<br />Why?  Because Barbour's entire notion of a timeless Platonia is
<br />
misguided.  It's an attempt to 'objectify everything, to imagine that
<br />
'all of reality' can somehow be comprehensible to a rational mind.  But
<br />
why should this be true?  Why shouldn't there exist incomprehensible
<br />
things?  Again, we have examples from mathematics...such as
<br />
uncomputable numbers...which appear to suggest that there do exist
<br />
incomphensible things.  And I propose that the existence of
<br />
incomphrensible things enables us to establish boundary conditions for
<br />
all of reality and refutes Barbour's notion of timlessness.
<br />
<br />So here's my alternative to a timeless Platonia:
<br />
<br />What I suggest is that we should take the
<br />
comprehensible/incomprehensible division as the boundary condition for
<br />
'reality'.  We then define TWO different 'existence' quantifiers.
<br />
<br />Let:
<br />
<br />'eXistenZ'  = everything which exists which is in principle
<br />
comphrensible
<br />
<br />and let
<br />
<br />'existence' = everything which exists, including INCOMPREHENSIBLE
<br />
things.
<br />
<br />Then:  'eXistenZ' is a sub-set of 'existence', but all minds can take
<br />
'eXistenZ' to be reality, because only this part of existence is
<br />
actually comprehensible to them.
<br />
<br />The advantage of this is that it enables us to apply ordinary system
<br />
analysis to eXistenZ.  eXistenZ does have a boundary and therefore 'an
<br />
inside and outside'.  And unlike Barbour's scheme, eXistenZ is not
<br />
timeless.
<br />
<br />Now one might try to argue that it's pointless to imagine
<br />
'incomprehensible things' because they can have no comprehsible effect
<br />
on reality.  But the argument isn't true.  Reason could still tell us
<br />
which things were incomprensible (for an analogy to this, note that we
<br />
DO have comptable proofs that there exist incomputable numbers) and
<br />
further more, incomprehensible things could still have *comprehensible*
<br />
effects on eXistenZ and therefore they could be referenced indirectly,
<br />
through these comprehensible effects.
<br />
<br />Now to summarize my analysis again:
<br />
<br />Start by defining the boundary between incomprehensible and
<br />
comprehensible things as the boundary condition for 'reality'.
<br />
Comprehensible (in principle) things are inside reality... call this
<br />
eXistenZ.  And the incomprehensible things are outside reality.
<br />
Existence in it's totality.
<br />
<br />Next I pointed out that we *could* actually reference the
<br />
incomprehensibles indirectly - because incomprehensible things *can*
<br />
have comprehensible effects on eXistenZ.
<br />
<br />Then we have the basis for a new reality theory!
<br />
<br />*Identify the incomprehensibles
<br />
*Reference them indirectly through their comprehensible effects on
<br />
eXistenZ
<br />
*Apply standard system analysis:
<br />
<br />let:
<br />
<br />The effects of the incomprehensibles on eXistenZ be the 'inputs'
<br />
The 'system' which is reality is of course eXistenZ
<br />
And the system 'outputs' are how the incomprehensibles are changed by
<br />
their interaction with eXistenZ
<br />
<br />So:
<br />
<br />Incomprehensibles &gt;&gt;(input)  eXistenZ  (ouput)&gt;&gt;Incomprehensibles
<br />
<br />In my MCRT analysis I listed 27 fundamental metaphysical actors.  I
<br />
believe that the 'incomprehensible things' are what I defined as the
<br />
intrinsic 'Matrix' properties.  There were 3 of these, which I defined
<br />
as follows:
<br />
<br />*Energy* -       Capacity to do work
<br />
*Volition* -       Capacity to make choices
<br />
*Information* -  A variance, or 'difference'.
<br />
<br />Now, how, you may ask, can these three things actually be
<br />
'incomprehensible' when I've just defined them? ;)  I point out again
<br />
that incomprehensible things could be referenced indirectly by their
<br />
comprehensible effects.  And I maintain that's all of any definitions
<br />
of these three things actually do.  After all: have you ever *seen*
<br />
Energy, Volition and Information directly?  Never!  All definitions of
<br />
these three things have only ever referenced them indirectly.... by
<br />
their comprehensible effects!   So these three things *could* logically
<br />
be incomprehensible things.
<br />
<br />If they are, we can consider them as the inputs and outputs of the
<br />
eXistenZ system.  Here's my reality theory at this point:
<br />
<br />Energy, Volition, Information
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;(Inputs) eXistenZ (Outputs) &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
Energy, Volition, Information
<br />
<br />This system analysis has the advantage that we still have boundary
<br />
conditions as science requires, and we have a possible means to define
<br />
the purpose of eXistenZ!  Or to be more precise, we could, if you like,
<br />
define a utility function for reality.
<br />
<br />The utility function (or 'purpose') of reality, would consist of taking
<br />
in Energy, Volition and Information , transforming them in some way
<br />
(inside the 'eXistenZ' system) then outputting the transformed Energy,
<br />
Volition and Information to the external environment (the wider
<br />
'existence').
<br />
<br />eXistenZ itself could still be some sort of Platonia or multiverse,
<br />
however it wouldn't be timeless.  The advantages of this scheme over
<br />
Barbour's:
<br />
<br /><br />*The scheme does not try to eliminate boundary conditions
<br />
<br />*The scheme allows for incomprehensible things and does not try to
<br />
objectify all of reality inside a comprehensible theory
<br />
<br />*The scheme allows us to apply standard system analysis to 'reality'
<br />
<br />*The scheme provides a way to define a purpose or utility function for
<br />
reality
<br />
<br /><br />I'd say the scheme suggested here has the advantage over Barbour's
<br />
timeless Platonia  on all counts!
