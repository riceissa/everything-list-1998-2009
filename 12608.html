<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Searle's theory is that consciousness is a result of actual brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; activity, not Turing emulable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Nooooo....... True: Searle's theory is that consciousness is a result
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of brain activity, but nowhere does Searle pretend that brain is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; turing emulable. He just implicitly assume there is a notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; actuality that no simulation can render, but does not address the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; question of emulability. Then Searle is known for confusing level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; description (this I can make much more precise with the Fi and Wi, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with the very important difference between computability (emulability)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and provability.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Searle seems to accept that CT implies the brain is Turing emulable, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not believe that such an emulation would capture consciousness any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more than a simulation of a thunderstorm will make you wet. Thus, a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that could pass the Turing Test would be a zombie.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. It confirms my point. And Searle is coherent, he has to refer to a 
<br />
notion of &quot;physically real&quot; for his non-computationalism to proceed.
<br />
He may be right. Now his naturalistic explanation of consciousness 
<br />
seems rather ad hoc.
<br />
But all what I say is that IF comp is correct, we have to abandon 
<br />
physicalism.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Searle is not a computationalist - does not believe in strong AI - but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe in weak AI. Penrose does not believe in weak AI either.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. In that way Searle is &quot;not even wrong&quot;.
<br />
<br />&lt;snip: see my preceding post to you&gt;
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If there are more arbitrary sequences than third person computations, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does it follow that arbitrary sequences are not computations?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I guess I miss something (or you miss your statement?). Is it not 
<br />
obvious that &quot;if there are more arbitrary sequences than third person 
<br />
computations, then some (even most) arbitrary sequences are not 
<br />
computations&quot;.
<br />
<br />Let us define what is a computable infinite sequence. A sequence is 
<br />
computable if there is a program (a machine) which generates 
<br />
specifically the elements of that sequence in the right order, and 
<br />
nothing else. The set of programs is enumerable, but by Cantor theorem 
<br />
the set of *all* sequences is not enumerable. So the set of computable 
<br />
sequences is almost negligible compared to the arbitrary one.
<br />
<br />Does it mean there is no program capable of generating a non computable 
<br />
sequence?
<br />
<br />Not at all. A universal dovetailer generates all the infinite 
<br />
sequences. The computable one, (that is, those nameable by special 
<br />
purpose, specific,  program) and the non computable one (how? by 
<br />
generating them all).
<br />
<br />I give another example of the same subtlety. One day a computer 
<br />
scientist told me that it was impossible to write a program of n bits 
<br />
capable of generating an incompressible finite sequence or string of 
<br />
length m with m far greater than n. I challenge him.
<br />
Of course, what is true is that there is no program of n bit capable of 
<br />
generating that m bits incompressible string, AND ONLY, SPECIFICALLY,  
<br />
THAT STRING.
<br />
But it is really easy to write a little  program capable of generating 
<br />
that incompressible string by letting him generate ALL strings: the 
<br />
program COUNT is enough.
<br />
<br />I think this *is* the main line of the *everything* list, or a 
<br />
miniature version of it if you want.
<br />
<br />Now, when you run the UD, as far as you keep the discourse in the third 
<br />
person mode, everything remains enumerable, even in the limit.
<br />
But from the first person point of view, a priori the uncountable 
<br />
stories, indeed generated by the UD, take precedence on the computable 
<br />
one: thus the continua of white rabbits. This results from the lack of 
<br />
any possibility from the first person point of view to locate herself 
<br />
into UD*. Somehow the first person belongs to 2^aleph_zero histories at 
<br />
the start.
<br />
<br />A similar &quot;explosion of stories&quot; appears with quantum mechanics, except 
<br />
that here the physicist as an easy answer: white rabbits and Potter 
<br />
universe are eliminated through phase randomization (apparently).
<br />
<br />I am not satisfied by this answer if only because my motivation is to 
<br />
understand where that quantum comes from.
<br />
<br />Is complex randomization of histories the only way to force normal 
<br />
nature into the shorter path?
<br />
<br />Well, my point is that if we take comp seriously, we have to justify 
<br />
the absence of rabbits from computer science. In case too much white 
<br />
rabbits remains, comp would be false, and this would be an argument in 
<br />
favor of materialism. But, when you interview a universal machine on 
<br />
this question you can realize at least that this question is far from 
<br />
being settled.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Hope you don't mind I continue to comment your post tomorrow,
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
