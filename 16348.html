</em><br />
<br />This is simply the observation that the action of hallucinogens on
<br />
consciousness is often dismissed as an abberration and the potential
<br />
scientific benefits from their objective study are therefore lost.  
<br />
<br />Witness the popularity of the term &quot;psychotomimetic&quot; until fairly
<br />
recently to automatically classify these effects as something akin to
<br />
temporary mental illness, or the determination in the medico-legal
<br />
context that all use is &quot;abuse&quot;.
<br />
<br />What is ignored is that any theory of consciousness, or other theories
<br />
that rely on the concept of consciousness as part of a chain of
<br />
reasoning, must also be able to explain not only &quot;typical&quot; consciousness
<br />
but also the quantitative and qualitative nature of altered states of
<br />
consciousness.  These altered states may be arrived at in a variety of
<br />
ways (meditation, religious practices, psychoactive substances), but the
<br />
use of drugs to achieve them appears to be the way most amenable to
<br />
controlled, scientific study.  Yet there is very little of this
<br />
happening, and what studies are in progress are aimed at establishing
<br />
their potential health benefits (MDMA for PTSD sufferers, for example.)
<br />
<br />This is not a bad goal in and of itself, but here we are trying to
<br />
understand this enormous mystery of consciousness, and focusing on a
<br />
narrow subset of conscious experience as the data to reason from.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Humans, properly fed, clothed, looked after,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; educated will ALWAYS seek to alter their consciousness somehow by  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; using substances.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, history bears this out.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Millions of people drink coffee which has a powerful chemical impact  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but nobody ever shows concern for their 1-pov experiences. Why the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; special pleading for drugs? It's all just substance of one kind or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another.
</em><br />
<br />Well, my earlier post in particular was singling out a specific class of
<br />
substances--hallucinogens potent enough to not just alter or distort
<br />
existing qualia, but to replace the user's entire sensorium with novel
<br />
qualia, and by some reports, qualia in novel sensory modalities.  People
<br />
report experiencing being in completely different locations, witnessing
<br />
and participating in complex, detailed events, with a subjective sense
<br />
that they are as real or even more real than what they experience in the
<br />
absence of the effects of the drug.
<br />
<br />Some hallucinogens go even further than this, and introduce an element
<br />
of amnesia for semantic and episodic memories, such that users report
<br />
the experience of &quot;forgetting that I had taken a drug, that I was human,
<br />
or even what being human meant.&quot;  Five to twenty minutes later they
<br />
return to baseline and report feeling completely &quot;normal&quot; again.
<br />
<br />Frankly, what astonishes me, is that these altered states even exist at
<br />
all.  It would be reasonable to think that &quot;disrupting&quot; the physical
<br />
processes which give rise to consciousness would merely cause it to
<br />
fail; i.e., cause a loss of consciousness.  Instead, in some cases, we
<br />
have these fully immersive experiences with recurring, consistent
<br />
themes, well structured, with content of unknown origin, and a lack of
<br />
any relationship to sensory data streaming into the brain from the
<br />
&quot;outside.&quot;
<br />
<br />Yeah, I think their might be something worth investigating here.
