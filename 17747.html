<br />If our goal is a criminal justice system that is rational, ethical,
<br />
and efficient, then do you think that it helps or hurts to frame the
<br />
discussion in terms of traditional words like morality,
<br />
responsibility, and free will - with all of their religious and
<br />
pre-scientific connotations and baggage?
<br />
<br />So, looking at your original Dennett quote:
<br />
<br />&quot;If you make yourself small enough you can avoid responsibility for everything.&quot;
<br />
<br />So apparently what he is saying is that it is his evaluation that
<br />
anyone who concludes that determinism precludes free-will is most
<br />
likely making that conclusion BECAUSE they themselves wish to avoid
<br />
being subjected to positive or negative reinforcement whose intent is
<br />
to produce optimal social conditioning.
<br />
<br />BUT, if I am in fact supportive of the rational, ethical, and
<br />
efficient application of positive and negative reinforcements whose
<br />
intent is to induce socially optimal behavior (even if I am the one
<br />
being targeted by these inducements), BUT I still don't believe in
<br />
free will or moral responsibility in the sense that those words are
<br />
traditionally used (e.g., to justify retribution, instead of only
<br />
deterrence and rehabilitation), then haven't I shown Dennett to be
<br />
wrong?
<br />
<br />I think the American criminal justice system is nowhere near rational,
<br />
ethical, or efficient...and I think that Dennett's compatiblist word
<br />
games are more likely to hinder attempts to correct this than to help.
<br />
&nbsp;And the same goes for other areas, like addressing poverty and
<br />
economic inequality.
<br />
<br />Not because Dennett's ENTIRE system leads to bad things, but because
<br />
if you just look at parts of it without grasping the full context,
<br />
then it seems to uphold the status quo approach of retribution first,
<br />
deterrence second, and rehabilitation third if at all.  And the idea
<br />
that the system is fine, and that people *only* have themselves to
<br />
blame for their poverty or other undesirable situation.
<br />
<br />And of course, as Stathis pointed out, Dennett isn't the first
<br />
compatiblist, or the only compatibilist...but he's by far the most
<br />
vocal and prominent.
<br />
<br />So...we've wandered way off topic.  But Dennett really irks me.
