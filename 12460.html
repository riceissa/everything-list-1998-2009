Mark:
<br />
although I still owe you my promised response to your note addressed to me
<br />
lately,
<br />
I join your 'impertinence' in expanding your question:
<br />
The 'meaning' of WHAT are you talking about? You said &quot;IT IS&quot;  - existence,
<br />
value, etc. etc.??? - which one did you 'pick' as the subject of that
<br />
&quot;meaning&quot;?  It is hard to agree in the meaning of a  not-agreed upon
<br />
subject.
<br />
From remarks (re: Mark) I guess you emphasise bodily functions, (from the
<br />
hippocampus through sleep to the Australian Tax Office) or maybe the
<br />
churning of bio-molecules within their assumed membrane boundaries? I have
<br />
been thinking about such puzzles for 30 years more than you, without
<br />
conclusive decision, so I still feel open to listen. There must be more to
<br />
it than what we think, because as I look at the history of human thinking,
<br />
subsequent ERAS always spoke about more (and different) than ANY preceding
<br />
ones. Since I don't see the End of the World attached to today's date, I
<br />
assume that our today's ideas are also not the final and complete ones. We
<br />
(as the grandkids of our grandkids and thereafter) have additional stuff to
<br />
learn.
<br />
So what is that contemporary and erroneous idea of &quot;life&quot; you are talking
<br />
about?
<br />
You don't seem tome as a heritage-adorer who cherishes only the ideas of
<br />
last century(s?). Not even further back, say all the way back to Plato
<br />
(OOPS!).
<br />
Then again &quot;MEANING&quot; is tricky: I could condone a descriptive formulation
<br />
about how origination resulted in phenomena we observe (right or wrong), but
<br />
most people think &quot;goal-wise&quot; and look for a (final??) purpose, which IMO;
<br />
lies in a dissipation of all.
<br />
<br />So: how sorry I am to say so: I cannot scribble down the 'perfect' answer to
<br />
the 'Subject' of this widely and spreadoutly branched thread, unless you
<br />
disclose the subject of that 'meaning' you all are seeking. (Even then I
<br />
don't promise...)
<br />
<br />Hal Ruhl gave an answer on 'life', but he seems to have merged too deeply
<br />
into the figment (sorry: no offense meant) of physical concepts he uses.
<br />
Earlier he was a 'more free' thinker. Now that he 'organized' his
<br />
theoretical stuff, he seemingly needed more of the establishment-science. or
<br />
at least their expressions - to express himself for the academic crowd.
<br />
<br />I am not talking about THIS biosphere and the physiology/evolution of
<br />
Darwinian restrictions, I like to generalize beyond the models available to
<br />
date. And try to leave open a slot for things beyond human mental
<br />
restrictions as unknowable uncertain potentials (not even possibilities,
<br />
which would be within our domain). Extract some characteristics that could
<br />
pertain to &quot;life&quot; as we don't know it,  boil it down to some applicability
<br />
beyond knowable circumstances and look for whatever our feeble m\ind  can
<br />
make out of it. I am not yet there, maybe in another 2-300 years of study?
<br />
<br />Have a good year and then more
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have to be very impertinent here and try to draw your attention to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something you are just not getting.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is NO ultimate answer to the meaning of life, the universe and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything except that IT IS, and you are here to take part in it and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observe yourself and others doing so. Existence is the source of value,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed it is the essence of value.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not in the habit of putting myself forward, but here I believe the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideas are what count and I believe the issue is very important. I mean at 55
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yo I know I have already attained 'old fart' status for most people I meet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But one thing I know for sure is that, just like me, YOU are not going to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; live for ever. As most of you seem a fair bit smarter than me I assume that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can/will mostly choose how you spend your limited lifetime. Choose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wisely 'cause it's a once-off.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I really do think that before any of you get much older you should take a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; VERY careful look at what I have been writing here. Have a look also at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; common meanings for the word physics [samples included below]. If you don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then I think you are going to spend the rest of your lives chasing shadows,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and end up a bunch of old men sitting on the cyberspace equivalent of a park
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bench, STILL chewing over the same old problem! Of course, if that is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you want then that's fine. But don't say you weren't warned!  :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact is, being conscious is inherently paradoxical, and there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; escape from the paradox, just like there is no escape from the universe -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; until you die that is. Your impressions, perceptions, feelings, intuitions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc. of being here now [where you are of course] is what it is like to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the updating of the model of self in the world which you brain is constantly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructing all the time you are awake. When you sleep there are times when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough of the model gets evoked that you have a dream that you can remember.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The paradox is that for most of the time we assume that this awareness -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, call it what you like - IS the world, i.e. what it is like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be 'me' here now, whereas in fact it is only what it is like to be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model of 'me' here now. This does not mean that you don't exist; you do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist, and you must pay taxes in partial payment for the privilege, until
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you die that is. [I work for the Australian Taxation Office so I know about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these things :-] There is however a lot more stuff going on in your brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than is actually explicitly involved in your consciousness of the moment, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far as I can see there are usually a couple or triple of very sophisticated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tasks going on in parallel but swapping in and out of focussed attention as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needs and priorities of the moment require. There are often also several
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other tasks simmering away like pots on the back burners of your stove.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe it is the hippocampus which maintains the tasks in process
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through re-entrant signalling to the relevant cortical and other areas which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; embody the salient features of the constructs involved. Binding is achieved
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through re-entrant signalling of resonant wave forms such that each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construct EXISTS as a dynamic logical entity able to maintain its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure sufficiently to prevent certain other things happening and to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; invoke through association [or perhaps through reaction to patterns of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inhibition, whatever] other constructs as necessary. Note the key word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'exists'. The energy is supplied through the work done as the neurons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; re-establish the resting potential of their cell membranes. And here I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should point out that most of the posts on this list do not seem to talk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much about structure, and yet it is the spatia-temporal structures of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interacting cell assemblies which embody the patterns of information which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make muscles move. Think about it! This is what you should be really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concentrating on, because you and I are NOTHING if our muscles can't be made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to move in exactly the right way and the right time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know I have written 'I believe' up there a few times, but if you wish I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can go hunting for you and find a bunch of references that back up what I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying. I do not have access to pay-as-you-go academic journals, so I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been gleaning ideas and items of interest about this for the last couple of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decades. I put it to you that if you seriously think I am wrong, then you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a moral duty to show me on the basis of clear and unambiguous empirical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence where it is that I am wrong about this. Because otherwise it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just a matter of opinion and speculation, in which case mine is as good as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anybody else's that I have seen on consciousness related lists and what I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposing is not in contradiction to any good evidence that I have heard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about. I think William of Occam would be more than happy with what I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; putting forward.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope no one is offended by this. Is they are, sorry! But time returns
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for no one and you do not have for ever, just all the time there is - for

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you. That is what entropy is about.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be  made that matter could be relevant for consciousness. (I see Peter

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jones makes a similar remark).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  &lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You mean a quantum superposition? (then with comp such a superposition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really describes an infinity of immaterial computational histories in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each page contains a finite amount of ink. Well it is rather similar with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the quantum mechanical superposition).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only sense in which (both with quantum field theory AND with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp-physics) I can accept an infinite information on a black page is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related to renormalization problem, spurious infinite energies ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then why to assume a physical world with all those infinities when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp forces us to deal with already enough infinities?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You loss me I'm afraid. Are you trying to save both comp AND the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenience? We have not yet derive the whole of physics from comp, but we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can already expect the &quot;mind-matter&quot; mapping to be something quite complex.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For me it is obvious that to a mind state there will be an infinity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;computational states and histories&quot; going through that mind state. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reverse is harder because we are unable (assuming comp) to singularize a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;comp-physical states&quot;. Physical states *are* already first person plural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (inter-subjective) appearances emerging from the gluing and overlapping of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinities of computations (and thus immaterial(*)). Unless I am wrong,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standard computationalism is flawed, like both the monist and dualist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doctrine of materialism are flawed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would be wrong to say that comp makes materialism refutated, but for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar reason that it is wrong to say that bilogy has proves that vitalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is refutated. But biology has made vitalism explanation-useless, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalism makes materialism explantion useless too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course it remains the possibility that comp is incorrect. If comp is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true, we have to live with that possibility forever.
