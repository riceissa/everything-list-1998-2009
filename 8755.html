<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taste) for direct perception of mathematics.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This notion sounds almost as outrageous as my recently retracted  
<br />
notion that music is *heard mathematics*. OK then, I'll make one more  
<br />
attempt - could music be the sensory modality by which we perceive  
<br />
mathematical entities? Since Bruno is currently injecting our  
<br />
thinking with a good dose of ancient Greek &quot;wisdom&quot; could we not also  
<br />
mention Boethius in this context with his &quot;harmony of the spheres&quot;?  
<br />
Boethius was actually a Roman patrician who was a super Greek scholar  
<br />
of the 6th century. Actually, Pythagoras discovered (or invented)  
<br />
this idea. A part of the cosmology of the Pythagorean is this  
<br />
extraordinary theory of the &quot;harmony of the spheres&quot;, which caught  
<br />
later generations in the ancient world and the Renaissance.
<br />
<br />It is generally accepted by scholars that Pythagoras himself was the  
<br />
first to formulate that concept, which reflects the whole cosmic plan  
<br />
and showed the intimate connection between the laws of mathematics  
<br />
and of music.
<br />
Aristotle characterizes the Pythagorean as having reduced all things  
<br />
to numbers or elements of numbers, and described the whole universe  
<br />
as &quot;a Harmonia and a number&quot;.
<br />
<br />Aristotle continued: &quot;They said too that the whole universe is  
<br />
constructed according to a musical scale. This is what he means to  
<br />
indicate by the words &quot;and that the whole universe is a number&quot;,  
<br />
because it is both composed of numbers and organized numerically and  
<br />
musically. For the distances between the bodies revolving round the  
<br />
centre are mathematically proportionate; some move faster and some  
<br />
more slowly; the sound made by the slower bodies in their movement is  
<br />
lower in pitch, and that of the faster is higher; hence these  
<br />
separate notes, corresponding to the ratios of the distances, make  
<br />
the resultant sound concordant.
<br />
<br />Now number, they said, is the source of this harmony, and so they  
<br />
naturally posited number as the principle on which the heaven and the  
<br />
whole universe depended.&quot;
<br />
<br />Well - it's surely not such a big jump from this notion to the main  
<br />
topic of this list.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We could imagine some super-intelligence that possessed this  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ability to directly perceive mathematics.  What would this super- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence 'see' ?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Or *hear* - the architecture of reality as a symphonic musical  
<br />
texture with an infinity of voices/instruments all producing/ 
<br />
generating the laws of physics, the immediate revelation of which are  
<br />
the heavenly bodies in their orbits. Music surely is a form of  
<br />
computation - it has an origin in &quot;pure thought&quot; and an outcome as a  
<br />
hard physical reality in the form of compression sound waves. A super  
<br />
intellect might be able to hear mathematics as music, indeed the very  
<br />
notion of the &quot;harmony of the spheres&quot; seems to suggest this.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (SNIP)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For one thing:  Are platonic mathematical entities really static  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and timeless like platonist philosophers say?  What if platonic  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical entities can 'change state' somehow ?  What if they're  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamic?
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are now describing essentially a musical phenomenon. Music is  
<br />
dynamic, it modulates and self-references and develops from state to  
<br />
state.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And what if the *movement* of platonic mathematics entities *are*  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Qualia (conscious experiences).  Are there any mathematical truths  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which may be time indexed (time dependent)?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Music is of course &quot;time-dependent&quot;. The canvas that music uses *is*  
<br />
time. I see great room for discussion of your 3-dimensional time view  
<br />
vis a vis musical time-frames. For example the &quot;Art of Fugue&quot; (Bach's  
<br />
method of composition) stipulates 4 quasi-independent voices or  
<br />
melodies which each exist in their own right and are perfectly  
<br />
satisfying on their own, yet somehow create an emergent, holistic,  
<br />
greater sense of unity when all combined ie. played simultaneously.  
<br />
Each of these melodies is largely unaware of the other three yet  
<br />
dovetails its own sense with the sense of the others. This is what  
<br />
creates the sense of *depth* in musical textures. The experience of  
<br />
listening to music correctly (without talking over the top of it or  
<br />
munching on your dinner) gives the impression of a physical object  
<br />
which you nevertheless cannot see. I would suggest that whatever this  
<br />
object is has been described by the musical process and cannot be  
<br />
perceived in any other way.
<br />
<br /><br />I hope nobody gets upset by my reintroducing this idea. Once more, a  
<br />
bit of a provocation to &quot;up the ante&quot; of the discussion.
<br />
<br />Regards to all
<br />
<br />Kim Jones
