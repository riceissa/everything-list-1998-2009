Hi,
<br />
----- Original Message ----- 
<br />
From: &quot;Pete Carlton&quot; &lt;pmcarlton.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Greetings;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this reply has taken some time...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't quite agree with your point of view, and the reason is maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; similar to our disagreement in my statement: &quot;It is not useful to talk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about 1st person experiences in 3rd person terms, since when we do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that we lose the very thing that we want to study.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you're right; this is the central disagreement.  To spell it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out:  I do not believe the 1st person/3rd person distinction is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental.  That is, I think that once you've explained what a system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does (and how it does it), you've explained everything.  Consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is simply a complicated set of behavioral dispositions, which can in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle be explained from an objective, 3rd-person standpoint; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;1st person&quot; viewpoint is just a description, a way that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; naturally occurs to us to put things, because of our psychology
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (biology).
</em><br />
<br />It seems a fundamental disagreement indeed. Let us try to discuss
<br />
about it a little bit...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When you said earlier that:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   &quot;In a materialistic framework, ' I ' am a bunch of atoms. These atoms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen to constitute a system that has self-referential qualities that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we call consciousness.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I took you to be agreeing with me on my view of consciousness.  But I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think a difference is highlighted here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't need to point out who ' I ' am. I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; concerned with my first-person experiences, and that is easy to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; determine without even gaining acces to the other entities who look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What, exactly, are these &quot;first-person experiences&quot;? Are they really so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; easy to determine?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say that whatever they are, they contain no information on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether you are Eric01 or Eric02.  We know that these completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specified entities do exist, but since Eric01 has no way of knowing he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is in fact Eric01, it does not matter what he experiences; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference between Eric01 and Eric02 is not a difference for Eric.
</em><br />
<br />Suppose I am going to make an experiment to determine the
<br />
z-component of a spin-1/2 particle. There are two possibilities: 1/2,-1/2.
<br />
Let us forget about all other particles that are changing in the universe
<br />
for the sake of the argument.
<br />
So Eric01 is the one who measured 1/2. Eric 02 measured -1/2. They
<br />
have had completely different experiences. Each one can say: I could
<br />
have experienced (-1/2,1/2) but I did not. I actually measured (1/2,-1/2).
<br />
If he knows about the multiverse, he might wonder that the universe split
<br />
when he measured this event, and some copy of him measured the other
<br />
outcome. But that does not change the fact that he can tell what outcome
<br />
he DID measure. You could now say: &quot;But there is no tag or anything
<br />
telling who is 01 or who is 02&quot;. In fact, I could beforehand decide that
<br />
if I measure 1/2, I will put a tag in my forehead written: 01. And that I
<br />
would put a tag written 02 otherwise. The difference between Eric01
<br />
and Eric02 is now manifest!
<br />
<br />But we are placing too much emphasis on Eric's actual measurement.
<br />
Now suppose Eric is sitting in his lab unaware of whatever is going on in
<br />
the particle beam hitting the detector. A friend of his knows of his
<br />
wonderings about personality and decides to play a game with him.
<br />
If he (the friend) measures spin 1/2, he will place a tag on his back
<br />
written 01 or 02 respectively. The difference between Eric01 and Eric02
<br />
is again manifest. Nevertheless, Eric01/02 are unaware of it.
<br />
<br />Now let's get rid of any conscious awareness.
<br />
The spin1/2 particle has been detected, but no one knows. Nevertheless,
<br />
the universe has split, and - in principle - Eric could have detected the
<br />
particle, and he could get to the same conclusion about how the outcome
<br />
could have been different. The fact that he did not actually measure it
<br />
does not imply that his universe is not different from the universe where
<br />
his copy is. No one can say that Eric01 and Eric02 are indeed the same
<br />
person just because they do not know which one they are. Even if their
<br />
universe is different only for the state of a particle!
<br />
<br />Now suppose Eric placed a bet with his pal Pete. If the measurement
<br />
comes out 1/2, Eric will pay him a 6-pack of beer. Otherwise Pete will
<br />
pay for Eric. The particle is measured, the universe split. In one of them,
<br />
Eric is sad and thirsty. For Eric01, the outcome was not good, and
<br />
even though Pete comes up and say: &quot;Cheer up! In another universe
<br />
you are drinking beer!&quot; that does not represent any relief on his thirst.
<br />
He can only wish he was the other one.
<br />
(And this is seeming particularly awful to me right now, since my
<br />
air-conditioner is broken and it is really hot in Rio today).
<br />
Now what sense could there be for Eric01 to wish he was the other
<br />
one if Pete insists that he is both? Is that just Eric's shortmindedness
<br />
or does it say something about the nature of the self?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hal Finney's thought experiment about the 2 identical computers is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right on, I think.  You have 2 AI programs running in lockstep.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nothing in the programs' experiences can tell them which program they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are (let's say each computer has a serial number on the outside; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is completely inaccessible to the programs running on them).  Now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I tell both programs that I'm going to turn off the machine labeled
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;01&quot; and leave &quot;02&quot; running.  Our intuitions now point in different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directions here.. I do not think it's meaningful here for a program to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider which computer it's running on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You would ask the next question:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;If you were one of the programs, what would you expect to happen?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whereas I would ask it:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;If you were the set of these 2 programs, what would you expect to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen?&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Suppose that before being turned off, the AI will feel a brief but
<br />
extreme pain. I imagine the AI sitting there, unconcerned by the
<br />
prospect that one of them will be turned off, since he thinks that
<br />
he is both, and he will survive anyway. Then Hal comes up
<br />
and presses the button. For a second, the turned off program will
<br />
wide open his virtual eyes, and silently shout &quot;FUC...!&quot; :)
<br />
<br />But playing with death and AI's just makes the task harder. Let us first
<br />
come to a conclusion on the easier problem.
<br />
In face of my example, you would ask the question: &quot;if you were the set
<br />
of the two Eric's in the example, how thirsty would you expect to be?&quot;
<br />
Your question does not make sense, I cannot answer it.
<br />
I, on the other hand, would ask: &quot;if you were one of the two Pete's,
<br />
how thirsty would you expect to be?&quot;
<br />
And you could answer: &quot;50% probability that I am thirsty, 50% that I
<br />
am drinking beer.&quot;
<br />
<br />But in your point of view, you would just sit back and relax, because you
<br />
would be happy anyway. But I don't believe that you actually live by
<br />
the rules you are proposing. How does that fit in your everyday life?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I think it all comes down to which conception of &quot;you&quot; you decide to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use.
</em><br />
<br />I would like to use the concept that I am both, but unfortunately it
<br />
is overwhelmingly hard for me to cheer up about having won the lottery
<br />
in another universe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another comment:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You are trying to identify ' me ' by somehowpointing it out from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; pool
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of similar entities in a God's perspective. That may be even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; impossible,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if there is no God, but that is another discussion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You're right, it is impossible. (even if &quot;you&quot; were in one of Jürgen's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or Bruno's programs, I would think it would be difficult and, to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain degree, _arbitrary_ to completely isolate the part of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program that is &quot;you&quot; from the part that is everything else.)  I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact that it is impossible to determine who &quot;you&quot; are is precisely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one of the things that makes QTI seem plausible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  ' I ' am what I experience myself to be, and that is a completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; specified entity since there are no interactions between universes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that your word &quot;that&quot; in this sentence does _not_ actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point to a completely specified entity.  Your experiences are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specifying what needs to be specified here.  You appear to be saying,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Well, at any rate, I know that _I am me_ and no one else!&quot;.  But you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do not experience yourself as a completely specified entity.  And it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still true that a vast number of (almost completely) identical bunches
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of atoms are saying the same thing as &quot;you&quot;, and invoking the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences in support of their assertion.
</em><br />
<br />No, I am Eric02, the one who measured the -1/2 spin, and I am thirsty.
<br />
The other is not. Since these are the only two entities in my simplified
<br />
example, ' I ' am a completely specified entity. The cases where the
<br />
entities
<br />
are unaware of the difference does not pose a problem either, as I showed
<br />
above. All those Eric's might be saying the same thing, but look closely
<br />
and you will find that each one of them live in universes that are
<br />
objectively
<br />
different, and that is the difference between them. If two of them live in
<br />
*exactly* the same universe, then I concede they are the same, but that
<br />
is not what we are worried about. We are worried about those which
<br />
do have differences, and specially those which have such remarkable
<br />
differences as thirsty/not-thirsty, dead/alive.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This was my point about Wittgenstein's man who says he knows how tall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he is.  The answer to the question &quot;How tall are you?&quot; is not &quot;This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tall!&quot;, accompanied by a gesture with your hand.  It seems like an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer, but it won't do - because the question is asking for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measurement (given an agreed-upon metric, etc.).  For the purposes of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the QTI, the question &quot;who are you?&quot; cannot be answered by doing, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you essentially are doing, &quot;I'm this person!&quot;, accompanied by pointing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to your chest.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe my previous posts weren't clear enough, but I think what I am
<br />
saying is not similar to Wittgenstein's man's claim. He cannot measure
<br />
his height with relation to himself, of course, because a distance is
<br />
necessarily given in relation to something else. But I did relate to
<br />
something else. I am the thirsty one, not the other. If you can see both,
<br />
then you can tell exactly who I am. No ambiguity, no imprecision.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If two universes have any distinction, even in the state of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; particle, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I understand the MWI, they are distinct universes. That is an objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; statement, which has nothing to do with my lack of knowledge about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the small differences. One particular universe (the one  ' I ' am in)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have distinct outcomes in a dangerous situation, so that it splits in,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; say,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 50% universes where I am dead, and 50% where I am alive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We both agree with this setup of MWI and the outcomes of dangerous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You might say, &quot;We agree on all the 3rd person facts&quot;.  For instance,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we both agree that, say, Eric01 will die and Eric02 will live, and this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has nothing to do with what either of them know.  The disagreement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comes when you say, &quot;Yes, but what will *I* experience?&quot;.  I have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to argue that this question and its answer depends on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular sense of &quot;I&quot; being used.
</em><br />
<br />And I sustain that the only sense of ' I ' that really makes sense is the
<br />
one
<br />
that I am proposing. If not, please defend another position.
<br />
<br />Thank you for an extremely pleasant discussion,
<br />
Eric.
