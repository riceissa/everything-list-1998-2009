This has been an interesting thread. Unfortunately I was too busy to 
<br />
contribute much. However, here is a thought regarding simulation versus 
<br />
first and third person points of view.
<br />
<br />It does make sense to talk about a 3rd person point of view about 
<br />
simulation of a conscious entity on a computer. However, I don't think 
<br />
it applies to a first person point of view.
<br />
<br />In the plenitude we'll have an infinite number of levels of simulation 
<br />
as well as an infinite number of simulations per level (2^aleph_0 as 
<br />
suggested by Bruno in a previous post, or higher)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From a first person point of view any observer moment in any simulation 
<br />
and at any level can transit to another observer moment in a different 
<br />
simulation at a different level provided the transition is consistent 
<br />
with the observer. Therefore from the first person point of view there 
<br />
is no such a thing as living in a simulator. As first persons we live in 
<br />
all simulators and at all levels.
<br />
<br />In addition, since lower levels have lower complexity and therefore 
<br />
higher measure, the number of simulations is higher at lower levels.
<br />
<br />Therefore we are more likely to occupy ensembles of simulations located 
<br />
at the lower levels. Is there a lowest level in the level hierarchy, 
<br />
that is a level below which there is no simulation, just the plenitude? 
<br />
Possibly. If so, we are most likely to exist &quot;most of the time&quot; at that 
<br />
base level, but we cannot exclude that &quot;some of the time&quot; we may be in a 
<br />
higher level.
<br />
<br />hmmmm. This argument points to the fact that &quot;most of the time&quot; we do 
<br />
not live in a simulator!
<br />
<br />George
