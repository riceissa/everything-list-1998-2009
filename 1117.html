<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; among the so called computational continuations of one's brain activity&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; leads inevitably to the concept of near-zombies.  The description of

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; making a million copies of one person is a good illustration.  Each of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; those copies has only a one millionth chance of &quot;being&quot; the original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person, so we should not be as concerned when one of those dies as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; when someone else, who has never been copied, dies.  But is this a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; refutation of the concept, by reductio-ad-absurdum?  I don't think so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         It is absurd to me and hopefully will be to the others.  I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are not being objective since you usually find zombies absurd.
</em><br />
<br />I should have qualified my zombie view in the post before, but I forgot.
<br />
If you re-read it, you'll notice that I always used the term &quot;near-
<br />
zombies&quot;.  I certainly do find the concept of zombies absurd.  But &quot;near-
<br />
zombies&quot;, as I was using the term, are physical SAS's that have a very 
<br />
low measure of existence.  That is, any random conscious entity would
<br />
have a low probability of finding itself to be that one relative to
<br />
others.
<br />
<br />But &quot;near-zombies&quot; are not the same as zombies -- there is a qualitative
<br />
difference between low measure and not conscious (zero measure).  I tend 
<br />
to agree with Russell that it's difficult to see what measure has to do 
<br />
with consciousness.
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Assume that all three branches occur (two copying events).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If there are two copying events, then there is no place for a coin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; toss to enter into the experiment, so the 'T' and 'H' should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; erased from the diagram.  The point is still made that, at time t0,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Jane would figure:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     P(left branch, t1) = 1/2, P(right branch, t1) = 1/2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     P(Y, t3) = 1/2, P(R, t3) = 1/4, P(B, t3) = 1/4
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Which would imply that the two copies of her that saw red and blue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would be less likely to be the same Jane at t0, so in some sense,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; they would be less human, you might say.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         In the QS claim, that is.  T and H can still label the branches.
</em><br />
<br />Okay as long as T and H are just labels, and there is no coin toss,
<br />
right?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;         The two experiments are actually rather different and I should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have made the distiction clearer in my post.  I assume you refer below to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the case with two copying events.
</em><br />
<br />No, I thought I was very clear.  All of my six &quot;options&quot; are alternative
<br />
ways of interpreting the original experiment, with a coin toss, and one
<br />
copying event if the toss lands heads.  There may be a problem with
<br />
terminology here, because if you assume the MWI, then the coin toss is
<br />
a copy event.  I do usually assume MWI, so I may have confused things.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;   3.  Subjective probabilities can be computed, but the assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       that consciousness can &quot;flow&quot; to a continuation independent of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       time or space is flawed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       This, I think, is Jacques' point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       view.  Though he didn't state it, I would guess that he would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;           P(H, t1) = P(H, t2) = P(H, t3) = 1/2,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       and that the original Jane would necessarily feel herself to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       continue along with her original body.  That is, if, in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       above diagram, at the copying event after Jane sees Heads, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       assume that the original Jane is the one who is shown the Red
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       card, then Jane at t1 would say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;           P(R) = 1,   P(B) = 0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       The copy of Jane who sees the blue card is a new person, who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       was just &quot;born&quot; at the instant the copy was made, even though
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       she has all the same memories as the original.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         That is NOT my position, though of course I think 'consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flowing to and being distributed among continuations' is nonsense.  I make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no distinction between a copy and the original; 'identity' is not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental concept.  Each has the same amount of measure.  For practical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purposes the distinction is useful, however.  It's just a matter of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terminology in the practical use.
</em><br />
<br />Then I wish you would describe what you do believe.  I am stymied in my
<br />
attempts to make sense of it, and I have tried.
<br />
<br />Consciousness &quot;flowing&quot; is perhaps a bad image.  I mean nothing more than
<br />
that certain observer moments are related by some sort of identity function
<br />
to other observer moments.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;   4.  Subjective probabilities can be computed on the basis of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       Strong SSA, and we get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;           P(H, t1) = 1/2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;           P(H, t2) = P(H, t3) = 2/3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       If this is the case, then I think we have to throw Tegmark's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       scheme using Bayesian statistics out the window.  This option
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       has severe metaphysical problems, though, in my opinion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         I don't know what you mean by the above paragraph, but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effective probabilities are correct if there are two copying events.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SSA is the right way to do Bayesian calculations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         If the T-H split represented a non-MWI coin toss and was a one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time event, then P(H,t3) = 1/2.  In practice those conditions would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible to achieve even without the MWI of QM (e.g. in an infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe) and P(H,t3) = 2/3.
</em><br />
<br />It's very simple, although I guess I haven't written it out in gory 
<br />
detail before.  Tegmark's formula &quot;for any mutually exclusive and 
<br />
collectively exhaustive set of possibilities Bi, the probability of
<br />
an event A is given by 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(A) = Sum over i [  P(A|Bi) P(Bi)  ]
<br />
<br />I want to computer P(H, t3).  Let B1 be (H, t1) and B2 be (T, t1), then
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(H, t3) = P(H,t3 | H,t1) P(H,t1) + P(H,t3 | T,t1) P(T,t1)
<br />
<br />We assume in this option (4) that P(H,t1) = P(T,t1) = 1/2.  Now, I
<br />
maintain, and I really don't see how it could be otherwise, that
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(H,t3 | H,t1) = 1  and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(H,t3 | T,t1) = 0.
<br />
<br />Some people have claimed that these relations do not hold, but I don't
<br />
see what they could possibly be talking about.  These statements say
<br />
nothing more than that my memories are consistent -- that I can expect
<br />
them to remain constant.  If we abandon that, then all hope is lost!
<br />
I wish those who claim this (Hal?, Wei?) would explain themselves better.
<br />
<br />So, anyway, we get P(H,t3) = 1/2 by Tegmark's formula.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;   6.  Subjective probabilities can be computed, and we should expect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       the nonsensical results
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;           P(H, t1) = 2/3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;           P(H, t2) = P(H, t3) = 2/3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       This is what I believe is probably true.  I think that there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       must be a sort of &quot;reverse causality&quot; at work, which would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       increase the measure of the right branch of Jane at time t1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       (the branch that sees heads, but before the copy is made).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Nonsense.
</em><br />
<br />Whatever.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       This still has Jacques' problem of allowing pseudo-zombies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       If we switch to Jacques' example and assume two copying events,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       then the Jane on the left branch, at time t1, would have less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       measure than the Jane on the right (note the contrast between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       this result and the previous, where the Janes that were the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       product of the second copying operation were accorded less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       measure).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       But I don't see this as a problem.  What I'm suggesting is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       each human alive today has a varying amount of &quot;measure&quot;.  It's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       incorrect to assume that each person, when they are born, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       given a single &quot;measure unit&quot;.  By my scheme, a person with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       terminal illness with only a few days to live would have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       very small measure of existence, relative to others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Huh?  This seems inconsistent with QS and the specifics aren't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there.
</em><br />
<br />This is my &quot;near-zombie&quot;.  We should not expect to find ourselves in the
<br />
body of someone about to die.  We should not expect to land in the 
<br />
hospital any time soon with a brain tumor and only a few days to live.
<br />
<br />Now, note that this is consistent with QS.  Just because the person 
<br />
doesn't have a strong likelihood of survival, he or she does have a
<br />
non-vanishing likelihood, and will, therefore, necessarily find him
<br />
or herself surviving, by some extremely unlikely means.  That's why
<br />
there's no such thing as a true zombie -- which would equate to 
<br />
a conscious entity with a zero chance of continuing.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       I can't help wondering, often, why I find myself to be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       particular human I am.  Do you others wonder this?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         You are arrogant.  I am not a typical human but see no reason to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suspect I could not be a randomly selected human.
</em><br />
<br />Tut tut tut.  Why is it arrogant to wonder?  The whole concept of the
<br />
SSA is about wondering why we are who we are.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       One thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       I've had (please don't laugh at me too badly) is that the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       that I have a pretty poor memory might be significant.  If I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       had a better memory, then my measure would be less, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       fewer universes could have given rise to me.  Of course, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       reasoning probably won't work for you, but that doesn't make it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       any less valid from my perspective, which is the only one I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       have.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Well I hate (giggle?) to say it but that sounds stupid.  If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remember something non-random, that shouldn't cut your measure.  If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remember a random bit, it cuts the total measure of each type of you in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; half but now there are twice as many types.  By total measure I mean, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always, the number, so this is consistent with the SSA and leads to no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zombies.
</em><br />
<br />But you said it yourself, if I remember a random bit, &quot;it cuts the total
<br />
measure of each type of [me] in half.&quot;  I don't know what you mean by
<br />
&quot;type&quot;.  I'd say it cuts the measure of me in half.  That's exactly my
<br />
point.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       I came to believe in this &quot;reverse causality&quot; while pondering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       the QS project I wrote about before.  I started to expect that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       things would crop up in my way to prevent my being able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       complete the project, before it came to fruition.  It didn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       (and it still doesn't) make sense to me that the measure of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       my branches should be unaffected until the very instant that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       carry out the experiment.  Because if the assumption that I'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       be alive after the experiment date is correct, then I can expect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       to have memories at that time of somehow having escaped.  And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       I should, in general, expect to have a memory of &quot;the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       likely&quot; escape route, or of one of the most likely ones, if there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       are several that are near-equally likely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       But how can one reconcile that with the concept of continuity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       consciousness from moment to moment?  Only if there is a reverse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       causality at work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       This theory has significant and testable implications.  Viz:  we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       should expect to find ourselves in a universe that will allow us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       to live forever.  I.e.  this leads directly to the requirement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       that the FAP is true.  Just consider if time t1 and t2 are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       separated by a larger and larger time span.  Consider also that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       those branches in which we cease to exist also tend to decrease
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       the measure of all the observer-moments in previous subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       Basically, the measure of our observer-moments at the next
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       instant in subjective time are weighted as the number of continous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       paths from that observer-moment to the &quot;Omega-point&quot;.  This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       my crackpot theory.  Though it's certainly hard to justify on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       basis of the SSA on a moment-by-moment basis (the Strong SSA), I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       haven't yet found anything that contradicts it.  I know that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       not good enough, but anyway I find it the most satisfying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       result of the above thought experiment.  All the other possibilities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;       are problematic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         The Omega Point CRAP is disproven because the universe is open.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (CRAP=causally retroactive anthropic principle)
</em><br />
<br />Cute!  But I thing the jury is still out.  I probably shouldn't use the
<br />
term &quot;Omega-Point&quot;, since that refers to a specific theory of the infinite
<br />
future evolution of the universe.  I sometimes use it to refer in general
<br />
to the infinite future in which life continues.
