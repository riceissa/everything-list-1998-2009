<br />
How can we argue for God's existence and unity in a way everyone can
<br />
understand?
<br />
In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.
<br />
<br />So God sets forth parables for men in order that they may bear (them)
<br />
in mind and take lessons (through them). (14:25)
<br />
<br />Such parables do we set forth for men so that they may reflect.(59:21)
<br />
<br />The existence of God is too evident to need any arguments
<br />
The existence of God is too evident to need any arguments. Some
<br />
saintly scholars have even stated that God is more manifest than any
<br />
other being, but that those who lack insight cannot see Him. Others
<br />
have said that He is concealed from direct perception because of the
<br />
intensity of His Self-manifestation.
<br />
<br />However, the great influence of positivist and materialist schools of
<br />
thought on science and on all people of recent centuries makes it
<br />
necessary to discuss such arguments. As this now-prevalent
<br />
&quot;scientific&quot; worldview reduces existence to what can be perceived
<br />
directly, it blinds itself to those invisible dimensions of existence
<br />
that far vaster than the visible. To remove the resulting veil, we
<br />
will review briefly several traditional demonstrations of God's
<br />
necessary existence.
<br />
<br />Before doing so, let us reflect on one simple historical fact: Since
<br />
the beginning of human life, the overwhelming majority of humanity has
<br />
believed that God exists. This belief alone is enough to establish
<br />
God's existence. Those who do not believe cannot claim to be smarter
<br />
than those who do. Among past and present-day believers are innovative
<br />
scientists, scholars, researchers and, most importantly, saints and
<br />
Prophets, who are the experts in the field. In addition, people
<br />
usually confuse the non-acceptance of something's existence with the
<br />
acceptance of its non-existence. While the former is only a negation
<br />
or a rejection, the latter is a judgment that requires proof. No one
<br />
has ever proven God's non-existence, for to do so is impossible,
<br />
whereas countless arguments prove His existence. This point may be
<br />
clarified through the following comparison.
<br />
<br />Suppose there is a large palace with 1,000 entrances, 999 of which are
<br />
open and one which appears to be closed. No one could reasonably claim
<br />
that the palace cannot be entered. Unbelievers are like those who, in
<br />
order to assert that the palace cannot be entered, confine their (and
<br />
others') attention only to the door that is seemingly closed.
<br />
<br />The doors to God's existence are open to everybody, provided that they
<br />
sincerely intend to enter through them. Some of those doors-the
<br />
demonstrations for God's existence-are as follows by way of a parable:
<br />
<br />A parable to understand God's Existence and Unity
<br />
Once two men washed themselves in a pool. Then, under some
<br />
extraordinary influence they fell into a trance-like state and when
<br />
they opened their eyes, they found themselves in a strange land. It
<br />
was a land in perfect orderliness and harmony-as it might be a well-
<br />
ordered state, or a single city, or even a palace. They looked around
<br />
in utmost amazement: from one point of view, it was a vast world; from
<br />
another, a well-ordered state; from yet another, a splendid city. If
<br />
it was looked at from still another point of view, it was a palace
<br />
though one that was in itself a magnificent world. They traveled
<br />
around this strange world and saw that there were creatures of diverse
<br />
sorts speaking a language they did not know. However, as could be
<br />
gathered from their gestures, they were doing important work, carrying
<br />
out significant duties.
<br />
<br />One of the two men said to his friend:
<br />
<br />This strange world must have someone to administer it; this well-
<br />
ordered state must have a lord, and this splendid city, an owner, and
<br />
this skillfully made palace, a master builder. We must try to know
<br />
him, for it is understood that the one who brought us here is he. If
<br />
we do not know him, who else will help us here? What can we expect
<br />
from those impotent creatures whose language we do not know and who do
<br />
not heed us? Moreover, certainly one who has made a huge world in the
<br />
form of a state, or a city, or a palace, and filled it from top to
<br />
bottom with wonderful things, and embellished it with every sort of
<br />
adornment, and decorated it with instructive miracles, wants something
<br />
from us and from whoever comes here. We must know him, and find out
<br />
what he wants.
<br />
<br />The other man objected:
<br />
<br />I do not believe that there is such a one as you speak of, and that he
<br />
governs this whole world alone by himself.
<br />
<br />His friend responded to him:
<br />
<br />If we do not recognize him and remain indifferent towards him, there
<br />
is no advantage in it at all, but it may be very harmful, whereas if
<br />
we try to recognize him, there is little hardship in it, but it may be
<br />
very beneficial. Therefore, it is in no way sensible to remain
<br />
indifferent towards him.
<br />
<br />The other man insisted:
<br />
<br />I find all my ease and enjoyment in not thinking of him. Besides, I am
<br />
not to bother myself with things like this which do not concern me.
<br />
These are all confused things happening by chance or by themselves.
<br />
They are no concern of mine.
<br />
<br />His intelligent friend replied:
<br />
<br />This obstinacy of yours will get us and many others into trouble. It
<br />
sometimes happens that a whole state is ruined because of one ill-
<br />
mannered person.
<br />
<br />The other man turned to him and said:
<br />
<br />Either prove to me decisively that this vast country has a single
<br />
lord, a single maker, or leave me to myself.
<br />
<br />In reply, his friend explained:
<br />
<br />Your obstinacy has reached the point of insanity, and through it you
<br />
will bring upon us a great calamity.  So I will show you twelve proofs
<br />
that this world, which is like a palace, this state which is like a
<br />
city, has a single master builder, and that it is only he who
<br />
administers it. He must be completely free of all deficiency. This
<br />
builder, who is invisible to us, must be seeing us and everything, and
<br />
hearing all voices. All his works seem miraculous. All these creatures
<br />
whom we see but whose languages we do not understand must be his
<br />
officials [working in his name].
<br />
<br />A hidden hand is working in everything
<br />
Come and look around! Be attentive to whatever is happening! In all
<br />
these things a hidden hand is working. For something which has not
<br />
even an ounce of strength (a tiny seed) is bearing loads of thousands
<br />
of pounds (a huge tree). Something that has no consciousness at all (a
<br />
bee, a silkworm) is doing much intelligent and purposive work. That
<br />
means they are not working on their own. A powerful, hidden one is
<br />
causing them to work. If everything were happening on its own, it
<br />
would require that all the work which we see being done everywhere in
<br />
this place must be itself a miracle and everything a miracle-working
<br />
marvel.
<br />
<br />If all people came together, they would not be able to produce a
<br />
single seed or leaf or fruit
<br />
Come and be attentive to the things with which all these plains,
<br />
fields, and residential places are adorned! On each of them are marks
<br />
pointing to that hidden one. Like a seal or stamp, each gives news of
<br />
him. Look, what he is producing before you from a few grams of cotton!
<br />
See how many rolls of cloth, linen and flowered material have come out
<br />
of it!  See how much sweet food and how many other sorts of delights
<br />
are being made. (Consider how, for example, a poppy seed as tiny as a
<br />
particle, or an apricot stone the weight of a few grams, or a melon
<br />
seed, each produce from the treasury of Mercy woven leaves more
<br />
beautiful than broadcloth, flowers whiter or yellower than linen, and
<br />
fruits sweeter than sugar, and finer and more delicious than
<br />
conserves, and they offer them to us.) If thousands of people like us
<br />
were to clothe themselves from these or eat of those, they would never
<br />
be able to do that. Again, look! He has taken a handful of iron,
<br />
earth, water, coal, copper, silver, and gold, and made some living
<br />
creatures out of them. (This refers to the creation of animal bodies
<br />
from elements, and living creatures from sperm.) Look and see!  These
<br />
sorts of work are particular to one such that he holds all this land
<br />
together with all its parts under his miraculous power and all
<br />
submissive to his will.
<br />
<br />An individual animal or human being, even a seed, is a miniature
<br />
specimen of the whole universe
<br />
Come and look at these priceless, moving works of art! Each has been
<br />
fashioned in such a way that it is simply a miniature specimen of this
<br />
huge palace. Whatever there is in this palace, it is found in these
<br />
tiny moving machines. Is it at all possible that someone other than
<br />
the builder of this amazing palace has included the whole of it in a
<br />
tiny machine? Again, is it at all possible that chance or something
<br />
purposeless could have intervened in the machine the size of a box
<br />
which contains a whole world? That means that however many
<br />
artistically fashioned machines you can see, each is like a seal of
<br />
that hidden one. Each is also like a herald or proclamation. In their
<br />
language of being they announce: 'We are the works of art of one such
<br />
as can make this entire world of ours as easily as he made us.'
<br />
<br />Every thing is interconnected with every thing, needs every thing and
<br />
comes to the aid of every thing
<br />
O obstinate friend! Come, I will show you something stranger. Look!
<br />
All the things in this land do not persist in one state: they are all
<br />
changing. Notice that each of these lifeless bodies and unfeeling
<br />
'bones' have started to move toward certain purposes, as if each thing
<br />
were ruling all the others. Look at this machine beside us! (Referring
<br />
to fruit-bearing trees. For, as if bearing on their slender branches
<br />
hundreds of looms and factories, they weave wonderful, richly adorned
<br />
leaves, flowers and fruits and then cook fruits to offer to us. On the
<br />
other hand, majestic trees like the pine and cedar have set up their
<br />
workbenches on hard, dry rock, and work.) It is as though it was
<br />
issuing commands and all the materials necessary for its adornment and
<br />
functioning were running to it from distant places. Look over there:
<br />
that seemingly lifeless body is as though beckoning; it makes the
<br />
biggest bodies serve it and work for it (Referring to grains, seeds,
<br />
and the eggs of flies. For example, a fly leaves its eggs on the
<br />
leaves of an elm tree. All of a sudden the huge tree turns its leaves
<br />
into another's womb, and a cradle, and into a store full of honey-like
<br />
food. It is as if the tree, which is not fruit-bearing, produces fruit
<br />
which is animate.). You may compare the rest with these.
<br />
<br />Everything seems to have subjugated to itself all the creatures in the
<br />
world
<br />
<br />Everything seems to have subjugated to itself all the creatures in the
<br />
world. If you do not accept the existence of that hidden one, you will
<br />
have to attribute all his skills, arts, and perfection to the stones,
<br />
earth, animals, and creatures resembling man everywhere in this land
<br />
to the things themselves. In place of a single miracle-working being,
<br />
whose existence in your mind seems improbable, millions like him have
<br />
to exist, who are miracle-working, and all opposed to one another, and
<br />
yet similar and one within the other, without causing any confusion
<br />
and spoiling the order. Whereas if two rulers intervene in the affairs
<br />
of a state they cause confusion. For if there are two head-men in a
<br />
village, or two governors in a town, or two kings in a country, chaos
<br />
arises. So what of the existence of absolute rulers in infinite number
<br />
in the same place at the same time?
<br />
<br />How can all those purposeful ornaments, splendid embroideries and
<br />
artistic inscriptions be attributed to unconscious causes, blind
<br />
chance and deaf nature?
<br />
O skeptical friend! Come and look carefully at the ornaments of this
<br />
huge palace, look at the adornments of the city, see the orderliness
<br />
in this land, and reflect on all the artistry in this world! Look!
<br />
Assume the pen of a hidden one with infinite miracles and skills is
<br />
not at work, or that all these ornaments are attributed to unconscious
<br />
causes, to blind chance and deaf nature. Then all the stones and
<br />
plains of this land will have to be each a decorator so miracle-
<br />
working and an inscriber so wonderful that each can write a thousand
<br />
books in a letter, and display infinitely different forms of artistry
<br />
in a single ornament. For look at the inscriptions on these stones; on
<br />
each are the inscriptions of the whole palace, the laws for the order
<br />
of the whole city, and the programs for the organization of the whole
<br />
state. That means that to make all these inscriptions is as wonderful
<br />
as making the whole state. So, each inscription, each instance of art,
<br />
is a proclamation of that hidden one, and one of his seals.
<br />
<br />A letter certainly indicates the one who wrote it, and an artistic
<br />
inscription undoubtedly makes known the inscriber. How is it, then,
<br />
that an inscriber, a designer, a decorator, who inscribes a huge book
<br />
in a single letter and displays a thousand ornaments in a single
<br />
ornament, should not be known through his inscriptions and ornaments?
<br />
<br />Existence is continually renewed with no single confusion and
<br />
disorderliness
<br />
Come, we'll go out onto this vast plain. On it is a huge mountain, the
<br />
top of which we will climb so that we can see all the surrounding
<br />
area. Also, we will take binoculars with us to make distant objects
<br />
seem nearer.  For in this strange land curious things are happening;
<br />
every hour things are happening that we have never imagined.
<br />
<br />Look! These mountains, plains, and towns are suddenly changing. They
<br />
are changing so that millions of new things take place with perfect
<br />
orderliness one within the other and one after the other. The most
<br />
curious transformations take place as though various cloths of
<br />
innumerable kinds are being woven inside and among others. Look, the
<br />
flowery things, with which we have been so familiar, have disappeared;
<br />
these have been replaced in orderly fashion with others of similar
<br />
nature but of different form. Everything is happening in a manner as
<br />
if these plains and mountains are each a page, and on them are being
<br />
written hundreds of thousands of different books.  They are being
<br />
written without any flaw, without any defect.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is inconceivable that these things come about on their own.
<br />
For these things displaying infinite instances of art and skill, and
<br />
exactness of an infinite degree, to happen of themselves is utterly
<br />
inconceivable, for rather than themselves, they show the artist who
<br />
brings them about.  The one who does all these things displays such
<br />
miracles that nothing at all can be difficult for him. It is as easy
<br />
for him to write one thousand books as to write one book.
<br />
<br />An absolute wisdom and all-encompassing favoring are manifest in
<br />
existence
<br />
Again, look all around you! He puts everything in just its proper
<br />
place with such wisdom, and on everyone needy and deserving he pours
<br />
his favor so generously, and he draws back and opens general veils and
<br />
doors so bountifully, that he satisfies the desires of all. Also, he
<br />
lays out tables, so munificently that a feast of bounties is given to
<br />
all the people and animals of this land, indeed, bounties particular
<br />
and suitable for each group and individual. (Referring to the face of
<br />
the earth in spring and summer, when innumerable individuals of
<br />
hundreds of thousands of species are brought into existence one among
<br />
the others, they are 'written' on earth. They are recruited and may
<br />
undergo changes without flaw and with perfect orderliness. Thousands
<br />
of tables of the Most merciful One are laid out, then removed, and
<br />
replaced with fresh ones. All the trees are as though bear trays. All
<br />
the gardens are like cauldrons.)
<br />
<br />So, is there anything more inconceivable of this world than that
<br />
anything in all that we observe could be attributable to chance, or
<br />
that anything in it could be purposeless or vain or that many hands
<br />
should be interfering in it? Could it be otherwise than that their
<br />
maker is powerful over everything, and that everything is subjugated
<br />
to him? So, O friend, in the face of all this, find, if you can, a
<br />
pretext to persist in denial of that unseen one!
<br />
<br />All the things in this world, as if all positioned face to face, help
<br />
one another. As though seeing one another, they co-operate with one
<br />
another. In order to perfect each other's work, they support one
<br />
another, and work together.
<br />
<br />Come, friend! Leaving these particular matters, we will turn our
<br />
attention to the mutual interrelations of the parts of this amazing
<br />
world in the form of a palace. Look! Universal things are being done
<br />
and general revolutions taking place with such perfect orderliness
<br />
that all the rocks, earth, and trees in this palace act in accordance
<br />
with the general rules of this world as if each were free to do
<br />
whatever it wills. Things that are most distant from one another come
<br />
to each other's aid. Look! A strange caravan has appeared, coming from
<br />
the unseen on mounts resembling trees, plants, and mountains. They are
<br />
carrying trays of food on their heads. Look! They are bringing the
<br />
food for the various animals waiting on this side. (Referring to
<br />
'caravans' of plants and trees bearing the sustenance of all animals.)
<br />
Look, again! That mighty electric lamp (the sun) in that dome, besides
<br />
furnishing them with light, cooks their food so well that the food to
<br />
be cooked is attached to a string by an unseen hand and held out and
<br />
offered. (The string and the food attached to it denote the slender
<br />
branches of trees and the delicious fruits thereon.) Look on this side
<br />
and see these impotent, weak, defenseless little animals; over their
<br />
heads are arranged small pumps like two springs, full of delicate
<br />
sustenance. They have only to press their mouths against the 'pumps'
<br />
to be fed. (Referring to the breasts of mothers.)
<br />
<br />In short: All the things in this world, as if all positioned face to
<br />
face, help one another. As though seeing one another, they co-operate
<br />
with one another. In order to perfect each other's work, they support
<br />
one another, and work together. The ways of co-operation among them
<br />
are too numerous to count. All these things demonstrate as decisively
<br />
as two plus two makes four that everything is subjugated to the
<br />
builder of that wonderful palace, that is, to the owner of this
<br />
strange world. Everything works on behalf of him; everything is like a
<br />
soldier carrying out his commands. Everything takes place by his
<br />
power. Everything moves by his command. Everything is arranged through
<br />
his wisdom. Everything helps the others by his munificence. Everything
<br />
hastens, rather, is made to hasten, to the aid of the others through
<br />
his compassion. O friend, raise an objection to this, if you can!
<br />
<br />In this palace of the world are uniform elements and minerals (namely
<br />
earth, water, air, and light) which encompass the whole world:
<br />
everything appearing in the world is made from them. That means that
<br />
whoever owns them also owns everything made from them.
<br />
<br />Come, O friend who supposes himself to be intelligent as does my own
<br />
selfhood! You do not want to recognize the owner of this magnificent
<br />
palace. Whereas everything points to him, shows him, and testifies to
<br />
him, how can you deny the testimony of all these things? You have
<br />
therefore to deny the palace as well, and say: 'There is no world, no
<br />
state!' Deny your existence, too, and disappear! Or else come to your
<br />
senses, and listen to me!
<br />
<br />Look! In the palace are uniform elements and minerals, which encompass
<br />
the whole of the land: everything appearing in the world is made from
<br />
them. That means that whoever owns them also owns everything made from
<br />
them; whoever owns the field owns its crops also; to whomever the sea
<br />
belongs,  to him also the things in the sea belong. (Elements and
<br />
minerals denote the elements of air, water, light, and earth, which
<br />
perform numerous systematic duties: they hasten by Divine leave to the
<br />
aid of all needy beings, enter everywhere by Divine command and
<br />
provide help, convey the necessities of life, and 'suckle' living
<br />
creatures, and function as the source, origin and cradle for the
<br />
weaving and decoration of Divine artifacts.)
<br />
<br />Again, look! These textiles, these decorated woven clothes are made
<br />
from a single substance. It is evidently the same person who brings
<br />
about the substance, prepares it, and makes it into yarn. For such a
<br />
work would not allow the participation of others. Therefore, all the
<br />
things skillfully woven out of it are particular to him.
<br />
<br />Also, look! All types of those woven things are found in every part of
<br />
the land; they are being made all together, one inside or among the
<br />
others, in the same way, and at the same instant. That means they are
<br />
the work of a single person, who does everything with a single
<br />
command. Otherwise their correspondence and conformity at the same
<br />
instant, in the same fashion, of the same quality, would be
<br />
impossible. So, each of these skillfully made things is like a
<br />
proclamation of that hidden one and points to him. It is as if each
<br />
kind of flowered cloth, each machine that has skillfully been made,
<br />
each delicious morsel, is a stamp, a seal, a sign of that miracle-
<br />
working one. Each one is saying in the language of its being: 'Whoever
<br />
owns me as a work of art, also owns the boxes and shops where I am
<br />
found.' Each decoration says: 'Whoever embroidered me also wove the
<br />
roll of cloth in which I am.' Each delicious morsel says: 'Whoever
<br />
cooked me also has the cooking-pot in which I am.' Each machine says:
<br />
'Whoever made me also makes all those like me that are found
<br />
everywhere in the land, and the one who raises us in every part of the
<br />
land is also the same. That means it is also the same person who owns
<br />
the land. Therefore, whoever owns this land, this palace, must own us,
<br />
too.' This is because, for example, in order to be the real owner of a
<br />
single cartridge-belt or even a button belonging to the state, one
<br />
also has to own all the factories in which they are made. If an
<br />
outrageous irregular claims ownership of it, it will be taken back
<br />
from him, and he will be punished because of his false pretending to
<br />
the property right of the state.
<br />
<br />In short:  If each element in this land has permeated through every
<br />
other, encompassing the whole, their owner can only be the one who
<br />
owns all the land. Since the instances of art found everywhere in the
<br />
land resemble one another and display the one same stamp, then all the
<br />
things that have spread throughout the land are evidently the works of
<br />
a single person's art and he rules over everything.
<br />
<br />There are certain things which are uniform, without like, and of the
<br />
same nature, yet all-encompassing. Certain other things, though
<br />
various and in great number, display a unity of grouping since they
<br />
resemble one another and are found everywhere. This points to a single
<br />
owner of the world.
<br />
<br />Thus, O friend, since there is a sign of oneness, a stamp of unity in
<br />
this land, in this magnificent palace-it is so because there are
<br />
certain things which are uniform, without like, and of the same
<br />
nature, yet all-encompassing. Certain other things, though various and
<br />
in great number, display a unity of grouping since they resemble one
<br />
another and are found everywhere-unity declares the one of unity. That
<br />
means that the builder, the host, and the owner, of this land must be
<br />
one and the same. In addition, look attentively: see how, from behind
<br />
the veil of the Unseen, a thick string Then look, see how thousands of
<br />
strings have hung down from it. See the tips of the strings: diamonds,
<br />
decorations, favors, and gifts have been attached to each. There is a
<br />
gift particular to everyone. (The string and the things attached to it
<br />
denote the slender branches of trees and the delicious fruits thereon
<br />
has appeared.) Do you know how great a foolishness it is not to
<br />
recognize and not to thank the one who stretches out from behind the
<br />
strange veil of the Unseen such wonderful favors and gifts?  For if
<br />
you do not recognize him, you will have to argue: 'It is the strings
<br />
themselves which make the diamonds and other gifts on their tips, and
<br />
offer them.' In which case, you will have to attribute to each string
<br />
the status and function of a king [who has a miraculous power and
<br />
knowledge to do whatever he wishes]. Whereas, before our very eyes, an
<br />
unseen hand is making the strings themselves, and attaching the gifts
<br />
to them. That means that everything in this palace points to that
<br />
miracle-working one rather than to itself.  If you do not recognize
<br />
him, by denying all these things happening in the palace, you will
<br />
display stupidity of a kind that a truly human being must not sink to.
<br />
<br />If we recognize the single owner of the world, the, this world and
<br />
whatever there is in it in such abundance, will be as easy to
<br />
understand as a single thing in it. If we do not recognize him, then a
<br />
single thing will be as difficult to explain as the whole world,
<br />
because everything is as skillfully made as the world.
<br />
<br />Come, O friend!  You do not recognize the owner of this palace, and
<br />
you do not want to recognize him, because you deem his existence
<br />
improbable. You deviate into denial because you cannot grasp his
<br />
wonderful arts and manner of acting. Whereas it is infinitely
<br />
difficult, even impossible, to explain all these exquisite things,
<br />
this wonderful existence, without recognizing him. For if we recognize
<br />
him, all this palace, this world, and whatever there is in it in such
<br />
abundance, will be as easy to understand as a single thing in it. If
<br />
we do not recognize him, and if he did not exist, then a single thing
<br />
will be as difficult to explain as the whole palace, because
<br />
everything is as skillfully made as the palace. Things would not be in
<br />
such abundance and so economical. No one, including ourselves, could
<br />
possess any of these things that we see. Look just at the jar of
<br />
conserve attached to that string (The jar of conserve denotes the
<br />
gifts of mercy such as melons, water melons, pomegranates, and
<br />
coconuts like tins of milk, which are each a conserve of Divine
<br />
Power.) If it had not been made in his hidden kitchen, where
<br />
everything is made miraculously, we could not have bought it for all
<br />
we have, while we buy it now for a few cents.
<br />
<br />In truth, every kind of persisting difficulty and impossibility
<br />
follows from not recognizing him. For, since a tree is given life from
<br />
one root, through one law, in one center, the formation of thousands
<br />
of fruits is as easy as that of one fruit. If the formation of fruits
<br />
had been dependent on different, particular centers and roots, and on
<br />
separate, particular laws, then each fruit would have been as
<br />
difficult to form as the tree. Also, if the equipment of a whole army
<br />
is produced in one factory, through one law, and in one center, it
<br />
will be as easy as equipping a single soldier. If, on the contrary,
<br />
the equipment of each soldier is procured from all different places,
<br />
then to equip one soldier there would have to be as many factories as
<br />
for the whole army.
<br />
<br />Just as in these two examples, so too in this well-organized palace,
<br />
this splendid city, this progressive state, this magnificent world, if
<br />
the invention of all these things is attributed to a single being, it
<br />
becomes so easy to account for the infinite abundance, availability,
<br />
and munificence that we see. Otherwise everything would become so
<br />
costly, so difficult, that the whole world would not suffice for
<br />
purchasing a single thing.
<br />
<br />In no way can we have been left to ourselves; we cannot wander about
<br />
and cause disorder among creatures so delicate, well-balanced, subtle,
<br />
skillfully made, and instructive as these.
<br />
<br />Come, O friend, from whom I expect some fairness! We have been here
<br />
for fifteen days (An allusion to the age of fifteen, the age of
<br />
responsibility.) If we do not know the rules of this world and do not
<br />
recognize its rules, we will deserve punishment. We have no longer
<br />
been left any excuses, because for fifteen days, as though given
<br />
respite, we have not been interfered with. But in no way can we have
<br />
been left to ourselves; we cannot wander about and cause disorder
<br />
among creatures so delicate, well-balanced, subtle, skillfully made,
<br />
and instructive as these. The punishment of the majestic lord of this
<br />
land must be severe. How majestic and powerful he must be to have
<br />
arranged this huge world like a palace and turn it as though a light
<br />
wheel. He administers this vast country like a house, missing nothing.
<br />
See, like filling a container and then emptying it, he continuously
<br />
fills this palace, this city, this land, with perfect orderliness, and
<br />
empties it with perfect wisdom. Also, like setting up a table and then
<br />
removing it, he lays out, as though with an unseen hand, throughout
<br />
the land, diverse tables with a great variety of foods one after the
<br />
other and then clears them away to bring new ones. (The tables are to
<br />
denote the face of the earth in summer, during which hundreds of
<br />
tables of the Most Merciful One are prepared fresh and different in
<br />
the kitchens of mercy, and they are laid down and then removed
<br />
continuously. Every garden is a cooking-pot, every tree, a tray-
<br />
bearer.) You see this too, and if you use your reason, you will
<br />
understand that there is an infinite munificence inherent in that
<br />
awesome majesty.
<br />
<br />As whatever is and takes place in this world testifies to its single
<br />
owner and administrator's existence, their disappearance and replaced
<br />
by their likes indicates his permanence
<br />
<br />Also see, just as all these things testify to the unity and
<br />
sovereignty of that unseen being, so too these revolutions and changes
<br />
that happen one after the other in succession bear witness to his
<br />
permanence. For the causes of things disappear along with them,
<br />
whereas the things which we attribute to causes are repeated after
<br />
them. That means, nothing can be attributed to causes; everything
<br />
takes place as the work of an undying one.  For example, the sparkling
<br />
bubbles on the surface of a river come and go, but the new ones coming
<br />
after them also sparkle. That means, what makes them sparkle is
<br />
something constant which stands high above the river and has a
<br />
permanent light. In the same way, the speedy changing in this world
<br />
and the things that replace the disappearing ones assuming the same
<br />
attributes show that they are the manifestations, inscriptions,
<br />
mirrors and works of art, of a single one who is permanent and
<br />
undying.
<br />
<br />The Prophet Muhammad is the greatest proof of the Creator's Existence
<br />
and Oneness
<br />
Come, O friend! Now I will show you another decisive proof as powerful
<br />
as the previous ten proofs put together. Come and let us go on a ship
<br />
and sail to that peninsula over there. For the keys to this mysterious
<br />
world are there. Moreover, everyone is looking to that peninsula, and
<br />
expecting something and receiving orders from there. See, we are
<br />
sailing towards there. Now we have landed on the peninsula.  Look,
<br />
there is a huge meeting, as if all the important people of the country
<br />
have gathered there, there is a great concourse. Look carefully, this
<br />
great community has a leader! (The ship refers to history, the
<br />
peninsula to the place of Time of Happiness, the age of the Prophet,
<br />
upon him be peace and blessings. Taking off the dress of modern
<br />
civilization on the dark shore of this age, sailing on the ship of
<br />
history over the sea of time and landing on the Arabian Peninsula in
<br />
the Time of Happiness, and visiting the Pride of the Creation, upon
<br />
him be peace and blessings, as he is carrying out the duty of his
<br />
mission. We know that he is a proof of Divine Unity so brilliant that
<br />
he illuminates the whole of the earth and the two faces of time, the
<br />
past and future, and disperses the darkness of unbelief and
<br />
misguidance.)
<br />
<br />Come, we will draw nearer; we must be acquainted with him. Look! What
<br />
brilliant decorations he has, more than a thousand of them. (A
<br />
thousand decorations signify the miracles of Muhammad, upon him be
<br />
peace and blessings, which, according to meticulous researchers,
<br />
number around one thousand) How forcefully he speaks!  How pleasant
<br />
his conversation! During these fifteen days I have learnt a little of
<br />
what he says, you could learn the same from me. See, he is speaking
<br />
about the miracle-displaying sovereign of that country. He says that
<br />
that glorious sovereign has sent him to us. See, he is displaying such
<br />
wonders that we are bound to admit that he is a special envoy of the
<br />
sovereign.
<br />
<br />Look carefully, it is not only the creatures on this peninsula that
<br />
are listening to what he says; he is having his voice heard in
<br />
wonderful fashion by the whole country. Near and far, everyone is
<br />
trying to listen to his discourse. Not only human beings but also
<br />
animals are listening to him. Look, even the mountains are listening
<br />
to the commandments he has brought so that they are stirring in their
<br />
places.  Those trees move to the place to which he points. He brings
<br />
forth water wherever he wishes.  He even makes his fingers like an
<br />
abundant spring, and gives to drink from them. Look, that important
<br />
lamp (the moon) in the dome of the palace splits into two at his
<br />
gesture. (The important lamp is the moon, which split into two at his
<br />
gesture. That is, as Mawlana Jami remarked: 'That unlettered one who
<br />
never wrote, wrote with the pen of his finger an alif [the first
<br />
letter of the Arabic alphabet] on the page of the skies and made one
<br />
forty into two fifties.' That is, before it split, the moon resembled
<br />
the Arabic letter mim, the mathematical value of which is forty. After
<br />
splitting, it became two crescents resembling two nuns, the value of
<br />
which is fifty.)
<br />
<br />That means this whole land together with all the beings in it
<br />
recognizes that he is an envoy. As though understanding that he is the
<br />
most eminent and true translator of an unseen miracle-displaying one,
<br />
and the herald of his sovereignty, and the discloser of his talisman,
<br />
and a trustworthy envoy communicating his commandments, they heed and
<br />
obey him. All those around him who are sensible affirm whatever he
<br />
says. Indeed, through submitting to his commands and answering his
<br />
beckoning, everything in this land-the mountains and the trees, etc.-
<br />
and the huge light that illuminates everywhere, also affirm him. (The
<br />
huge light is the sun. On one occasion, the noble Prophet, upon him be
<br />
peace and blessings, was sleeping in the arms of 'Ali, may God be
<br />
pleased with him, who did not wake him up out of deep love and respect
<br />
for him. When the Prophet woke up, the sun was about to set, and 'Ali
<br />
had not been able to perform the afternoon prayer. Upon the Prophet's
<br />
order, the earth revolved a little backwards and the sun appeared
<br />
above the horizon, so 'Ali could perform the prayer. This is one of
<br />
the famous miracles of the Prophet, upon him be peace and blessings.)
<br />
<br />So, O friend! Could there be any lie or deception in the information
<br />
which this most illustrious, magnificent, and serious of beings, who
<br />
bears a thousand decorations from the royal treasury of the king,
<br />
gives with fullest conviction? Could there be any deception in the
<br />
information which is confirmed by all the country's notables, about
<br />
the miracle-displaying king, and in his description of his attributes
<br />
and communication of his commands? If you consider it possible that
<br />
there could be deception in them, then you have to deny this palace,
<br />
those lamps, and this congregation, both their existence and their
<br />
reality. If you can, raise any objections against these, but you will
<br />
see that they will be refuted by the power of the proof.
<br />
<br />The Qur'an is another greatest evidence of God's Existence and Oneness
<br />
Come, O friend, who must have come to your senses a little! I will
<br />
show you further proof as strong as the sum of the previous eleven
<br />
proofs. See this illustrious decree, which had descended from above
<br />
and which everyone looks upon with full attention out of either
<br />
amazement or veneration. That being with a thousand decorations is
<br />
explaining its meaning to everyone. The decree has so brilliant a
<br />
style that it attracts everyone's admiration, and it speaks of matters
<br />
so important and serious that everyone feels compelled to give ear to
<br />
it. For it describes distinctively all the acts, attributes, and
<br />
commands of the one who governs this whole land, who made this palace,
<br />
and exhibits these wonders. And there is a mighty seal on the decree
<br />
as a whole. Look!  There is also an irresistible seal on its every
<br />
line and sentence, and, moreover, the meanings, truths, commandments,
<br />
and instances of wisdom it provides are seen to be in a style
<br />
particular to him which functions like a stamp or seal.
<br />
<br />In short: That supreme decree shows that Supreme Being as clearly as
<br />
the sun, so that anyone who is not blind can 'see' him.
<br />
<br />So, O friend! If you have come to your senses, this is enough for
<br />
now.  Do you still have any objections?
<br />
<br />The stubborn man replied:
<br />
<br />In the face of all these proofs I can only say:  All praise be to God
<br />
for I have come to believe. I believe in a way as bright as the sun
<br />
and clear as daylight that this land has a single Lord of Perfection,
<br />
this world a single Owner of Majesty, this palace a single Maker of
<br />
Grace. May God be pleased with you for saving me from my former
<br />
obstinacy and foolishness. Each of the proofs you have offered is
<br />
sufficient to demonstrate the truth. But with each successive proof,
<br />
clearer and finer, more pleasant, agreeable, radiant levels of
<br />
knowledge, scenes of acquaintanceship, and windows of love, were
<br />
opened and revealed.  I listened and learned.
