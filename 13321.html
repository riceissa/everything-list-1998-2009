'There is no doubt that the nature of consciousness is closely
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; associated with time in some way - but exactly how?  The relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between time (time flow and also causality) may be far closer than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many realize.  Could consciousness in fact be *identical* to time in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some peculiar sense? '
</em><br />
<br />MP: How about: consciousness is simply [ie no more and no less 
<br />
than] the *registration of change* in one's model of 
<br />
self-in-the-world.
<br />
<br />My understanding, from my [admittedly-] shallow but obsessive 
<br />
and persistent reading of abstracts and articles, is that a 
<br />
reasonable case can be made that  sentience in vertebrates can 
<br />
be correlated to the fact of and extent that the outcome of 
<br />
perception and action does not match expectation. The gist of 
<br />
the mechanism is that every time an 'instruction' to move or 
<br />
change perceptual focus is generated and emitted to muscles 
<br />
and/or adaptable sense organs, a matching emission goes to the 
<br />
cerebellum. There the 'expectation' - the amalgamated result of 
<br />
all previous instances - is evoked in concert with the outcome 
<br />
of the current new instance. Any discrepancies are then 
<br />
available for feedback and feed-forward to modulate the activity 
<br />
and warn of potential problems.
<br />
<br />The model of self in the world is just a bunch of network 
<br />
activations which embody/describe/denote/are the situational 
<br />
awareness and navigational controls of the entity. For human 
<br />
beings, who can tell themselves and each other stories, the 
<br />
model of self in the world clearly must include much description 
<br />
of social and personal history. For the model of self in the 
<br />
world to exist [and be any use at all] it must entail 
<br />
representations of currently significant features of the world, 
<br />
currently relevant aspects of 'self', and relevant relationships 
<br />
between self and world. The representation of self incorporates 
<br />
recursive self-references and therefore constitutes a process 
<br />
that is present and unique [and to a great extent 
<br />
unpredictable]. There is therefore something which actually 
<br />
exists. The constant updating of this model of self in the world 
<br />
IS the experience we call consciousness or awareness.
<br />
<br />What we call time can be seen as the story, or sets of stories, 
<br />
we tell ourselves and each other in order to account for the 
<br />
changes that are occurring and to predict and control what we 
<br />
expect to occur. Calling time a 'dimension' therefore, or a set 
<br />
of dimensions, seems to me to be a rather abstract fudge. 
<br />
Enormously useful of course, we couldn't make social 
<br />
appointments or launch space rockets without 'time', but aren't 
<br />
we just reifying a human construct when we do this?
<br />
<br /><br />Regards

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think of time from the third person perspective as being simply a higher
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; spatial dimension above 3 dimensional volume in the same way that 3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dimensional volume exists above 2 dimensional area.  In other words it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; really the same as the other dimensions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So your comment about &quot;3 dimensional time&quot; is sort of right, but it is of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; course actually 4 dimensional.  This means there are connections and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relationships between points in this &quot;hyperspace&quot; that we can't imagine with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; our normal thought process because it is obviously something more than 3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dimensional volume.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, 3-d time would be quite different to the standard 4-d block
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe of general relativity.  Even in relativity, the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimension is not exactly the same as the spatial dimenions.  3-d time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would result in a 6-d block universe (the standard 3-dimensions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space, plus 3 extra time dimensions).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In any event, I've kinda modified my ideas and am not longer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; postulating three time dimenions in a literal sense.  What I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggesting is simply that there may be more than one valid way to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; define causality and it may arise from the fact that there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different levels of organization.  I'm a non-reductionist.  Although I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree there may be physical properties associated with everything,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are many different levels of organization and I'm skeptical that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; higher level properties of systems are entirely reducible to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanations in terms of the lowest level properties.  This would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allow for the possibility of there being more than one valid measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of time flow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This 4 dimensional thing is eternal, and is the multiverse.  Actually that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is not even correct because it implies the passage of an infinite amount of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; time.  Time is ultimately the relationships between things and how those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relationships change.  So for the entire multiverse it exists outside of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; time, or more accurately time exists as a part of it so it does not make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sense to discuss the whole in the context of time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; From the first person point of view the sum is greater than the parts.  No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; individual frame of reference creates an observer moment because it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; obviously takes the passage of some time (passage of time being another way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of saying a string of individual universe frames in the first person point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of view).  Therefore the illusion of time passing and moving in one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; direction is simply a result of the nature of consciousness.  Consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; involves linear thought process and we of course only seem to experience one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; outcome as you follow the line of existence of the SAS (that acronym used to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be used a lot around here!) through the multiverse.  From the 3rd person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; perspective, the existence of the SAS is a 4 dimensional space in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; diagram (covering its existence in every universe it is described in), but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; again from its perspective on the diagram it is a one dimensional line
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; through points in the 4 dimensional hyperspace it existed.  This is of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; course its self-perceived time line.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This idea may give us a theory as to the total information capacity of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; multiverse, which may not be infinite.  It may also explain the holographic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; principal, as suggested by Colin Bruce a few years ago.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no doubt that the nature of consciousness is closely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; associated with time in some way - but exactly how?  The relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between time (time flow and also causality) may be far closer than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many realize.  Could consciousness in fact be *identical* to time in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some peculiar sense?  This is in fact what I'm getting at with my

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggestion that there may be more than one valid way to define
