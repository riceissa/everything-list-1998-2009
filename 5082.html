<br /><br /><br />But then what would be an undecidable proposition?
<br />
<br />You know, about arithmetic, and about machines btw, a lot of
<br />
people defends idea which are just no more plausible since
<br />
Godel has proved its incompleteness theorems.
<br />
Arithmetical proposition are just not tautologies. This is how
<br />
Russell's and Whitehead logicism has break down. There is a ladder
<br />
of arithmetical propositions which ask for more and more
<br />
ingenuity to be proved. Actually arithmetical truth extend far beyond
<br />
the reach of any consistent machine (and consistent human with
<br />
comp). There is an infinity of surprise in there.
<br />
I guess you know that there is no natural number p and q such that
<br />
(p/q)(p/q) is equal to 2. If mathematical truth were conventionnal,
<br />
why did the pythagoreans *hide* this fact for so long?
<br />
So those propositions are neither tautologies, nor conventions.
<br />
David Deutsch, following Johnson's criteria of reality, would say
<br />
that such propositions kick back.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Giving that I hope getting some understanding of the complex human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; from something simpler (number property) the approach of those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; people will never work, for me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;And certainly vice versa. Though it is difficult to have them saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;it explicitely I have the feeling that the reason why they do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;want the natural numbers to be out there and even as not possibly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;being considered as out there is that they do not accept that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;complex human be understood from something simpler (number property).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;They do not even accept the idea being considered, were it as a mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;conjecture or working hypothesis. Their more official argument is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;that such a view would prevent the foundation of human dignity.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Damned!!!  If there is one thing which could prevent the foundation
<br />
of human dignity, it is certainly that totalitarian idea following which
<br />
some ideas can not even be considered as an hypothesis or conjecture.
<br />
But that happens all the time. There has been days you could be burned even
<br />
just because you ask yourself if by chance it was not the sun but
<br />
the earth which was moving. Are you defending those guys? Are you
<br />
asking me how to reply to those guy? My suggestion: if many people
<br />
things like that around you, just leave them. Like Valery said, those who are
<br />
not willing to use logic with you (that is to argument) are in war with you.
<br />
Run or kill them! It is not enough they have good intention, if they does not
<br />
want arguments, they are dangerous for all humans. I like to insist, in Valery
<br />
spirit, that logic is not a question of truth, but of politeness.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have not met any of them physically but I had discussion with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some of them via Internet. There might not be so many of them but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there are. You will find, at least in the US, a lot of people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;considering the views of evolution and/or of the big-bang as evil.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Then what? If they disagree with dialog and argumentation, *I* will
<br />
consider them as evil. (btw I think there are much more people like that
<br />
in France and in Belgium, especially in Belgium, but that's another story).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If they finally have to abandon these positions due to the amount
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of evidence in favor of it, the last line of defence for their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conception of a personal God and for a significant role for Him
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could be at the level of artihmetical realism. Artihmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;realism by itself (not from a distinct personal God) is therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seen as evil by them. As I mentionned, they usually do not put it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that way. Rather they argue that such a view would prevent the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;foundation of human dignity and the like.
</em><br />
<br /><br />They make probably the same confusion of those who believe
<br />
that determinism is in contradiction with free will.
<br />
Actually I tend to think that Godel's and other incompleteness
<br />
result makes comp a sort of vaccine against reductionist view of
<br />
self and reality (and arithmetic).
<br />
You know &quot;reason&quot; works only through doubt, and through the ability
<br />
to listen to different opinions. Now with Godel we can say more,
<br />
which is that &quot;good faith&quot; never fears &quot;reason&quot; and rationality.
<br />
Sincere Faith can only extend Ratio, and is always open to dialog.
