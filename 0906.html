From: Marchal &lt;marchal.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I really think that it is not possible to solve the rabbit problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with Tegmark hypothesis (that all mathematical structures exist),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because it makes the indeterminism domain to big. The more we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make Tegmark's hypothesis precise, the more will it be likely that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we should seen white rabbit flying ...
</em><br />
<br />The general problem here seems to be that if one has a scheme that differs
<br />
in any way from Tegmark's hypothesis, then it is subject to Tegmark's category 1b
<br />
challenge: 'why are only *these* mathematical structures implemented?' or
<br />
'why should *this* mathematical structure be represented more than another?'
<br />
Without its own philosophical justification to compare in profundity to Tegmark's idea
<br />
that the bird view in some sense just *is* the mathematical structure, then
<br />
a putative universal hypothesis has no advantage over any of a number of
<br />
single universe TOE's - it will just be another category 1b casualty. I
<br />
suppose this has to be a personal opinion, but I just don't feel that the
<br />
category of mappings that are provided by the set of all TM's (or an individual
<br />
UTM) can seriously be considered in its own right as providing the deep
<br />
intuitive or philosophical ground for an everything theory. (Neither can I
<br />
see how it can coincide with Tegmark's hypothesis, except perhaps
<br />
fortuitously, though I agree in general terms with Hal that a formal system
<br />
approach might be able to make progress.)
<br />
<br />If this is the case, then the flying rabbit problem still haunts, and no one has provided
<br />
me with a substantive answer to it so far. So, partly for this reason, I shall make a
<br />
try at a solution to the flying rabbit challenge to Tegmark's
<br />
hypothesis. (I should just like to say that my own ideas don't quite coincide with
<br />
those of Tegmark - I don't assume a direct ontological equivalence between some
<br />
mathematical structures and universes - but there is I think a sufficient overlap for
<br />
the solution to work for both, if it is going to work.)  I would be happy for anyone to
<br />
supply rationally-based criticism, or even shoot it down in flames if it deserves it.
<br />
(Sorry if it's been discussed before, but I *have* asked for solutions to
<br />
this problem earlier.)
<br />
<br />The basic idea is that the significant source of measure (for say a
<br />
particular type of universe, or conscious instant) is contained *within* the
<br />
mathematical specification/structure. (Perhaps this idea is obvious to some,
<br />
controversial to others, I am not sure). This internal source of measure
<br />
already occurs with Everett many-worlds - there is an implicit specification
<br />
of multiplication of subjective ('common sense') universes (or conscious
<br />
instants, if one prefers) with unfolding time contained within its overall
<br />
mathematical structure. In general, it does not seem unreasonable to suppose
<br />
that there is some maximal fecundity of universes per information unit that
<br />
is possible within any mathematical structure; that is, for any given length
<br />
of bit string then the highest measure of universes will be associated with those
<br />
specifications (bit string combinations) which have the highest proportion devoted
<br />
to specifying maximal copies/variations of universes. It follows from this
<br />
that for any countable bit string length, and considering all possible bit
<br />
combinations within that length, we are most likely to be in one of those
<br />
universes that are part of one of these specifications, subject to having just
<br />
enough bits 'left over' to generate/specify sufficient complexity for
<br />
intelligent life to be present - in other words, a universe with the simplest possible
<br />
physical laws conducive to sentience ... and so no flying rabbits. (This solution does
<br />
also happen to tend to favour Everett many-worlds over several other
<br />
hypotheses (for us), because the multiplicity/splitting serves the dual purpose of
<br />
fecundity, and variation necessary for life, but the splitting could well be
<br />
the tip of the fecundity iceburg.)
