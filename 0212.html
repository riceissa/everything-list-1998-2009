<br />I wonder if there couldn't be another possibility, neither determinism, nor

randomness, but free will, which I agree to be something rather mysterious.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person making a decision, without getting into algorithmic details.
</em><br />
<br />This idea of description levels seems very important to me. This is perhaps
<br />
the key idea for understanding the spirit and its properties, consciousness,
<br />
free will and creative intelligence.
<br />
My idea is that the universe, and the living beings in particular, could be
<br />
made of an infinity of material organization levels : body, cell, molecule,
<br />
atom, particle, quark, ..., with different physical laws at each level. In
<br />
this case a human being cannot be considered as a finite machine, since he's
<br />
infinite in the infinitely small. Any physical theory is only approximation
<br />
of the physical reality. In fact, the physical reality could be just an
<br />
infinite mathematical theory, defined by an infinite converging sequence of
<br />
finite theories. In this model, the spirit would be relative to the
<br />
considered level : if X1 is not explained by some theory T1, then X1 belongs
<br />
to the domain of spirit relatively to this theory T1. But there exist a more
<br />
precise theory T2 which explains X1. Then X1 belongs to the domain of matter
<br />
according to T2. But there exist another X2 which T2 does not explain, and
<br />
which belongs to spirit relatively to T2. But there exist a more precise
<br />
theory T3 which explains X2, and so on... Spirit would be something tending
<br />
to nothing without reaching it.

<br />
<br />I see also an analogy with Feferman's transfinite iteration of the
<br />
reflection principle on formal systems : for a theory T0, there exist a
<br />
Godel proposition G0 which is true but not provable in T0. But by adding
<br />
reflection to T0 we can obtain a more complete theory T1 in which G0 is
<br />
probable. But T1 is itself a finite theory, and we can construct another G1
<br />
which is true but not provable in T1, and so on...
<br />
Adding reflection is a mechanical construct, but this leads to an infinite
<br />
sequence T0, T1, T2... which we can integrate in one theory Tw (w = omega),
<br />
and we can go on with Tw+1... giving a transfinite sequence of theories.
<br />
Generating the sequence of transfinite ordinals is a creative, not
<br />
mechanizable process, which requires creative intelligence to perceive
<br />
regularities when we fall in a loop, to skip out of the loop.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	The above paragraph makes no sense to me.
</em><br />
<br />I meant that a decision is significant if it consists in chosing to act in a
<br />
certain way which makes real a certain state of the world, excluding other
<br />
states led by other possible (but not actualized) acts.
<br />
If every possible decision is made in one world, there is no real decision
<br />
in this sense. It does not make sense to ask ourself which decision we
<br />
should take to obtain a state of the world which we consider as good if
<br />
anyway every possible decision is taken in some world and then every
<br />
possible state of the world is real is one world.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;	This is the part that got me riled up.  Pascal's bet is the height
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of stupidity.  I'd rather live as an atheist and go to hell than spend an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;eternity kissing up to a god so evil and self centered that he'd send me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to hell just for not believing in him when I had no evidence.
</em><br />
<br />The subject of Pascal's Bet is not whether an eternity in Paradise is a good
<br />
thing or not, it's that supposing it has an infinite value, then for any
<br />
probability p that we will spend an infinite time in Paradise if we behave
<br />
well, the corresponding value (infinite times a finite probability) is
<br />
infinite. But you're right in the sense that Pascal forgot that there is
<br />
also a (rather strange) possibility that we suffer for an infinite time if
<br />
we behave well. Suppose this has probability p'. Then the value of behaving
<br />
well would be (p - p') * infinite. In fact we should behave well only if we
<br />
believe that p &gt; p'.
<br />
<br />Concerning decision theory, it's not exactly the same situation : 
<br />
Let P be the proposition : &quot;Decisions has no sense&quot; (for example if MWI is
<br />
true or if everything is predeterminated), and suppose P has probability p
<br />
to be true, according to our knowledge of the world.
<br />
Let A be the choice of acting as if decisions make sense, and B as it does
<br />
not.
<br />
This leads to 4 possibilities :
<br />
~P, A : Decisions make sense and know it, I take them knowing it make sense,
<br />
trying to take the correct decision. This situation has a positive value v.
<br />
P, A : Decisions does not make sense, but I think they do. I do not really
<br />
have the choice of thinking decisions make sense or not. At the global
<br />
level, everythink is determinated. No good, no bad, all that can happen
<br />
happens. I would attribute a value 0 to this situation.
<br />
~P, B : Decision make sense, but I am convinced thai in fact they don't.
<br />
This is the catastrophic situation. I don't make any effort to take the
<br />
correct decision, thinking it does not make sense.This situation has a
<br />
negative value -v'.
<br />
P, B : Decisions does not make sense and I know it, and I don't have the
<br />
possibility of thinking anything else. This situation has also the value 0.
<br />
In summary, taking in account the probabilities, choice A has value (1-p) *
<br />
v + p * 0 = (1-p) * v, and choice B has value (1-p) * (-v') + p * 0 = -
<br />
(1-p) * v'.
<br />
For any p, the value of A is greater than the value of B, then we should
<br />
chose A.

Interesting idea. But these laws of physics should be infinite if we are not

machines.
