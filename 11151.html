<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; kill yourself (because you say it to yourself and because you have the means)

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; should, over many bets, swing the odds in your favour in the universes in which

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you survive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then merely the small probability of commiting suicide in an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unfavourable universe because of psychological reasons would swing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; odds towards being in a favourable one. In addition, weak persons,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely to commit suicide under harsh conditions, would have higher
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability of experiencing favourable histories.
</em><br />
<br />I think that would be a prediction of QTI - but only from a first person perspective. 
<br />
As in Tegmark's original QS thought experiment, from everyone else's point of view, 
<br />
the physicist will very likely be killed. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, you would not want to experience the suicide part. Otherwise,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what would any instance of you gain from actually doing it? Why would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it care for other instances of you reaping the benefits? Itself would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still suffer death. It might as well avoid all risk taking confort in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the idea that other instances are using the QTI money-making scheme or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are just being lucky. For the idea to make sense, it is key to avoid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiencing anything after the dice are thrown.
</em><br />
<br />This is the most immediate response of people to the QTI idea: even if it's true, 
<br />
what do I care if other versions of me survive in the multiverse if I'm going to die? 
<br />
The problem is, you can arbitrarily divide up the moments of your life and say that, 
<br />
for example, you were alive from 2:50 PM to 2:51 PM, then suddenly vanished 
<br />
from the universe (i.e. you were instantly and painlessly killed), then a perfect copy 
<br />
of you suddenly appeared at 2:51 PM and lived another minute. What would you notice 
<br />
if this happened? Would you worry about dying? I put it to you that this is precisely 
<br />
what *does* happen, perfectly seamlessly from your point of view, every moment 
<br />
of your life. The version of you alive at 2:50 PM today is as thoroughly and completely 
<br />
dead from your point of view at 2:52 PM as if a nuclear bomb had been detonated on 
<br />
top of you at the earlier time. The disadvantage of the nuclear bomb scenario in a single 
<br />
branch existence is that the perfect copy of you would not eventuate as a result; but 
<br />
in the MWI, the perfect copy would eventuate, somewhere. It is understandable that 
<br />
you might still worry the &quot;real&quot; you would have died, but this is like worrying that the 
<br />
&quot;real&quot; you died at 2:51 PM, or died in the teleporter, and the present you is just a very 
<br />
good copy, complete with false memories.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the factoring scheme you need some time to check the solution, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you would end up checking the solution and by the time you find that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you have a wrong answer it is too late, bang and, if QTI holds,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; miraculous escape. For the scheme to work, the solution being wrong
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be equivallent to you not existing. With original QTI and death
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is already the case.
</em><br />
<br />You would still end up dead in most worlds from a third person POV though, wouldn't 
<br />
you? That seems the main impediment to actually conducting a QS-type experiment (aside 
<br />
from the possibility that all this MWI stuff is just wrong, of course). Even in my scheme where 
<br />
there is just a possibility of death some calculations I have done suggest that if you could 
<br />
demonstrate that your success rate after many bets was better than chance to a statistically 
<br />
significant extent, your chance of dying would also have to be statistically significant. It's 
<br />
as if the multiverse is conspiring against us to prevent us from proving its existence!
