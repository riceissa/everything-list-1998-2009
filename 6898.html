<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But in general, what do observer-moments explain? Or what does the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothesis concerning them explain?  I just don't get a good feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there are any &quot;higher level&quot; phenomena which might be reduced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to observer-moments (I am still very skeptical that all of physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or math or something could be reduced to them---but if that is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is meant, I stand corrected). Rather, it always seems like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a number of (other) people are trying to explain observer-moments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as arising from the activity of a Universal Dovetailer, or a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonic ensemble of bit strings, or something.
</em><br />
<br />I would say that observer-moments are what need explaining, rather than
<br />
things that do the explaining.  Or you could say that in a sense they
<br />
&quot;explain&quot; our experiences, although I think of them more as *being*
<br />
our experiences, moment by moment.  As we agreed:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; An observer-moment is really all we have as our primary experience of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the world.  The world around us may be fake; we may be in the Matrix or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a brain in a vat.  Even our memories may be fake.  But the fact that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are having particular experiences at a particular moment cannot be faked.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nothing could be truer.
</em><br />
<br />That is the sense in which I say that observer-moments are primary;
<br />
they are the most fundamental experience we have of the world.
<br />
Everything else is only a theory which is built upon the raw existence
<br />
of observer-moments.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In terms of measure, Schmidhuber (and possibly Tegmark) provides a means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to estimate the measure of a universe.  Consider the fraction of all bit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; strings that create that universe as its measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that perhaps I know exactly what is meant; but I'm unwilling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to take the chance. Let's say that we have a universe U, and now we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want to find its measure (its share of the mega-multi-Everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resources).  So, as you write, we consider all the bit strings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that create U.  Let's say for concreteness that only five bit strings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;really exist&quot; in some deep sense:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 010101110100101010011101010110001010110101...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 101101110100010101111111001011010110100101...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 001010100111010100111010001001000010101111...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 11011101000100100001010l110110000101010011...   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 110010111010101110100010000101001010011111...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and then it just so happens that only 2 out of these five actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make the universe U manifest. That is, in the innards of 2 of these,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one finds all the structures that U contains. Am I following so far?
</em><br />
<br />In the Schmidhuber picture, it's not that the strings contain U,
<br />
rather the strings are programs which when run on some UTM produce
<br />
U as the output.  This corresponds to the concept you mention below,
<br />
the Kolmogorov complexity.  KC is based on the length of programs that
<br />
output the objects (strings, or universes, or any other information
<br />
based entity).  Measure as I am using it is 1/2^KC where KC is the
<br />
Kolmogorov complexity of an object.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In practice this is roughly 1/2^n where n is the size of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; shortest program that outputs that universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So each of these universes (each of the five, in my toy example)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has a certain Kolmogorov complexity?  Each of the five can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; output by some program?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I think this is equivalent to my conception, although when I spoke
<br />
of bit strings I was thinking of the inputs to the UTM while you are
<br />
talking about the outputs.  But the basic idea is the same.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But is that program infinite or finite?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Argument for finite: normally we want to speak of *short* programs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and so that seems to indicate the program has a limited size.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Argument for infinite: dramatically *few* bit strings that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite in length have just a finite amount of information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our infinite level-one Tegmark universe, for example, probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is tiled by Hubble volumes in a non-repeating irregular way so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that no program could output it.
</em><br />
<br />Now I think we are both talking about the inputs to the UTM.  Should
<br />
we consider infinite length inputs?
<br />
<br />I don't think it is necessary, for three reasons.  First, due to the
<br />
way TM's work, in practice a random tape will only have some specific
<br />
number of input bits that ever get used.  The chance of an infinite
<br />
number of bits being used is zero.  Second, you could construct tapes
<br />
which used an infinite number of bits, but they would be of measure zero
<br />
and hence would make no detectable contribution to the actual numeric
<br />
predictions of the theory.  Third, there are variants on UTMs which
<br />
only accept self-delimiting input tapes that have, in effect, lengths
<br />
that are easily determined.  Greg Chaitin's work focuses on the use of
<br />
self-delimiting programs to achieve a more precise picture of algorithmic
<br />
complexity (which is equivalent to KC).  The lengths of such programs
<br />
are inherently finite.  These UTMs are equivalent to all others.
<br />
<br />Note that you could, I think, create an infinite universe even using a
<br />
finite tape.  I believe that our universe, even if infinite in Tegmark's
<br />
level-one sense, could be output by a finite program, at least in an
<br />
MWI model.  The amount of information in such a universe is roughly zero;
<br />
all of the order that we see around us is due to splitting of universes.
<br />
