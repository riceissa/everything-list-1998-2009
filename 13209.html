</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The whole point of Godel's proof is that, exactly like you can define 
<br />
&quot;prime&quot; in the language of Peano Arithmetic PA (or weaker non lobian 
<br />
entity like Robinson Arithmetic),  you *can* define &quot;being the godel 
<br />
number of a proof by PA&quot;  *in* PA.
<br />
<br />In all situation, when we are using a language we have to agree on some 
<br />
convention. Even the question &quot;is the number 12345678987654321 prime or 
<br />
not&quot; presuppose the conventional use of base ten position notation for 
<br />
number and the arithmetical definition of primeness.
<br />
The same occurs for the notion of arithmetical provability.
<br />
Of course the finite string &quot;12345678987654321&quot; could be a godel number 
<br />
of a proof or not depending of the way you represent the variable or 
<br />
the quantifier or the connector in term of numbers, but the *string* 
<br />
&quot;12345678987654321&quot; will represent a prime number or not according to 
<br />
the way you represent decimal numbers in Pean Arithmetic. It is just 
<br />
because we already agree, since high-school, on conventional notation 
<br />
for number that you can directly talk about the *number* 
<br />
123456787654321&quot;.  If we would have learn in high school some canonical 
<br />
way to represent proof (in PA) by numbers, like those used to explain 
<br />
to PA what a proof is, I would have been able to say yes or no 
<br />
directly.
<br />
<br />Now, concerning Peano Arithmetic (PA), obviously (ask if not) 
<br />
12345678987654321 is NOT the godel number of a proof of f 
<br />
(independently of any choiçce of proof representation). This is because 
<br />
PA is consistent, so no number can represent a  proof of a falsity f.
<br />
And a lobian machine like ZF can prove that.
<br />
<br />Note that, although Stathis defends many argument which are going in 
<br />
the direction of the ultimate consequence of comp, I do agree with some 
<br />
critics you are doing here and there. To believe that the observer 
<br />
moment OM are disconnected is perhaps a remnant ASSA thought (Absolute 
<br />
Self Sampling Assumption).
<br />
<br />Let us try to be a little more specific. From a computational point of 
<br />
view, a computation can be considered equivalent with a proof of an 
<br />
arithmetical statement having the shape &quot;it exists a number having this 
<br />
or that decidable property&quot;, that is &quot;En P(n)&quot; (it exists a n such that 
<br />
P(n)). So the universal dovetailer infinite execution is equivalent 
<br />
with the set of true Sigma1 sentences together with their proofs. So we 
<br />
can define easily a notion of atomical (primitive) third person 
<br />
&quot;Observer Moment&quot; by them. I put OM in quotes, because strictly 
<br />
speaking OM are conceived as first person experience and not as third 
<br />
person computational states. The UD Argument does force us to take 
<br />
those distinction into account. In particular it  shows that, to 
<br />
predict anything physical, among other things, we have to define a 
<br />
notion of first person plural indeterminacy, bearing on the OMs as seen 
<br />
by a machine itself embedded in UD*.
<br />
<br />What happens is that each internal view, or hypostases, like the first 
<br />
plural person points of view, are defining a non trivial (thanks to 
<br />
Godel &amp; Co.) mathematical and quasi geometrical structure on the OMs. 
<br />
That is each hypostases relate the OMs. They single out arithmetical 
<br />
relations in between the OMs. They remains disconnected, in a sense, 
<br />
like the numbers themselves can be considered disconnected. But of 
<br />
course, numbers are connected to each other by the usual arithmetical 
<br />
relations (definable in term of sums and products), and when the 
<br />
internal points of view are taken into account, we got for each of them 
<br />
a collection of different connections. If you recall some of my older 
<br />
post, the three primary hypostases rise Kripke multiverses, and the 
<br />
secondary (material, physical, natuiral) hypostases rise Scot-Montague 
<br />
sort of continuum topological multiverses, where the OMs appears to be 
<br />
as connected as &quot;points&quot; on continuous manifolds.
<br />
<br />Now if comp is correct, it is expected that the relations between the 
<br />
OMs, from some first person point of view, restricted to the atomical 
<br />
Sigma1 propositions (by the UDA) gives rise to the laws of physics, 
<br />
defined by what is invariant for all observer point of views (arguably 
<br />
given by the third or fourth or fifth &quot;hypostases&quot;). Those are indeed 
<br />
the one which technically give purely arithmetical interpretation of 
<br />
Quantum Logic, the real signification of which remains to be seen (to 
<br />
be sure).
<br />
<br />The lobian machine already gives some clues that a *physical* 
<br />
computation has to be given by a unitary transformation (and thus a 
<br />
solution of the SWE). I don't obtain quantum entanglement, because I am 
<br />
still unable to recover arithmetical tensor products. This is a bit 
<br />
ironical, giving that &quot;non locality&quot; (a typical feature of quantum 
<br />
entanglement) is the easiest consequence about the physical world that 
<br />
we can derive from UDA, but apparently, when interviewing the lobian 
<br />
machine, it appears to be rather well hidden.
<br />
<br />Obviously, the comp-physics is not yet as elaborated than current 
<br />
modern physics. But thanks to the fundamental difference between G and 
<br />
G*, inherited by most &quot;material (first person plural) intensional 
<br />
(modal) variant&quot; of it, the lobian interview does not eliminate the 
<br />
mind or the first person views, with all their un-communicable 
<br />
sensations and qualia. here the comp physics is in advanced compared to 
<br />
the physicists who, in majority, are still attaching their feet to the 
<br />
primary Aristotelian matter bullet.
<br />
<br />To be sure, I love Aristotle. His theology is enough precise to be 
<br />
falsified. And, as I explained in my last (SIENA) paper, Plotinus 
<br />
theory of Matter is really the theory of Aristotle reconsidered in the 
<br />
Platonic theology.
