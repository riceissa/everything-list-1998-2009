Answering the last question first, &quot;Do you find this perspective 
<br />
useful?&quot;...
<br />
<br />I'm not yet convinced of any of the utility of the MWI for any bet or 
<br />
action, but I certainly think you are pursuing something that _might_ 
<br />
be interesting or even useful, with a kind of &quot;quantum decision theory&quot; 
<br />
view. But I've yet to see anything convincing.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general than the former, because all local optimizers can be modeled as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; global optimizers with a special form of utility function.
</em><br />
<br />I would like to see some better examples of what these &quot;take into 
<br />
account what one believes to be happening in other branches&quot; decisions 
<br />
or optimizations might be.
<br />
<br />If in fact the branches are unreachable to us, then causally there can 
<br />
be no effect of one branch on another. From the causal decision theory 
<br />
I believe you support (Joyce's book), this is just about a perfect 
<br />
example of where causal decision theory says &quot;no causal link.&quot;
<br />
<br />Now, as I discussed in reply to Hal, there's much evidence that what 
<br />
people _believe_ affects their actions in this world, this branch. But 
<br />
this is true without recourse to many worlds theories. A person's 
<br />
belief in an afterlife usually affects his actions in this life. 
<br />
Examples abound, and were we talking or arguing in the room I described 
<br />
in my first post today, we might consider a bunch of them.
<br />
<br />R.I.G. Hughes, in &quot;The Structure and Interpretation of Quantum 
<br />
Mechanics,&quot; 1989, discusses this issue of betting in a MWI environment:
<br />
<br />(late in the book, after much discussion of operators, lattices         
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;propositions, measurements, interpretations, probability 
<br />
measures, etc.)
<br />
<br />&quot;But what, on Everett's account, has become of the world which is 
<br />
actual in Lewis's? If there is no such privileged world, then something 
<br />
odd happens to our conception of probability. For if _all_ (relevant) 
<br />
events with nonzero probability are realized in some world or other, 
<br />
then are not all those events certain of occurrence? (This was pointed 
<br />
out by Healey, 1984, p 593.) And if I wager on what the outcome of a 
<br />
measurement will be, will it not pay &quot;me&quot; to place my bet on whatever 
<br />
outcome is quoted at the highest odds, without regard to the 
<br />
probabilities involved? ...... (Before an epidemic of long-odds betting 
<br />
is upon us, however, I should add that even the National Security 
<br />
Council would be hard put to divert funds from my Swiss bank account in 
<br />
one world to its counterpart in another.)
<br />
<br />&quot;These levities aside, we may ask what new understanding of the 
<br />
measurement process MWI gives us. After a measurement each observer 
<br />
will inhabit a world (for her the actual world) in which a particular 
<br />
result of the measurement has occurred. And the &quot;total lack of effect 
<br />
of one branch on another also implies that no observer will ever be 
<br />
aware of any 'splitting' process&quot; (Everett, 1947, p. 147n).  What is 
<br />
this observer to say about the physical process which has just 
<br />
occurred? From where she stands, the wave packet has collapsed no less 
<br />
mysteriously , albeit no more so, than before.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We are still left with the dualism that the interpretation sought to 
<br />
eradicate. As de Witt (1970, pp. 164-165) himself remarks, the 
<br />
many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics &quot;leads to experimental 
<br />
predictions identical with the (dualist) Copenhagen view.&quot;&quot;
<br />
<br />(p. 293)
<br />
<br />(Tim again.) Now we all know this, but it makes the point that 
<br />
probabilities are calculated identically in both interpretations.
<br />
<br />If Wei can find a way, no pun intended, to show that &quot;quantum decision 
<br />
theory&quot; produces different results OTHER THAN THOSE BASED ONLY ON THE 
<br />
BELIEF ITSELF, this would seem to contradict the &quot;identical 
<br />
experimental predictions&quot; and would be an important contribution.
<br />
<br />(Excluding results based only on the &quot;BELIEF ITSELF&quot; means that it is 
<br />
not kosher or persuasive to argue that because someone's belief changes 
<br />
their actions it must mean that the belief is correct. If this were 
<br />
allowed, Allah's suicide bombers would be proof that Islam is right, 
<br />
and so on, for every religious and other belief.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My point is that since there doesn't seem to be a reason to disallow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; global optimization, it shouldn't be ruled out. I'm interested in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a decision theory that allows global optimization and want to know its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practical and philosophical consequences.
</em><br />
<br />I would rule it out in terms of causal decision theory by the very fact 
<br />
that the standard model (of MWI) posits no causal flow amongst 
<br />
branches. So, by the most basic sort of CDT, how could actions in one 
<br />
branch affect things in other branches?
<br />
<br />As Joyce puts it, initially quoting Allan Gibbard and William Harper,
<br />
<br />&quot; &quot;The &quot;utility&quot; of an act should be its expected efficacy in bringing 
<br />
about states of affairs the agent wants, not the degree to which news 
<br />
of the act ought to cheer the agent....&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;The point here is that rational decision makers should choose actions 
<br />
on the basis of their _efficacy in bringing out desirable results_ 
<br />
rather than their auspiciousness as harbingers of these results.&quot;
<br />
<br />(p. 150, &quot;The Foundations of Causal Decision Theory,&quot; 1999.)
<br />
<br />Now in Hal's retelling of your model, Alice occasionally chooses 
<br />
non-optimal choices of rewards in a game of chance precisely because 
<br />
she hopes that other Alices in other worlds will do the same and that 
<br />
this will increase diversity in the Multiverse. But how can such 
<br />
behavior in other worlds affect _her_ world, the world where she made a 
<br />
sub-optimal choice? Isn't this the &quot;good news&quot; fallacy writ large?
<br />
<br />(By the way, there is an interpretation under which Alice sometimes 
<br />
does &quot;the unexpected&quot; because it adds to her own joy in her own 
<br />
universe. One might say that &quot;sometimes picking a non-optimal result 
<br />
makes here a more interesting person.&quot; But this is all done with 
<br />
conventional single-track notions of probability, of &quot;karma&quot; (in the 
<br />
personality sense, not in a religious sense), etc. Sometimes doing the 
<br />
unexpected also may enhance her survival (landscape exploration) or 
<br />
problem-solving, by having new experiences of vantage points. Google 
<br />
has an &quot;I'm feeling lucky&quot; button on its search pane, and casting I 
<br />
Ching or Tarot cards may have the &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; effects 
<br />
for some. All of these actually involve &quot;meta-optimizing&quot; Alice even by 
<br />
locally choosing non-optimal results sometimes. An appeal to Alice' and 
<br />
Alice'', etc., in other branches is neither useful nor helpful, as I 
<br />
see things.)
<br />
<br />If you guys can think of some better examples, I'll be very interested.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the question of QS, I think all QS'ers can also be modeled as global
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; optimizers with a special form of utility function. From this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the disagreement between QS'ers and local optimizers like Tim can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a difference of opinion on what kind of utility function one should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have. (Personally I'm not convinced by either side and I'm not sure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer the question myself.) Do you find this perspective useful?
</em><br />
<br />As I said, I think your quest is potentially useful. If you come up 
<br />
with actual predictions which differ from normal predictions--modulo 
<br />
the point that they are not based on Alice's &quot;belief&quot; qua belief--then 
<br />
you will have perhaps _experimentally_ distinguished MWI from other 
<br />
interpretations, something no one has been able to do so far.
<br />
<br /><br />But such an extraordinary result will require much debate before many 
<br />
of us are persuaded.
<br />
<br />Good luck! (Imagine, in a large number of universes you have already 
<br />
found such a proof...the challenge is getting it to those of us in this 
<br />
our only universe.)
