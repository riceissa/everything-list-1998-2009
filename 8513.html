<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why does an OM need to contain so much information to link it to other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OMs making up a person?  [the complete message is below].
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure I understand. Are you saying, like Saibal Mitra, that OMs 
<br />
(Observer-Moments) are not related? How, in this case, would you 
<br />
interpret your own talk about &quot;next observer moment&quot; (those which could 
<br />
be dead end)?
<br />
Is there not a confusion between the idea of physicalist (causal) view 
<br />
of the relation between OMs (which, as Brent meeker said should be 
<br />
explained from a more primitive (mathematical, immaterial, not causal, 
<br />
...)  notion of OM, with those very (more primitive) OMs.
<br />
Are you assuming some notion of multiverse richer than (or just 
<br />
different from) a notion of multi-OMs?
<br />
<br />At least, when you &quot;interview&quot; a sound lobian machine on such questions 
<br />
(through the modal logic G), or better when you interview its &quot;guardian 
<br />
angel&quot; (through its modal logic G*), you can understand that the 
<br />
&quot;ultimate&quot; multiverse can reasonably be said not having structure, and 
<br />
that multiverse-structures *appear* for each notion of self-referential 
<br />
points of view (not necessarily first person pov). The first person pov 
<br />
makes the &quot;multiverse&quot; a temporal structure, the first person plural 
<br />
pov makes the multiverse a quantum probability structure.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***
<br />
<br />Mmmmmhhhhhh.... I know this could look like jargon. Let me give &quot;easy&quot; 
<br />
exercises for anybody following this list.
<br />
<br />Let me define a  Multiverse (called also &quot;frame&quot; by Kripke) as any 
<br />
non-empty set  W together with an accessibility relation R defined on 
<br />
the set. Elements of that set are called &quot;world&quot;, by definition, and I 
<br />
follow the convention to denote worlds by greek letters (or their 
<br />
english transcription: alpha, beta, gamma, delta, eta, epsilon, iota, 
<br />
kappa, omega, nu, theta, etc.). R is called the accessibility relation.
<br />
So the simplest  example of multiverse is given by the set {alpha} +  
<br />
the empty relation (so just one dead end!). Another example is the set 
<br />
of natural numbers with the divisibility relation ( n R m iff n divide 
<br />
m iff there is a k such that n * k = m).
<br />
<br /><br />Let me define a notion of illuminated multiverse (called &quot;model&quot; by the 
<br />
modal logicians). It is just a Kripke multiverse where we associate to 
<br />
each world a value 1 or 0 to each sentence letter. The Kripke 
<br />
multiverse is &quot;illuminated&quot; when a truth value (1 or 0) is assigned to 
<br />
each proposition, in each world.
<br />
Remember that in (propositional) logic we have sentence letter p, q, r, 
<br />
etc.
<br />
We also say that p is true in alpha for p has value 1 in alpha (in some 
<br />
illuminated multiverse).
<br />
<br /><br />Now Kripke semantics can be given in a very simple way, by just asking 
<br />
that,
<br />
<br />1) each world obeys to classical logic (that is: if 1 is assigned to p 
<br />
in the world alpha, and if 1 is assigned to q in alpha, then 1 is 
<br />
assigned to (p &amp; q) in alpha, etc. The &quot;etc&quot; is just a pointer to the 
<br />
usual truth table of classical propositional logic. I have already 
<br />
explain this on this list but I can do it again if asked). In 
<br />
particular each classical tautologies are true in all worlds, whatver 
<br />
the illumination chosen (whatever the truth value of the sentence 
<br />
letter are in each world: like (p -&gt; p) or (p v ~p), etc.
<br />
<br />2) Kripke says that Bp (also written box p, []p, etc.) is true in the 
<br />
world alpha if p is true in all worlds beta accessible from alpha. From 
<br />
this it follows that Dp (defined as an abbreviation of ~B~p) will be 
<br />
true in some world alpha if there is some world beta, accessible from 
<br />
alpha, and with p true in the world beta.
<br />
<br />Now I will say that a formula A of modal logic is valid in a 
<br />
illuminated multiverse (W, R, V)  if A is true in all the worlds of 
<br />
that illuminated multiverse.
<br />
<br />And I will say that a formula A of modal logic is respected by a 
<br />
multiverse (W,R)  if A is valid
<br />
in all illuminated multiverse (W, R, V). Or equivalently: A is 
<br />
respected in (W,R)  if A is true in all worlds in W and this for all 
<br />
&quot;illuminations&quot; V, i.e. for all assignment of truth value of the 
<br />
sentence letters in all worlds.
<br />
<br />Last definition: a multiverse (W,R) is said to be reflexive if the 
<br />
relation R is reflexive (that is: if for all world in W we have xRx, 
<br />
i.e. if each world is accessible to itself by the relation R.
<br />
<br />The easy exercise is the following: show that if the multiverse is 
<br />
reflexive then the multiverse respects the formula Bp -&gt; p.
<br />
<br />Slightly less easy: show that the reverse is true: show that if a 
<br />
multiverse respects Bp -&gt; p, then the multiverse is reflexive.
<br />
<br />I would like to know if that exercise *seems* difficult. For those who 
<br />
cannot do it, it just means there is a need to refresh some &quot;naive set 
<br />
theory&quot; knowledge, and I will think about a book who can help.
<br />
<br />Don't hesitate to answer out of line if you prefer.
<br />
<br />Sorry to annoy you with that modal stuff, but we are at a point I could 
<br />
no more comment the posts without making nuances which will resemble 
<br />
jargon if you don't invest a little bit in modal logic. This, by the 
<br />
way, could provide us with a language capable of  make clearer many 
<br />
other &quot;everything-like philosophy clearer.

<br /><br />The complete original message by Stathis Papaioannou:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why does an OM need to contain so much information to link it to other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OMs making up a person? I certainly don't spend every waking moment 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reminding myself of who I am, let alone going over my entire past 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history, and I still think all my thoughts are my thoughts. I don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think that the fact these thoughts are contained in my head makes the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference, because as you seemed to agree, continuity of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness can in theory extend over discontinuities in time and/or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space, as in teleportation. On the other hand, I could suddenly become 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychotic and as a result believe I am a completely different person, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with a different past; or perhaps my mind could be taken over by an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alien intelligence with a similar effect. As for one OM potentially 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representing a thought from thousands of different people, that is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly what happens in the multiverse and is one of the key 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; advantages of the concept. Suppose you and I happened to have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *exactly* the same subjective experience at a particular time, say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seeing a red shape on a white wall at the age of two. This would mean 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that, for that moment, your mind and my mind could have been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interchanged, or one of our two minds could have been temporarily 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suspended, without making any subjective difference to either of us. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An external observer monitoring my body might have noticed a momentary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; blankness if my mental processes were suspended at the moment of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coincidence, but as far as I was concerned, it would have been exactly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same as if I were teleported away to have the red shape experience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which I would have had anyway) and teleported back.

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we mean by a

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; order to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; define persons by causal continuity.  I thought the point of OMs

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was to provide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a fundamental ontology from which spacetime would be constructed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; While it always seems in real life, as in my example, that there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; a causal connection between related OMs, this need not necessarily 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; be the case. For a2 to think, &quot;I stepped into the teleporter a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; moment ago&quot; and to consider himself the person a1a2, it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; sufficient simply that a2 exist. That is, given that a2 exists, it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; makes no difference whether there is information transfer from a1 to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; a2, whether a1 precedes a2, or whether a1 exists at all. In general, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; if the only thing that exists is the set of all possible OMs, not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; ordered in any particular way and each OM completely independent and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; isolated, then the apparent multiverse with its complex physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; laws results as an emergent phenomenon, or if you prefer, an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; illusion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That's taking an OM to be like Barbour's time capsule.  They are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ordered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; according to their contents.  a1a2's OM with the thought that he was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; teleporter and was a1, connects to a1's OM with the thought that now 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; stepping into a teleporter.  But that brings me back to my objection 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to OMs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Barbour's time capsules contain whole states of the world.  OMs don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; enough information to provide the specificity required for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; connections.  a1a2's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OM thought could be the thought of thousands of other people.  To be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sure, if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; take a sequence of a1a2's thoughts and lump them into one OM then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that OM will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have enough information to place in a unique sequence indentifying a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But then we've really assumed the thing to be explained.
