Dear Tim,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for the reply but ... Well, I did not mean to imply that we
<br />
should &quot;look to Egan's fictional character for actual theories&quot; or any other
<br />
novel or fiction... I think that I asked you a similar question before
<br />
regarding the idea that Egan is discussing using the fictional character of
<br />
Mosala. I am trying to see if you understood the idea well enough to discuss
<br />
it with me. It seems that my question below got missed somehow.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scerir mentioned the following paper previously:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110124">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110124</a>

<br />
<br />Is there a real time ordering behind the nonlocal correlations?
<br />
Authors: Antoine Suarez
<br />
Comments: 4 pages Latex, 1 eps figure
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It is argued that recent experiments with moving beam-splitters
<br />
demonstrate that there is no real time ordering behind the nonlocal
<br />
correlations: In Bell's world there is no &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you get a chance to read it perhaps my terms &quot;a priori&quot; and &quot;a
<br />
posteriori&quot; might make some sense. ;-) I have been looking for Smolin's book
<br />
in my local bookstore. I will try again. Incidentally, I have read books by
<br />
most of the writters you mention! I too am very fond of Zindell's Neverness.
<br />
;-)
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
<br />
<br />Stephen

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Dear Tim and scerir,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     I am VERY interested in this discussion! ;-) It seems to me that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that the amplitudes of observables in QM are complex valued and thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; obey trichotomy may be at the root of the difficulty. When we attempt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; make sense of situations such as those we obtain in EPR we have to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; careful that we take into account the configuration of the experiment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; itself. This implies that the lattice of relations or poset aspect of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; causality is a posteriori and not a priori to the specifics of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiment. This implies, at least to me, that it is a mistake to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; assume the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a priori existence of a space-time (with a unique light cone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; structure).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that imposing a space-time structure for quantum events is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem. In fact, this is one of the motivations of quantum gravity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; work, to get rid of the &quot;events on a background of space and time&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which most QM has been using.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, assuming a space-time and with local light cones seems very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasonable to me. We have no particular evidence that the light cone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formalism isn't still applicable to quantum kinds of events (whatever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; EPR &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; may be, there is certainly no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence that faster than light travel of particles or photons is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involved, so there's no reason to throw out the speed of light as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maximum speed).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You may be interested in Smolin's &quot;Three Roads to Quantum Gravity.&quot; He
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argues for the _relational_ view of space-time as being more suitable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the absolute space-time coordinates in Newtonian and (ironically)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most quantum theories. Relativity of course uses the less absolute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scheme.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However--and this is very important!--there are no theories given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experimental support today which show real violations of causality. (We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could debate for a few days whether delayed-choice experiments,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Aharonov-Bohm experiments, etc. show violations of causality. While
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entangled states show behaviors not found in the macroscopic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classical, human-scale world, they don't violate causality.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This argues for the emphasis placed on causal sets and causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relations. And hence on posets and lattices. (In my opinion, following
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the lead of the several authors I've mentioned a few times here.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     One possible solution is to consider space-times strictly from an a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; posteriori point of view. You had mentioned Greg Egan's novels and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Topologies model&quot; (for instance in the novel Distress) in previous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; posts. Do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you think that the ideas of the character Mosala could be used to &quot;make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sense&quot; of this?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I try not to get too many of my theories out of science fiction!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not to sound flip or dismissive, but Egan's novels and short stories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are best seen as romps through a landscape of strange and stimulating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideas. I like his stuff a lot because he's one of the few writers today
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; able to (or interested in) keep up with modern physics and modern math.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There was a time when SF writers were engineers or scientists (Asimov,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Heinlein, Clarke, Hal Clement, even Larry Niven, who was at Caltech for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a while). Their editors were also science-oriented people, like Hugo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gernsback and John Campbell, who wanted hard science in the science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ficiton they bought.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In their day, these authors wrote stories and novels involving the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then-weird ideas of hypercubes, Mobius bands, planets with extremely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high gravity, time travel, neutron stars, and black holes. (Larry Niven
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was the Greg Egan of his day. Niven still writes, but his recent novels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are less compelling and certainly no longer are exploring cutting-edge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stuff.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As SF spread in popularity to the Baby Boom generation, more and more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-scientists and non-engineers started writing. So we got more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;sociological&quot; SF (some of it very good, like Ursula LeGuin's stuff).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And more of the &quot;palace intrigue&quot; kind of novels (&quot;The planet Cthwox
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has been ruled by the Klanring for 2000 years. A spaceship from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Vegan Federation has arrived...&quot;). And then there is fantasy...dragons,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; magic, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A few writers have stuck to hard science themes. Vernor Vinge is a good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example. And some of the &quot;cyberpunk&quot; themes have been more or less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based on plausible science, including Gibson, Walter Jon Williams,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruce Sterling, Dan Simmons, etc. (I also like a less popular author,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David Zindell, and his quartet of novels set on the planet &quot;Neverness.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematics plays an unusual role.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Steven Baxter also writes Stapletonian novels about the distant future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the end of time, though his themes are often depressing (to me at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Greg Egan is one of the few writers today actually _using_ the latest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; developments in physics and even math to explore ideas about the nature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of our reality, the anthropic principle, and the colonization of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cyberspaces.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It also turns out that Egan has been doing some Java and Mathematica
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programming for some of the spin foam papers by Baez and others. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't mean that any particular idea he explores, whether in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Distress&quot; or &quot;Diaspora&quot; or &quot;Schild's Ladder,&quot; is &quot;right,&quot; just that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Egan is obvious technically competent to write about these ideas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What fired me up about &quot;Distress&quot; in particular was the several-page
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; synopsis of the &quot;All Topologies Model.&quot; For some reason, this got my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; juices flowing. (The rest of the novel just sort of plodded along to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fairly predictable conclusion.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope this explains why I don't look to Egan's fictional character for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actual theories, just stimulation.
