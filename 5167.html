<br />Actually it is more a theorem than an opinion. But I don't want to insist on
<br />
this at this stage, I guess it would be premature.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm just interested in theories which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instrumental in solving this universe's problems. You know, trivial stuff:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wars, famines and death. A TOE which says: universe is information, every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible pattern exists, observers which can observe themselves will, is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bit sterile in that respect.
</em><br />
<br />That's my point: the comp hyp is popper falsifiable, because it put
<br />
very strong constraint on any possible measure on the set of all
<br />
computational histories (as seen from any possible sound first person).
<br />
Unfortunately the notion of first person is hard to make precise without
<br />
going into the modal logics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There's a little problem with some practical relevance I don't have an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;answer, though, which I'd like to have your opinion on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We have a finite system, iteratively evolving along a trajectory in state 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;space.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We have observers within that system, subjectively experiencing a flow of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have trouble alternating between the internal and the external observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;view. So we have a machine crunching bits, sequentially falling from state to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state. This spans a continous trajectory. We can make a full record of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;trajectory, eliminating a time axis. When does the subjective observation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;existence assemble into place? The first time the computation was made?
</em><br />
<br />The type of approach advocated in this list makes indeed possible to answer
<br />
such a question. Of course I will ask you, if only for the sake of the 
<br />
argument,
<br />
to accept that idea that all arithmetical true propositions are true in a 
<br />
atemporal
<br />
way (and a-spatial way too btw). Now a computation can be described as a
<br />
purely arithmetical object (to make this precise you need Church thesis 
<br />
aswell).
<br />
Such computation are never run, they exist like the decimals of PI once and
<br />
forall (by Arithmetical realism of course). The subjective observation as such
<br />
will then also exists out of space and time, and will be felt as a time 
<br />
ordered,
<br />
or as a space-time structured scenario only from the point of view of the 
<br />
observer
<br />
which is related to that computation. If you want, from each instant an 
<br />
observer
<br />
can think, that instant is now. In philosophy such a treatment of 
<br />
subjective time is
<br />
called an indexical. This is counterintuitive because people (including many
<br />
defender of comp) are used to believe in the following psycho-physical 
<br />
relation:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(the sensation of pain/pleasure) at space-time point (x,t)
<br />
<br />is associated with
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the physical state of some device at space-time (x,t)
<br />
<br />But comp precludes this and forces instead:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sensation of (pain/pleasure at space-time point (x,t))
<br />
<br />is associated with
<br />
<br />a (infinite set of equivalent) relative computational state(s).
<br />
<br />That is the space-time qualia is completely part of the sensation.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have trouble seeing my subjective observer experience as a sequence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;frames, already computed.
</em><br />
<br />No problem. It is totally unbelievable. As it should be in case it is true. 
<br />
*that*
<br />
can be proved. Such unbelievable but true proposition belongs to the family
<br />
of undecidable but true arithmetical propositions.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is the first run magical, and the static record
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dead meat?  I'm confused.
</em><br />
<br />The static record (here it is the set of all true arithmetical proposition) is
<br />
similar to any &quot;block universe&quot; view in which time is internal. Note that 
<br />
this is
<br />
the case for quantum cosmology where time disappears from the fundamental
<br />
equation without precluding internal time to be defined. Remember the
<br />
DeWitt Wheeler equation H = 0.  With comp, space itself is &quot;illusion&quot;, although
<br />
that word is misleading in the sense that comp justify the solidity and 
<br />
stability of such
<br />
illusion. Actually this has not yet be shown, but It has been shown how to 
<br />
translate
<br />
that problem into a mathematical question. In case the math leads to not enough
<br />
stability, that will give a falsification of comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let's bring a little dust into the run. Let's say we use a HashLife approach,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which assembles the flow from lightcone hashes. Does this screw up the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subjective experience? If yes, how?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't think this will screw up the subjective experience. The illusion of 
<br />
time
<br />
makes part of the relativeness of the computational states.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What about computing a record of all possible trajectories? Is enumerating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all possible states sufficient to create an observer experience?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is not even necessary (I really assume comp implicitly). The only think
<br />
which is needed is the existence, in some logical sense, of all those relative
<br />
states.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I haven't spent much time on this, so maybe you can bring some light into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;matter.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I hope I have not been to short. You can tell me if you grasp the idea or 
<br />
perhaps
<br />
if you grasp at least the intention of the idea, perhaps.
