I have not undergone conscious sedation myself, but I have administered the 
<br />
anaesthetic (midazolam, diazepam, propofol, fentanyl) for hundreds of 
<br />
gastroscopies and colonoscopies. Sometimes the patients are more or less 
<br />
fast asleep for the whole experience. Other times, they seem to be fully 
<br />
awake, talking to you with only a slight slurring of their voice, as if they 
<br />
have had a few beers. In fact, benzodiazepines are not that dissimilar to 
<br />
alcohol pharmacologically, and patients who go into delirium tremens from 
<br />
alcohol withdrawl are treated with large doses of diazepam. (It is ironic 
<br />
that any adult can buy as much alcoholic beverages as he wants, but for 
<br />
diazepam, which basically has all the effects of alcohol but is much safer, 
<br />
a prescription is needed.) The dose of the anaesthetic agent in conscious 
<br />
sedation is titrated according to how the patient responds: if he is very 
<br />
anxious the anaesthetist might give more midazolam, which is primarily given 
<br />
for its anxiolytic effect rather to induce amnesia, while if he is 
<br />
complaining of pain more fentanyl is given. Not everyone has complete 
<br />
amnesia for the procedure afterwards, but even if amnesia were guaranteed, 
<br />
certainly no doctor would deliberately allow a patient to suffer just 
<br />
because he won't remember it. The only situation I can think of where 
<br />
midazolam might be used primarily for its amnestic effect is with young 
<br />
children (you squirt it up their nose!) who need to have a series of 
<br />
unpleasant treatments, and would become very distressed each time if they 
<br />
could remember the details of their last experience.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*while it was happening*, since all I can think about now is how I felt

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;before and after.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Was I oriented to time, place, who I was, and what was happening to me?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Did my first person experience of consciousness &quot;seem&quot; any different?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Aside from the obvious mellowness that any sedative induces.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;While I was undergoing the procedure, and feeling the pain, did I regret 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the decision to be &quot;awake&quot; but not remember later?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Knowing that I would forget this, is there anything about what I was

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiencing that I'd want to be noted so I could read about it afterward?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So I do wonder, if I was &quot;awake&quot; and responding accurately to verbal cues, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but not &quot;laying down memories&quot;, was I really conscious?  Of course, it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*seems* to me now that I was unconscious the whole time, with some odd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;emergent effects&quot; as the Versed wore off.  But as I've gathered from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reading folks like Dennett, what things seem like and what actually is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happening can be very different things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Performing the question &amp; answer session described above is at least part

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of my willingness to undergo conscious sedation again.
