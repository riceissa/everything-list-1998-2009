I think a reconciliation between Bruno and Lee's arguments can be the following:
<br />
<br />Our perception of reality is limited by the structure and composition
<br />
of brains. (we can 'enhance' these to be able to perceive and
<br />
understand 'more', but at ANY point of time the above limitation
<br />
holds). I think this is closer to what Lee wants to say, and I totally
<br />
agree with it. This is what I have tried to elaborate on in my earlier
<br />
(my first here) email.
<br />
<br />But the very fact that this limitation is absolutely inescapable
<br />
(observation and understanding is ALWAYS limited to the observer's
<br />
capabilities) gives us the following insight:
<br />
<br />That which cannot be modelled (understood) cannot figure in ANY of our
<br />
&quot;models of reality&quot;. Therefore although our models of reality keep
<br />
changing, at any given time instance there is no way for us to
<br />
perceive anything beyond the model, because as soon as something
<br />
outside our current model is perceived, we have moved to a future
<br />
instance, and can create a model that includes it. Thus it is kind of
<br />
senseless to talk of a reality beyond our perception. In other words,
<br />
we can call something &quot;reality&quot; only once we perceive it. In this
<br />
sense &quot;models may be more real than reality&quot; to us. This is an
<br />
argument of the &quot;Shroedinger's Cat&quot; kind.
<br />
<br />In fact if I am correct about what both Bruno and Lee want to say,
<br />
then Lee's arguments are a prerequisite to understanding to what Bruno
<br />
is hinting at.
<br />
<br />Quantum Physics says that an observer and his observation are
<br />
impossible to untangle.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the above fact, 
</em><br />
<br />A Realist (Lee) would conclude that &quot;absolute reality&quot; is unknowable.
<br />
(follows from heisenburg's uncertainty also btw:-) ). But for this the
<br />
realist assumes that this &quot;absolute reality&quot; exists.
<br />
<br />A Nihilist (Bruno) would conclude that since this tanglement of
<br />
observer and observation is inescapable, it is meaningless to talk
<br />
about any &quot;absolute reality&quot; outside the perceived and understood
<br />
reality (models).
<br />
<br />None of the views is &quot;naive&quot;. In fact neither view can ever disprove
<br />
the other, because both belong to different belief (axiomatic)
<br />
systems. apples and oranges, both tasty.
<br />
<br /><br />P.S.:
<br />
If what I have said above sounds ok and does help put things in
<br />
perspective, then I would like to think that in this WHOLE discussion
<br />
there is NO NEED of invoking terms like &quot;comp hyp&quot;, &quot;ASSA&quot;, &quot;RSSA&quot;,
<br />
&quot;OMs&quot;, etc. I, being clearly a lesser being in this new domain of
<br />
intellectual giants at eskimo.com, would highly appreciate if atleast
<br />
the full forms are given so that I can google them and put them in
<br />
context.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Look, it's VERY simple:  take as a first baby-step the notion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; that the 19th century idea of a cosmos is basically true, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; then add just the Big Bang.  What we then have is a universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; that operates under physical laws.  So far---you'll readily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; agree---this is *very* simple conceptually.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Next, look at this picture after 14.7 billion years.  Guess
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; what has evolved?  Finally, there is intelligence and there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; are entities who can *perceive* all this grandeur.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; So, don't forget which came first.  Not people.  Not perceptions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Not ideas.  Not dich an sich.  Not 1st person.  Not 3rd person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; NOT ANY OF THIS NONSENSE.  Keep to the basics and we *perhaps*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; will have a chance to understand what is going on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But both the quantum facts, and then just the comp hyp are incompatible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with that type of naive realism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At this level of discourse, dear Bruno, I don't give a _______
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for your *hypothesis*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Moreover, please google for &quot;naive realism&quot;.  You'll find that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the world view of children who have *no* idea of the processes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by which their brains are embedded in physical reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since no one claims to be a naive realist, this rises to the level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of insult.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then, I'm not too surprised that the most *basic* understanding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of our world has been forgotten by some who deal everyday with only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the most high level abstractions.
