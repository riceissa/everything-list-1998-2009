<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm not sure I see what distinction you're making.  If as you say the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; realisation of computation in a physical system doesn't cause
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness, that would entail that no physically-realised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computation could be identical to any mental state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That doesn't follow because causation and identity are different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The realisation could be consciousness (fire IS combustion)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without causing it (fire CAUSES smoke but it not smoke)
</em><br />
<br />So what did you mean the reader to conclude from your original
<br />
argument?  You concluded that the realisation of a computation doesn't
<br />
cause consciousness.  But did you also mean to imply that nonetheless
<br />
the realisation of a computation IS consciousness?  If so, why didn't
<br />
you say so?  And how would that now influence your evaluation of CTM?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; follows if one accepts the argument from MGA or Olympia that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness does not attach to physical states qua computatio.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find them both quite contestable
</em><br />
<br />If you would risk saying precisely why, you might have a counter-argument.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree.  Nonetheless, when two states are functionally equivalent one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can still say what it is about them that is physically relevant.  For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; example, in driving from A to B it is functionally irrelevant to my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experience whether my car is fuelled by petrol or diesel.  But there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is no ambiguity about the physical details of my car trip or precisely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; how either fuel contributes to this effect.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One can say what it is about physical systems that explains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its ability to realise a certain computation. One can't say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is anything that makes it exclusively able to. Equally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one can explain various ways of getting from A to B, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one can't argue that there is only one possible way.
</em><br />
<br />The point at issue is not whether there is only one way to realise a
<br />
computation, or to get from A to B.  The point is that in the case of
<br />
the journey, the transition from physical irrelevance to relevance is
<br />
at the point where the physical result emerges as identical - i.e. as
<br />
the same journey form A to B.  In the case of the computation, no such
<br />
physical identity of result ever emerges; all you have is a collection
<br />
of heterogeneous physical processes, each merely *formally* identical
<br />
to a given computation.  It is a further - and physically entirely ad
<br />
hoc - assumption that this heterogeneity of physical states is
<br />
homogeneous with a single experiential state.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes, I agree.  But if we're after a physical theory, we also want to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be able to give in either case a clear physical account of their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; apprehensiveness, which would include a physical justification of why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the fine-grained differences make no difference at the level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; THat would be because they make no computational difference,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if CTM is correct.
</em><br />
<br />If all you have to offer is circular arguments we shall simply go
<br />
round in circles.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I can only suppose that complete arbitrariness would be a random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; association between physical states and mental states.  This is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what is meant by arbitrary realisation.  What is meant is that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; requirement that a physical system be deemed conscious purely in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; virtue of its implementing a computation rules out no particular kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of physical realisation.  Consequently a theory of this type is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; incapable of explicating general principles of physical-mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; association independent of its functional posit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It isn't. Why is that a problem?
</em><br />
<br />The problem is that theories which aren't reducible to fundamental
<br />
physics don't warrant consideration as physical theories.  This is
<br />
amply demonstrated by the fact that, when reduced to a physical
<br />
interpretation, CTM is in fact shown to entail gross implausibilities.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes, but the upshot is that CTM is reduced to the theory that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conscious states can be associated with material systems only in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; manner that ex hypothesi must obscure any prospect of a general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reduction of their detailed material causes, because any such causes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could only be specific to each realisation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can have as many material details as you like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so long as they are relevant to explaining the computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe you are hung up on causes. CTM is really an identity theory--
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states are identified with functional states. It's not fire-causes-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; smoke causation.
</em><br />
<br />I'm fine with mental states being identified with functional states.
<br />
The problem is one functional state reduces to multiple physical
<br />
states.  Hence CTM entails that one experiential state reduces to
<br />
multiple physical states, without being able to give any consistent
<br />
physical, as opposed to formal, criterion for such identity.  Prima
<br />
facie this renders any claim that consciousness is identical with
<br />
physical states physically empty (i.e. without significant commitment)
<br />
and under further analysis, renders it grossly implausible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Doesn't that make CTM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; somewhat spurious as a materialist theory of consciousness?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's materialist because it doesn't require anything immaterial.
</em><br />
<br />Is this materialism's last gasp?  A materialist theory requires a
<br />
materialist approach to explanation, else its commitment to
<br />
materialism is, shall we say, somewhat non-committal.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I can only suppose that complete arbitrariness would be a random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; association between physical states and mental states.  This is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what is meant by arbitrary realisation.  What is meant is that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; requirement that a physical system be deemed conscious purely in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; virtue of its implementing a computation rules out no particular kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of physical realisation.  Consequently a theory of this type is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; incapable of explicating general principles of physical-mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; association independent of its functional posit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It isn't. Why is that a problem?
</em><br />
<br />Well I'm glad we agree that it isn't capable of so doing.  This would
<br />
consequently be a problem if in fact we wished to elucidate such
<br />
general principles of physical-mental association, wouldn't you say?
<br />
It would be even more of a problem if following CTM to its logical
<br />
conclusion in fact showed its implied physical-mental associations to
<br />
be grossly implausible.  Wouldn't you say?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It doesn't need to say that to be obscure as a physical theory.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; point is that it can ex hypothesi say nothing remotely physically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; illuminating about what causes a mental state.  To say that it results
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whenever a physical system implements a specific computation is to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nothing physical about that system other than to insist that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'physical'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ..and it implements a certain computation. That's kind of the point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is not a criticism of the CTM that it doesn't work like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a reductive physcial theory: it;s not suppposed to be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It just supposed to be a phsycialist theory that doesn't have ghosts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the machine
</em><br />
<br />We've been all round the houses on this, and we've arrived back where
<br />
we started.  To restate the criticism: when an uncommitted examination
<br />
is made of what CTM necessarily entails as a reductive materialist
<br />
theory (which in the final analysis any physical theory must be) it is
<br />
revealed as incapable of justifying the consistent attachment of a
<br />
given phenomenal experience to any non-formally identified physical
<br />
events.  Of course if one is concerned only to dodge any such
<br />
reductive analysis by ignoring it, such a devastating criticism can be
<br />
obscured, but what is to be gained by such obscurantism?  All one ends
<br />
up with is precisely what one sought to avoid: the ghost of a
<br />
'consciousness' that is - ex hypothesi without need for justification
<br />
- allegedly conjured by any ad-hoc collection of physical events that
<br />
happens to accord with the purely formal criteria of the theory.
<br />
<br />It turns out that if CTM is true on any basis, then it cannot be
<br />
because consciousness is attached to objectively identifiable material
<br />
events on the basis of consistent physical principles that transcend
<br />
any purely formal equivalence.  Conversely the attempt to reduce it to
<br />
a consistent physical interpretation reveals - to anyone prepared to
<br />
confront rather than ignore the arguments - that it can only be false,
<br />
or at best vacuous, as a materialist theory.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But CTM is not engaged on such a project; in fact it entails
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the opposite conclusion: i.e. by stipulating its type-token identities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; purely functionally it requires that a homogeneous phenomenal state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; must somehow be associated with a teeming plurality of heterogeneous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; physical states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; It doesn't suggest that any mental state can be associated with any

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; It has been accused of overdoing  Multiple Realisability, but MR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; can be underdone as well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree.  Nonetheless, when two states are functionally equivalent one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can still say what it is about them that is physically relevant.  For

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Various arguments - Olympia, MGA, the Chinese Room etc. - seek to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; expose the myriad physical implausibilities consequential on such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; implementation independence.  But the root of all this is that CTM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; makes impossible at the outset any possibility of linking a phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; state to any unique, fully-explicated physical reduction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; That's probably a good thing. We want to be able to say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; two people with fine-grained differences in their brain structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; can both be (for instance) apprehensiveness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes, I agree.  But if we're after a physical theory, we also want to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be able to give in either case a clear physical account of their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; apprehensiveness, which would include a physical justification of why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the fine-grained differences make no difference at the level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; THat would be because they make no computational difference,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if CTM is correct.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; physical can in principle be ruled out as an explanation for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experience,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; That isn't an implication of CTM. CTM can regard computers as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; a small subset of physical systems, and conscious computers as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; a small subset of computers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes, but we needn't push &quot;nothing physical&quot; to the extent of random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; association to make the point at issue.  The relevant point is that,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in picking out the subset of physical systems solely qua computatio,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; no kind of physical realisation is capable of being ruled out in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; principle.  That is unproblematic in the usual case because our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; interest is restricted to the computational output of such systems,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and we are unconcerned by the physical details that occasion this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But if we are seeking a physical explanation of consciousness, then it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is precisely the coupling of the physical process and the mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; process which requires explication in a physical theory, and this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; now obscured from any general resolution by the computational posit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obscured? It goes in two stages. Physical-.computational and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational-&gt;mental.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Beyond that, your objectio to CTM seems to be (again) that it is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reductive physicalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; no uniquely-justified physical explanation need - or in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; practice could - be explicated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't think &quot;unique justification&quot; is a requirement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The detailed implausibilities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; variously invoked all fall out of this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So if a physical theory of mind is what is needed, CTM would seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fail even as a candidate because its arbitrariness with respect to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; physical realisation renders it incapable of grounding consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in any specific fundamental physical reduction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; MR is not complete arbitrariness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I can only suppose that complete arbitrariness would be a random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; association between physical states and mental states.  This is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what is meant by arbitrary realisation.  What is meant is that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; requirement that a physical system be deemed conscious purely in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; virtue of its implementing a computation rules out no particular kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of physical realisation.  Consequently a theory of this type is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; incapable of explicating general principles of physical-mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; association independent of its functional posit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It isn't. Why is that a problem?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; If CTM had the implication that one material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; system could realise more than one computation, then there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; would be a conflict with the phsyical supervenience principle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; But CTM only has the implication that one computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; system could be realised more on more than one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; material system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes, but the upshot is that CTM is reduced to the theory that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conscious states can be associated with material systems only in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; manner that ex hypothesi must obscure any prospect of a general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reduction of their detailed material causes, because any such causes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could only be specific to each realisation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can have as many material details as you like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so long as they are relevant to explaining the computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe you are hung up on causes. CTM is really an identity theory--
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states are identified with functional states. It's not fire-causes-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; smoke causation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Doesn't that make CTM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; somewhat spurious as a materialist theory of consciousness?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's materialist because it doesn't require anything immaterial.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Indeed, its success could only be in direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; opposition to the principles of materialist reductive theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't think that follows at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Shouldn't the business of a physical theory be to seek general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical principles that lead to a detailed physical reduction?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CTM associates the set of relevant physcial properties with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physical properties that makes something a certain kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of computer. What's wrong with that?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
