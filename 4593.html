Just a note. Think of a brain more than just an intake valve, reacting to 
<br />
similar stuff, and not so similar stuff. There are so many things we need to 
<br />
take into consideration. Genetics. We are born with a specific preprogramed 
<br />
set of organization and hardware. the way the neurons are preorganized, and 
<br />
the way they go about utilizing and organizing and transfering specific 
<br />
information. We are predisposed if you will. However, there's also nurture. 
<br />
Even from starting in the womb, we recieve biorythms of our mother, which 
<br />
our whole body sets to. What she ingests, the anxieties she feels. We feel. 
<br />
Not that it's a good or bad thing. BEcause I would seriously wonder what 
<br />
would happen to a child born in the matrix with no combination of Biorythms 
<br />
to build on, it would be like being born empty. that would be your &quot;clean 
<br />
slate&quot;, aside from the genes aspect. Next you have the BIO aspect of our 
<br />
hardware. It ain't plastic and metal. It moves and changes and grows. 
<br />
Continuously. There are specific pieces that are formed in seperate parts of 
<br />
the brain... But that is merely predisposed grow pattern. meaning, our whole 
<br />
brain can actually do every tasks that our parts do for us, but through 
<br />
evolution, we have managaed to pick up certain precoded hardware forms, if 
<br />
you will, that are wired and organized to preform certain ways. Then you get 
<br />
the whole consciousness/unconsiousness, combined with your intact of outside 
<br />
stimuli, including ingested foods/toxins. That all combines to decide what 
<br />
will go on with your brain.... You brain is so much more than a computer.. 
<br />
think of it like a galaxy or even it's own universe. It's predisposed to be 
<br />
a certain way. and even if you take out all outside stimuli, it is still 
<br />
on... and it will still process and continue changing and revolving without 
<br />
anything. each of it's pieces will change , and work around each of them... 
<br />
kinda like the conservation of angular momentum, and the way galaxies get 
<br />
all squished... but it's SO MUCH MORE. then you add in ONE factor, and 
<br />
everything is changed. EVERYTHING..... but this is where you get a smart 
<br />
galaxy. it can learn to filter out what it feels it does not need to PAY 
<br />
ATTENTION TO. It can forget it. It will all get in on some level mind you. 
<br />
It will process subliminal messages ect. But it still has the capacity to 
<br />
realize what to listen to and what not to. If it has already realized that 
<br />
performing X is imorral and wrong, you send it x subliminally, it will not 
<br />
suddenly prefrom X... unless you bypass all the wiring, switch to rightbrain 
<br />
processing, tell it to either run on auto pilot, or put in some information 
<br />
to reorganize the way the mind percieves X as being Okay to preform or not.
<br />
The point? I don't know, just giving you guys some info on brains.. To 
<br />
actually copy one would be NEAR TO IMPOSSIBLE. unless you could copy the 
<br />
position of everysingle neuron and chemical within the brain and send it. 
<br />
One wrong positioned neuron, one lost connection... you have a different 
<br />
person. ... Mind you, one may not make THAT big of a difference... may be as 
<br />
light as having a beer or not. But if you repostion a pathway by mistake. 
<br />
Who knows what could happen....
<br />
<br />This all brings up more questions. What about memory transfer. We code our 
<br />
memory by the continious rearangement of pathways. Unless you could copy the 
<br />
coding and rearrangement, decode it by that persons CODING... then figure 
<br />
out the next persons coding. and recoded the information, then force their 
<br />
brain the ralign... it seems impossible. We are each different. to put in 
<br />
someones else thought into me, for example. I may just remember my childhood 
<br />
in a different light. because it would be reacting to my chemicals, my 
<br />
preexisting knowledge, and my makeup of my nuerons, and how they preform.
<br />
you would have to develop a way for the brain to learn to accept and digest 
<br />
incoming brain knowlegde.
<br />
Not that it's not possible. We just have to learn it. and to learn something 
<br />
we are not predisposed for, takes a long time. it's like takeing a CD, and 
<br />
continuingly puting it in your microwave and hoping that when you push the 
<br />
microwave buttons, that instead of Frying the CD and catching the mircowave 
<br />
on fire, it will somehoe recognize that a CD is there and mutate to learn 
<br />
how to digest it. Mind you the microwave is made of mental.. the brain is 
<br />
not.
<br />
<br />Not saying it's impossible. the brain would just have to learn some new ways 
<br />
of coding.
<br />
<br />Which brings to mention... how many other ways of CODING are there? I mean, 
<br />
our brain has evolved to the point to where it is now, and it has learned to 
<br />
coded certain things certain ways now BY INSTINCT.... but what if we could 
<br />
use our actual processing ability, to realize the next step in eveolution, 
<br />
and train our brains to make the change itself?... The only reason why were 
<br />
aren't doing it, is because we aren't forced to. If we can find it. then 
<br />
offer the brain a route to form around it, who knows what could happen...
<br />
It's in a sense... finding the best optimal way to process information... 
<br />
then teaching the brain to process that way.... The best step would be to 
<br />
teach the brain to evolve and process subconsciously... instead of 
<br />
consciously by my deciding to write you guys, and prepose such an idea.
<br />
<br />Anywayz, have fun digesting...

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The real question is the ontological status of the 'nothing' in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;last sentence. I am starting to believe that the true nature of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'fundamental' beneath qualia is not only about the 'stuff', but is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actually about all of it. That is, the 'stuff' and the 'not stuff'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So. Anyone care to comment on the ontological status of 'not thing'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I believe our brains and minds are &quot;difference engines&quot;.
<br />
<br />What they do is respond in a feedback loop with perceptual signals in such a 
<br />
way as to
<br />
continually sort things, by the single rule of &quot;this is more different from 
<br />
that than it is from that&quot;,
<br />
so I'll represent that comparative level of difference (in a compact way 
<br />
that can be stored and retrieved
<br />
quickly).
<br />
<br />In other words, it organizes its internal representation of &quot;what's out 
<br />
there&quot; so
<br />
that the &quot;more different, less different&quot; relations between representational 
<br />
symbols in the brain
<br />
are as close as possible to mirroring the &quot;more different, less different&quot; 
<br />
relations among chunks
<br />
of &quot;reality&quot;. Objects in the world, for example, are individuated (their 
<br />
boundaries from other objects
<br />
determined, and thus the extent that their identity applies to) on the basis 
<br />
of a rigorously
<br />
mathematical, and simple, algorithm of &quot;these are the best clusters of all 
<br />
kinds of similarities&quot;
<br />
and their boundaries are where the most differences (of many kinds) occur.
<br />
<br />This individuation by difference-measurement applies equally well when 
<br />
turned inward on itself
<br />
to create abstract theories of abstract domains (e.g. higher math and logic, 
<br />
language about thoughts).
<br />
<br />I would contend that notions like abstraction into 
<br />
generalization-specialization hierarchies of
<br />
&quot;noun&quot; and &quot;verb&quot; (&quot;thing&quot; and &quot;relationship&quot;) concepts emerge spontaneously 
<br />
if you simply
<br />
mix a &quot;represent the differences&quot; principle with an &quot;achieve most compact 
<br />
representation&quot; principle.
<br />
<br /><br />So what does all this musing about conceptualization of the world have to do 
<br />
with the world
<br />
(universe) itself, or what that universe really &quot;is&quot; ? That's a hard one.
<br />
<br />The best I could come up with is that the &quot;multiverse&quot; or &quot;plenitude&quot; is 
<br />
&quot;the capacity for
<br />
all differences and configurations of differences to manifest themselves.&quot; 
<br />
Most parts of that
<br />
will be &quot;ungrokable&quot; by brains like ours because only those parts which have 
<br />
organized
<br />
configurations of differences exhibiting space-time-like locality, energy, 
<br />
matter etc which
<br />
behave within limits that allow formation of emergent systems of &quot;bigger&quot;, 
<br />
observable,
<br />
simple configurations of differences will be observable universes (to 
<br />
difference-engine brains
<br />
like ours that were lucky enough to emerge as one of those emergent systems 
<br />
in a
<br />
hospitable energy regime.
<br />
<br />Or Whatever.
