<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hi Hal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  My first comment was directed at your previous sentence which read 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something like: &quot;The list of course would have properties that seem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incompatible as simultaneous properties of a single object, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nevertheless definitions create such objects as the &quot;is not&quot; member of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the definitional pair. So the All is - in total - self incompatible, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so what? &quot; I thought, from it, that you meant to say that your Everything 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list contains contradictory attributions like &quot;X is a car&quot; and &quot;X is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a car&quot; for the same X. I obviously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;misunderstood you.
</em><br />
<br />The distinction is between existence and reality.  While the whole list is 
<br />
taken as existing the assumption does not hold that every &quot;is&quot; and &quot;is not&quot; 
<br />
definable object can also have reality.  I find it difficult to accept some 
<br />
combinations of &quot;X is ***...&quot; and &quot;X is not ***...&quot; as being simultaneous 
<br />
properties of the same object that can have reality or of any of its sub 
<br />
components but &quot;round square&quot; is perhaps not so unacceptable.  For example 
<br />
in a discrete point universe where for one of its components half the 
<br />
applicable points are arranged &quot;square&quot; and half &quot;round&quot; this being a state 
<br />
in some sort of transition sequence of states wherein that component goes 
<br />
from being round to being square.  Now when this particular state has 
<br />
reality in a sequence of such states does it not contain a &quot;round square&quot;?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  About your first assumption, as you restate above, I would venture to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say that QM suggests that the existence of such list is very unlikely if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by 'reality&quot; one understands &quot;physical reality&quot; as defined by EPR, that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is, as composed by distinct elements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  bearing properties that are independent of the means of observation used 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to assign them to such objects. This is the gist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  of Einstein's famous question &quot;Is the moon there when nobody looks?&quot; and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all that folklore.
</em><br />
<br />I am making a distinction between existence and reality.  Reality is a 
<br />
transitory state that some definable objects can have.  Further I think it 
<br />
is incorrect to try to exclusively argue from a very small sub set [sample] 
<br />
of the objects that can have reality - presumably the states of our 
<br />
universe - back to the system that embeds them.
<br />
<br />If it turns out that quantum mechanics is part of the valid description of 
<br />
our universe [The issue is I believe an open one] then the embedding system 
<br />
should allow for that.  This does not preclude other universes for which 
<br />
quantum mechanics is not part of the description.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now if by &quot;reality&quot; you mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  platonic reality, I think it is a good question whether such list may 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist or not. You will have to ask a mathematician...
</em><br />
<br />I am of the opinion that the line items on my list are just numbers.  I 
<br />
believe that most participants in this venue would allow that &quot;Numbers 
<br />
exist&quot; is a possible starting point and that this is could be considered a 
<br />
type of Platonism.  I just renamed numbers as &quot;properties&quot; so as to include 
<br />
all their interpretations [sets of other numbers].
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(I am assuming it is contains an countable infinity of entries, no?)
</em><br />
<br />Well there is a difference between listing and counting.  I may not be able 
<br />
to count the reals [at least in this universe] but I think a mathematician 
<br />
who allows for continuous dimensions in a 3D space will also allow that in 
<br />
such a space I can list the reals just by drawing a line segment of 
<br />
arbitrary length on a note pad.  Since my list has no dimensionality 
<br />
restrictions I suspect it can be one for one with the continuum.
