<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [re: Tegmark's formula]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It's very simple, although I guess I haven't written it out in gory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; detail before.  Tegmark's formula &quot;for any mutually exclusive and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; collectively exhaustive set of possibilities Bi, the probability of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; an event A is given by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     P(A) = Sum over i [  P(A|Bi) P(Bi)  ]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         What is the meaning of this formula?  If P(Bi) is the effective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability that an observer would see Bi, then Bi is a label for all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things an observer could see.  'A' is then a particular characteristic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that an observer-moment can have.  But then P(A|Bi) is either zero or one,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is not what I think you meant.  Explain.
</em><br />
<br />A and Bi are labels used to indicate states of an SAS.  For example, let's
<br />
define 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A == remembers having just seen the Ace of Spades,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;B1 == remembers having just seen an Ace,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;B2 == remembers having just seen a card that is not an Ace.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;B3 == does not remember having just seen a card.
<br />
Note that the set of Bi are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.  That means
<br />
P(B1 AND B2 AND B3) = 0, and P(B1 OR B2 OR B3) = 1.  But the set of all Bi
<br />
don't label &quot;all the things an observer could see&quot;.  
<br />
<br />In the above example, P(A|B1) = 1/4, P(A|B2) = 0, P(A|B3) = 0.  With an
<br />
appropriate restriction of our domain, we might guess that P(B3) = 1/2,
<br />
then if we assume a random draw from a standard deck of cards, 
<br />
P(B1) = 1/26, P(B2) = 12/26.  Then the formula says
<br />
<br />P(A) = P(A|B1)P(B1) + P(A|B2)P(B2) + P(A|B3)P(B3)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 1/4 * 1/26 + 0 + 0 = 1/104.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I want to compute P(H, t3).  Let B1 be (H, t1) and B2 be (T, t1), then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     P(H, t3) = P(H,t3 | H,t1) P(H,t1) + P(H,t3 | T,t1) P(T,t1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We assume in this option (4) that P(H,t1) = P(T,t1) = 1/2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         I guess your 'identity function' is coming into play.  Otherwise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the above makes no sense ... unless you are not using an MWI coin flip.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Without the MWI, either the H branch exists or the T branch but not both.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In any case you have changed the game when bringing time into the picture.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Am I now to understand that what Tegmark meant to say is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      P(A,t2) = Sum over i [  P(A,t2|Bi,t1) P(Bi,t1)  ]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which not the same at all as what you quoted him as saying.
</em><br />
<br />Actually, I didn't change the game, Tegmark did.  I've re-read his paper,
<br />
section III-B-2, &quot;Making Predictions&quot;, and here's what he says:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose that a SAS at location L0 has perceived Y up until that 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instant, and that this SAS is interested in predicting the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perception X that it will have a subjective time interval delta-t
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the future, at location L1.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... for any mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive set of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possibilities Bi, the probability of an event A is given by 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(A) = Sum over i { P(A|Bi)P(Bi) }.  Using this twice, we find that 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the probability of X given Y is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(X|Y) = Sum over L0 {  Sum over L1 {  P(X|L1)P(L1|L0)P(L0|Y)  } }
<br />
<br />He uses L0 and L1 to label &quot;locations&quot; in the entire ensemble of all 
<br />
universes and all SAS-observer-moments.  L0 == (i0, j0, t0), where 
<br />
i0 labels the structure, j0 labels the SAS, and t0 labels the subjective
<br />
time.
<br />
<br />Tegmark clearly, in this line of reasoning, assumes some sort of 
<br />
(unspecified) identity function, and makes that explicit in his discussion
<br />
of the second term above, P(L1|L0).  This is supposed to be the probability
<br />
that the SAS &quot;will be&quot;, or will find herself, at L1, given that she is now
<br />
at L0.  He says:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since a SAS is by definition only in a single mathematical structure i
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and since t1 = t0 + delta-t, the second factor will clearly be of the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;form:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(L1|L0) = P(i1, j1, t1 | i0, j0, t0)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= kd(i0, i1) Dd(t1 - t0 - delta-t) P(j1 | i0, j0)
<br />
<br />Where &quot;kd&quot; is the Kronecker delta function, and &quot;d&quot; is the Dirac delta 
<br />
function. So P here is a probability density function of six independent 
<br />
variables. We know we're interested in subjective times t0 and t1, so 
<br />
P(L1|L0) vanishes for every value of (t1 - t0) except delta-t.
<br />
<br />The problem in the notation is exactly because of this unspecified 
<br />
identity function.  The way I used it, I intended that P(H,t3|H,t1)
<br />
should mean &quot;the probability that she'll remember having seen heads,
<br />
and that she now sees the clock at t3, given that when she saw the
<br />
clock at t1, she remembered having seen heads&quot;.  
<br />
<br />But in a strict reading of the notation, one would assume it to mean
<br />
&quot;the probability that she remembers having seen heads and the time 
<br />
is now t3, given that she remembers having seen heads and the time is 
<br />
now t1,&quot; which of course is 0 (the time cannot be both t3 and t1).
<br />
So  you have to assume some sort of identity function for this sort
<br />
of reasoning to work at all.  Which is exactly what I was trying to
<br />
say before, viz:  In option 4, this sort of probabalistic reasoning is 
<br />
not possible.
<br />
<br />But I say that if we throw this out, then all is lost.  ALL we are are
<br />
able to do, in physics, is make predictions about future observations,
<br />
based on past experiences.  And all of these predictions are necessarily
<br />
subjective, for each one of us.
<br />
<br />And that's why I think this thought experiment is CENTRAL to the whole
<br />
topic that we are talking about.  Granted, we don't have copy machines.
<br />
But death is in some sense very real (we see it all around us), and it
<br />
has the converse affect of a copy machine.  Yet we still propose to
<br />
make subjective predictions about the future based on each of our
<br />
past observations.
<br />
<br />So let me re-assert what I mean by P(H,t3|H,t1), as 
<br />
&quot;the probability that she'll remember having seen heads,
<br />
and that she now sees the clock at t3, given that when she saw the
<br />
clock at t1, she remembered having seen heads&quot;.
<br />
<br />And let me ask you, how can this not be 1?  (Or at least as near as 
<br />
dammit?)  If you like, forget about the copy machine and use a death
<br />
machine instead:  if the coin lands heads, then she'll have a 50/50
<br />
chance of being killed.  Should she expect a 1/2 chance of remembering
<br />
having seen heads at t1, but a 1/3 chance of remembering having seen
<br />
heads at t3?
<br />
<br />I suppose you would say yes, because of the absolute SSA.  But then you'd 
<br />
have to conclude, I guess, that the reason we see things obey physical 
<br />
laws now is that the chance of our dying is relatively low.  
<br />
<br />Anyway, the reason, I guess, I adhere to the QTI is that the concept of
<br />
my own personal death just doesn't make any sense to me.  My own death
<br />
is by definition outside the realm of my own experience.  This ties in
<br />
directly with the discussion above, and with the strong sense I have that
<br />
my identity continues through subjective time.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But you said it yourself, if I remember a random bit, &quot;it cuts the total
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; measure of each type of [me] in half.&quot;  I don't know what you mean by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;type&quot;.  I'd say it cuts the measure of me in half.  That's exactly my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         The bit is either 0 or 1.  If you don't know the value, let your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure be M_d.  If you know it's 0, you have measure M_0; if you know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's 1, M_1.  So M_d = M_0 + M_1.  Suppose there are two guys, Dummy and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ben.  Dummy is ignorant and has M_d.  Ben knows the bit and the versions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of him that saw 1 have M_1, the versions that saw 0 have M_0.  A randomly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chosen observer is equally likely to be Dummy or to be one of the Bens.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I think you're right about this.  The expectation value for my memory
<br />
should be right around the median.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Cute!  But I thing the jury is still out.  I probably shouldn't use the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; term &quot;Omega-Point&quot;, since that refers to a specific theory of the infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; future evolution of the universe.  I sometimes use it to refer in general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to the infinite future in which life continues.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Life will continue but with decreasing measure.  Still it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you can make a refutable prediction: namely, that the universe we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in is not optimised for us to be here, but is optimised to give you a long
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lifetime.  Basically you are saying that what the measure ratio (say,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between two universes) will be in the future affects the measure ratio in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the present.  For example a universe in which lives decay polynomially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be favored over one in which they decay exponentially.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have made a refutable prediction:  that we necessarily will find ourselves
<br />
in a universe that will support eternal life.
