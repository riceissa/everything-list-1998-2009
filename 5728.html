This is confusing because &quot;I believe p&quot; has two different meanings.
<br />
One is that I have written down &quot;p&quot; with a number in front of it,
<br />
as one of my theorems.  The other meaning is the string &quot;Bp&quot;.
<br />
<br />But that string only has meaning from the perspective of an outside
<br />
observer.  To me, as the machine, it is just a pair of letters.  B doesn't
<br />
have to mean &quot;believe&quot;.  It could mean &quot;Belachen&quot;, which is German for
<br />
&quot;believe&quot;.
<br />
<br />All I need to know, as a formal system, is what rules the letter B
<br />
follows.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;as I feel like going.  Is this correct?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, not necessarily. Unless you are a &quot;normal machine&quot;, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope you are!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So let us accept the following definition: a machine is normal when,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if it ever assert x, it will sooner or later asserts Bx.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Normality is a form of self-awareness: when the machine believes x,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it will believe Bx, that is it will believe that it will believe x.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;But what about the other direction?  From Bx, can I deduce x?  That's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;pretty important for this puzzle.  If Bx merely is a shorthand for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;saying that x is on my list, then it seems fair to say that if I ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;write down Bx I can also write down x.  But this seems too powerful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are right. It is powerful, but rather fair also.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; let us define a machine to be stable if that is the case. When the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine believes Bx the machine believes x.
</em><br />
<br />So in my terms, I can add two axioms:
<br />
<br />0a. x implies Bx
<br />
0b. Bx implies x
<br />
<br />The first is the axiom of normality, and the second is the axiom of
<br />
stability.  I don't find these words to be particularly appropriate,
<br />
by the way, but I suppose they are traditional.
<br />
<br />It also seems to me that these axioms, which define the behavior of
<br />
the letter B, don't particularly well represent the concept of belief.
<br />
The problem is that beliefs can be uncertain and don't follow the law
<br />
of the excluded middle.  If p is that there is life on Mars, then (p or
<br />
~p) is true.  Either there's life there or there isn't.  But it's not
<br />
true that (Bp or B~p).  It's not the case that either I believe there
<br />
is life on Mars or I believe there is no life on Mars.  The truth is,
<br />
I don't believe either way.
<br />
<br />But axioms 0a and 0b let me conclude (Bp or B~p).  Obviously they
<br />
collectively imply &quot;p if and only if Bp&quot;.  Therefore from (p or ~p)
<br />
we can immediately get (Bp or B~p).  Hence for normal people, the law
<br />
of the excluded middle applies to beliefs.
<br />
<br />This proof is pure logic and has no dependence on the meaning of B.
<br />
If B is &quot;Belachen&quot;, I have showed that if p implies Belachen(p), then
<br />
it follows that (Belachen(p) or Belachen(~p)) is true.  That's all.
<br />
<br />It's a step outside the system to say that B follows rules which make it
<br />
appropriate for us to treat it as meaning &quot;believes&quot;.  But do 0a. and
<br />
0b. really capture the meaning of belief?  I question that.  B looks
<br />
more like an identity operator under those axioms.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The problem is that the rules I proposed here lead to a contradiction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;If x implies Bx, then I can write down:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;8. t implies Bt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Note, this does not mean that if he is a knight I believe it, but rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that if I ever deduce he is a knight, I believe it, which is simply the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;definition of &quot;believe&quot; in this context.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here you are mistaken. It is funny because you clearly see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the mistake, given that you say 'attention  (t implies Bt) does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not mean &quot;if he is a knight the I believe it&quot;. But of course (t implies Bt)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *does* mean &quot;if he is a knight the I believe it&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see this.  To me as the machine, there is no meaning.  I am just
<br />
playing with letters.  t implies Bt is only a shorthand for &quot;if he is a
<br />
knight&quot; then B(&quot;if he is a knight&quot;).  There is no more meaning than that.
<br />
The letter B is just a letter that follows certain rules.
<br />
<br />We only get meaning from outside, when we look at what the machine is
<br />
doing and try to relate the way the rules work to concepts in the real
<br />
world.  It is at this point that we bring in the interpretation of Bx as
<br />
&quot;the machine believes x&quot;.
<br />
<br />Suppose for some proposition q the machine deduces it on step 117:
<br />
<br />117. q
<br />
<br />Does this mean that q is true?  No, it means that that the machine
<br />
believes q.  Does it mean that Bq is true?  Yes.  Bq is true, because Bq
<br />
is a shorthand for saying that the machine believes q, and by definition
<br />
the machine believes something when it writes it down in its numbered
<br />
list.  We can see it right there, number 117.  So the machine believes
<br />
q and Bq is true.  But q is not (necessarily) true.  The machine writing
<br />
something down does not &quot;mean&quot; it is true.  By definition, it means the
<br />
machine believes it.
<br />
<br />Consider a different example:
<br />
<br />191. Bp
<br />
<br />What does this mean?  Does it mean that Bp is true?  No, it means that the
<br />
machine believes Bp, because by definition, what the machine writes down
<br />
in its numbered list is what it believes.  Is BBp true?  Yes, it is true,
<br />
because that says that the machine believes Bp, and that means that Bp
<br />
is in the machine's numbered list, which it is, right there.  The machine
<br />
believes Bp, but Bp is not (necessarily) true.  BBp is necessarily true.
<br />
<br />Another example
<br />
<br />207. p implies q
<br />
<br />By the same reasoning, this does not mean that if p is true, then q
<br />
is true.  It means that if the machine ever believes p (i.e. it writes
<br />
it down in its list of theorems), then it will believe q (i.e. it will
<br />
eventually write down q in its list of theorems). The true statment is
<br />
that Bp implies Bq.  You can also (trivially) conclude B(p implies q).
<br />
But &quot;p implies q&quot; is not (necessarily) true.
<br />
<br />Now we are ready for:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;8. t implies Bt
</em><br />
<br />It is not mean that &quot;t implies Bt&quot; is true, any more than &quot;207. p implies
<br />
q&quot; was true.  What it means is that if the machine ever believes t, it
<br />
will believe Bt.  Given that t means the native is a knight, it means
<br />
that, as I wrote before, &quot;if I ever deduce he is a knight, I believe it&quot;,
<br />
where I am the machine.  The true meaning is that Bt implies BBt.
<br />
<br />So I don't see why you said that this was wrong, and that
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here you are mistaken. It is funny because you clearly see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the mistake, given that you say 'attention  (t implies Bt) does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not mean &quot;if he is a knight the I believe it&quot;. But of course (t implies Bt)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *does* mean &quot;if he is a knight the I believe it&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />While it is true that, by itself, (t implies Bt) does mean &quot;if he
<br />
is a knight then I believe it&quot;, in the context of the machine, &quot;8. t
<br />
implies Bt&quot; doesn't mean that.  It means that the machine believes the
<br />
implication, not that the implication is true.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You add it means only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and here I add a slight correction) &quot;if I ever deduce he is a knight I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will deduce I believe he is a knight&quot; which really is, in the machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language: (Bt implies BBt) instead of (t implies Bt).
</em><br />
<br />Right, or as in my simpler example, when I wrote &quot;207. p implies q&quot; that
<br />
truly means Bp implies Bq.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be sure: a machine is normal if for any proposition p, if the machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believes p, it will believe Bp. But this is equivalent with saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that for any proposition p, the proposition (Bp implies BBp) is true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *about* the machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Same remark for stability: you can say a machine is stable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if all the propositions (BBp implies Bp) are true about the machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This does not mean the stable or normal machine will ever believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being stable or normal. You have (momentarily) confuse a proposition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being true on a machine, and being believe by a machine.
</em><br />
<br />I agree with everything here except the last sentence.  I don't see what
<br />
I have confused, or what is wrong with my derivation.  If you assume
<br />
both 0a. and 0b., meaning that I am both normal and stable, then the
<br />
proof is correct, right?  If not, which step fails?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;But 6 and 8 together mean that t implies a contradiction, hence I can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;conclude:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;9. ~t
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;He is a knave.  7 then implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;10. Bt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I believe he is a knight.  And if Bx implies x, then:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;11. t
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;and I have reached a contradiction with 9.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;So I don't think I am doing this right.
