Hi Kim,
<br />
<br />Le 27-déc.-05, à 01:06, Kim Jones a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; for some time now you have been building up to what appears to be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; core of your thesis - the &quot;Interview with the Universal Lobian 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Machine&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. I would say that there is really two cores in my thesis. The 
<br />
Universal Dovetailer Argument (UDA), and the interview of the Lobian 
<br />
Machine.
<br />
<br />- The UDA is an informal (but I think definite and rigourous) argument 
<br />
showing that if we believe that we are (digitalisable) machine (comp) 
<br />
then we should believe that the laws of physics (the laws of observable 
<br />
predictions) are derivable from computer science/ machine's 
<br />
psychology/machine theology/number theory (cf the naming issue). The 
<br />
whole of physics must be derivable: this includes space, time, 
<br />
constants, etc. The UDA does presuppose some amount of folk psychology 
<br />
for making sense to the expression &quot;yes doctor&quot;, when the doctor 
<br />
proposes to *you* an artificial digital brain.
<br />
<br />- The interview of the lobian machine is just what logicians call &quot;the 
<br />
logic of provability&quot;, or &quot;the logic of consistency&quot; or &quot;the logic of 
<br />
arithmetical self-reference&quot;. Such an interview has begun when Godel 
<br />
discovered the gap between provability *by* or *in* a formal system 
<br />
(like PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA, or PEANO ARITHMETICS, or ZERMELO-FRAENKEL 
<br />
SET THEORY, to name typical examples) and truth *about* such a formal 
<br />
system.
<br />
I identify such &quot;theories&quot; with their theorem provers (all 
<br />
axiomatisable theory have some canonical theorem prover capable of 
<br />
generating all their proofs).
<br />
<br />In 1931 Godel discovered the existence of true but unprovable 
<br />
propositions in all such systems/machines. The most typical true but 
<br />
unprovable proposition (unprovable by the machine/theory) is the 
<br />
consistency assertion: &quot;I am consistent&quot;. A machine or a theory is said 
<br />
to be consistent if the theory or the machine does not prove false 
<br />
proposition. That is:
<br />
PA cannot prove the true proposition that PA is consistent.
<br />
ZF cannot prove the true proposition asserting that ZF is consistent.
<br />
Note that nobody doubt that PA is consistent. In the case of ZF this is 
<br />
slightly less obvious (but I will suppose so, and in any case, I will 
<br />
deliberately limit myself on the discourse of consistent machines). The 
<br />
general Godel's result, known as Godel's second incompleteness theorem, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is that no consistent machine can prove its own consistency:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IF M is consistent then M cannot prove its consistency
<br />
<br />[in modal logic, if you represent the &quot;provability predicate&quot; by a 
<br />
modal box B, then consistency can be written by NOT PROVABLE FALSE, or 
<br />
by the shorter ~Bf, with &quot;~&quot; put for the &quot;not&quot;, the &quot;B&quot; put for the 
<br />
&quot;provability&quot; predicate, the &quot;f&quot; put for some falsity. With such 
<br />
notation, and reminding that &quot;IF pTHEN q&quot; is written &quot;p -&gt; q&quot; by 
<br />
logician, Godel's second incompleteness theorem can be written:  ~Bf -&gt; 
<br />
~B(~Bf), or remembering that ~Ba = D~a (NOT PROVABLE A = CONSISTENT NOT 
<br />
A), the second theorem by Godel can be written also with the diamond; 
<br />
Dt -&gt; DBf. I guess people see that this is the formula of my 
<br />
&quot;tiniest-theory-of-life-and-death&quot;. It is Kripke-semantically 
<br />
characterised by the &quot;Papaioannou&quot; multiverses.].
<br />
<br />Now Godel showed that in each &quot;sufficiently rich&quot; machine/theory, the 
<br />
provability predicate can be defined in or by the theory/machine 
<br />
itself, and that such theories/machines *can* prove their own &quot;Godel&quot;s 
<br />
second incompleteness theorem&quot;.
<br />
<br />M can prove &quot;IF M is consistent then M cannot prove its own 
<br />
consistency&quot;.
<br />
<br />This can be written:
<br />
<br />M can prove &quot;IF I am consistent then I cannot prove I am consistent&quot;
<br />
<br />But please note that &quot;I&quot; is a third person form of self-reference, not 
<br />
a first person one. The machine talk really about itself through a 
<br />
&quot;scientific&quot; description of itself.
<br />
<br />I call such &quot;sufficiently rich&quot; machine a LOBIAN MACHINE (Loebian, or 
<br />
Löbian, but &quot;Lobian&quot; is easier for the e-mail). The reason is that in 
<br />
1955 M. Loeb (Löb) will prove a significant generalisation of Godel's 
<br />
theorem, and here too, it can be shown that the lobian machine can 
<br />
prove their own lob's theorem. In French (I mean in English) Lob's 
<br />
theorem says that if a lobian machine (PM, PA, or  ZF for example) 
<br />
proves Bp -&gt; p, for some proposition p, then soon or later the machine 
<br />
will prove p (if it has not been done already). This is rather weird, 
<br />
because it shows that (sufficiently rich) machines are &quot;vulnerable&quot; to 
<br />
some placebo effect. If you prove to such a machine that if she ever 
<br />
prove the existence of Santa Klaus then Santa exists, then you already 
<br />
have proved the existence of Santa Klaus to the machine.
<br />
Much more on that can be find in my paper &quot;the origin of the physical 
<br />
laws&quot;.
<br />
<br />[modally: Lob's theorem can be written B(Bp -&gt; p) -&gt; Bp (known as Lob's 
<br />
formula L). If you remember that &quot;~A&quot; is the same as &quot;A -&gt; f&quot;, and if 
<br />
you substitute p by f in Lob's formula, you get  B(Bf -&gt; f) -&gt; Bf, that 
<br />
is B(~Bf) -&gt; Bf, and if you remember that A -&gt; B  is equivalent with ~B 
<br />
-&gt; ~A, you know that B(~Bf) -&gt; Bf is equivalent with ~Bf -&gt; ~B(~Bf). So 
<br />
you see that Lob's theorem is a generalization of Godel's second 
<br />
incompleteness theorem. Smullyan and Parick interpret Lob's formula as 
<br />
a form of super-modesty principle]
<br />
<br />So the interview of the lobian machine gives those nice propositions: a 
<br />
sort of humility principle (if I am consistent then I cannot prove I am 
<br />
consistent), and a form of modesty principle: provability entails truth 
<br />
(Bp -&gt; p) only when p is proved.
<br />
<br />In 1976, Solovay shows that Lob's formula formalises completely what 
<br />
the machine can prove about herself. Like you can derived most QM 
<br />
proposition from the SWE, you can derive the whole of what a machine 
<br />
can prove about herself from Lob's formula. Solovay defined the logic 
<br />
G. Its main assumption is the formula of Lob.
<br />
This is called Solovay Arithmetical's completeness theorem. It is 
<br />
amazing at first because it is a COMPLETENESS theorem, showing that a 
<br />
modal logic (G) does capture completely what the machine can prove 
<br />
about its own INCOMPLETENESS phenomenon!
<br />
<br />You see what the interview of the introspective machine gives: the 
<br />
machine discovers its own incompleteness, and can say non obvious fact 
<br />
about it.
<br />
<br />Still more important (for our comp TOE quest) is that Solovay will 
<br />
prove a second arithmetical COMPLETENESS theorem, and that's its 
<br />
discovery of the modal logic G*. G* formalises the whole incompleteness 
<br />
phenomenon, i.e. not just what the machine can say about it, but also 
<br />
what the machine cannot say about (without loosing consistency).
<br />
The most typical example of a theorem in G*, and not in G, is the 
<br />
consistency assertion Dt, but also all of DDt, DDDt, etc., and also 
<br />
DBf, DBBf, etc.
<br />
<br />To sum up:
<br />
G = the discourse provable by an introspective self-referentially 
<br />
correct machine.
<br />
G* = the truth *about* such introspective machine (includes the non 
<br />
provable one).
<br />
<br />Now, all the (self)-references here are third person references, and 
<br />
the UDA has shown that physics appears within first person 
<br />
self-references. Tomorrow I will explain how to get first person 
<br />
notions from third person references. The key ideas appear already in 
<br />
Plato.
<br />
<br />Tell me if all this helps you, and don't hesitate to ask ANY questions.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've processed the concepts emerging from this discussion - and I have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been downloading it since 2003. I have not yet come across any info on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what the Lobian machine interview reveals. 
</em><br />
<br />I think you could find many earlier posts of mine on G and G*. But it 
<br />
is ok I re-explain. The archive &quot;escribe&quot; seems to be dead, and I 
<br />
should correct some links in my web pages.
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
