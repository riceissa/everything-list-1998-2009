<br />
There has been a huge amount written about the Fermi Paradox (why are
<br />
there no aliens) over the years, and I don't want to reiterate that here.
<br />
You can come up with scenarios in which intelligent life is common but
<br />
where they just aren't visible, but IMO such explanations are not very
<br />
natural.  Instead I propose that for the purpose of our discussion here,
<br />
we accept the apparent fact that there are no other intelligent life
<br />
forms within the visible universe.  Then let us consider the implications
<br />
with regard to the All Universe Hypothesis (AUH), which says that all
<br />
universes exist.
<br />
<br />This observation points to the fact that with our laws of physics,
<br />
the evolution of intelligent life is extremely unlikely.  The question
<br />
is, why?  Not, why do our laws of physics make it hard for life to form,
<br />
but why do we live in a universe whose laws of physics have this property?
<br />
<br />Presumably, there are universes whose laws make life essentially
<br />
impossible.  For example, they may be completely static, or equally bad,
<br />
utterly chaotic.  But on the other extreme, there must exist universes
<br />
where intelligent life is common.  At a minimum, we could create a such
<br />
a universe in an ad hoc way by letting it be born full of intelligent
<br />
life via forced initial conditions.  And probably there are other laws
<br />
of physics which would be much more congenial for the formation and
<br />
sustenance of intelligent life than our own.
<br />
<br />So we have some universes which are full of life, others which are devoid
<br />
of life, and others where there is a chance for life to form but it is
<br />
relatively small.  We appear to live in the third class.
<br />
<br />We talk about measure with regard to universes, and however it is defined,
<br />
it seems that some such principle is needed to allow some universes
<br />
to be more probable than others.  Otherwise we have our flying rabbit
<br />
paradox where the universe could suddenly stop being lawful, or could
<br />
have arbitrary exceptions to lawfulness.  Since there are more ways for
<br />
things to go wrong than to go right, these exception-full universes would
<br />
superficially be more numerous than those where the laws are universal.
<br />
So there must be some property of the universal-law universes which makes
<br />
it more probable for us to experience them than the others, and this is
<br />
basically what we mean by measure.  Universes with more measure somehow
<br />
play a larger role in the multiverse and we are more likely to live in
<br />
one of them.  If universes with more consistent and uniform laws have
<br />
greater measure, then this explains why we don't see exceptions like
<br />
flying rabbits.
<br />
<br />However, it seems that the measure of a universe is not the only factor
<br />
which should determine how likely it is to be observed; but in addition
<br />
there should be a factor related to how many observers there are.
<br />
The obvious case is for high-measure universes where observers are
<br />
impossible.  No one will observe such universes.  This is the basic
<br />
anthropic principle.  But I would extend this principle to say that the
<br />
probability of observing a universe is proportional to the product of
<br />
its intrinsic measure and some factor relating to the number of observers
<br />
in that universe.
<br />
<br />There are a few different ways this factor might work.  The simplest would
<br />
be to count the number of observers.  A universe with similar measure
<br />
but twice as many observers would be twice as likely to be experienced.
<br />
Another possibility would be to use observer-moments.  If two universes
<br />
had the same number of observers, but in one they lived for twice as
<br />
long as the other, then perhaps the second one would be twice as likely
<br />
to be observed.  Yet another alternative would be to base the factor
<br />
on the fraction of the universe's total resources incorporated into
<br />
observers, rather than just the number of observers.  This would give a
<br />
bonus to universes which were relatively efficient at creating observers,
<br />
compared to universes which gained large numbers of observers merely be
<br />
being inordinately large.
<br />
<br />The question of why we live in a sparsely populated universe, then,
<br />
comes down to a comparison between the measure of a typical universe
<br />
with many observers versus the measure of a typical universe with few.
<br />
The former universes would get a large bonus factor for their many
<br />
observers, while universes like ours don't have that.  So for our
<br />
observations to be consistent with the AUH, it must be that universes
<br />
like ours have much larger intrinsic measure than universes with many
<br />
observers.  And since, as far as we can tell, our universe is not
<br />
just sparsely populated, but extremely so, the measure differential
<br />
in these two classes of universes must be extremely large.  That is
<br />
(turning to the Schmidhuber interpretation) it must be much simpler
<br />
to write a program that just barely allows for the possibility of life
<br />
than to write one which makes it easy.  This is a prediction of the AUH,
<br />
and evidence against it would be evidence against the AUH.
<br />
<br />On the face of it, this prediction doesn't seem too plausible to me.
<br />
Of course, no one has ever written a program which evolves intelligent
<br />
life, so we don't really know.  But our initial explorations towards
<br />
artificial life seem to indicate that it's not particularly difficult
<br />
to achieve model universes just swarming with tiny and unintelligent
<br />
replicators.  Whether they could take the additional steps to become
<br />
fully-fledged observers is an open question, one to which I suppose the
<br />
AUH would have to predict the answer is no.
