<br />It makes no sense to ask which is &quot;really&quot; the same person as  
<br />
me-before-the-split.  But after the split, each will have its own 
<br />
identity--Moscow-me will be a different person from Washington-me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Perhaps when other posters (not you) write about continuity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;consciousnes they mean that a persons consciousness cannot be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;duplicated even if their physical being is duplicated - but I believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;you explicityl reject this view.  In which case I'm not sure what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;continuity of consciousness&quot; means either.
</em><br />
<br />Since I'm the one who's been talking this way, I'll try to address this.  I 
<br />
originally brought up &quot;continuity of consciousness&quot; in my post about &quot;3 
<br />
possible views of consciousness,&quot; at 
<br />
&lt;<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2358.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2358.html</a>&gt;.  There, I was defining 
<br />
it in contrast to the &quot;only individual observer-moments exist&quot; view, which 
<br />
you seem to be taking here.  If only observer-moments exist, of course it 
<br />
would be meaningless to talk about whether I am &quot;going to&quot; find myself in 
<br />
Washington or Moscow--all you can say is that there will be observer-moments 
<br />
in Washington with memories of stepping into the replication chamber, and 
<br />
also observer-moments in Moscow with identical memories.
<br />
<br />The problem is that this way of talking doesn't match the way we actually 
<br />
experience the world from the first-person point of view.  If I am stepping 
<br />
into the replication chamber, I will wonder what I am about to experience 
<br />
next--will I suddenly find myself in Washington or in Moscow?  This question 
<br />
will be especially pressing if, say, the Moscow copy will be sold into 
<br />
slavery and the Washington copy will be set free...in this case I'll be 
<br />
holding my breath as the chamber begins to hum, hoping I'll &quot;get lucky.&quot;  
<br />
It's certainly possible that all this is an illusion, based on confused 
<br />
thinking, that my sense of experiencing multiple observer-moments 
<br />
successively is false.  In that case &quot;I&quot; would just be whatever I am 
<br />
experiencing now, period.  This leads to a lot of counterintuitive 
<br />
conclusions though--if I observe myself to be the Moscow twin and I know the 
<br />
Moscow twin is due to be tortured in an hour, I have no particular reason to 
<br />
feel any more concern than if it was the Washington twin who was due to be 
<br />
tortured.  Either way, it will not be &quot;me&quot; but an observer-moment very 
<br />
similar to &quot;me&quot; who will experience the pain.
<br />
<br />The alternative to the isolated-observer-moments view is what I have been 
<br />
calling &quot;continuity of consciousness.&quot;  You could picture this as a moving 
<br />
spotlight that shines on various observer-moments in succession, and can 
<br />
split into multiple spotlights as it moves.  This picture is 
<br />
problematic--it's a bit too concrete, too &quot;soul-like.&quot;  However, we run into 
<br />
similar problems when we use the so-called &quot;copernican anthropic principle&quot; 
<br />
or the &quot;Doomsday argument&quot;...what does it mean to say &quot;I&quot; could have born at 
<br />
any point in history?  If I were born at a different point in history, I 
<br />
certainly wouldn't be the same person...it seems we must picture a sort of 
<br />
featurless spotlight-of-experience that randomly selects an observer-moment 
<br />
to shine on.  But the copernican anthropic principle should not be ruled out 
<br />
just because it's hard to understand what it &quot;means&quot; philosophically, and I 
<br />
think the same is true of continuity of consciousness.
<br />
<br />In terms of a theory of consciousness, all that the continuity view says is 
<br />
that we should expect our theory to quantify some kind of &quot;conditional 
<br />
probability&quot; between any two observer-moments, which in some sense we would 
<br />
interpret as the probability that the first moment will experience 
<br />
&quot;becoming&quot; the second.  The theory itself would not comment on the sort of 
<br />
philosophical difficulties I mention above, which seem to be what you're 
<br />
having trouble with.
<br />
<br />In contrast, the isolated-moments view says that although we might expect a 
<br />
theory of consciousness to quantify the absolute probability of being 
<br />
various observer-moments, the theory will not define any notion of 
<br />
conditional probability *between* observer-moments.  In this case, identity 
<br />
would be merely an aesthetic interpretation, much as consciousness itself is 
<br />
an aesthetic interpretation to people like Dennett.  Personally, I believe 
<br />
that even if I convince myself of an &quot;interpretation&quot; in which I am not the 
<br />
same person as Jesse-in-5-minutes, I am nevertheless likely to experience 
<br />
what he experiences--identity-over-time is something imposed on me by 
<br />
external reality (although if splitting is possible, there is probably some 
<br />
nonzero probabilty of 'becoming' any observer-moment at all, even one 
<br />
radically different from my current one).
