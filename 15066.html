<br />
I've thought of an interesting modification to the original UDA argument
<br />
which would suggest that one's consciousness is at both locations
<br />
simultaneously.
<br />
Since the UDA accepts digital mechanism as its first premise, then it is
<br />
possible to instantiate a consciousness within a computer.  Therefore
<br />
instead of a physical teleportation from Brussels to Washington and Moscow
<br />
instead we will have a digital transfer.  This will allow the experimenter
<br />
to have complete control over the input each mind receives
<br />
and guarantee identical content of experience.
<br />
<br />A volunteer in Brussels has her brain frozen and scanned at the necessary
<br />
substitution level and the results are loaded into a computer with the
<br />
appropriate simulation software that can accurately model her brain's
<br />
functions, therefore from her perspective, her consciousness continues
<br />
onward from the time her brain was frozen.
<br />
<br />To implement the teleportation, the simulation in the computer in Brussels
<br />
is paused, and a snapshot of the current state is sent over the Internet to
<br />
two computers, one in Washington and the other in Moscow, each of these
<br />
computers has the same simulation software and upon receipt, resume the
<br />
simulation of the brain where it left off in Brussels.
<br />
<br />The question is: if the sensory input is pre-fabricated and identical in
<br />
both computers, are there two minds, or simply two implementations of the
<br />
same mind?  If you believe there are two minds, consider the following
<br />
additional steps.
<br />
<br />Since it was established that the experimenter can &quot;teleport&quot; minds by
<br />
pausing a simulation, sending their content over the network, and resuming
<br />
it elsewhere, then what happens if the experimenter wants to teleport the
<br />
Washington mind to Moscow, and the Moscow mind to Washington?  Assume that
<br />
both computers were preset to run the simulation for X number of CPU
<br />
instructions before pausing the simulation and transferring the state, such
<br />
that the states are exactly the same when each is sent.  Further assume that
<br />
the harddrive space on the computers is limited, so as they receive the
<br />
brain state, they overwrite their original save.
<br />
<br />During this procedure, the computers in Washington and Moscow each receive
<br />
the other's brain state, however, it is exactly the same as the one they
<br />
already had.  Therefore the overwriting is a no-op.  After the transfer is
<br />
complete, each computer resumes the simulation.  Now is Moscow's mind on the
<br />
Washington computer?  If so how did a no-op (overwriting the file with the
<br />
same bits) accomplish the teleportation, if not, what makes the
<br />
teleportation fail?
<br />
<br />What happens in the case where the Washington and Moscow computer shutdown
<br />
for some period of time (5 minutes for example) and then ONLY the Moscow
<br />
computer is turned back on.  Did a &quot;virtual&quot; teleportation occur between
<br />
Washington and Moscow to allow the consciousness that was in Washington to
<br />
continue?  If not, then would a physical transfer of the data from
<br />
Washington to Moscow have saved its consciousness, and if so, what happened
<br />
to the Moscow consciousness?
<br />
<br />The above thought experiments led me to conclude that both computers
<br />
implement the same mind and are the same mind, despite
<br />
&nbsp;having different explanations.  Turning off one of the computers in either
<br />
Washington or Moscow, therefore, does not end the consciousness.  Per the
<br />
conclusions put forth in the UDA, the volunteer in Brussels would say she
<br />
has a 1/2 chance of ending up in the Washington computer and 1/2 chance of
<br />
ending up in the Moscow computer.  Therefore, if you told her &quot;15 minutes
<br />
after the teleportation the computer in Washington will be shut off forever&quot;
<br />
she should expect a 1/2 chance of dying.  This seems to be a contradiction,
<br />
as there is a &quot;virtual&quot; teleportation from Washington to Moscow which saves
<br />
the consciousness in Washington from oblivion.  So her chances of death are
<br />
0, not 1/2, which is only explainable if we assume that her mind is
<br />
subjectively in both places after the first teleport from Brussels, and so
<br />
long as a simulation of her mind exists somewhere she will never die.

<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; But of course you have to accept that if a simple teleportation is

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; This is the position I was arguing against in my earlier post. Let's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; stick with simple teleportation, without duplication. If the data is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; scrambled so much that the thing that ends up on the other side is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; just a puddle of goo, then my probability of surviving the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; teleportation is 0%. It's functionally equivalent to just killing me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; at the first teleporter and not sending any data over. (Do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; agree?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; If the probability of me surviving when an imperfect copy is made is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; still 100%, then there's some point of &quot;imperfection&quot; at which my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; chances of surviving suddenly shift from 100% to 0%. This change will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; be marked by (say) the difference of a single molecule (or bit of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; data, or whatever). I don't see how that can be correct.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But there are many ways for what comes out of the teleporter to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *not* be you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Most of them are &quot;puddles of goo&quot;, but some of them are copies of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Bruno or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; imperfect copies of me or people who never existed before.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Suppose it's a copy of you as you were last year - is it 100% you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It's not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 100% the you that went into the machine - but if you're the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person you were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; last year it's 100% you.  Of course the point is that you're not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; same &quot;you&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from moment to moment in the sense of strict identity of information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; down to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; molecular level, or even the neuron level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. And if a teleporter transforms me into a copy of me as I was last

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; year, I will say that although I have 100% survive, I suffer from an

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amnesia bearing on one year of experience, and indeed I will have to
