</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I respect your belief or faith, but I want to be frank, I have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidences for the idea that &quot;Jesus&quot; is &quot;truth&quot;, nor can I be sure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any clear meaning such an assertion could have, or how such an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assertion could be made scientific, even dropping Popper falsification
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criteria. I must say I have evidences on the contrary, if only the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that humans succumb often to wishful thinking, and still more often to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their parents wishful thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />If you are not sure of any clear meaning of the personal God being the
<br />
source of everything, including of course truth, this entails not
<br />
knowing the other things too.  For a personal God, taking on our form
<br />
(incarnation), especially if we were made in the image of God in the
<br />
first place, and showing through miracles, and rising from the dead...,
<br />
his dual nature (God&amp;man, celestial&amp;terrestial, G*&amp;G) seems to make a
<br />
lot more sense than something like a cross in earth orbit.  For
<br />
example, giving a hug is a more personal (and thus a more appropriate)
<br />
way of expressing love, than giving a card, even though a card is more
<br />
verifiable in a third person sense, especially after the hug is
<br />
finished.  But we do have the &quot;card&quot; too: God's written Word, even
<br />
though this is not sufficient, the incarnate hug was the primary proof,
<br />
the &quot;card&quot; was just the historical record of it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There can be no upward
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emanation unless/until a sufficient downward emanation is provided.  In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Christianity, the downward emanation is &quot;God loves us&quot;, and then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; upward emanation is &quot;We love God&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Plotinus insists a lot on the two ways: downward emanation and upward
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emanation. The lobian machine theology is coherent with this, even if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; negatively. It is coherent with Jef idea that pure &quot;theological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imperatives&quot; can only be addressed by adapted &quot;story telling&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; examples, like jurisprudence in the application of laws. But then there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a proviso: none of the stories should be taken literally.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I agree with the use of stories.  Jesus used stories almost exclusively
<br />
to communicate.  Either the hearers &quot;got it&quot; or not.  But this does not
<br />
imply that stories are the only form of downward emanation.   The
<br />
incarnation was the primary means.  Otherwise, who would have been the
<br />
story-teller?  What good are stories if the story is not teaching you
<br />
truth?  How do we know that the ultimate source of stories is a good
<br />
source.  Jef and Brent and others seem to be basing their truth on
<br />
really nothing more than pragmatism.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is not poetry.  Heidegger said to listen to the poet, not to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; content, but just to the fact that there is a poet, which gives us hope
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that there is meaning.  However, unfulfilled hope does not provide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; meaning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hope is something purely first-personal, if I can say. So I have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clue how hope does not provide meaning. Even little (and fortunately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; locally fulfillable hope) like hope in a cup of coffee, can provide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning. Bigger (and hard to express) hopes can provide genuine bigger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning, it seems to me. I am not opposed to some idea of ultimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning although both personal reasons and reflection on lobianity make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me doubt that communicating such hopes can make any sense (worse, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication would most probably betrays the possible meaning of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is attempted to be communicated, and could even lead to the contrary).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Even poetry must be based eventually on some meaning.  Even minimalism
<br />
or the Theatre of the Absurd is based on some form to attempt to
<br />
communicate meaninglessness.
<br />
<br />I am glad that your aren't opposed to some idea of ultimate meaning.
<br />
My whole argument is that without it our hope eventually runs out and
<br />
we are left with despair, unless we lie to ourselves against the
<br />
absence of hope.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The content of these words speak of the *actual* fulfillment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the hopes of the Greeks expressed in their hypostases.?   Are you talking about mystical enlightening experiences. Like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; losing any remaining doubts about immortality because you have already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seen the whole of the eternal tergiversations all at once ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />By &quot;these words&quot; I was referring to the John quote from the Bible.  The
<br />
actual fulfillment was Jesus (the Word/Logos).  He spanned the infinite
<br />
gap, like you said above, perhaps analogous to hypercomputation,...all
<br />
in one step.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; We have seen his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; full of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; grace and truth.&quot; (John 3:1,2,3,14)  So the particular finite form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; we have, God somehow took on that same form.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is the ultimate irony that Jesus was taken to be blaspheming when he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; said he was &quot;one with the Father&quot; and &quot;before Abraham was, I AM&quot;, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;no one can say that they are God&quot;..... the mistake is the missing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; phrase at the end: &quot;...except God&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. I mean, here, that we can agree on an important disagreement,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making both of us quite coherent with respect to my &quot;faith&quot; in comp and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your faith in non-comp. Here the comp theology is simpler: &quot;no one can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say that they are God&quot;. The comp would add (inferring on G*): &quot;even, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not especially, (a) God&quot;. No God can assert &quot;I am (a) God&quot;,  I mean,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not in public.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />So apparently, accepting the personal God basis would mean that you
<br />
would have to reject comp.  It makes sense, even in that to accept the
<br />
personal God we have to put aside anything that we were putting in
<br />
place of Him.  In fact, we put ourselves in the place of God, whether
<br />
we consider ourselves a machine or not.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes it is a mistake to say that we understand God fully, but it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; also be a mistake (would it not?), if God were to tell us something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; true (but of course not exhaustive), for us to say that we do not know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the thing that he told us.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But expressions and statements are always is need of interpretations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be it God's or Nature's or Colleagues' statements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As you know I am already skeptical about a &quot;physical universe&quot; if only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because of lack of evidences (that is besides its lack of explanation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; power with comp), but then I am a realist so I do have faith in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accessible reality, by observation, introspection, dialog ... But term
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Universe&quot; or &quot;Reality&quot; or &quot;Truth&quot; cannot been used in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any sense presupposing that the utterer has some special connection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with them (and this despite the most obviously probable existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such connections).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />This is why Jesus was the Word, the Logos.  God simply shouting words
<br />
out of the sky or something would have this problem.  This is why I
<br />
said that the incarnation was primary in God's communication to us.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  It is like (in fact IT IS) the relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; between a father and a child.  (In fact, the earthly father/mother and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; child relationship is a shadow/projection of the heavenly, rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the other way around.)
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How do you know? Are you willing to assume this clearly and build some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axiomatization?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />This follows from the acceptance of the personal God who is love (among
<br />
the three Persons I outlined using the hypostases) independently of
<br />
anyone/anything else.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I agree that it is dangerous for a child to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; keep taking a father too literally when the father tells him/her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; something.  At first, the child should take the father/mother's words
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at face value, trusting that the parent is saying the right words for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the child to understand what the parent wants them to know.  But to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; keep living with only those words, and not continue to try to learn a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; deeper understanding and grow through more communication and exchange
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of love.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I feel uneasy to be loved by someone because that someone has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; asked to love me. &quot;Love&quot; is essentially a &quot;second&quot; person construct.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again &quot;telling stories&quot; will go here beyond the ten thousand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;treatises&quot; . Love stories ok, love theories, why not. But normative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; love = end of love.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I agree, words are not enough.  Here again, the primary communication
<br />
of love was not words e.g. a command to love, but the actually
<br />
expression by the action of incarnation and giving his life and death.
<br />
&quot;Greater love has no one than this, that a man lay down his life for
<br />
his friends.&quot;  ...and back to evil, Jesus' conquerring of death was the
<br />
solution to evil.  &quot;For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God
<br />
is eternal life through Jesus Christ.&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And this can be done only on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; basis of the ultimate infinite Person.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again I agree. I would say the arithmetical hypostases describes such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person. In a precise theoretical frame where any one can verify the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statements following from the axioms. Actually your &quot;ultimate inifinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Person&quot; is still very vague so that there are still many arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; candidates for the &quot;ultimate infinite person&quot; related to a simpler
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine like Peano Arithmetic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />By &quot;ultimate&quot; I mean something that cannot be created, or generated by
<br />
upward emanation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But on the other hand, I think that our post-Godelian ignorance results
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in our being even more lost that before!
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can perhaps imagine, at least at first sight.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The fact that now we CANNOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; know, if we are a machine, which machine we are, makes us even more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; lost in a sea of meaninglessness than before.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure, because we can bet. We can make act of faith. We can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learn from our mistakes, we can change our minds and still keeping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; faith, faith corrected by reason and experiences can only grow. Only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;bad or wrong faith&quot; (generally based on wishful or fearful thinking)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can fear to be &quot;corrected&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A bit like it is more easy for a parent to &quot;punish&quot; his child when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parent &quot;truly&quot;  loves it.
</em><br />
<br />But this hope is without an ultimate basis.  Real hope has an ultimate
<br />
basis.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Our hope has become even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; more hopeless, not that the reductionist hope was well-founded either.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why should our hope become more hopeless? On the contrary, knowing that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we know less, we can expect more. With comp we can hope for more (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fear for more too, to be precise).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Knowledge is personal.  Without an ultimate personal basis, we cannot
<br />
expect or hope for more, because we have nothing to begin with.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; saying that we have not received ANY words from God.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have never said that. (Unless by God you mean this one, or this one,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or this one, ...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Without God putting words into a form which we can recognize as from
<br />
him (like the incarnation) where we can say &quot;there he is&quot;, we have no
<br />
way of receiving ANY words from God, and knowing it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  there remains an *infinite* gap to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fulfill our aspirations, which will always remain unbridged.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It depends on what you mean by &quot;fulfill&quot;. Comp could be consistent with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some complete fulfilment in some limit. It is hard to work out, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed it could be related with unpersonhood. (But the point is to take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our theory seriously and see where we are led)
</em><br />
<br />I agree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; By
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; working from nothing, one step at a time, we will never get there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;Forever Unfulfilled&quot;, there can be no true fulfillment, only through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; deceiving ourselves, which also leads to death...
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure your &quot;pessimist&quot; derivation is valid. One of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical comp hypostase (Bp &amp; p) is both divine and personal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We could agree on everything except for the idea that &quot;sacred text&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should not be taken literally. And we could differ on that just for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contingent reason we have been educated differently.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that I am not saying that Jesus is not the son of God, just that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have less evidence for that than for the *primitive* physical universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which I still don't believe either.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know I am demanding, concerning evidence and conviction.
</em><br />
<br />Again, the &quot;sacred text&quot; by itself is not sufficient.  The proof is in
<br />
God's actual act of love toward us.  For us, love is expressed in
<br />

<br />
