<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The point is, there are enough stories published in any year that it

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would be a trivial matter to find a few superficial resemblances between

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;any event and a story that came before it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Let's look a little closer at the story in terms of gestalts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;On one side we have published author Robert Heinlein writing a story in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;1939 about a guy named Silard who works with a uranium bomb, a beryllium 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;target and a fellow named &quot;lenz.&quot;  We'll leave Korzybski out of this one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;(I suspect Heinlein borrowed the name from A. Korzybski, a sematicist of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;some renown back in the 1930s.)  To me the interesting nodes involve the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;words &quot;Silard&quot; &quot;lenz&quot; &quot;beryllium,&quot; &quot;uranium&quot; and &quot;bomb.&quot; So let's agree 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;that here is a story that includes a gestalt of the words &quot;Silard, lenz, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;beryllium, uranium and bomb.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;But you can't use that particular &quot;gestalt&quot; when talking about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;probability that a coincidence like this would occur, because you never 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;would have predicted that precise gestalt in advance even if you were 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;specifically looking for stories that anticipated aspects of the Manhatten 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;project.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Where on earth did *that* gestalt rule come from??? ;-)
</em><br />
<br />It comes from the idea that if you are going to claim a &quot;hit&quot; for ESP or 
<br />
whatever that has a significance level of 1 in 10^9, then it should be true 
<br />
that *if* ESP didn't exist and the hit was a pure coincidence, then no more 
<br />
than 1 in 10^9 versions of you in different possible universes should be 
<br />
claiming to have seen a hit with that level of significance--that seems to 
<br />
be inherent in the meaning of &quot;significance level&quot;, no? If 1 out of 15 
<br />
parallel versions of you would end up claiming to see a hit with a 
<br />
significance level of 1 in 10^9, *even if there was no ESP and these hits 
<br />
were pure coincidence*, then obviously something is wrong with the reasoning 
<br />
that these various versions of you are using. Do you disagree?
<br />
<br /><br />I wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  It would make more sense to look at the probability of a story that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;includes *any* combination of words that somehow anticipate aspects of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Manhatten project. Let's say there were about 10^10 possible such gestalts 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;we could come up with, and if you scanned trillions of parallel universes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;you'd see the proportion of universes where a story echoed at least one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;such gestalt was fairly high--1 in 15, say.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;This means that in 1 in 15 universes, there will be a person like you who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;notices this anticipation and, if he uses your method of only estimating 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the probability of that *particular* gestalt, will say &quot;there's only a 1 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in 10^9 probability that something like this could have happened by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;chance!&quot; Obviously something is wrong with any logic that leads you to see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;a 1 in 10^9 probability coincidence happening in 1 in 15 possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;universes, and in this hypothetical example it's clear the problem is that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;these parallel coincidence-spotters are using too narrow a notion of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;something like this&quot;, one which is too much biased by hindsight knowledge 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of what actually happened in their universe, rather than something they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;plausibly might have specifically thought to look for before they actually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;knew about the existence of such a story.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />you responded:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Sounds like you're invoking rules of causation here--post hoc rather than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;ad hoc, hindsight bias, etc.  Certainly I am not suggesting Heinlein's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;story caused Szilard to be hired (interesting thought, though!)  And 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;unless I want to invoke Cramer's transactional approach, I would not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;really want to think that the Manhattan Project caused Heinlein to write 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;his story.  That would require reverse causation, and we know that doesn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;happen.  This is very simple: we have instances in which Heinlein includes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;key words (definable as being essential to the story---without them, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;different story) that form a gestalt of. . .well, key words.  These words 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;are equivalent to those describing the Manhattan Project and not many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;other things.  To show that there are not many other things these key word 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;gestalts describe, one can wait a year and use Google Print to call up all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the books and stories associated with these key words.  Then we will have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;a probability to work with.  Since the gestalts are separated by four 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;years (or thereabouts) then we shouldn't have to invoke causation.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />You are misunderstanding the meaning of &quot;hindsight bias&quot;, it's not about the 
<br />
prediction causing the event being predicted or vice versa, it's about *you* 
<br />
making a retroactive calculation of the &quot;probability&quot; of a particular 
<br />
successful prediction which is illegitimate because you incorporate 
<br />
knowledge of what already happened into your choice of the &quot;target&quot; whose 
<br />
probability of predicting you want to calculate. This is illustrated by an 
<br />
anecdote involving Richard Feynman which is quoted at 
<br />
<a href="http://www.numeraire.com/value_wizard/probable.htm">http://www.numeraire.com/value_wizard/probable.htm</a> :
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />What came to Feynman by &quot;common sense&quot; were often brilliant twists that 
<br />
perfectly captured the essence of his point. Once, during a public lecture, 
<br />
he was trying to explain why one must not verify an idea using the same data 
<br />
that suggested the idea in the first place. Seeming to wander off the 
<br />
subject, Feynman began talking about license plates. &quot;You know, the most 
<br />
amazing thing happened to me tonight. I was coming here, on the way to the 
<br />
lecture, and I came in through the parking lot. And you won't believe what 
<br />
happened. I saw a car with the license plate ARW 357. Can you imagine? Of 
<br />
all the millions of license plates in the state, what was the chance that I 
<br />
would see that particular one tonight? Amazing!&quot; A point that even many 
<br />
scientists fail to grasp was made clear through Feynman's remarkable &quot;common 
<br />
sense.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Of course in this example Feynman did not anticipate in advance what licence 
<br />
plate he'd see, but the kind of &quot;hindsight bias&quot; you are engaging in can be 
<br />
shown with another example. Suppose you pick 100 random words out of a 
<br />
dictionary, and then notice that the list contains the words &quot;sun&quot;, &quot;also&quot;, 
<br />
and &quot;rises&quot;...as it so happens, that particular 3-word &quot;gestalt&quot; is also 
<br />
part of the title of a famous book, &quot;the sun also rises&quot; by Hemingway. Is 
<br />
this evidence that Hemingway was able to anticipate the results of your 
<br />
word-selection through ESP? Would it be fair to test for ESP by calculating 
<br />
the probability that someone would title a book with the exact 3-word 
<br />
gestalt &quot;sun, also, rises&quot;? No, because this would be tailoring the choice 
<br />
of gestalt to Hemingway's book in order to make it seem more unlikely, in 
<br />
fact there are 970,200 possible 3-word gestalts you could pick out of a list 
<br />
of 100 possible words, so the probability that a book published earlier 
<br />
would contain *any* of these gestalts is a lot higher than the probability 
<br />
it would contain the precise gestalt &quot;sun, also, rises&quot;. Selecting a precise 
<br />
target gestalt on the basis of the fact that you already know there's a 
<br />
book/story containing that gestalt is an example of hindsight bias--in the 
<br />
Heinlein example, you wouldn't have chosen the precise gestalt of 
<br />
Szilard/lens/beryllium/uranium/bomb from a long list of words associated 
<br />
with the Manhattan Project if you didn't already know about Heinlein's 
<br />
story.
