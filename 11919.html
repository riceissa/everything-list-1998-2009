<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Scientific behaviour demanded of the zombie condition is a clearly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; identifiable behavioural benchmark where we can definitely claim that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; phenomenality is necessary...see below...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is all to easy to consider scientific behaviour without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Scientist looks at test-tube -- scientist makes note in lab
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; journal...
</em><br />
<br />'Looks' with what? Scientist has no vision system. There are eyes and
<br />
optic chiasm, LGN and all that. But no visual scene. The scientist is
<br />
blind.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The reason it is invisible is because there is no phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; consciousness. The zombie has only sensory data to use to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; science. There are an infinite number of ways that same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sensory data could arrive from an infinity of external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; natural world situtations. The sensory data is ambiguous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; That doesn't follow. The Zombie can produce different responses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; on the basis of physical differences in its input, just as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; a machine can.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I spent tens of thousands of hours designing, building, benchtesting and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; commissioning zombies. On the benchtop I have pretended to be their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; environment and they had no 'awareness' they weren't in their real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; environment. It's what makes bench testing possible. The universe of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; zombies was the universe of my programming. The zombies could not tell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; they were in the factory or on the benchtop.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; According to solipsists, humans can't either. You seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to think PC somehow tells you reality is really real,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but you haven't shown it. Counterargument: we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PC during dreaming, but dreams aren't real.
</em><br />
<br />I say nothing about the 'really realness' of 'reality'. It's irrelevant.
<br />
Couldn't care less. _Whatever it is_, its relentlessly consistent to all
<br />
of us in regular ways suffient to characterise it scientifically. Our
<br />
visual phenomenal scene depicts it well enough to do science. Without that
<br />
visual depiction we can't do science.
<br />
<br />Yes we have internal imagery. Indeed it is an example supporting what I am
<br />
saying! The scenes and the sensing are 2 separate things. You can have one
<br />
without the other. You can hallucinate - internal imagery overrides that
<br />
of the sensing stimulus. Yes! That is the point. It is a representation
<br />
and we cannot do science without it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; yes you got it - all coded....I am talking about action potential pulse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; trains. They are all the same general class. Burst mode/Continuous mode,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all the same basic voltage waveform, overshoot, refratory period...LTP,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; LTD, afterhyperpolarisation.... all the same class for sight, sound,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; taste, imagination, touch, thirst, orgasm etc etc... coded messages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; travelling all the way from the periphery and into the brain. They are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the same...and..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the fact that they are coming in on distinct channels is what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still don't see why we need to appeal to PC.
</em><br />
<br />I am determined to get this across! :-)  On my bike ride I dreamt up a new
<br />
thought experiment that I think might do it.
<br />
<br />&quot;The Totally Blind Zombie Homunculus Room Experiment&quot; where marvin the
<br />
human is methodologically, buit not physically zombied. That ought to do
<br />
it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; None of it says anything about WHY the input did what it did. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; causality outside the zombie is MISSING from these signals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The causality outside the human is missing from the signals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A photon is a photon, it doesn't come with a biography.
</em><br />
<br />Yep. That's the point. How does the brain make sense of it? By making use
<br />
of some property of the natural world which makes a phenomeanl scene.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  They have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intrinsic sensation to them either. The only useful information is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; body knows implicitly where they came from..which still is not enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Try swapping the touch nerves for 2 fingers. You 'touch' with one and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the touch happen on the other. The touch sensation is created as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; phenomenal consciousness in the brain using the measurement, not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; signal measurement itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The brain attaches meaning to signals according to the channel they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; come on on, hence phantom limb pain and so on. We still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't need PC to explain that.
</em><br />
<br />Please see the recent post to Brent re pain and nociception. Pain IS
<br />
phenomenal consiouness (a phenomenal scene). How do you think the phantom
<br />
limb gets there? It's a brain/phenomenal representation. It IS phenomenal
<br />
consiousness. Of a limb that isn't actually there.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now think about the touch..the same sensation of touch could have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; generated by a feather or a cloth or another finger or a passing car.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; context is what phenomenal consciousness provides.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PC doesn't miraculously provide the true context. It can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be fooled by dreams and hallucination.
</em><br />
<br />Yes it can misdirect, be wrong, be pathologically constitutes. But at
<br />
least we have it. We could not survive without it. Would could not do
<br />
science without it. It situates us in an external world which we would
<br />
otherwise find completely invisible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And it doesn't have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; access to information that the physical brain doesn't have access
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to.
</em><br />
<br />The physical brain generates it! The fact that it's hard to conceive how
<br />
is irrelevant. The fact is that brain material does it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A photon is a photon. And the context of one particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; signal is a bunch of other signals, memories and so on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You haven't shown that the process of contextualising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a signal isn't essentially cognitive.
</em><br />
<br />Contextualising nerve signal against nerve signal is one thing.
<br />
Contextualising what the nerve signal is saying in respect of the external
<br />
world is another. Reflex actions do the former on habituated/safe
<br />
behaviour completely without awareness (like your intestines are right
<br />
now). Science, however, cannot function without the latter.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The zombie cannot possibly distinguish the novelty from the sensory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and has no awareness of the external world or even its own boundary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Huh? It's perfectly possible to build a robot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; that produces a special signal when it encounters input it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; not encountered before.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes but how is it to do anything to contextualise the input other than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; correlate it with other signals?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why would it need to do something more? Are you saying PC
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is something more? What?
</em><br />
<br />Contextualises it with respect to the world beyong the actual transduction
<br />
site where the measurement took place. Think of it as a voltage
<br />
measurement. You put the meter on it. You get X volts. That voltage
<br />
reading on its own tells you nothing of what it means, where it came from
<br />
etc. Additional information is provided by brain material by generating a
<br />
phenomenal scene using the measurement. This additional information is
<br />
added via 'mystery property Z'/whatever... the solution to the hard
<br />
problem...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (none of which, in themselves, generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; any phenomenal consciousness, they trigger it downstream in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cranium/cortex).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In robots?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sight... that is scientifically proven fact. EG There is a HUGE neural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sensory transduction/actuation system along the wall of your intestines,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of which you have no awareness at all, but is hammering away like a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; factory squeezing and pushing all day...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You mean &quot;having the sensor transduction does not necessarily give it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal sight&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Put it this way.... a 'red photon' arrives and hits a retina cone and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; isomerises a protein, causing a cascade that results in an action
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; potential pulse train. That photon could have come from alpha-centuri,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bounced off a dog collar or come from a disco light.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is equally true with or without PC.
</em><br />
<br />No. PC contexualises where the photon came from. The neurons use that
<br />
contextual information to construct the PC visual scene in which 'red' is
<br />
painted.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The receptor has no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; clue. Isomerisation of a protein has nothing to do with 'seeing'. In the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; human the perception (sensation) of a red photon happens in the visual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cortex as an experience of redness and is 'projected' mentally into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; phenomenal scene. That way the human can tell where it came from.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not exactly. We can tell where it came from because it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; combined with a lot of other data to form a 3d reconstruction.
</em><br />
<br />Yes and that construction is the visual scene - phenopmenal consciousness.
<br />
Visual qualia in a virtual reality made for you by your brain using
<br />
neurons and only neurons.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For instance, there is no depth information in the photon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; per se. The depth information comes from matching the information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the two retinas. Phenomenality is just how it is &quot;presented&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once it has been worked out.
</em><br />
<br />The act of working it out presents it. Is it. The two things are identical.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You seem to be saying that without the phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;show&quot;, we wouldn't have the information in the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place. But, blindsight shows we might.
</em><br />
<br />Yes there are a bunch of visual pathways, some of which enable basic
<br />
processes to function without the visual scene. Hand-placement is about it
<br />
for the blindsighted - very importnt though. Note that the hand placement
<br />
is possible because the body knows where the hand it - it put it there.
<br />
Again a blindsighed person would be intrinsically limited when presented
<br />
with novelty.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mystery of how that happens is another story. That it happens and is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessary for science is what matters here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The main fact is that the zombie does not have sensation at all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does not have phenomenal sensation. Could have sensory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; access to the world (as in blindsight). Could have tha bility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to integrate and contextualise it, non-phenomenally.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. Certain processes (see blind sight - above). In order that you
<br />
construct that you have to know already how to construct it. Chicken and
<br />
egg.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as a result it cannot do science on the world outside the zombie. It's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; doesn't even know there is a world to do science on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And we do, contra the solipsist. How do we?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; All it can do is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; correlate measurements with each other, measurements that could have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from anywhere and the zombie can never tell from where.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; According to the solipsist, that is all we can do. And we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be fooled.
</em><br />
<br />Yes but we have PC and scientific procedure to minimise problems in
<br />
science. The zombie has squat of either.
<br />
<br />Maybe wait for the
<br />
&quot;The Totally Blind Zombie Homunculus Room Experiment&quot;
<br />
:-)
