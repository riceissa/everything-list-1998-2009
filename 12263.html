<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have been doing a lot of reading/thinking on your former posts on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hypostases, other reading on Plotinus and the neo-Platonist hypostases,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the Christian &quot;interpretation&quot; of the hypostases.  There is a lot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to say, but I'll start by just giving some responses to your last post
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On Dec 11, 8:46 am, Bruno Marchal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree that the problem of evil (and thus the equivalent problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Good) is interesting. Of course it is not well addressed by the two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; current theories of everything: Loop gravity and String theory. With
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that respect the comp hyp can at least shed some light on it, and of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; course those &quot;light&quot; are of the platonic-plotinus type where the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; notion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of goodness necessitates the notion of truth to begin with. I say more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; below.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The discussions over the last two weeks on Evil, and just how to define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good and bad, underscore how puzzling this problem can be.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It certainly is.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that at the base of this is the question, &quot;What is Truth?&quot;  I am not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; satisfied with the Theaetetus definition, or Tarski's &quot;trick&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />We can come back to this.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe the answer to the question, &quot;What is Truth?&quot; which Pilate asked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jesus, was standing right in front of Pilate: Jesus himself.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmmm.... Perhaps in some symbolical way.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Christian definition of truth goes back to the core of everything, who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is personal.  As I've said before, without a personal core, the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;personal&quot; has lost its meaning.  In the context nowadays of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impersonal-based philosophy, &quot;personal&quot; has come to &quot;mean&quot; something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like &quot;without rational basis&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course that *is* a pity. It is bad, for human, to develop such 
<br />
&quot;self-eliminating&quot; belief.
<br />
It is not rational either.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But when the personal IS the basis, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an impersonal concept of personal, but the ultimate Person, and with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; man being made in the image of that ultimate Person, we have a basis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for truth, personality, rationality, good...
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />So you are emphasizing the &quot;third hypostase&quot; = the first person = the 
<br />
ALL-SOUL = the universal knower. This is akin to David Lymann and 
<br />
George Levy. It is not incompatible with your view if you accept the 
<br />
idea that we &quot;are all God(s)&quot;. Cf Alan Watts for example and most 
<br />
mystical insight.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Note also that the major critics by the neoplatonists on Aristotle,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; besides their diverging opinions on the nature of matter, is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; non-person character of the big unnameable, but then for Plotinus 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;second God&quot; (the second primary hypostase is &quot;personal&quot;), and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; indeed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; G* has a personal aspect from the point of view of the machine. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (comp agree) with Plotinus  that the big first cannot be a person. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; second one can. To be sure Plotinus is not always completely clear 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that point (especially on his chapter on free-will).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; None of Plotinus' hypostases are both personal and free from evil 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; well as infinite, which we agree is needed (but not sufficient, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; maintain!) for the problem of meaning).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is a key point. I agree. None of Plotinus hypostases are both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; personal and free from &quot;evil/good&quot;. Finding an arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; interpretation of the hypostases could then give a hope toward an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explanation of goodness and evil.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Please note that 7/8 of the hypostases are &quot;personal-views&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll just deal with the first 4 hypostases, since this is the basis of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the rest, even though my John quote below addresses the others also.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps the neo-Platonists couldn't see how the core could be personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (even though Plato called it the &quot;Good&quot;). It is hard to accept that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; core could be both infinite and personal (and good), since our view of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personality is finite (and flawed). But the infinite personal core, God
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Father, which replaces the neo-Platonist &quot;ONE&quot; or 0-person (of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course I maintain that the replacing was in the other direction :),
</em><br />
<br /><br />It looks you seem really to be an Aristotelician ....
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; answers the big question of the origin of all other persons (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You mentioned to Brent that perhaps invoking the second-person is a way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of explaining the origin of &quot;personal&quot; aspects.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I was just saying that the &quot;second person&quot; or some collective intimacy 
<br />
can explain utterance of &quot;uncommunicable things&quot;.
<br />
Some &quot;ethical&quot; scientific truth can be said in the coffee room, not at 
<br />
any congress ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In a way this is true,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in that our earthly fathers/mothers and others take part as persons in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; developing us as persons.  But there has to be an ultimate source.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. To be a realist is to bet there is one, but from a scientist 
<br />
(third person) pov, it is an open question as to know if such ultimate 
<br />
thing is personal. Comp is going in the Plotinus direction where the 
<br />
ultimate reality is not personal.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the Christian &quot;interpretation&quot; the ultimate source of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first-person level experience (neo-Platonist &quot;ALL-SOUL&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;UNIVERSAL-SOUL&quot;) could be said to be God the Holy Spirit.
</em><br />
<br />I can agree with that hypothesis. It is consistent with 
<br />
computationalism. There is no real order among the main three primary 
<br />
hypostases.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; He fills in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the gaps when we cannot find words to talk to him.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Like G* minus G does for any self-referentially classical machine. (The 
<br />
lobian machine).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then, the real clincher is the third person point of view, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neo-Platonist &quot;INTELLECT&quot;.  The personal God did not stay silent and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; keep all of this personhood stuff at a purely theoretical level which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we would have to take with blind faith.  Instead the hopes of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neo-Platonists were fulfilled in the Christ (Messiah) whose name was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Emmanuel which means &quot;God with us&quot;, who was the &quot;wisdom and power of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God&quot;.  &quot;In the beginning was the Word (Logos), and the Word was with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made. In him was life, and that life was the light of men. The light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it... The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I can take this as a poetical description of the relation between the 
<br />
internal modalities or the hypostases.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We have seen his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grace and truth.&quot; (John 3:1,2,3,14)  So the particular finite form that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we have, God somehow took on that same form.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This, on the other way, could be a comp sort of blasphemes. Comp 
<br />
&quot;ethic&quot; could even makes God eliminating any creature so arrogant that 
<br />
they take they their realities and images of God for granted. With 
<br />
comp, if we are divine, we can only be divine *hypotheses*. We can hope 
<br />
being God last word, but this is really something which depends on our 
<br />
work and can never be taken for granted.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In this way God showed us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (who are in his image) true truth about himself in a way which we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand (just as a father tells truth to his children), without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having to tell us infinite exhaustive truth.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Again this can have Plotinian sense. But there is a danger (for us 
<br />
human) to take those assertions too much literally.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This bridges the gap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the celestial/divine and the terrestial/human.  Christ is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fixed-point between heaven and earth, the axis of the universe for us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In Christ, we all see in third-person the Way, the Truth and the Life.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Again if &quot;Christ&quot; denotes a symbolic value I can make sense of what you 
<br />
are saying, but in my opinion the relation between Christians and the 
<br />
Christ are extremely fuzzy. There has been a lasting confusion of power 
<br />
which makes me skeptical. Too much propositions has been deformed by 
<br />
their authoritative institutionalization. Still today &quot;theology&quot; tends 
<br />
to be separated from science (i.e. from accepting doubts and the 
<br />
infinite number of attempts of clarity and rigor). This separation 
<br />
resulted into the abandon of the fundamental questions to the fanatics 
<br />
(who mocks clarity, rigor, and doubts).
<br />
Now I am aware of the last century &quot;repentance&quot; of the Catholic Church, 
<br />
including the necessity of restricting faith with rationality, like 
<br />
many open minded school of Muslims already warned us in the eleven 
<br />
century, but not for a very long time).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's late, so I'll stop here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Joyeux Noel!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Happy Christmas!
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
