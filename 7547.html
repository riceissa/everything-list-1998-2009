<br />
Bruno asked a while back for various people to try to encapsulate
<br />
their favorite theory or model of the &quot;everything exists&quot; concept,
<br />
so I will try to describe my current views here.
<br />
<br />Basically it can be summed up very simply as: Universal Distribution
<br />
(UD) plus ASSA (absolute self selection assumption).
<br />
<br />Traditional philosophy distinguished between ontology, the study of the
<br />
nature of reality, and epistemology, which examines our relation to and
<br />
understanding of the world.  I can adopt this distinction and say that
<br />
the UD is the ontology, and that the epistemology is roughly the ASSA.
<br />
As you will see, my ontology is stronger than my epistemology.
<br />
<br />[Note, UD is often used to mean Universal Dovetailer, a different
<br />
concept.]
<br />
<br />For the ontology, the UD is a probability distribution over information
<br />
objects (i.e. information patterns) which I assume is the fundamental
<br />
system of measure in the multiverse.  It is defined with respect to an
<br />
arbitrary Universal Turing Machine (UTM) and basically is defined as
<br />
the fraction of all possible input program strings that produce that
<br />
information pattern as output.
<br />
<br />I am therefore implicitly assuming that only information objects exist.
<br />
Among the information objects are integers, universes, computer programs,
<br />
program traces (records of executions), observers, and observer-moments.
<br />
<br />The UD is an attractive choice because it is &quot;dominant&quot;, meaning that it
<br />
is asymptotically within a constant factor of any other distribution,
<br />
including UD's defined by other UTMs.  This is why it is called
<br />
&quot;universal&quot;.  It is often considered the default probability distribution
<br />
when no information is available.  This makes it a natural choice, perhaps
<br />
the only natural choice, for a distribution over information objects.
<br />
<br />The UD defines a probability or &quot;measure&quot; for every information object.
<br />
This is the basic ontology which I assume exists.  It is the beginning
<br />
and ending of my ontology.
<br />
<br />A few additional points are worth making.  Time does not play a
<br />
significant role in this model.  An information object may or may not
<br />
include a time element.  Time is merely a type of relationship which
<br />
can exist among the parts of the information object, just as space is
<br />
another type.  In relativity theory, time is different from space in
<br />
the sign (positive/negative) by which its effects are made known on the
<br />
metric.
<br />
<br />Among universes, some may have a time dimension, some may not; some
<br />
may have more than one dimension of time.  Similarly, they could have
<br />
different dimensions of space, or perhaps fractal dimensions.
<br />
<br />Observers are by definition information systems that are similar to us,
<br />
and since time is intimately bound up in our perception of the world,
<br />
observers will be information objects which do include a time element.
<br />
<br />It is also worth noting that the UD measure is non-computable.  However
<br />
it can in practice be approximated, and that seems good enough for my
<br />
purposes.
<br />
<br />Another point relates to the question of copies.  One way to interpret
<br />
the UD is to imagine infinite numbers of UTMs operating on all possible
<br />
programs.  The measure of an object is the fraction of the UTMs which
<br />
output that object.  This inherently requires that &quot;copies count&quot;, even
<br />
exact copies.  The more copies of an information object are created, the
<br />
more measure it has.
<br />
<br />A final point: I strongly suspect that the biggest contribution to the
<br />
measure of observers (and observer-moments) like our own will arise from
<br />
programs which conceptually have two parts.  The first part creates a
<br />
universe similar to the one we see where the observers evolve, and the
<br />
second part selects the observer for output.  I argued before that each
<br />
part can be relatively small compared to a program which was hard-wired
<br />
to produce a specific observer and had all the information necessary to
<br />
do so.  Small programs have greater measure (occupy a greater fraction
<br />
of possible input strings) hence this would be the main source of measure
<br />
for observers like us.
<br />
<br /><br />For the epistemology, we need some way to relate this definition of
<br />
measure to our experience of the world.  This is necessary to give the
<br />
theory grounding and enable it to make predictions and explanations.
<br />
What we want is to be able to explain things by arguing that they
<br />
correspond to high-measure information patterns.  We also want to be
<br />
able to make predictions by saying that higher measure outcomes are
<br />
more likely than lower measure ones.  To achieve this I want to adopt
<br />
a relatively vague statement like:
<br />
<br />You are more likely to be a high measure information object.
<br />
<br />Obviously this statement raises many questions.  It seems to suggest
<br />
that you might be a table, or the number 3.  It also has problems
<br />
with the passage of time.  &quot;When&quot; are you a given information object?
<br />
Are you first one and then another?  If you start off as one, do you
<br />
stay the same?
<br />
<br />I am not necessarily prepared to fully explain and answer all of these
<br />
problems.  At this point I am trying to keep to the big picture.  Objects
<br />
have measure, and for that to be meaningful, objects with higher measure
<br />
have to be considered more prominent.  We should expect the universe
<br />
we observe to have relatively high measure.  We should expect ourselves
<br />
as observers, and as observer moments, to have relatively high measure.
<br />
If we face alternatives of either a low measure or a high measure future,
<br />
we should expect to experience the high measure one.
<br />
<br />As far as the problem of &quot;being&quot; unconscious objects, I don't necessarily
<br />
see that as contradictory.  We all know what it is like to be unconscious.
<br />
We become unconscious every day when we sleep.  We also know through
<br />
experience that there are many degrees and kinds of consciousness.
<br />
<br />In practice, being a table or the number 3 is so different from what we
<br />
think of as consciousness that we cannot relate to it as human beings.
<br />
We need to restrict our attention to information objects that have a
<br />
similar nature and complexity to our own.  Among those objects, we can
<br />
distinguish between ones with low and high measure.  The theory predicts
<br />
that we should find ourselves as entities with a relatively high measure,
<br />
and explains those aspects of our existence which have a high measure.
<br />
<br />The ASSA is well suited for this interpretation, because it relates
<br />
measure of observer moments to subjective probability.  The older SSA,
<br />
which is observer based where the ASSA is observer-moment based, also
<br />
can work reasonably well in this model for the same reason.
<br />
<br />But the details of ASSA vs ASA vs other interpretations are not of
<br />
fundamental importance in my view.  The most important part is the UD.
<br />
We then connect its definition of measure to subjective experience using
<br />
the concept that higher measure states are more likely to be experienced.
<br />
This is the basic principle from which we attempt to make our predictions
<br />
and explanations.
