<br />Well stated, Brent!
<br />
<br />I would be forced to agree, but there might be an omission in that 
<br />
very strong counter argument. There was a peer reviewed article 
<br />
published many years ago (I think in Scientific American magazine) 
<br />
that basically said that given enough time EVERY particle will 
<br />
spontaneously emit energy until, eventually, there is no energy left 
<br />
to emit. If I remember correctly that argument was making claim that 
<br />
not only radioactive particles are unstable, and that all particles 
<br />
with no exception follow the same emission rules but that some are 
<br />
just almost unimaginably unlikely to do so but that they will do so. 
<br />
The point being that in some near infinite but still within a finite 
<br />
time every particle in the universe will have evaporated, so to 
<br />
speak. Since having read that article I've never seen a disapproval 
<br />
of the hypothesis presented in that article. Perhaps I've missed a 
<br />
peer reviewed disapproval of the premise.
<br />
<br />But the question in my mind at the time I read that article was: why 
<br />
would a particle considered to be stable eventually decay to a point 
<br />
of complete self destruction? I now believe that the answer to that 
<br />
question is localized inflation of space/time being expressed at the 
<br />
subatomic level. Although the nuclear binding forces are so very 
<br />
strong that the consequences are that inflation is very drastically 
<br />
slowed relative to a particle, inflation itself is a factor of 
<br />
space/time and not of matter but matter does exert a resistive effect 
<br />
against inflation. But only a resistive effect, however large that 
<br />
might be, and not a total inhibiting effect. Over time, inflation 
<br />
marches on regardless.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that it is true that one reason behind a decay of any 
<br />
particle (radioactive or not) is because of inflation rather than 
<br />
because of fuzzy quantum chance. The argument I put forth is that any 
<br />
atomic arrangement is actually 100% stable until it is acted upon by 
<br />
an external force, which does include inflation but could also 
<br />
include interaction with other energy sources. Barring any 
<br />
possibility of interaction, eventually inflation will lead to decay 
<br />
and be expressed by way of spontanious emmision of energy. Inflation 
<br />
is a component of space and time, it is not granular (it is smooth) 
<br />
and is not itself subject to Planck's constant. The constant is a 
<br />
measure of the smallest size of an energy packet at the quantum 
<br />
level, something like 6.26 x 10^-34 J-sec, and it is the only reason 
<br />
why the affect upon matter by inflation occurs in discrete levels of 
<br />
energy instead of linearly. 
<br />
<br />It is the very drastic localized slowing (but not the entire 
<br />
elimination) of inflation that makes it appear that inflation is not 
<br />
occuring at a subatomic level because of some binding force such as 
<br />
gravity or [insert choice here]. But inflation is still occuring 
<br />
regardless, and at some finite point in time it gets expressed in 
<br />
Planck terms.
