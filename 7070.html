<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But the basic idea is simple perhaps: Suppose I must choose between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a) I am 3-multiplied in ten exemplars. One will get an orange juice 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and 9 will be tortured.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; b) I am 3-multiplied in ten exemplars.  One will be tortured, and 9 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will get a glass of orange juice instead.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK. Now, with comp, strictly speaking the 1-uncertainty are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ill-defined, indeed. Because the uncertainty bears on the maximal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; histories. Without precision I would choose &quot;b&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But if you tell me in advance that all the 9 guys in &quot;b&quot;, who got the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; orange juice, will merge (after artificial amnesia of the details 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which differ in their experience), and/or if you tell me also that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the one who will be tortured will be 3- multiplied by 1000, after the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; torture, this change the number of relative histories going through 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the 1-state &quot;orange-juice&quot; or &quot;tortured&quot; in such a way that it would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be better that I choose &quot;a&quot;. Obviously other multiplication events in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the &quot;future&quot; could also change this, so that to know the real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; probabilities, in principle you must evaluate the whole histories 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; going through the states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To be sure, the reasoning of Stathis is still 100% correct with comp 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for what he want illustrate, but such probability calculus should not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be considered as a mean to evaluate &quot;real probabilities&quot;. When you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; look at the math, this can be described by conflict between local 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; information and global information. It is all but simple. Today I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have only &quot;solve&quot; the &quot;probability 1&quot; case, and it is enough for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; seeing how quantum proba could be justify by just comp. But even this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; case leads to open math questions. It is tricky in QM too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was with you until you proposed the tortured copy in (a) be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiplied 1000-fold or the 9 orange juice copies in (b) be merged. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would *still* choose (a) in these situations. I look at it in two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; steps. The first step is exactly the same as without the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiplying/merging, so at this point (a) is better. If you had then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposed something like, the orange juice copies will then be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tortured, then that would have made a difference to my choice. What 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you in fact proposed is that the absolute measure of the tortured 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copies be subsequently increased or the absolute measure of the orange 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; juice copies be subsequently decreased. I would argue that changing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the absolute measure in this way can make no possible first person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference; or, equivalently, that multiplying or reducing the number 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of instantiations of an observer moment makes no possible first person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference - it's all the one observer moment.
</em><br />
<br />Yes but this leads to paradoxes. It can be shown that all OM have the 
<br />
same measure in the running of the UD, or that there is no measure at 
<br />
all. The relative measure of OM2 relative to OM1 will be given by the 
<br />
density of computations going from OM1 to OM2.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What does make a difference is the *relative* measure of candidate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successor OM's, and it is crucial that this refers to the transition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from one OM to the next.
</em><br />
<br />Strictly speaking I agree, but then I am taking the opportunity of the 
<br />
ambiguous nature of you statement.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is simply because that is how our minds perceive the passage of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time and construct the illusion of a single individual who maintains 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his identity over time.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree intuitively, but here I have a problem: for technical reasons I 
<br />
disbelieve in &quot;intuition&quot; at this stage. At this stage I cannot *not* 
<br />
take into account the &quot;reversal&quot; which makes the &quot;passage of time&quot; 
<br />
secondary from the way the 1-computations (the web of arithmetical 
<br />
&quot;dreams&quot;) are coherent. Of course this is probably highly 
<br />
counter-intuitive and that's why I turn on the math. I have said this 
<br />
recurrently on the list. The thought experiments are good for making us 
<br />
doubt about many prejudices. But to build a theory, at some point it is 
<br />
necessary to be utterly clear on what we assume or not, and to be open 
<br />
that the consequences of the theory are in contradiction with what 
<br />
intuition told us. After all this happened already more than one time 
<br />
with modern physics. I am not sure at all I can follow you when you 
<br />
describe how our minds perceive the passage of time. I have learn to 
<br />
accept that the notion of single individual is less an illusion than 
<br />
time, space and all physical modalities. But I know it is 
<br />
counter-intuitive and that is the reason I have eventually decided to 
<br />
interview lobian machine to take into account the lob-godel 
<br />
incompleteness (which is counter-intuitive at its roots). Sorry if this 
<br />
looks a little bit like an authoritative argument, but I can explain 
<br />
all the details if you are willing to cure your math anxiety ....
<br />
As I said once, common sense is the only tool we have to go a little 
<br />
bit beyond ... common sense.
