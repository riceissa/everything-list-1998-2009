<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I have still a question for Russell, what is the meaning of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; giving a &quot;physical existence&quot; to a mathematical structure ? This is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; not at all a clear statement for me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I am using it in the sense of Tegmark - essentially saying that some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;structure really _does_ exist. A bit like saying Platonic forms really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;_do_ exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. But I reserve platonic existence to numbers and their (intricate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough) relations. The &quot;whole of math&quot; is not a well defined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being, it seems to me. See also my post to Chris.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And there is a difference which remains to explain between the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atemporal universal Turing machine and the apparently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contingencial concrete universal computer I am using right now.
</em><br />
<br />A bit like whoever it was who said that &quot;whole numbers are the work of
<br />
god - all else [of mathematics] is the construct of man&quot;. I have some
<br />
sympathy for this view, but suspect that that debate would occupy many
<br />
centuries of discussion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A lot of people seems to take mathematical reality for granted. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They should realise that the very mathematical discovery of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer (by Post, Turing, Church, Markov, etc.) comes from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; works in the foundation of math, when all attempt to define the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;whole math&quot; appears to be inconsistent ... or incomplete.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Incomplete I agree with, however I don't believe incompleteness to be
<br />
a problem per se.
<br />

<br />I have thought about your last week's post some more, and believe
<br />
there is much more to tease out here. It appears that you are
<br />
concerned by incompleteness of theories built on finite axiom sets. It
<br />
is true that all of the embedded theories (Tegmarkian ensemble members
<br />
embedded in Schmidhuber's) I was referring to are RE. A finite axiom
<br />
set defines a partition of wffs into three sets (true, false and
<br />
undecidable). If an additional independent and consistent axiom is
<br />
added, then the true and false sets are expanded, whilst the
<br />
undecidable set is reduced. This in effect defines a partial ordering
<br />
on theories T1 and T2:
<br />
<br />T1&gt;T2 iff true(T2) \subset true(T1) and false(T2) \subset false(T1)
<br />
and undec(T1) \subset undec(T2).
<br />
<br /><br />However, T1 and T2 are quite distinct theories. In your view, (N,+,*)
<br />
is somehow the limit of such a partially ordered chain - this appears
<br />
to fly against the prevailing opinion of defining (N,+,*) to be the
<br />
incomplete result of some finite set of axioms, with its three-way
<br />
partitioning of theorems.
<br />
<br />Now for my purposes, all of the incomplete theopries (T1,T2 etc) can
<br />
be mapped into the Schmidhuber ensemble by my method (and hence are
<br />
given physical existence). One needs to include a program the
<br />
recursivley enumerates all theorems, and sorts them into canonical
<br />
order to ensure that isomorphic theories are indeed mapped to the same
<br />
set of indistinguishable programs. The completed theories can also be
<br />
mapped onto bitstrings (however the bitstrings contain infinite
<br />
information, so would have measure zero) - however, can all the
<br />
theorems be recursively enumerated to ensure that all isomorphic
<br />
complete theories are mapped into same set of indistinguishable
<br />
programs? Intuitively, it would appear possible, but infinity is a
<br />
tricky beast.
<br />
<br />In any case, it would appear unimportant, as the complete theories
<br />
must have measure zero, so we wouldn't be living inside a universe
<br />
described by a complete mathematical theory.
<br />
<br />This is from considerations of Goedel's incompleteness
<br />
theorem. Another line of thought that emanated from your criticism was
<br />
theorems that exist in the &quot;completion&quot; of the RE list of
<br />
theorems. For example, lets assume that Goldbach's conjecture (that
<br />
any even number can be written as the sum of two primes) was true, but
<br />
that no finite manipulation of our currently agreed axioms of the
<br />
whole numbers could prove it. Now GC can be proved false by
<br />
counterexample, so GC can be proven true in countably infinite steps
<br />
by testing each even number. So, in this sense, GC will lie in the
<br />
&quot;completion&quot; of the set of all theorems.
<br />
<br />Is this a problem? Certainly, if this were the case, GC would not be
<br />
listed in the RE of all theorems by a UTM. However, all the
<br />
enumeration is important for is to identify uniquely the set of
<br />
equivalent mathematical theories with a set of equivalent UTM programs.
<br />
