My caveat before commenting: I'm an opinionated person, but I really 
<br />
don't have any particular theory of everything to share with you. No 
<br />
dreams theory, no soap bubble theory, no 18-dimensional cellular 
<br />
automaton theory. I'm currently doing a lot of reading in logic, topos 
<br />
theory, quantum mechanics, and math in general. I'm more interested 
<br />
right now in really grasping why the Kochen-Specher says what it says, 
<br />
for example. Some of you are way ahead of me. Anyway, these are some of 
<br />
my caveats before plunging in.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complete landscape of the solution space in all contexts?
</em><br />
<br />And I believe Charles Bennett said all this more clearly and 
<br />
convincingly with his &quot;logical depth&quot; arguments. (See, for example, his 
<br />
long essay in an excellent book called &quot;Fifty Years of the Turing 
<br />
Machine.&quot;)
<br />
<br />The argument goes like this: suppose one is walking on a beach and 
<br />
finds a gold watch. The watch has many moving parts, many non-natural 
<br />
things like the crystal, the case, and much internal structure. (I'm 
<br />
deliberately mixing in parts of Dawkins' &quot;Blind Watchmaker,&quot; as the 
<br />
arguments are closely related.)
<br />
<br />The watch shows evidence that a lot of &quot;processes&quot; have run for a very 
<br />
long time. Not computer processes, but processes of manufacturing the 
<br />
components, of fitting them together, of learning what doesn't work and 
<br />
what does work, and of a serious industrial infrastructure.
<br />
<br />Or consider an e. coli organism. Something like 4 GB of genetic 
<br />
material, measured in bits and bytes (if I recall this correctly...it 
<br />
doesn't affect the argument if I am off by some factor).
<br />
<br />The &quot;complexity&quot; of the e. coli genome is, by some measures, just this 
<br />
4 GB. But nearly all 4 GB strings (which is a very, very large number!) 
<br />
produce dead organisms. In the space of 4 GB strings, some relatively 
<br />
small &quot;patch&quot; of them produce functioning, reproducing organisms like 
<br />
e. coli.
<br />
<br />Both the watch and the e. coli appear to have been the result of a lot 
<br />
of shuffling and processing of the &quot;apparent&quot; number of bits.
<br />
<br />Charles Bennett calls this &quot;logical depth.&quot; This is closely related to 
<br />
algorithmic information theory, where the shortest description of a 
<br />
string (or other object) is essentially the program or process which 
<br />
produces the object. Bennett has placed more emphasis on the &quot;depth&quot; of 
<br />
a series of iterated processes, but the idea is basically the same. 
<br />
(And there may have been good syntheses of the ideas in recent years...)
<br />
<br />Another way to look at this, metaphorically, is in terms of compression 
<br />
of a spring. The evolutionary pressures and differential reproduction 
<br />
rates with e. coli, or with watches!, takes a spring and puts more 
<br />
energy into it...the energy to do things later. Even a fixed-length 
<br />
string, like 4 GB in e. coli, can be seen as being &quot;compressed&quot; in this 
<br />
sense. More and more logical depth is compressed into a string of fixed 
<br />
length. (Imagine a program in a competing robot, perhaps in one of 
<br />
those &quot;Battlebots&quot; arena shows, where the program is perhaps, by 
<br />
coincidence, limited to about 4 GB of Pentium 4 main memory. The 
<br />
program gets shuffled and changed, via either genetic algorithms (GA) 
<br />
or genetic programming (GP) or whatever. The same 4 GB program space 
<br />
(&quot;string,&quot; seen abstractly) gets more and more capable.
<br />
<br />A cellular automaton can also have high logical depth. In fact, back 
<br />
when I read (some of ) Wolfram's earlier book on CAs, &quot;Cellular 
<br />
Automata and Complexity,&quot; I believe it is called, this is the viewpoint 
<br />
I was reading it from.
<br />
<br />But the fact that cellular automata exhibit this kind of logical depth 
<br />
does not mean that gold watches and e. coli are proof that the universe 
<br />
is a cellular automaton!
<br />
<br />Q.E.D.
<br />
<br />Now, pace Zuse, Fredkin, Lloyd, and all the others, it may in fact be 
<br />
the case that a Theory of Everything somehow involves CA-like 
<br />
computations or interactions at perhaps the Planck scale.
<br />
<br />But nothing in Wolfram's recent book is at all convincing to me that he 
<br />
has shown this in any meaningful sense. The phenomena he has been 
<br />
experimenting with are at least 25-30 orders of magnitude away from the 
<br />
Planck scale. Believing snowflakes, crystals, and sea shells accrete 
<br />
material in CA-like ways, which I think physicists and biologists have 
<br />
been convinced of for a long time, does not mean the universe is in any 
<br />
meaningful sense itself a cellular automaton.
<br />
<br />(And, pace Gleason's Theorem and the aforementioned Kochen-Specker 
<br />
Theorem, and the work of Bell, I am suspicious for other reasons that a 
<br />
purely local theory of the universe, one based on CA-like iterations, 
<br />
can be consistent with quantum mechanics. &quot;No local hidden variables&quot; 
<br />
and all that.)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My own approach has been to regard emergence as the repositioning of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer of a system such that the mathematical descriptions you have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; using fall over/cease to be relevant. The idea that the math can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seamlessly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transcend an observer’s scope is, I concluded, simply meaningless as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; math is defined by the observer’s scope. The prejudices of our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; position as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers are therefore automatically destined to be embedded in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descriptors of things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If this is the case then one cannot overlook the use of computers or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the AIT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach if you need to study, understand and replicate real-world 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (in particular, MIND) that transcend the boundaries of emergence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Will the historians look back on our obsession with closed form math 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it as the machinations of mathematical youth? Para *** above is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clincher
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I have been unable to distil a definitive stance from all the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; writings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Clues anyone?
</em><br />
<br />There are many phenomena which have no closed-form, simple description. 
<br />
That watch on the beach clearly is not going to have some master 
<br />
differential equation describing it. And e. coli is not likely to have 
<br />
some simple theory behind it: it emerged/evolved as the result of many, 
<br />
many interactions with other e. coli, with a complex environment of 
<br />
chemicals and proteins, and the resulting code is &quot;packed&quot; with a lot 
<br />
of stuff.
<br />
<br />All of these things are interesting from an information theory point of 
<br />
view, an AIT point of view, and other mathematical and philosophical 
<br />
points of view.
<br />
<br />But the evidence is slim that these things have anything at all to do 
<br />
with what's going on 30 orders of magnitude away in space, time, and 
<br />
energy, down where perhaps spin foams are bubbling with instantons, 
<br />
where perhaps wormholes are opening and closing, where perhaps 
<br />
Kalabi-Yau topological structures are vibrating or whatever it is they 
<br />
do.
<br />
<br />Fascinating stuff, to be sure.
