<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the first 95% of all OM's available to you. Well, that's why you're a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;few decades old, rather than thousands of years old at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;ever-thinning tail end of the curve. But this is still consistent with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the expectation of an infinite subjective lifespan as per QI.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, this view would imply that although I am likely to reach reasonable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusions about measure if I assume my current OM is &quot;typical&quot;, I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inevitably going to find myself in lower and lower measure OMs in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future, where the assumption that the current one is typical will lead to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more and more erroneous conclusions.
</em><br />
<br />That's right, but the same is true in any case for the atypical
<br />
observers who assume that they are typical. Suppose I've forgotten how
<br />
old I am, but I am reliably informed that I will live to the age of
<br />
120 years and one minute. Then I would be foolish to guess that I am
<br />
currently over 120 years old; but at the same time, I know with
<br />
certainty that I will *eventually* reach that age.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess if you believe there is no real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; temporal relation between OMs, that any sense of an observer who is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successively experiencing a series of different OMs is an illusion and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the only real connection between OMs is that memories one has may resemble
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the current experiences of another, then there isn't really a problem with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this perspective (after all, I have no problem with the idea that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ordinary Doomsday Argument applied to civilizations implies that eventually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the last remaining humans will have a position unusually close to the end,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and they'll all reach erroneous conclusions if they attempt to apply the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Doomsday Argument to their own birth order...the reason I have no problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with this is that I don't expect to inevitably 'become' them, they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separate individuals who happen to have an unusual place in the order of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human births).
</em><br />
<br />That's exactly how I view OM's. It is necessary that they be at least
<br />
this, since even if they are strung together temporally in some other
<br />
way (such as being generated in the same head) they won't form a
<br />
continuous stream of consciousness unless they have the appropriate
<br />
memory relationship. It is also sufficient, since I would have the
<br />
sense of continuity of consciousness even if my OM's were generated at
<br />
different points in space and time.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I've always favored the idea that a theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness would determine some more &quot;objective&quot; notion of temporal flow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than just qualitative similarities in memories, that if my current OM is X
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then there would be some definite ratio between the probability that my next
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OM would be Y vs. Z.
</em><br />
<br />If you assume that the probability is determined by the ratio of the
<br />
measure of Y to Z, given that Y and Z are equally good candidate
<br />
successor OM's, this takes care of it and is moreover completely
<br />
independent of any theory of consciousness. All that is needed is that
<br />
the appropriate OM's be generated; how, when, where or by whom is
<br />
irrelevant.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This leads me to the analogy of pools of water with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; water flowing between them that I discussed in this post:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/msg/07cd5c7676f6f6a1">http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/msg/07cd5c7676f6f6a1</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Consider the following analogy--we have a bunch of tanks of water, and each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;tank is constantly pumping a certain amount of its own water to a bunch of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;other tanks, and having water pumped into it from other tanks. The ratio
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;between the rates that a given tank is pumping water into two other tanks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;corresponds to the ratio between the probabilities that a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;observer-moment will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;succeeded by one of two other possible OMs--if you imagine individual water
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;molecules as observers, then the ratio between rates water is going to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;two tanks will be the same as the ratio between the probabilities that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;given molecule in the current tank will subsequently find itself in one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;those two tanks. Meanwhile, the total amount of water in a tank would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;correspond to the absolute probability of a given OM--at any given time, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;you randomly select a single water molecule from the collection of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;molecules in all tanks, the amount of water in a tank is proportional to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;probability your randomly-selected molecule will be in that tank.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Now, for most ways of arranging this system, the total amount of water in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;different tanks will be changing over time. In terms of the analogy, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;would be like imposing some sort of universal time-coordinate on the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;multiverse and saying the absolute probability of finding yourself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;experiencing a given OM changes with time, which seems pretty implausible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;to me. But if the system is balanced in such a way that, for each tank, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;total rate that water is being pumped out is equal to the total rate that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;water is being pumped in, then the system as a whole will be in a kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;equilibrium, with no variation in the amount of water in any tank over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;time. So in terms of OMs, this suggests a constraint on the relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;between the absolute probabilities and the conditional probabilities, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;this constraint (together with some constraints imposed by a 'theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;consciousness' of some kind) might actually help us find a unique
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;self-consistent way to assign both sets of probabilities, an idea I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;elaborated on in the &quot;Request for a glossary of acronyms&quot; thread.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (also see the followup post at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/38g8yt">http://tinyurl.com/38g8yt</a> ...and to see the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context of the whole thread go to <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2wsowb">http://tinyurl.com/2wsowb</a> , and for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Request for a glossary of acronyms' thread which I mentioned at the end of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the quote go to <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2wah5v">http://tinyurl.com/2wah5v</a> )
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, the requirement that the system be in &quot;equilibrium&quot;, with the total
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amount of water in each tanks not changing over time, means that if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; randomly select one of all the water molecules in the system &quot;now&quot;, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability it will be in any one of the various tanks (corresponding to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different OMs with a measure assigned) will be the same as if you randomly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; select one of the water molecules, then wait a while so that molecule has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time to travel through a number of successive tanks, and want to know what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the probability is that it will be in the given tank &quot;then&quot;. This means that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at any moment in a water molecule's history, it will always be likely to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reach good conclusions if it considers itself to be randomly selected from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the set of all tanks weighted by their &quot;absolute probability&quot; (corresponding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the absolute measure on each OM), you don't have a situation where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's a special moment where they'll be correct if they reason this way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but their conclusions will grow more and more erroneous if they do so at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; later points in their history, or a situation where there is some global
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion of &quot;time&quot; and the absolute probability associated with each tank is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changing over time.
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand how the probability that a water molecule will be
<br />
in a given tank stays constant over time. Sure, the probability that a
<br />
random water molecule is in a given tank is proportional to the volume
<br />
in that tank, but once a particular water molecule is identified,
<br />
isn't it increasingly likely as time increases to end up in a
<br />
downstream tank, regardless of the volume of the downstream tanks?
<br />
<br />You seem to be allowing for the possibility that your next OM might
<br />
not actually be your next OM. Quoting from one of your above-cited
<br />
posts:
<br />
<br />&quot;So suppose we
<br />
calculate the absolute probability of different possible OMs being my &quot;next&quot;
<br />
experience *without* taking into account specific knowledge of what my
<br />
current OM is, by doing a sum over the absolute probability of each OM being
<br />
my current experience multiplied by the conditional probability that that OM
<br />
will be followed by the OM whose probability of being my &quot;next&quot; experience
<br />
we want to calculate.&quot;
<br />
<br />It seems to me that you *have* to take into account specific knowledge
<br />
of your current OM in these questions. Your current OM fixes you in
<br />
identity and in time. You don't have to consider that you will turn
<br />
into a five year old, or into George Bush, even if the multiverse is
<br />
teeming with George Bushes and five year old Jesses. The only OM's you
<br />
need consider for your next experience are those which count as t-now
<br />
+ delta-t versions of yourself.
