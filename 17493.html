Hi,
<br />
<br />I sum up, a little bit, and then I go quickly, just to provide some  
<br />
motivation for the sequel.
<br />
<br />We have seen the notion of set. We have seen examples of finite sets  
<br />
and infinite sets.
<br />
<br />For example the sets
<br />
<br />A = {0, 1, 2},
<br />
<br />B = {2, 3}
<br />
<br />are finite.
<br />
<br />The set N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} is infinite.
<br />
<br />We can make the union of sets, and their intersection:
<br />
<br />A union B = {x such-that x is in A OR x is in B} = {0, 1, 2, 3}
<br />
<br />A intersection B = {x such-that x is in A AND x (the same x) is in B}  
<br />
= {2}. 02 is the only x being both in A and B.
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />We have seen the notion of subset. X is a subset of Y, if each time  
<br />
that x is in X, x is also in Y.
<br />
<br />And we have seen the notion of powerset of a set. The powerset is the  
<br />
set of all subset of a set.
<br />
<br />Example: the powerset of {2, 3} is the set {{ }, {2}, {3}, {2, 3}}.
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />In particular we have seen that the number of element of the powerset  
<br />
of a set with n elements is 2^n.
<br />
<br />Example: {2, 3} has two elements, and the powerset of {2, 3}, i.e.   
<br />
{{ }, {2}, {3}, {2, 3}} has 2^2 = 04 elements. OK?
<br />
<br />We have seen the notion of function from a set A to a set B.
<br />
<br />It is just a set of couples (x, y) with x in A and y in B. x is  
<br />
supposed to be any elements of A, and y some element of B.
<br />
<br />To be a function, a set of couples has to verify the *functional  
<br />
condition* that no x is send to two or more different y. This is  
<br />
because we want y be depending on x. Think about the function which  
<br />
describes how the temperature  evolves with respect to time: an  
<br />
instant t cannot be &quot;send&quot; on two different temperature.
<br />
<br />Let A = {1, 2} and B = {a, b, c}
<br />
<br />F1 = {(1, a), (2, a)}
<br />
<br />F2 = {(1, c}, (2, a)}
<br />
<br />F1 and F2 are functions.
<br />
<br />But the following are not:
<br />
<br />G1 = {(1, a), (2, b}, (2, c)}  because 2 is send on two different  
<br />
elements
<br />
<br />G2 = {(1, a), (2, b), (1, b)} because 01 is send on two different  
<br />
elements.
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />We have then consider the set of all functions from A to B, written  
<br />
B^A, and seen that this number is equal to
<br />
card(B) ^card(A)  where card(A) is the number of elements of A.    A  
<br />
is supposed to be a finite set, and later we will see how Cantor will  
<br />
generalize the notion of cardinal for infinite sets.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />We have then studied the notion of bijection.
<br />
<br /><br />A function from A to B is a bijection from A to B when it is both
<br />
<br />- ONE-ONE  two different elements of A are send to two different  
<br />
elements of B
<br />
<br />- ONTO, this means that all elements of B are in the range of the  
<br />
function, i.e. for any y in B there is some couple (x, y) in the  
<br />
function.
<br />
<br />Example: F from {a, b} to {1, 2} with F = {(a, 1}, (b, 2)} is a  
<br />
bijection, but G = {(a, 1), (b, 1)} is not because G is not ONTO, nor  
<br />
ONE-ONE.
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />We have seen that if A and B are two finite sets, then we have
<br />
<br />A and B have the same number of element if and only if there exists a  
<br />
bijection from A to B.
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />Now I can give you the very ingenious idea from Cantor. Cantor will  
<br />
say that two INFINITE sets have the same cardinality if and only if  
<br />
there exists a bijection between them.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />This leads to some surprises.
<br />
<br />Let N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} be the usual set of all natural numbers.  
<br />
This is obviously an infinite set, all right?
<br />
Let 2N = {0, 2, 4, 6, ....} be the set of even numbers. This is  
<br />
obviously a subset of N OK?, and actually an infinite subset of N.
<br />
<br /><br />Now consider the function from N to 2N which send each n on 2*n. This  
<br />
function is one-one. Indeed if n is different from m, 2*n is different  
<br />
from 2*m. OK?
<br />
And that function, from N to 2N is onto. Indeed any element of 2N, has  
<br />
the shape 2*n for some n, and (n, 2*n) belongs to the function.
<br />
<br />In extension the bijection is {(0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 8),  
<br />
(5, 10), (6, 12), ...}
<br />
<br />So here we have the peculiar fact that a bijection can exist between a  
<br />
set and some of its proper subset. (A subset of A is a proper subset  
<br />
of A if it is different of A).
<br />
<br /><br />The first who discovered this is GALILEE. But, alas, he missed Cantor  
<br />
discovery. Like Gauss later, such behavior was for them an argument to  
<br />
abandon the study of infinite sets. They behave too much weirdly for  
<br />
them.
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />At first sight we could think that all infinite sets have the same  
<br />
cardinality. After all those sets are infinite, how could an infinite   
<br />
set have a bigger cardinality than another infinite set? This is the  
<br />
second surprise, and the main discovery of Cantor: the fact that there  
<br />
are some infinite sets B such that there is no bijection between N and  
<br />
B.
<br />
<br />Cantor will indeed show that there is no bijection between N and N^N,  
<br />
nor between N and 2^N. We will study this.
<br />
<br />Cantor will prove a general theorem, know as Cantor theorem, which  
<br />
asserts that for ANY set A, there are no bijection between A and the  
<br />
powerset of A.
<br />
The powerset operation leads to a ladder of &quot;bigger infinities&quot;.  I  
<br />
will come back with some detail later.
<br />
<br />Some surprises were BAD surprises. Conceptual problems which Cantor  
<br />
will &quot;hide&quot; in its desk, to treat them later. The so-called paradoxes  
<br />
of &quot;naïve set theory&quot;. The root of what has been called the crisis in  
<br />
mathematics.
<br />
<br />For example, we could naively consider the set of all sets. Often  
<br />
called the universal set, or Universe (of sets). Surely no set can be  
<br />
bigger that this one? But by Cantor theorem the powerset of the  
<br />
universe has to be bigger than the universe. So there is a problem.
<br />
<br />And the naïve conception of sets will lead to many other problems.  
<br />
Torgny Tholerus has mentioned some other problems, if you remember.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />So what?
<br />
<br />Mainly three approaches have been proposed to solve those conceptual  
<br />
problems.
<br />
<br />1) The most liberal one, suggested by Hilbert, who was fond of Cantor  
<br />
theory. He said that no one will drive us away from Cantor Paradise.  
<br />
He suggested to build a formal system capable of talking about sets,  
<br />
and capable of proving the main theorem of Cantor, but free of the  
<br />
paradoxes. This will lead to the modern axiomatic trend in  
<br />
mathematics. Hilbert asked for the proof of the consistency of such  
<br />
formal theories, and this will be shown just impossible, by Gödel.  
<br />
Despite this, most mathematicians have followed this path, explicitly  
<br />
or implicitly. In most axiomatic set theories, the axiom will prevent,  
<br />
for example, the existence of a universal set or universe. To be sure,  
<br />
some highly non standard axiomatic set theory allows a Universal set  
<br />
to exist, for example Quine new foundations (cf some post by Brian and  
<br />
Adam).
<br />
<br />2) The least liberal one, suggested by Brouwer (the main opponent to  
<br />
Cantor and Hilbert). To abandon classical logic, and &quot;set realism&quot;.  
<br />
This consists in abandoning the law of the excluded middle (p or ~p)  
<br />
in mathematics, and this will lead to intuitionist mathematics and  
<br />
philosophy, which is a form of mathematical solipsism.
<br />
<br />3) Intermediate solutions. One will consist in searching a weaker  
<br />
notion of function, capable of satisfying both the intuitionist and  
<br />
the classical mathematicians. This will lead mathematicians to the  
<br />
notion of computable functions, and when Cantor reasoning is applied  
<br />
again, this will lead to the (mathematical) notion of universal  
<br />
machine. In my opinion: this is the biggest discovery ever done by  
<br />
humanity. And both UDA and AUDA are just non sensical without that  
<br />
discovery (and this explains why I insist on this). Note that from  
<br />
empirical data, we can guess that &quot;nature&quot; has done that discovery and  
<br />
has exploited it again, and again, and again, and again ....
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
<br />
<br /><br />Exercise: if you have not yet done them, or understand them, please  
<br />
take some time to just think about those questions. I have to solve  
<br />
them properly to proceed. You may try to read Brent's correct answer  
<br />
to some of those questions.
<br />
<br />Show that there is a bijection between the following sets:
<br />
<br />N and 2N, 3N, 4N, 5N, ....     (nN = the set of multiple of n).
<br />
<br />N and Z    (Z = all integers, that is postive and negative integers, Z  
<br />
= {... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
<br />
<br />N and Q  (Q = the reduced fractions, or the decimal periodics)
<br />
<br />N and NxN
<br />
<br />N and NxNxN.
<br />
<br />The powerset of A (finite set) and the set of functions from A to {0, 1}
<br />
<br />The powerset of N and the set of functions from N to {0, 1}.
<br />
<br />The powerset of N and the real numbers.  (real numbers = finite of  
<br />
infinite decimals).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*                                
<br />
*                                    *
<br />
<br />Take it easy, and enjoy if you have the time and taste,
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
