Dear John,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't know how tolerable our discussion may be for the list, but for me it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is enjoyable. Amazing, in how many things (aspects?) we DO agree, coming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fundamentally from quite different worldviews.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I'm sure we agree on something and be confident we will be able to agree
<br />
about what we disagree ...
<br />
Anyway discussion is only interesting between people who disagrees (as far
<br />
as they are willing to search the disagreement point).
<br />
I will be obliged now to write the paper for Amsterdam, which will be
<br />
an english version of my Paris paper (except I will not talk about Changeux
<br />
and Connes).
<br />
I hope George and Kory are not angry because I don't give them enough
<br />
Holiday work ;)
<br />
What should I do? Explain my work top down or bottom up. Teach logic?
<br />
Wait for people reading Smullyan's FU.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; To be frank I do think Comp and QM are more universal than &gt;human, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;perhaps what *is* human is to considere comp and &gt;QM as human thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'YOU do think' (!) In our 'human' restrictions we cannot even think about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'other' ways of thinking. If it went through our mind, it DID become 'human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thinking'. If 'it' happened to go into and through it at all. Whatever we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;imagine as 'non human' IS human with a twist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Including your argument Godel II, a gem of the 'human' thought.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here I don not understand you at all. Why are you so stuck by our
<br />
&quot;human&quot; nature. We are mammals too. Why don't you say that whatever we
<br />
think it did become mammal thinking, that our imagination get a
<br />
mammal twist. The same with earth-like creature.
<br />
Actually even without the comp hyp, we are (at least) universal machine
<br />
(in the &quot;church thesis&quot; sense, I can prove it to you).
<br />
So why don't you say that whatever we think it gets the universal machine
<br />
twist?
<br />
I really don't understand.
<br />
Furthermore, why should such a twist, as human (mammal,
<br />
life being, universal machine, whatever ...) prevent us to bet on some
<br />
reality beyond us?  Whatever we are.
<br />
And perhaps to bet wrongly and precisely enough to be able to learn ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Sci fi is the worst human violent emotional stupidity, neither sci nor fi.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So (just not so bad) are our dreams about 'nonhuman' thinking).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Come on! *Some Sci Fi* are perhaps bad, but some could be
<br />
master piece of reasoning, but too much in conceptual advance
<br />
to be appreciate by current academical institution or even by the
<br />
sc fi author himself.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;belongs to all possible universes&quot;&lt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consider the impossible ones.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />But I told you that is exactly what Godel II makes it possible to do
<br />
in a clean sharable (between universal machine) way.
<br />
And that a way to be more independent of our human nature.
<br />
But of course whatever I do you will always be able to say: &quot;human!&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I will try your article with my rusty French, I never read math-based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;science in French (and that was ~50 years ago) so I have doubts about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understanding it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />French and english are quite alike for math: look
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;function is fonction
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;relation is relation
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;collection is collection
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;theorem is theoreme
<br />
lemma is lemme
<br />
proposition is proposition
<br />
Ok, some exception (exception) the french for 'set' is 'ensemble'.
<br />
But you can wait for my amsterdam paper.
<br />
You can also read my 2000 Computation Consciousness and the Quantum
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/CC&amp;Q.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/CC&amp;Q.pdf</a>
<br />
Or my older 1991 Mechanism and personal identity: 
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/M&amp;PI_15-MAI-91.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/M&amp;PI_15-MAI-91.pdf</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am afraid to read 'Smullyan's little bible' -  it may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;too good. Besides you would not believe how many people suggest such an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inescapble 30,000th ONE book to read.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is up to you of course. But please don't think I want to convince you
<br />
or anyone on any truth ... I certainly would like to share a feeling
<br />
of supertranscendantal *beauty* in the way it seems the laws of nature
<br />
should arise from all machine dreams ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What I am reading now is &quot;Krakatoa&quot;, with a cultural history of the Dutch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;British takeover of the Portugese South-of-Asia world -  part of my cultural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;debt of information.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />This is certainly interesting too. Although no clearly in the scope of the 
<br />
list.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then you wrote:  &quot;?&quot; after my par including the 'model' view I carry. To
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;attempt an inadequate rambling about this point: I consider the universe(s)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;parts of the wholeness they emerged from, the plenitude (not Plato's), an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unimaginable-undescribable everything in infinite invariance of infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;symmetrical changes (no time involved). Such emergences are inevitable by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the fact that the 'everything' involves (local - without a space-concept,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;transitionally occurring) asymmetries  ie. universes, ....
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />You are quick here. I imagine things ... I dont' figure that clearly. I must
<br />
read it again.
<br />
I tell you if I understand when I understand.
<br />
<br />I think, John, that we agree that wholism is important and reductionism
<br />
should be avoid.
<br />
But what I would like to explain is that the idea of being a machine
<br />
is not a reductionism. It is only a reductionism in the eyes of those who
<br />
have a reductionist conception of machine. Such a conception is provably
<br />
false since Emil Post, Turing, Church works.
<br />
With comp, even better, &quot;to be a machine&quot; gives tools capable of
<br />
vaccinate us toward an extremely large collection of reductionist trap.
<br />
A lot of people miss that point, like Rosen you mention in your 2004
<br />
draft.
<br />
Oh but you know German. The best book to understand how Church's thesis
<br />
can kill the dragon of reductionism is the book by Judson Webb:
<br />
Webb, 1980
<br />
Webb, J. C. (1980). Mechanism, Mentalism and
<br />
Metamathematics: An essay on Finitism. D. Reidel Publishing
<br />
Company, Dordrecht, Holland.
<br />
(It is an American book but it has a lot of quotation in German)
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
<br />Bruno
