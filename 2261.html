Dear Bruno:
<br />
<br />Thank you for your interest and comments.
<br />
<br />I guess I got my model too compressed.
<br />
<br />So I will answer some questions and expand things a bit plus cover one 
<br />
stage at a time.
<br />
<br />A) My use of incompleteness is for the most part rather standard I think 
<br />
[terms defined below]: If a logic system is both complete and consistent 
<br />
then there exists a Decision Procedure.  Thus a consistent logic system 
<br />
absent a Decision Procedure is incomplete.
<br />
<br />B) Consistent: A choice between two meaningful alternates must be inherent 
<br />
in the logic.
<br />
<br />C) Complete: All alternates meaningful to the logic have such an inherent 
<br />
choice.
<br />
<br />D) Decision Procedure: An automatic procedure for listing all alternates 
<br />
that have an inherent choice.  A computer program as per Turing.
<br />
<br />What happened historically:
<br />
<br />Godel constructed meaningful alternates for which there was no inherent 
<br />
choice in a particular class of logic - finite, consistent, Formal 
<br />
Axiomatic Systems [fc-FAS].  That is systems concerned with the structure 
<br />
of a string of symbols selected from a set of such symbols [an alphabet].
<br />
<br />Turing using Cantor's diagonal argument demonstrated the general lack of a 
<br />
Decision Procedure for consistent FAS up to and including the largest 
<br />
possible one - one containing a countable infinity of inherent choices.
<br />
<br />Chaitin showed that a consistent FAS that actually has a Decision Procedure 
<br />
and if that procedure is finite then the FAS could not contain a choice 
<br />
between alternates that were more complex than the Decision Procedure 
<br />
except for a constant.  This shows the existence of all sorts of alternates 
<br />
for which there is no inherent choice in such FAS.  My model focuses on 
<br />
those that are meaningful in a certain way.
<br />
<br />E) In my model &quot;meaningful&quot; requires that extending the FAS to include one 
<br />
or more of the Chaitin candidate alternates as a new inherent choice aside 
<br />
from preserving consistency does not alter the previously existing set of 
<br />
Chaitin inherent choices except in a very specific way. To partially 
<br />
accomplish this I take the view that it is not necessary to add the new 
<br />
inherent choices as new axioms.  For some FAS I take the view that one can 
<br />
add additional inherent choices by adding symbols to the alphabet while 
<br />
retaining the existing set of axioms and set of rules.  In other words, the 
<br />
added inherent choices are new tails of existing running theorem cascades 
<br />
that - to preserve consistency - preclude any old tails under a mandatory 
<br />
consistency preserving rule that all theorems must contain all symbols 
<br />
currently in the alphabet when the cascade reaches them.  This does not 
<br />
intend to introduce &quot;time&quot; but recognizes that cascades are a series of 
<br />
steps and may be &quot;running&quot; when the incompleteness resolving event takes 
<br />
place.
<br />
<br />On to my model:
<br />
<br /><br />BEGINNINGS
<br />
<br />My model is a type of zero absolute information approach.  However, I 
<br />
believe it may differ from others in several key ways.
<br />
<br />I actually have two initiation paths for this type of universe set.  I 
<br />
think it is necessary to arrive at a position where there are at least two 
<br />
paths between which one can not make a logical choice.  Otherwise it seems 
<br />
you would put yourself in the position of proving an axiom.
<br />
<br />I can think of only one absolutely imperative set of alternates which must 
<br />
exist and must be or become an inherent choice.
<br />
<br />1) Is &quot;nothing&quot; stable with respect to &quot;everything&quot; - Yes or No?
<br />
<br />2) Is &quot;everything&quot; stable with respect to &quot;nothing&quot; - Yes or No?
<br />
<br />I see the answers as No and Yes respectively.  &quot;Nothing&quot; must become 
<br />
&quot;everything&quot; to answer the question and &quot;everything&quot; will return even if it 
<br />
should somehow become &quot;nothing&quot;.  I argued only the first branch in my 
<br />
compression.  Too much compression it seems.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Well that is my view up to &quot;everything&quot; exists.  More later.
<br />
<br />Hal
