</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; It gets cumbersome to qualify everything with &quot;given the appearance 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of &gt; a physical world&quot;. As I have said before, I am not entirely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; convinced &gt; that comp is true,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Nor am I. (Remind that no machine can, from its first person point of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; view, be &quot;entirely convinced&quot; that comp is true. Comp is an axiom for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a theory, and the beauty of it is that comp can explain why it has to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be a guess. The &quot;yes doctor&quot; has to be an act of faith. It is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (meta?)-theological.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; precisely because because such ideas as a conscious computation &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; supervening on any physical process
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This does not follow at all. We have already have some discussion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; about this and since then I have a more clear-cut argument. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Unfortunately the argument is based on some result in mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; logic concerning the distinction between real numbers and integers. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We can come back on this in another thread. For a logician there is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; case that  &quot;real number&quot; are a simplification of the notion of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; natural number. An identical polynomial equation can be turing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal when the variables are conceived to belong to the integers, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but is never turing universal when the variables belong to the reals. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Well, a case can be made that the vacuum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; or on no physical process may be considered absurd.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This would be fair enough in case the idea that consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; supervenes on physical processes was not absurd in the first place. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In all your post you do assume comp. For comp to be false you have to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assume actual physical infinities and give a reason why consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; supervenes on that. But in some reasoning it seems clear to me you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; talk life if comp is true, when referring to the functional role of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; neurotransmitters, the fact that slight change in the brain are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; permitted, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Standard computationalism says that mental processes supervene on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical processes, and moreover that these physical processes with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their attendant mental processes may be emulated by a digital 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmmm....    .... OK (say).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problems with this theory are:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. The implementation problem: everything can implement a computation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you look at it the right way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Normally this is of no consequence - mapping the vibration of atoms in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a rock to a word processing program would be at least as difficult as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; building a conventional computer and writing the software for it - but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if computations can be conscious, then the conscious computations are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hiding all around us.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here I disagree. This has never been proved, except that in quantum 
<br />
field theory a case can be developed for justifying that the quantum 
<br />
vacuum quantum-simulates the whole quantum multiverse. But this has 
<br />
nothing to do with comp. It is true with any realistic non collapse 
<br />
interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Actually it less a problem for a 
<br />
computationalist because this is equivalent to some homogeneous 
<br />
addition of universal dovetailer &quot;everywhere&quot; (if that exists, which is 
<br />
not even the case). There is no reason this would change any relative 
<br />
and internal measure. But with my argument, anything physical, 
<br />
including the vacuum, is emergent from the dreams, so there is no 
<br />
Putnam-Chalmers-Mallah problem for comp. I explained this to Jacques 
<br />
Mallah some years ago.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. The Maudlin/Marchal argument showing that even if you specify that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a computer must handle counterfactuals in order to avoid the &quot;trivial&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusion (1), you end up concluding that physical processes are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irrelevant to consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You (BM) think that (1) is absurd but (2) is OK; Maudlin thinks that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1) and (2) are both absurd, and that therefore computationalism is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flawed theory. You would like to keep computationalism but drop the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computers, i.e. the supervenience thesis. I am not certain which I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would rather drop: computationalism or the idea of disembodied 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />I am quite willing to drop comp, once I get a real flaw. Now I have 
<br />
almost never take seriously the supervenience thesis, if only because 
<br />
it leads to an insoluble problem (more or less the one called 
<br />
&quot;mind-body&quot; problem in the literature). Also, one of my motivation 
<br />
since the beginning is to get an explanation for the appearance of 
<br />
matter. Physicists have developed, through Aristotelian philosophy, a 
<br />
methodology for progressing without addressing that question. It has 
<br />
been a powerful methodological idea, but it is flawful for those who 
<br />
ask themselves what is the nature of matter. I am worried how much it 
<br />
has been easy for physicist to accept pure non sense like wave collapse 
<br />
or Bohr unrealistic attitude. It works for building ships and bombs, 
<br />
not for getting a better understanding of what happen.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; It is quite possible, for example, that there is something special 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; about the structure of the brain which leads to consciousness, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a &gt; digital computer will not be able to copy this, even if it copies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 3rd &gt; person observable behaviour. Against that idea is the question 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of why &gt; we didn't evolve to be zombies, but maybe we would have if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nature had &gt; electronic circuits to play with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You are saying that zombie are possible if comp is false. I can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; agree. Actually I believe that comp entails the existence of a notion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of local zombie (which can make you believe that they are conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; during a time).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; If I had to guess between comp and not-comp I don't think I could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; do &gt; better than flipping a coin.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Comp is my working hypothesis, and I tend to consider that arguing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for or against comp is a bit of a waste of time (especially given 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that comp is undecidable for machines).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Still I am astonished that you would flip a coin on that matter. Comp 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is just the statement that &quot;I&quot; am turing emulable at some level. Even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; if we have to emulate the quantum state of the entire galaxy (some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;generalized brain&quot;) comp remain true unless we have both:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - my brain = the &quot;complete physical&quot; description of the galaxy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - the &quot;object&quot; galaxy is not turing emulable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is possible to drop computationalism and keep a form of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functionalism, without introducing magical effects or even any new 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics. For example, it is possible that consciousness is a property 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of actual neuronal activity, and although you might be able to emulate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this activity using a digital computer, even to the point where you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can build a substitute brain that behaves just like the biological 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalent, it won't be conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In order to build a proper replacement brain you would have to copy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the actual physical structure of the neurons, not just emulate them. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am not sure that I believe this theory but it is theoretically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes of course. But there is nothing new here. Even comp itself forces 
<br />
us (the machine) to find non-comp plausible. I mean comp can be false. 
<br />
My main technical point is that comp is even falsifiable, given that it 
<br />
gives the laws of physics. The UDA does not only show that physics 
<br />
emerges from numbers, it show exactly how physics emerges from numbers. 
<br />
The comp-physics is entirely determined by the relations between 
<br />
numbers. I thought in my youth that comp would be refuted. Now that I 
<br />
have make progress (in my thesis) on the comp-physics, I am less sure. 
<br />
Indeed, where the logic of physics should occur through the relation 
<br />
between numbers, I get non trivial arithmetical quantum logics.
