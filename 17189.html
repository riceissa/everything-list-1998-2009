<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Either the &quot;I&quot; refers to my first person, and then I have ontological

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As I said on FOR, I can conceive that I wake up and realize that

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; quark, planet, galaxies and even my body were not real. I cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conceive that I wake up and realize that my consciousness is not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Ontological first person does not need an &quot;IF this or that theory is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; correct&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You are reifying theoretical constructions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think need to take a hard line on RITSIAR.  I feel that the key lies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in what Bruno terms the certainty of the ontological first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (OFP): i.e. the sine qua non of reality as it is uniquely available to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us.
</em><br />
<br />I thought you were using &quot;RITSIAR&quot; in this 1-person way. But it seems  
<br />
that
<br />
Peter Jones was using in in a 3-person way. But all the 3-things  
<br />
belong to the realm of the dubitable, and none can be real in the  
<br />
sense I am real.
<br />
I can know that I am real, but I cannot *know* for sure that I have  
<br />
fingers, or that I am made of atom, or that my hair are brown. This  
<br />
&quot;knowledge&quot; is of the conjectural, theoretical type.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since this is inescapably the foundation of any and all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; judgements whatsoever, it is simultaneously both the both point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; departure and the 'what-is-to-be-explained' of RITSIAR.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;to-be-explained&quot; means to be explained in a theory. I show that comp  
<br />
leads to a simple theory for the ontology (any universal machine, like  
<br />
a tiny fragment of arithmetic will do), and a slightly less simple  
<br />
epistemology (arithmetic + the induction axiom, so that we get the  
<br />
self-awareness theorem: Bp -&gt; BBp (if I believe p, I believe that I  
<br />
believe p).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it becomes self-evident that any and all explanatory entities -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical, computational, or whatever - are severely restricted to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; domain of epistemology.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see why. I would not put arithmetic in epistemology, or only  
<br />
in a very large sense of epistemology, the epistemology of the 0- 
<br />
person views!. It seems clearer to accept them ontologically like in  
<br />
the usual practice of math. Could be only a vocabulary problem here.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  IOW - as Bruno says above - they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretical constructions.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but this does not mean those construction does not refer to  
<br />
something real independently of us, and this is what I assume for  
<br />
comp. Even if the whole existence get annihilated, 17 would still be  
<br />
prime.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So far so obvious.  But - as has again been recognised immemorially -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solipsism is a dead-end and hence we seek a theory to capture the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation between the OFP and its environment.  But immediately we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; faced with the notorious 'explanatory gap', and it seems to me that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its most precise expression is in the gap between ontology and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemology.  Indeed, what conceivable strategy could raise these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretical constructions - to which the OFP uniquely lends existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - to the ontological certainty of their host?  Is there a coherent way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to conceive what it could mean to *be* a theoretical entity (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opposed to postulating or observing one)?
</em><br />
<br />It is the point of saying &quot;yes&quot; to the doctor. You don't say yes  
<br />
because the new brain is a good modelisation of your brain, but  
<br />
because you bet it will enact yourself completely, relatively to the  
<br />
neighborhood.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  There is something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quintessential that stubbornly eludes capture, because epistemological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; access never tells us what an entity *is* - only what can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ascertained of its 'externalised' properties.  And lest we be tempted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to accept the sum of these properties as exhausting 'existence', we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need only turn to the self-evident corrective of the OFP.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the gap must remain, and I think that now I see why Bruno appeals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply to the 'ordinary' mathematical sense of existence - because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP, under this analysis, is an epistemological schema, and its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities are theoretical constructions.
</em><br />
<br />You may confuse the reality of number, and the reality of machine/ 
<br />
theories talking about those numbers. Numbers are not viewed as  
<br />
theoretical construction. The theoretical construction are our  
<br />
theories on the numbers. It simplifies things.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence the question of jumping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ontological gap is in abeyance, perhaps permanently, but in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case in the realm of faith.
</em><br />
<br />All theories demands faith, but the faith needed for understanding  
<br />
that 17 is prime is not comparable to the act of faith needed to say  
<br />
yes to the doctor.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And if this is true for COMP, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mutatis mutandis it is true for physics.
</em><br />
<br />This is hard for many people, because our faith in a physical worlds  
<br />
relies on billions years of prejudice. Only the greeks, from -500 to  
<br />
+500, have dare to doubt it, and this gave rise to science, including  
<br />
theology. But Aristotle, and mainly its middle age disciples have  
<br />
reintroduced the naturalist dogma.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It's no use appealing to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notions of 'what it's like to be a brain' - nor what it's like to be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP-quale - because we can never say that it is 'like anything to be'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the stuff of epistemology.
</em><br />
<br />Assuming comp we can still say that it is like you feel right now.  
<br />
Only zombie cannot understand, but if they are good zombie, they will  
<br />
have no problem to fake that they understand.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence we must see our theorising and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observing - in physical, computational, or whatever terms - *in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation* to ontological certainty, not as constitutive of it.
</em><br />
<br />That's right.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily weakens what can be ascertained by theory or by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observation, but at least keeps us honest.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The unavoidable consequence of the foregoing is that atoms, quarks and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers cannot be RITSIAR.
</em><br />
<br />I thought this was obvious.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rather, they stand in some theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation to RITSIAR, but strictly on the epistemological side of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanatory gap.  They are 'real as far as theory takes us', or if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; further jargon is unavoidable: RAFATTU.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well frankly this will depend of the first &quot;T&quot; of RAFATTU. It depends  
<br />
of the theory.
<br />
With the comp theory, quarks, electrons, planet and galaxies are not  
<br />
ontologically real.
<br />
With string theory, they may be real.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The point is just that IF you survive &quot;in the RITSIAR&quot; sense,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; digital (even material, if you want) brain, then materiality has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; retrieved by coherence or gluing property of immaterial  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; computation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or there is an error in the UD Argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not clear what you mean by that. If I am transferred from a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; phsycial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; brain into a physcial computer, physicalism is unscathed. Your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; against physcialism is that is  unnecessary because something else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; is doing the work --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; My argument is not that. From what you say, I infer that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; understand the seven first steps of the UD-Argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You seem to have a problem with the 8th step, which is the step
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; showing that no &quot;work&quot; is needed at all. The usual number relations  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the work, and this without any need to reify them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; See above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; But you have to assume Platonism to get your UDA, so you have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; assume Platonism to refute physicalism. Without that assumption, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; rest doesn't follow.. It is step 0.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do I need platonism to believe in the existence of prime numbers? I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; need only the amount of arithmetical realism for saying that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (mathematical) machine x stop or doesn't stop on input y. This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; enough for the computational supervenience. And physical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; supervenience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; does not work, as the step 08 of UDA shows.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is a relief for me to see that you did look at the papers, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; realise I do not postulate platonism, only realism. So now you have  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; attribute this assumption as an implicit assumption. I'm afraid that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; such an implicit assumption exists only in your imagination.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You reify a physical primitive reality to instantiate consciousness,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and you attribute me a reification of the numbers to get the same,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the point of step 8 is to show that such a reification, be it with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; matter or number, cannot work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My argument against the *physical* instantiation of a computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind (i.e. in any non-eliminative sense) rests on the claim that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very arbitrariness of possible physical instantiations of a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation (cf Hofstadter) violates the criterion of direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervention on *specific* physical entities and relations from which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a class of emergent phenomena inherits physical - as opposed to merely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental (and hence egregiously question-begging) - stability.
</em><br />
<br />I think that this what the movie graph argument makes necessary.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Naturally, all this is per physics as ordinarily understood.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tolerating such a violation is tantamount to accepting (and this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notoriously claimed by Hofstadter et al) that *any* arbitrarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assembled set of physical entities deemed to be in the required
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'functional' relation (e.g. - famously - in an anthill) necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stabilises exactly the same 'mental state'.  AFAICS this is by itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quite sufficient to reveal such a 'mind' as intrinsically unphysical -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and a fortiori un-RITSIAR.
</em><br />
<br />Hmm... things are more subtle, but in a first approximation this can  
<br />
be useful.
<br />
Once you say yes to the digital surgeon, you can undersatnd that you  
<br />
are immaterial, in the sense you can change body everyday, like you  
<br />
can buy a new car. The movie graph shows that comp makes this  
<br />
immateriality contagious on the environment.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My argument assumes, however, that - per physicalism - a running
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation (as opposed to its specification)
</em><br />
<br />It is important to distinguish a program (immaterial static object)  
<br />
and a computation (an immaterial &quot;dynamic&quot; object, which can be finite  
<br />
or infinite, but is best handled when accepting it is infinite,  
<br />
because in that case a dynamic can be defined by a function from N to  
<br />
anything: it is a sequence of things). If not, people get troubled by  
<br />
the existence of running computation in platonia/arithmetical truth.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily requires
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *some* physical activity to transform inputs to outputs (e.g. in terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of logic gates).  Step 8, however, seems to take a step beyond this by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposing that a running computation can take the form of (as opposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to merely being described by) a machine *state*: i.e. without the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; requirement of activity.
</em><br />
<br />No, activity is required. But activity is just a function from N to  
<br />
set of states. The movie graph show that a machine cannot distinguish  
<br />
physical activity from such an arithmetical activity. A computation is  
<br />
an infinite set of numbers such that there is a universal number  
<br />
generating that sequence.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But in precisely what sense can such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'stopped' state (i.e. still within purely physical terms of reference)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be regarded as a 'running' computation, and hence - per computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory of mind - as evocative of temporal experience?
</em><br />
<br />By the invocation of a universal machine/number.
<br />
The problem, well the white rabbit problem, is that if a universal  
<br />
machine makes a sequence s1 s2 s&quot; ... a computation, then there will  
<br />
be an infinity of such universal machine and computations, and from  
<br />
the first person point of view the person belongs to all those  
<br />
computations at once.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case, in what way is step 8 intended to extend intuition beyond my own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument, which - as I have tried to show - also elicits the insight
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the direct supervention of 'functional' relations on functions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves - not on their arbitrarily-defined physical tokens - is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; central to the recovery of 'mind' from computation.
</em><br />
<br />See above.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You talk like if we knew that a primitive physical ontology exists,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but we don't know that, and the seven first step are neutral on that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You are the one insisting that for consciousness to exist, we need a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical ontology. But the step 8 shows that with comp such a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ontology, or any special ontology is spurious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And again, the onto-epistemological gap.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All the edges in the graph of the arithmetical hypostases represents  
<br />
gap from the machine point of views. 8 gaps. In details: 8 + infinity  
<br />
of gaps, because the material hypostases are graded and multiplied.
<br />
But I don't want to use AUDA too much, if some people have still  
<br />
trouble with UDA.
<br />
The discovery of the universal machine is the creative bomb which  
<br />
makes comp possible and plausible. Universal machine, like computers  
<br />
and brains, are not trivial mathematical object at all. To study comp  
<br />
without computer science, is like doing cosmology without QM and GR.  
<br />
Of course we can have the deepest intuition right, by experience, but  
<br />
to make a sharble verifiable theory, I am afraid we cannot dismiss  
<br />
some math ...
