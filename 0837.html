Just peeked in on the list, having come to its central position by my
<br />
own means, from the artificial intelligence position that simulated
<br />
minds can be conscious of their own existence.
<br />
<br />Chapter 7 of my recent &quot;Robot&quot; &lt;<a href="http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/book97">http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/book97</a>&gt;
<br />
derives the idea that all universes are equally real from the position
<br />
that robots can be conscious.  It notes that the totality of all
<br />
universes (like the library of all books) requires no information to
<br />
construct, that, although any of us (however we define ourselves)
<br />
exists in an infinity of bizarre universes, we're most likely to find
<br />
ourselves in ones that require the least amount of initial information
<br />
to explain us, and that we are stuck on a subjective path that needs
<br />
the least coincidences to keep our consciousness going (and that turns
<br />
out to be the boring physical universe that made us by Darwinian
<br />
selection, all working under a very simple TOE that resulted in the
<br />
visible universe as a side effect).  It also notes that, no matter
<br />
what happens to us, among all universes there are some in which our
<br />
consciousness continues, and we will always find ourselves in those
<br />
(and never in ones where our consciousness does not continue!).  For
<br />
some things that happen (like our brain rotting) the simplest
<br />
continuation of our consciousness may no longer involve the exact
<br />
continuation of the old physical laws.
<br />
<br />Here's a compactified presentation of of the core train of thought:
<br />
<br />Start with the premise (A) that properly designed minds implemented in
<br />
computers can have conscious experiences just like minds implemented
<br />
in flesh. Also assume (B) that experiences of rich virtual worlds can
<br />
be as vivid as experiences of the physical world. Immersive video
<br />
games make the second premise non-controversial. Materialistic
<br />
accounts of the evolution of life and intelligence, providing a rough
<br />
roadmap for the evolution of machine intelligence, make the first
<br />
premise compelling to AI guys like me. (Also, Occamesque, it demands
<br />
no mysterious special new ingredients to make consciousness.)
<br />
<br />Let AI = Artificial Intelligence and VR = Virtual Reality.
<br />
Combine the two halves of both premises into four cases:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) a flesh human in the physical world.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) a conscious AI controlling a physical-world robot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) a human immersed in a VR, maybe by neural interface.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) a conscious AI linked to a VR, all inside one computer.
<br />
<br />Case 4 is a handle on the subjective/objective problem that was not
<br />
available to past philosophers. Unlike flesh, dreams, stories,
<br />
sensation-controlling demons or divine ideas, it is nearly free of
<br />
slippery unstated assumptions about human minds or physical
<br />
reality. On the outside, we have a simple objective device stepping
<br />
through states. Yet, on the inside, there is a subjective mind
<br />
experiencing its own existence.
<br />
<br />What connects the internal experience to the external mechanism? As in
<br />
any simulation, it is an interpretation. Storage locations can be
<br />
viewed as representing bit patterns, numbers, text, pressures,
<br />
temperatures, sensations, moods, beliefs, feelings or more abstract
<br />
relationships. In general, different observers will have different
<br />
interpretations. Someone looking at the simulation trying to improve
<br />
memory management in the operating system will likely put a different
<br />
interpretation on the memory contents than someone wanting to view
<br />
life in the simulation, or to talk with its inhabitant.
<br />
<br />But does the AI cease to exist if there is no one outside who happens
<br />
to have the correct interpretation to see it? Suppose an experimenter
<br />
sets up an AI/VR, and builds a translating box allowing him to plug in
<br />
and talk with the AI. But on the way home, the experimenter is killed
<br />
and the translating box destroyed. The computer continues to run, but
<br />
no one suspects it holds a living, feeling being. Does the AI cease to
<br />
be? Suppose one day enough of the experimenter's notes are found and a
<br />
new translating box is built and attached. The rediscovered AI then
<br />
tells a long story about its life in the interval when it was
<br />
unobserved.
<br />
<br />My take on this is that there is an observer of the AI even when it
<br />
goes unobserved from the outside, namely the AI itself. By
<br />
interpreting some process inside the box as a conscious observer, we
<br />
grant that process the power of making observations about itself. That
<br />
self-interpretation exists in its own right whether or not someone
<br />
outside ever appreciates it. But once you allow externally
<br />
undiscovered interpretations of AIs that exist only in their own
<br />
eyes, you open the door to all possible interpretations which contain
<br />
self-aware observers. Which is fine by me. I think this universe is
<br />
just such a self-interpretation, one self-defining subjective thread
<br />
in an infinity or alternatives that are just as real to their
<br />
inhabitants.
