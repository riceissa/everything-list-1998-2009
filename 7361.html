<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; First, I think that it's important to remove the qualifier &quot;identical&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; here. Would two copies cease to be identical if one atom were out of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; place?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I meant something more like &quot;running the same program&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Okay, that's fine.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; On another tack, you are the same person, etc., that you were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; five minutes ago where strict identicalness isn't even close.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From a third-person POV, why am I the same person? If you don't believe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's an objective truth about continuity of identity, isn't it just a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort of aesthetic call?
</em><br />
<br />When we say that you are the same person you were a few
<br />
minutes ago, of course, we are starting from common usage
<br />
and going from there. Normal people value their lives, 
<br />
and don't want to die, say, next week. Even legally, people
<br />
are regarded as having an identity that doesn't change much
<br />
over time.
<br />
<br />Objectively, (i.e. 3rd person), there really *is* a fuzzy set 
<br />
of states that ought to be regarded as Jesse Mazur. Any 
<br />
intelligent investigator (or even a program that we cannot
<br />
quite write yet) could examine each of the six billion people
<br />
in the world and give a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; answer to whether this
<br />
is an instance of Jesse Mazur. Naturally in the case of duplicates
<br />
(running on computers or running on biological hardware doesn't
<br />
matter) it may be found that there is more than one Jesse running.
<br />
<br />It's *not* aesthetic whether, say, George Bush is you or not. He's
<br />
definitely not! He doesn't have your memories, for the first thing.
<br />
It's simply objectively true that some programs---or some clumps
<br />
of biological matter---are Jesse Mazur and others are not. (Even
<br />
though the boundary will not be exact, but fuzzy.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Second, suppose that someone loves you, and wants the best for you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The person who loves you...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If she finds out that although dead on Earth, you've been copied into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a body out near Pluto, (and have the same quality of life there), she's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; once again happy for you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's a pretty unhuman kind of &quot;love&quot; though--if a person I know dies, I'm 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sad because I'll never get to interact with them again,
</em><br />
<br />Then you don't know true love  :-)  (just kidding) because as
<br />
the great novelists have explained, truly loving someone involves
<br />
wanting what is best for *them*, not just that you'll get the
<br />
pleasure of their company. Hence the examples where one lover
<br />
dies to save the other.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously my sadness is not because the death of the copy here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means that there are only 10^10^29 - 1 copies of that person...
</em><br />
<br />By the way, this figure 10^10^29 is a *distance*. It is, according
<br />
to Tegmark, very approximately how close in terms of meters the
<br />
nearest exact copy of you who is reading this is.  (And it doesn't
<br />
matter whether one uses meters or lightyears.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well, lots of things can go better or worse for me without me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; being informed of the difference. Someone might perpetrate a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; scam on me, for example, that cheated me of some money I'd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; otherwise get, and it is still bad for me even if I don't know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, in that case there are distinct potential experiences you might have had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you now won't get to have. But in the case of a large number of copies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; running in lockstep, there are no distinct experiences the copies will have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that a single copy wouldn't have.
</em><br />
<br />I am speaking even of the case you bring up where the experiences
<br />
are *exactly* alike, although, as I say, for physical copies a
<br />
few atoms (or even many) doesn't matter much.
<br />
<br />This, then, is the big question: how may I appeal to your intuition
<br />
in such a way that you come to agree that benefit is strictly additive?
<br />
<br />Let me resort to another torture experiment. Suppose that I invite
<br />
you into my house, take you down to the torture chamber, and allow
<br />
you to look through a tiny peephole inside the entire steel-encased
<br />
chamber. You see some Nazis torturing a little girl, and her screams
<br />
are reproduced electronically so that you hear them.
<br />
<br />You are appalled. You beg me to dissolve the chamber and put an end
<br />
to the atrocity. But then I say the following peculiar thing to you:
<br />
&quot;Ah, but you see, this is an *exact* molecular---down to the QM
<br />
details---reenactment of an incident that happened in 1945. So you
<br />
see, since it's identical, it doesn't matter whether the little girl
<br />
suffers once or twice.&quot;
<br />
<br />Now contrive translated versions of that to programs, where a program
<br />
here is suffering exactly the same way that it's suffering on Mars.
<br />
Still feel that since one is taking place anyway, it doesn't matter
<br />
whether a second one is?
<br />
<br />The love of a mother who understood all the facts would not mislead
<br />
her into making the correct decision: all other things being equal,
<br />
(say that her daughter was to live happily in any case after 2007),
<br />
she would judge that it is better for her daughter to suffer only
<br />
one computation---here, say---than two, (say here and on Mars).
<br />
Each time that the girl's suffering is independently and causally
<br />
calculated is a terrible thing.
<br />
<br />It is this last sentence that well sums up the entire objective
<br />
viewpoint about these matters, and I hope you entirely understand
<br />
what it's saying.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The real problem here is that when we talk about what's &quot;better&quot; from a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first-person POV, we just mean what *I* would prefer to experience happening 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to me;
</em><br />
<br />Again, I think that the first-person point of view can lead to
<br />
errors just as incorrect as those of Ptolemaic astronomy.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but if you want to only think in terms of a universal objective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third-person POV, then you must define &quot;better&quot; in terms of some universal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective moral system, and there doesn't seem to be any &quot;objective&quot; way to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decide questions like whether multiple copies of the same happy A.I. are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better than single copies.
</em><br />
<br />You're right, and here's how I go about it. We must be able to decide
<br />
(or have an AI decide) whether or not an entity (person or program)
<br />
is being benefited by a particular execution. Now, there will be many
<br />
doubtful cases, perhaps, where it's hard to say. But then, there are
<br />
usually borderline cases in all important realistic questions.
<br />
<br />In ninety-nine percent of the cases, even we today with our primitive
<br />
science and paucity of knowledge (say, compared to the engines of
<br />
2080 A.D.) can determine with high probability whether someone is
<br />
gaining benefit from an experience or not. Several signature tests
<br />
help.  One is to simply ask the person. This is one of the very most
<br />
dependable, because only in a few pathological cases can an argument
<br />
be made that the person is wrong.
<br />
<br />Another great test is to consult other human beings who have the
<br />
welfare of the subject uppermost in mind. For example, the people
<br />
who deeply love an individual and want only the best for him are
<br />
almost always good guides. Of course, difficult cases can be found,
<br />
and we must concede that no set of indicators we have in 2005 can
<br />
judge 2005 people with total accuracy. The vastly wiser AIs of
<br />
centuries from now will be able to point out the cases where we
<br />
went wrong, but they'll judge that we were right ninety-nine percent
<br />
of the time. For example, they'll probably confirm that Terry Schaivo
<br />
was not alive while the courts debated her case, but, of course, I
<br />
could be wrong.
<br />
<br />But even though our instruments and methodologies today may still
<br />
be relatively poor, it's nonetheless in almost all cases objectively
<br />
true whether or not a person is receiving benefit from some experience.
<br />
And, to repeat, in almost all cases it suffices to consult the person's
<br />
own value system.
<br />
