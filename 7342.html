<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You answer like if by making things more precise, automatically the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, the nature of identity and cognition can be already described with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sufficient precision.
</em><br />
<br /><br />By making some assumptions. It is important to state them clearly so 
<br />
that we can derive clear testable consequences of it. I hope you don't 
<br />
take for granted Aristotle theory of cognition which is incompatible 
<br />
not only with empirical facts, but also with quite general and 
<br />
seemingly innocent theoretical assumption, like comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It's just empirically threads about personal identity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are fueled by sentiments similiar to now obsolete ones: those about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phlogiston,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vis vitalis and creationism. These, too, have gone round in circles for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decades and centuries, leading pretty much nowhere.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree with you. But I do think it is irrational to believe that the 
<br />
mind-body problem is already solved. In particular with comp: it is not 
<br />
solved.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Statements &quot;I believe that first-person introspective view is special&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree with you. It is no more special that the taste of my coffee in 
<br />
the morning. But this does not mean that the feeling of that taste does 
<br />
not exist, or that we have find an explanation how neurons are 
<br />
associated with that state. Many &quot;scientist&quot; are gifted overlooking 
<br />
detailed conceptual problems related to that issue.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and &quot;I'm convinced cognition is not a physical process described by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; known physical laws or require deep quantum magic&quot;,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Needless to say &quot;I'm convinced that ...&quot; is always unscientific. Even 
<br />
&quot;I am convinced by 1+1=2&quot;. This one could be a sincere communication to 
<br />
a friend, not a scientific assertion.
<br />
Now, what I have done, is a proof that if comp is true then notion like 
<br />
space, matter, energy, are secondary on the relation between numbers, 
<br />
and this in a verifiable way.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;continuity matters&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;location is part of system identity&quot;, &quot;atoms themselves, not their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spatiotemporal arrangement constitute identity&quot; are such sterile 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguments.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That was a list of (vague) &quot;hypotheses&quot; not of arguments.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ultimatively, they cannot be refuted by means other than a direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; demonstration, preferrably from a first-person perspective
</em><br />
<br /><br />Nobody in this list has ever do that. Some have pointed to that 
<br />
possibility. But that has always been a minority with no sequels. There 
<br />
are argumentations, and of course we go quicky up to the point we 
<br />
disagree so as to been able to progress. There is even two camps 
<br />
(mainly). Those who search some absolute measure and those who believes 
<br />
in the need and importance of a relative measure (to sum up very 
<br />
shortly).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (but even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then, some observers will still remain unconvinced, claiming the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zombie clause, or trying to get the experimenter persecuted for their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; murder).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Some use of zombie in reasoning are valid, some are not.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; starting to find the axioms. But: replace &quot;sufficiently complex 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; animals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and people&quot; by &quot;sufficiently complex machines&quot; or by &quot;sufficiently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rich
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theories&quot;,  and then computer science and logic illustrate and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; enlighten *already* the relevance of the question and the high
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; counter-intuitive character of the possible answers).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Absolutely. Apparently, too counter-intuitive for some people to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accept,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; despite based on solid seat-of-the-pants science and empirically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refuted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by daily routine in IT.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I'm not sure I understand? The counter-intuitive consequences of 
<br />
computer science have not been refuted by daily routine in IT. 
<br />
(Information Technologies?).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But I don't think it is useful nor necessary to go to the math before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; understanding the &quot;intuitive&quot; but precise problems, and thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experiments like those in this (sequences) of threads are very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; illuminating. Why do you think the question is irrelevant? What do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course they're illuminating. But have they convinced many? It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Well they should, or those not convinced should be asked to be kind 
<br />
enough to explain where in the argument they are not convinced, and in 
<br />
that case we always find that those people have not understand the 
<br />
hypothesis, or that we have been unclear .... But basically we tend to 
<br />
argue like in the proof of the irrationality of the square root of two. 
<br />
Now the problems are new (or it is new that we tackle them by the sc. 
<br />
method) and some people takes more time than other to figure out what 
<br />
we really talk about, but that is not a problem. Boltzman suicides 
<br />
himself in part due to the dogmatic opposition against the use of 
<br />
statistics in physics among physicist that time. Godel's theorem (like 
<br />
many solutions to Hilbert's problems) has been understood quasi at 
<br />
once, but they are exceptional in that setting.
<br />
New things are generally hard to grasp and that's normal. Especially 
<br />
when &quot;scientist&quot; are quasi programmed to estimate &quot;unscientific&quot; 
<br />
question bearing just ... in the field of their collegues!
