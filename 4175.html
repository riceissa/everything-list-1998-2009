<br />
hi all. I recently posted this to sci.physics.research.
<br />
its a intro to the &quot;qm2&quot; group &amp; also a neat link on an
<br />
outstanding web page-paper on decoherence by scott c. johnson
<br />
with animated simulations... one of the really nice products
<br />
from the group discussion so far (also see FAQ link below). 
<br />
SCJ may turn it into a published paper.
<br />
we've also been following the bogdanov commotion recently.

<br />
<br /><br />hi all. Im very pleased to have opportunity to do 
<br />
something a little sneaky, and promote a new paper by Scott C Johnson
<br />
behind his back (haha) along with a plug for a group some here
<br />
may enjoy.
<br />
<br />background: I founded/moderate the mailing list qm2 that seeks to reexamine
<br />
quantum mechanics foundations &amp; look into new theories, now around
<br />
over a year, about 130 members, and thousands of posts. 
<br />
and we're especially fond of &quot;overly speculative posts&quot; (haha). 
<br />
basically, totally unfiltered (although not totally unmoderated!!). 
<br />
<br />I certainly dont pretend the signal-to-noise ratio 
<br />
is greater than it is here in this
<br />
great newsgroup (sci.physics.research), but
<br />
I do promise we're a very fast-paced and almost-no-holds-barred group with
<br />
extremely intense, lively and animated dialog (hey, I admit
<br />
uncensored==raw at times!!).
<br />
<br />SCJ, Phd joined the list recently, within the last few months or
<br />
so, coinciding with a massive explosion of thousands of posts on the list, 
<br />
in which we achieved an amazing critical mass of cross pollination &amp; 
<br />
exchange of ideas among participants. (at least 3 Phds at this point.)
<br />
something unlike anything Ive ever seen in cyberspace (I 1st posted
<br />
to usenet in 1989..)
<br />
<br />SCJ is, imho, a brilliant up-and-coming physicist. he tells me
<br />
that he chose not to go into academia with regret due to the salary levels
<br />
making it hard to support a family. a big loss for the academic
<br />
establishment I would say!! he's working at intel currently in the quality 
<br />
control division, making sure those pentiums are up-to-snuff!!
<br />
<br />here is a recent outstanding
<br />
paper by him in the american journal of physics,
<br />
which Ive skimmed &amp; highly recommend. SCJ is interested in building up visual
<br />
models of QM, and education of newcomers to the field. 
<br />
TDG, Phd, his coauthor joined qm2 not long after SCJ 
<br />
discovered the group &amp; invited him. 
<br />
<br />Scott C Johnson and Thomas D Guttierrez, &quot;Visualising the phonon 
<br />
wave function&quot;, Am. J. Phys, 70(3) 227-237 (2002)
<br />
<br /><br />SCJ is interested in advancing &amp; keeping the flame alive
<br />
of his publication background so that someday he might return to 
<br />
academic research.
<br />
<br />below I include the msg to the group from october 11th
<br />
where SCJ announces his first &quot;qm2 web paper&quot; (blush). its an
<br />
outstanding and nice modelling of decoherence of two particles,
<br />
revealing the distinction of pure vs mixed states. a beautiful
<br />
tutorial &amp; device for increasing ones intuitive feel for the
<br />
concepts. fun animated diagrams!!
<br />
<br />this is SCJs homepage where you can read more about him &amp; his 
<br />
background
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.geocities.com/scjphysicist/">http://www.geocities.com/scjphysicist/</a>
<br />
<br /><br />we have another Phd member from brookhaven national 
<br />
laboratories whos published superconductor research in PRL and Nature.
<br />
he posts pseudonymously.  he's currently attending the 
<br />
CERN particle accelerator school in long beach, more info here: 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://cas.web.cern.ch/cas/">http://cas.web.cern.ch/cas/</a>
<br />
<br />another illustrious and highly engaged 
<br />
qm2 member has a remarkable background including 
<br />
coauthoring a paper with carl sagan in the mid 60s.
<br />
<br /><br />this is a list of many juicy links Ive collected on qm2 over the last year
<br />
that conveys a little of the flavor of our interests &amp; the group
<br />
directions, which I think any serious physicists will find something
<br />
very interesting.

Hi all,
<br />
<br />I'm back from my move and I'm trying to catch up on the wealth of QM2 
<br />
messages you all posted while I was gone.
<br />
<br />One topic that is particularly interesting to me is decoherence, or 
<br />
the superposition/mixed state discussion.  I have a visual way to try 
<br />
to understand that, and I've been meaning to solidify it for a 
<br />
while.  So, that's what I did tonight (in addition to reading lots of 
<br />
posts).  I present all of you with my first &quot;QM2 paper&quot;, which can be 
<br />
found here:
<br />
<br />&lt;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/scjphysicist/decoh.html">http://www.geocities.com/scjphysicist/decoh.html</a>&gt;
<br />
<br />This paper has no math and lots of ANIMATED pictures, so I'm hoping 
<br />
it's accessible and moderately enjoyable to everyone in this group.  
<br />
Whether you agree with my demonstration or not is another matter.  I 
<br />
welcome all your comments on both the substance and the form of my 
<br />
paper.
<br />
<br />- --Scott
