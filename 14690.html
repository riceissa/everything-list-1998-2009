At the very least, I could register and start wiki-ing -my- posts here
<br />
before they get anywhere near massive in number, right?  OR is it frozen?  I
<br />
think I'm confused on that point.
<br />
<br />I'd like to have a hyperlinked version of the explanation of Bruno's
<br />
argument against the CRH.  I think the &quot;physical universe&quot; -might- be (or
<br />
is) computable but I think the &quot;entire&quot; universe, at least in algebraic
<br />
physics, can -not possibly- be computable except perhaps by a computer of a
<br />
sort not known in mathematics to me as of yet.  Even with hyperlinks, it
<br />
would take me a while to digest Bruno's arguments and everyone's
<br />
counterarguments.  This should be something I should examine in the
<br />
&quot;algebraic physics&quot; theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Well, I've been working on my &quot;algebraic physics&quot; theory some more, not to
<br />
be confused with prior notions or other notions of algebraic physics.  I
<br />
really don't know what to call this multi-mathematical-disciplinary
<br />
approach...
<br />
<br />And I've been focusing on dimensions.  I see, from my point of view, that I
<br />
am creating the paradigm that I live in but the last thing I want to do is
<br />
trap anyone into someone else's paradigm.  I will try to type up what I have
<br />
so far about my set of dimensions which seems to have a vector space
<br />
structure with a natural operator I call the &quot;transition operator,&quot; to be
<br />
broadcast when I am done proving my dimension set is a vector space, if it
<br />
is.
<br />
<br />The set of dimensions is Q* in the theory of algebraic physics with only
<br />
some of these being &quot;special&quot; in the sense that they are relevant to
<br />
conjecture 1 of my paper, which is that the multiverse studied in physics is
<br />
isomorphic to the &quot;universe generated by Q*,&quot; with more precision in the
<br />
type-up posted in version 00-02-00 above.
<br />
<br />There are concrete dimensions, the positive integers, the transition
<br />
dimensions, which end up being more natural if they are the positive
<br />
integers greater than 1 (including 4 and higher for transition on the first
<br />
three dimensions--to be compatible with Einstein's paradigm), and other
<br />
classifications:
<br />
The microscopic dimensions are those positive infinitesimal elements of Q*
<br />
The macroscopic dimensions are those positive unlimited elements of Q*
<br />
The abstract dimensions are those not given in any other scheme, the
<br />
complement of the union of every other &quot;natural&quot; class of dimension, with
<br />
respect to Q* (the complement is with respect to Q*).
<br />
<br />Now if |D is the set of all subsets of Q*, this is the main carrier for my
<br />
thought-to-be vector space, the set of all concrete and abstract
<br />
dimensions.  (I prefer that nonmenclature to something like &quot;real and
<br />
imaginary.&quot;)
<br />
<br />The addition of two elements of |D, call them D_1 and D_2, is defined to be
<br />
the set of all sums of elements of D_1 and D_2.
<br />
<br />The set of scalars is Q* and note that Q* is a field.  Scalar multiplication
<br />
kD, where k is in Q* and D is in |D is defined thusly:
<br />
kD := D + k, by which, I mean { d+k : d is in D}.
<br />
<br />The zero element of the (proposed) vector space is {0} which is an element
<br />
of |D.  Denote this with a capital O.  (In my write-up, to be posted later,
<br />
this is blackboard capital O.)
<br />
<br />I hope V := &lt; |D, F, +, ., O &gt; is a vector space.  I am attempting to find
<br />
it's basis; I think it is simply {0,1}, which would make V a two-dimensional
<br />
vector space over F.  If that is the case, all the tools of finite
<br />
dimensional linear algebra would then be at my disposal for analyzing my set
<br />
of dimensions, with the concrete dimensions being of most interest to
<br />
physicists.
<br />
<br />Ah, so the transition operator is defined so that it maps |D to itself and
<br />
for all D in |D, ie for all subsets D of Q*,
<br />
T(D) := D + 1 := {d + 1 : d is in D}.  This is nothing more than translation
<br />
along the hyper-rational axis.
<br />
<br />In this event, and if D_c is the set of concrete dimensions and D_t is the
<br />
set of transition dimensions, then
<br />
T(D_c) = D_t, which is why I call T the transition operator.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />I am observing that I used the word event instead of definition.  But maybe
<br />
interesting blurt there if I can grasp what I meant by event.  Is defining
<br />
something an event in the theory of paradigm creation?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I would think so....
