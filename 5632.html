&nbsp;Greetings Bruno and Kory,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also, you said that your are not platonist. Could you tell me how you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the proposition that the number seventeen is prime. (I want just be sure I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your own philosophical hypothesis).
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A quick aside: It might be better not to even use the term &quot;platonist&quot; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these discussions, because it means at least two different things. It can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be used to refer to Plato's &quot;essentialism&quot; - the idea that there's a world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Forms in which exists (for instance) the Ideal Horse, and all physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; horses represent imperfect copies of this Horse. This is certainly a more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elaborate belief than &quot;mathematical realism&quot; (or &quot;arithmetical realism&quot;,
</em><br />
or
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;computational realism&quot;). One can be a mathematical realist without being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an essentialist. I am. So some people would call me a Platonist, and some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wouldn't, but that's just a disagreement about a definition. I prefer just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to use the term &quot;mathematical realism&quot; or &quot;essentialism&quot;, depending on
</em><br />
what
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm talking about.
</em><br />
<br />There would seem to be some difference of opinion on this view:
<br />
<br />&quot;Mathematical realism holds that mathematical entities exist independently
<br />
of the human mind. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather
<br />
discover it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would
<br />
presumably do the same. The term Platonism is used because such a view is
<br />
seen to parallel Plato's belief in a &quot;heaven of ideas&quot;, an unchanging
<br />
ultimate reality that the everday world can only imperfectly approximate.
<br />
Plato's view probably derives from Pythagoras, and his followers the
<br />
Pythagoreans, who believed that the world was, quite literally, built up by
<br />
the numbers. This idea may have even older origins that are unknown to us.&quot;
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.fact-index.com/p/ph/philosophy_of_mathematics.html">http://www.fact-index.com/p/ph/philosophy_of_mathematics.html</a>
<br />
<br />I'd have to agree that mathematical realism smacks of &quot;essentialism&quot; to me
<br />
as well. Thus my reservations regarding it.
<br />
<br />But my real point here is that, for myself, all &quot;isms&quot; including Platonism
<br />
are merely maps (models?) and the world the territory, to paraphrase
<br />
Korzybski. Mathematics is, I believe, one of those maps.
<br />
<br />Hard pressed for a label, I'd guess that I probably fit most well as a
<br />
non-Aristotelian if anything (but I'm not sure they'd have me). But in truth
<br />
I tend to be like bacterium where my &quot;world view&quot; is like it's genome: I
<br />
take a little here, a little there from various compatible isms and
<br />
assimilate the parts that seem to &quot;fit&quot; well, averaging across many maps to
<br />
better grok the territory. Ultimately though, I suppose my &quot;main man&quot; would
<br />
be Socrates, if I had to choose one (and apparently I just did). Plato would
<br />
have done well to assimilate more of his mentor's methodology, IMHO. He
<br />
might have been more competitive with the Ionians had he done so.
<br />
<br />On the science topic: Natural History magazine this month has an article on
<br />
the anthropic universe, the cosmological constant and cosmology. It cites
<br />
the multi-verse as one theory gaining popularity in &quot;explaining&quot; the
<br />
constant's otherwise apparently arbitrary value. The author quotes Tegmark
<br />
as well as some &quot;soft&quot; multi-versers and of course the skeptics who tend to
<br />
see a meta-verse solution as a cop-out and, in at least one view, akin to a
<br />
religious mythological tale. These last bemoan what they see as a premature
<br />
abandonment of rigourous physics methodology in pursuit of an instant TOE.
<br />
To this lot the rumors of the end of science are &quot;greatly exaggerated&quot;, I
<br />
would imagine.
<br />
<br />Look, all I &quot;know&quot; is that the world(s) apparently &quot;proceeds&quot; from state to
<br />
state and exihibits patterns of varying degrees of order and (psuedo/)
<br />
randomness. I suspect that this is likely the consequence of simple
<br />
underlying &quot;rules&quot; or a single rule. Thus the world contains information,
<br />
IMHO. That these patterns &quot;map&quot; reasonably (remarkably?) well to a &quot;meme&quot;
<br />
that we call mathematics and that first appeared at a recent juncture(s) of
<br />
that procession seems clear. Am I a mathematical realist? You tell me..
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
