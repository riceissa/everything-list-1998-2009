<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That the 'comp reality' is founded on the number realm, is almost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; trivial. What is not trivial at all, and this is what the UDA shows, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that, once you say &quot;yes&quot; to the digital doctor, for some level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; substitution, then your immateriality (somehow like the quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; superpositions) is contagious on your most probable neighborhoods. So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that physics has to be shown to emerge statistically from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;measure&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on the UD accessible relative states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This perhaps needs to be explained more slowly.  What - exactly - do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you mean by &quot;immateriality&quot;, and &quot;contagious on your most probable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neighbourhoods&quot;?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Nothing magical. For example the game of bridge is immaterial, despite 
<br />
you need some local matter to implement some particular bridge game. 
<br />
All abstract concepts are immaterial. You don't have the need to 
<br />
explain what bosons and fermions are to explain what is a number.
<br />
Like Stathis argued a lot, if you identify yourself with your 
<br />
history/personality there is a sense to be 50 years old, but if you 
<br />
identify yourself with your matter, you disappear a bit by eating and 
<br />
shitting (is this correct? polite?) and respiring, etc. and never 
<br />
really exist for more than seven years, etc... In the first case you 
<br />
admit somehow your immateriality despite contingent and local 
<br />
appearance of being composed in some substancial way.
<br />
What comp (by UDA+FILMED-GRAPH) shows, is that, once the digitalness of 
<br />
your local relative description is taken seriously, you can no more 
<br />
distinguish the comp stories existing below your comp substitution 
<br />
level. Eventually the laws of physics will be the law of what remains 
<br />
or emerges as observable in all computations. From inside this has to 
<br />
interfere statistically (by UDA).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, precisely what do you intend to be included in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - or excluded from - the notion of 'physics' in this context?  Is it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be equated with what is observable, and if so, how and by whom?
</em><br />
<br /><br />By lobian machine. By lobian machine, as they are emulated by a weaker 
<br />
machine (the universal dovetailer, alias the arithmetical Sigma1 
<br />
sentences).
<br />
How? I would say by self-measurement relatively to their most probable 
<br />
(or credible ...) comp histories. There is always an infinity of them.
<br />
<br />I said in Siena, and already in this list, that for Plato, what *you* 
<br />
see (observe, measure) is the border of what *you* don't see. In the 
<br />
universal machine context this can lead to a recursive but solvable 
<br />
equation where physical reality is a sort of border of the comp- 
<br />
indeterminacy or the comp intrinsical ignorance.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To be sure, it is needed,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; however, for the understanding that with comp, we *have to* derive the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physics from &quot;intensional numbers prevailing discourses&quot;. With comp,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; postulating a physical world cannot be used as an explanation relating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mind and appearance of matter (memory-stable observations).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is not that (aristotelian primary )substance does not exist, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that such primary substance is provably (with the comp hyp) void of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explanation power.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It strikes me, reading the above, that it might be a good idea to find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a way to limit ourselves -
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. (but hard!)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; at this deliberately elementary stage - to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an agreed set of terms with which to designate each of your key ideas,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for example with respect to physics deriving from &quot;intensional number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prevailing discourses&quot;.  Perhaps what we need is not so much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grandmother-version, but a kindergarten-level introduction to the key
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms and concepts, which we can then use slowly and clearly to build
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up the argument.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I have to explain enough notions so as to be able to explain Solovay 
<br />
theorem, which links precisely the modal logic G and G* with the 
<br />
discourse of the ideally correct lobian machines. &quot;Machine theology&quot; is 
<br />
really captured by the study of G*, G* \ G, and their intensional 
<br />
(modal) variants (but this is again an anticipation).
<br />
<br />Most key terms and concepts are from mathematical logic and computer 
<br />
science key terms and concepts, at least for the arithmetical part.
<br />
<br /><br />You can see my thesis either as a the showing that comp necessitates to 
<br />
generalize Everett embedding of the subject into the physical world. 
<br />
(Cf also Rossler endophysiocs). Indeed comp forces us to embed the 
<br />
arithmetician (or any memory machine) in numberland (something for 
<br />
which we will never have a complete unification).
<br />
<br />But you can also see the technical part of the thesis as a 
<br />
reconstruction of Lucas-Penrose godelian argument. This reconstruction 
<br />
has a long history which, paradoxically enough precedes both Lucas 
<br />
(1960) or Penrose (Much latter). The line is: Post, Benecerraf, Wang, 
<br />
Reinhardt, (myself), Webb, etc.
<br />
<br />In a nutshell, you cannot use Godel incompleteness to show that we are 
<br />
not machine (or that we are not lobian), but you can use Godel 
<br />
incompleteness to argue that IF we are sound lobian machine then we 
<br />
cannot know which machine we are, still less which computations support 
<br />
us. It gives the arithmetical origin of the first person comp 
<br />
indetermincacy, which you are supposed to have already intuitively 
<br />
swallow from the UDA, OK?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; At each stage, perhaps you could refer to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate points in the UDA, or other key papers, that could then be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consulted for comparison and further elucidation.  Would this work?
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. Don't hesitate to remind me.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The best book is without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; doubt the one by Cutland:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; CUTLAND N. J., 1980, Computability An introduction to recursive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; function theory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Cambridge University Press.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think this one is the best. But the subject is so beautiful that you 
<br />
can find other very nice book (I think of the classical bible of 
<br />
recursion theory, the book by Rogers, Tourlakis comes to my mind. 
<br />
Calude also did wrote a cute technical textbook, Saloma too, aargh 
<br />
there are too much good books! OK, keep on on Cutland and Franzen.
<br />
(A chef d'oeuvre which is hard to find is the preprint by Machtey and 
<br />
Young, Cutland acknowledge being inspired by it).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK. I will begin by saying two words on the language we will use when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; discussing with the machine. I can already explain the difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; between the layman (or grandmother) and the logician. This is not just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for you (I guess you know what I will say) but for those who just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; abandon logic for reason of notation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The main difference is that where a layman says &quot;Alfred is serious&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the logician says serious(Alfred).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Where the layman will say there is a ferocious dog, a logician will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that it exists something such that that something is a dog and is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ferocious. Because of laziness he will write Ex(dog(x) &amp; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ferocious(x)).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; For saying that all dogs are ferocious, he will say that for all dogs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (i.e. choose any thing that is a dog) that things will be ferocious:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and he will write Ax (dog(x) -&gt; ferocious(x)).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Of course, there is perhaps no effective test to see if a dog is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ferocious or not, perhaps the notion is not well defined, but we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to live with things like that: even in the pure realm of numbers we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will encounter some unexpected (I guess) complexity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks, this is useful.
</em><br />
<br /><br />So, where the layman says &quot;17 is prime&quot;, the logician writes 
<br />
&quot;prime(17)&quot;.
<br />
<br />But let me add two words on function. Actually you can see &quot;prime(17) 
<br />
as a function, defined on numbers and having {true, false}, or {t, f} 
<br />
as range: for example prime(17) = t, and prime(14) = f. OK?
<br />
<br />Where a layman says: the temperature in Toulouse is 34.5,  the logician 
<br />
says:   temperature(Toulouse) = 17. And, here, you can see 
<br />
&quot;temperature&quot; as a function from location (city) in the real numbers. A 
<br />
function is just such an association. The key idea is that a function 
<br />
will always have zero or one value. There is no sense to say that the 
<br />
temperature in toulouse is 34.5 and 23.7.
<br />
Childhood operation on numbers are usually function, even binary 
<br />
functions (functions with two arguments, inputs, ...). Where the layman 
<br />
will say: the sum of 3 and 4 gives 7, the logician will write: +(3,4) = 
<br />
7. They put the name of the function in front, and they put the 
<br />
arguments after. So an arbitrary function from n-tuple to number will 
<br />
be denote by f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n). Exactly like in the definition of 
<br />
an arbitrary derivative in calculus: the limit, if it exists, for h 
<br />
going near zero of the quotient f(x + h) - f(x) with h. OK?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; By the way, David, do you know what is called &quot;classical propositional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; calculus&quot;, the truth table method? Do you need some refreshing?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Some refreshing is in Smullyan's FU, but I can do it, or focus on some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; difficulty (classical propositional calculus is not so simple indeed,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; even if simpler than most other logics).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can always use wikipedia - which I've looked at - or other sources
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; online, but anything you would also be prepared to do here would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most helpful.
</em><br />
<br />OK. The road is the following:
<br />
<br />I propose to go, from the Cantor non-enumerability of the reals (or 
<br />
things equivalent) to Kleene non recursive enumerability of the 
<br />
recursive reals, by Church thesis. Comp, both in the UDA, and in the 
<br />
arithmetical UDA, is mainly Church thesis. I want to show you how 
<br />
strong and deep that thesis is. OK?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I don't think Church thesis can be grasped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conceptually without the understanding that the class of programmable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; functions is closed for the diagonalization procedure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please explain 'programmable functions' and 'closed for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diagonalisation procedure'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course, today, there is a simple way to say what is a programmable 
<br />
function: it is a function that you can program on a computer. But wait 
<br />
I explain Church thesis, for really making sense of this.
<br />
<br />I can explain to you what I mean by: a set is closed for this or that 
<br />
function/operation/procedure. A set is closed for some operation 
<br />
applicable to its elements when such application does not lead outside 
<br />
the set. Examples:
<br />
<br />the set of natural numbers N = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...} is closed for 
<br />
addition
<br />
the set of natural numbers N = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...} is NOT closed 
<br />
for subtraction
<br />
the set of natural numbers N = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...} is closed for 
<br />
multiplication
<br />
the set R of real numbers is closed for addition, multiplication, 
<br />
division, subtraction, but ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not closed for the square roots
<br />
the set of humans is closed for sexual reproduction
<br />
Etc ... OK?
<br />
<br />Now diagonalization will appear to be a sort of &quot;transcendental 
<br />
operation&quot;. Its main use is for going outside some set, and I would 
<br />
like to convey why the fact that the set  &quot;programmable functions&quot; is 
<br />
closed for diagonalization is truly a miracle! (to borrow Godel's 
<br />
expression). It is really that miracle which makes the set of 
<br />
programmable or computable function fitting so well the search for 
<br />
universal everything theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do everyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (interested) know how to prove the non enumerability of the subset of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; N
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; by diagonalization?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which subset do you mean?  I've encountered the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diagonalisation/enumerability argument, assuming it's the one I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; referred to above.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, ok, sorry. Instead of &quot;the non enumerability of the subset of N&quot;, 
<br />
read &quot;the non enumerability of the set of subsets of N&quot;.
<br />
Have you take a look on my old diagonalization post which I send to 
<br />
Lennart?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Let us go slow and deep so that everybody can understand, once and for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all.  OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Definitely OK.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Did this post helped? I want you to understand Church thesis, before 
<br />
the description of some formal language. This will economize work, and 
<br />
help you disentangle the rigorous from the formal. In our setting, 
<br />
&quot;formal&quot; will always mean &quot;output by a machine&quot;. Don't believe that 
<br />
formal = rigor. That would be equivalent to believe that all machines 
<br />
are correct (a nonsense).  OK?
