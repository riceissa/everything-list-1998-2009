Hi,
<br />
<br /><br />1) The computationalist hypothesis (comp),
<br />
<br />This is the hypothesis that &quot;I am a digital machine&quot; in the 
<br />
quasi-operational sense that I can survive through an artificial 
<br />
digital body/brain. I make it precise by adding Church thesis and some 
<br />
amount of Arithmetical Realism (without which those terms are 
<br />
ambiguous).
<br />
To be sure this is what Peter D. Jones called &quot;standard 
<br />
computationallism&quot;.
<br />
Let us call momentarily &quot;Pythagorean comp&quot; the thesis that there is 
<br />
only numbers and that all the rest emerge through numbers dream 
<br />
(including possible sharable dreams); where dreams will be, thanks to 
<br />
comp, captured by infinite collection of computations as seen from some 
<br />
first person perspective. Then ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />2) The Universal Dovetailer argumentation (UDA)
<br />
<br />... then the Universal Dovetailer Argumentation (UDA) is literally a 
<br />
proof that
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard computationalism   implies   Pythagorean computationalism.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From a strictly logical point of view this is not a proof that &quot;matter&quot; 
<br />
does not exist. Only that &quot;primitive matter&quot; is devoid of any 
<br />
explanatory purposes, both for the physical (quanta) and psychological 
<br />
(qualia) appearances (once comp is assumed of course).
<br />
The UDA needs only a passive understanding of Church Thesis (to make 
<br />
sense of the *universal* dovetailing).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />3) The lobian interview and the rise of the arithmetical &quot;plotinian&quot; 
<br />
hypostases, or n-person perspectives.
<br />
<br />The difference between the UDA and the lobian interview is that in the 
<br />
UDA, *you* are interviewed. *you* are asked to implicate yourself a 
<br />
little bit; but in the lobian interview, instead of interviewing 
<br />
humans, I directly interview a &quot;self-referentially correct&quot; and 
<br />
sufficiently &quot;rich&quot; universal machine (which I call lobian for short).
<br />
Computer science + mathematical logic makes such an enterprise 
<br />
possible. We can indeed study what a correct (by definition) machine is 
<br />
able to prove and guess about itself, in some third person way, and 
<br />
that's how the other notion of person will appear (cannot not appear).
<br />
<br />Let us abbreviate &quot;the machine asserts &quot;2+3=5&quot;&quot; by B(2+3=5). B is for 
<br />
Godel's Beweisbar notion of &quot;formally provable&quot;. If &quot;p&quot; denotes any 
<br />
proposition which we can translate in the machine's language, we write 
<br />
Bp for &quot;the machine asserts p&quot;.
<br />
For a classical mathematician, or an arithmetical platonist, there is 
<br />
no problem with *deciding* to limit the interview to correct machine 
<br />
(independently that we will see that no correct machine can know it is 
<br />
a correct machine). To say that the machine is correct amounts to say 
<br />
that whatever the machine asserts, it is true. So Bp -&gt; p, when 
<br />
instantiated, is always true.
<br />
But now, by the incompleteness phenomena, although Bp -&gt; p is always 
<br />
true, it happens that no correct machine can prove for any p that Bp -&gt; 
<br />
p. For some p, Bp -&gt; p is true, but not provable by the machine. The 
<br />
simplest case is when p is some constant falsity, noted f, like &quot;0 = 1&quot; 
<br />
for example, or like &quot;p &amp; ~p&quot;. In that case Bp -&gt; p is Bf -&gt; f, and 
<br />
this is equivalent (cf propositional truth table) to ~Bf, which is a 
<br />
self-consistency assertion not provable by the correct machine (by 
<br />
Godel's second incompleteness theorem). Due to this, &quot;Bp&quot; does not 
<br />
capture a notion of knoowledge, for which &quot;Bp-&gt;p&quot; should be not only 
<br />
true but known.
<br />
B does capture a notion of self-reference, but it is really a third 
<br />
person form of self-reference. It is the same as the one given by your 
<br />
contemplation of your own body or any correct third person description 
<br />
of yourself, like the encoding proposed by the doctor, in case he is 
<br />
lucky.
<br />
This means that &quot;Bp &amp; p&quot;, although equivalent with &quot;Bp&quot;, cannot be 
<br />
proved equivalent by the machine. This means that the logic of &quot;Bp &amp; p&quot; 
<br />
will be a different logic than the one of &quot;Bp &amp; p&quot;. Now Theaetetus has 
<br />
proposed to define &quot;knowledge&quot; by such a &quot;true justified opinion&quot;, and 
<br />
I propose to define the logic of machine (perfect) knowledge by Bp &amp; p.
<br />
This remains even more true for other &quot;epistemological nuances&quot; arising 
<br />
from incompleteness, like the future probabilty or credibility (not 
<br />
provability!) notions, which I will capture by Bp &amp; Dp and Bp &amp; Dp &amp; p, 
<br />
where Dp abbreviates, as usual (cf my older post) ~B~p (the non 
<br />
provability of the negation of p).
<br />
<br />Now, note this: I said &quot;Bp &amp; p&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Bp&quot;, but the machine 
<br />
cannot prove that equivalence. So the proposition &quot;(Bp &amp; p) &lt;-&gt; Bp&quot; is 
<br />
an example of true (on the machine) but unprovable (by the machine) 
<br />
proposition. So, concerning the correct machine we talk about, we must 
<br />
distinguish the provable propositions and the true but unprovable 
<br />
propositions. Thanks to Solovay, the logic of the provable proposition 
<br />
is captured by a modal logic often named G, and the logic of the true 
<br />
proposition is captured by a vaster logic named G*. The corona G* minus 
<br />
G gives a logic of the true but non provable statements.
<br />
<br />I think I have enough to give you a sketch of the hypostases. I will 
<br />
use Plotinian greek neoplatonist vocabulary, because it fits 
<br />
completely.
<br />
<br />I will associate to any machine, a complete &quot;theology&quot; in the sense of 
<br />
the greek (you can take it as a theory of everything). Going from one 
<br />
machine to another one does not change the logics related to the 
<br />
theology, although the precise sense of the &quot;B&quot; will vary. So you can 
<br />
think of &quot;B&quot; as an indexical notion. Please note that it is absolutely 
<br />
not obvious that such a B notion exist. That is the main lesson of 
<br />
Godel's 1931 work.
<br />
Basically a theology for a machine M is just the whole truth about 
<br />
machine M. This is not normative, nobody pretend knowing such truth.
<br />
<br />Plotinus' ONE, or &quot;GOD&quot;, or &quot;GOOD&quot; or its &quot;big unnameable&quot; ... is 
<br />
(arithmetical, analytical)  truth. A theorem by Tarski can justified 
<br />
what this notion is already not nameable by any correct (arithmetical 
<br />
or analytical) machine. Now such truth does not depend on the machine, 
<br />
still less from machine representation, and thus is a zero-person 
<br />
notion. From this I will qualify as &quot;divine&quot; anything related to truth, 
<br />
and as terrestrial, anything related to &quot;provable by the machine&quot;.
<br />
<br />The hypostases can then be divided into the divine one, and the 
<br />
terrestrial one. And like Plotinus, it suits well to divide them also 
<br />
into &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; one.
<br />
The three primary hypostases, in Plotinus, are the ONE (zero-person), 
<br />
the DIVINE INTELLECT (third person), and the ALL-SOUL (the &quot;pure&quot; first 
<br />
person). Here, the difference between truth and provability divides all 
<br />
the hypostases into their communicable or deducible parts and their non 
<br />
communicable parts), except for the soul (that is not obvious at all) 
<br />
which is invariant for the
<br />
proof-&gt;truth path, and &quot;truth&quot;, which although &quot;purely divine&quot; will 
<br />
have through comp some terrestrial &quot;consequences&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br />(And remember this is just a roadmap)

<br />
<br /><br />All this even without assuming comp!!! It works for a very much larger 
<br />
set of self-referentially correct entities (larger than the set of 
<br />
those which are turing emulable).
<br />
I must go now, and tomorrow I explain what happens exactly when comp is 
<br />
assumed.
<br />
Meanwhile you could try to guess where qualia and quanta appear.
<br />
(I will see too if this table survives the electronic voyage ...)
<br />
<br />Hope this will help,
<br />
<br />Bruno
