Hi Godfrey,
<br />
<br />Le 15-août-05, à 21:14, kurtleegod.domain.name.hidden a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The point I am trying to make is that a lot of your back and forth 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discourse on the 1st versus the 3rd person misses the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  2nd person in between them! More specifically: I am quite convinced 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that one good part of what we call &quot;the Mind&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  &quot;the Self&quot; and perhaps even &quot;Consciousness&quot; is generated by social 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interaction rather than by any &quot;inner realm of subjectivity&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I suspect this is true about all of what we call &quot;symbolic&quot; or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;meaningful&quot; including a lot of the support for mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  understanding though I guess I am a platonist to the extent that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think of mathematical objects as existing independently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of any of our semantics in a realm of their own.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Nice your platonism. Although it is not entirely relevant, I do not 
<br />
believe consciousness is generated by social interactions. I think 
<br />
consciousness has evolved with the ability of self-moving by the need 
<br />
to anticipate collisions (thus consciousness evolved from interaction 
<br />
but not necessarily social interaction (unless you call the invention 
<br />
of the &quot;cables&quot; by amoebas a social interaction). Self-consciousness is 
<br />
perhaps due to social interaction. I will give you a &quot;definition&quot; of 
<br />
consciousness below.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  As for consciousness I do agree with you that whatever explains it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may seriously require a revision of our oldest and,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  very possibly, some of our newest prejudices about reality but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly most of outr old prejudices about... consciousness-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yours (and mine) included! ;-)
</em><br />
<br />Consciousness can be defined by the first person high level description 
<br />
of the result of an unconscious (totally automated) *guess* that there 
<br />
is at least one observer-moment (world, state, etc.). More simply: 
<br />
consciousness is the belief in a world.
<br />
With such a definition it is possible to explain both
<br />
1) why consciousness has a role and which one: the role consists in 
<br />
giving us the ability of self-speeding up ourself relatively to our 
<br />
most probable (Turing) universal environment.
<br />
2) why consciousness is ineffable (not justifiable).
<br />
<br />But then it explains also how the physical laws are generated logically 
<br />
by the Lobian machine's dream (in that verifiable way described in my 
<br />
papers).
<br />
See also the work by Helmholtz on perception.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I would rather not bring Penrose to this discussion though he is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone I much appreciate and will not easily dismiss. Unfortunately I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can't claim I understand his Byzantine time-asymmetric proposals as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternatives for QM and GR enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to criticize them, and I am not alone in this.
</em><br />
<br /><br />In the &quot;emperor new clothes&quot; Penrose is wrong in its use of Godel's 
<br />
theorem. In &quot;the shadows of the mind&quot; Penrose made the necessary 
<br />
correction, but he puts it into parentheses and does not take it really 
<br />
into account. But I find Penrose very courageous to tackle the 
<br />
fundamental questions. Godel's incompleteness cannot be used to show 
<br />
that we are not machine, just that we cannot known which machine we are 
<br />
(and thus which computations support us). This is related to the 
<br />
mathematical form of the first person comp indeterminacy. The physical 
<br />
laws emerge from the border of machine's intrinsic ignorance; a measure 
<br />
on or of  incompleteness.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But I thought about your COMP and such over the weekend and I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realized I have to take back what I said above! I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  perfectly well imagine a world in which no one has yet built a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious machine from scratch but someone has found a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  procedure for replacing one's consciousness by a digital one in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way you describe. Why should one imply the other?
</em><br />
<br /><br />To make a conscious machine (if that can be tested!) from scratch does 
<br />
not logically imply we are machine (machine think does not entail that 
<br />
only machine think (no OCCAM in logic or math).
<br />
And to be able to copy a human machine (assuming comp) does not imply 
<br />
we can build a conscious machine from scratch).
<br />
None of the implications exist.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Oh, I am sorry, than! As you speak so much of acts-of-faith I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concluded, too soon I gather, that you took all those years of toil
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a consequence of your beliefs. Silly me!
</em><br />
<br />No problem. Some people would like to think I am a defenser of comp. 
<br />
But I am not. I am a defenser of the idea that we can do philosophy or 
<br />
theology still keeping the modesty of the scientific attitude. It needs 
<br />
just courage if only to acknowledge that we are just at the very 
<br />
beginning, and that until now many fundamental questions are just tabu.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Oh but you make it sound so easy! See: its is the &quot;derive physics &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from computer science&quot; that I have my first problem with!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  That is the object of the proof I gave. The proof is 100% third 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person accessible, like any proof. What is hard, perhaps, is that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proof is done in a field which is in the intersection of theoretical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics, theoretical computer science and theoretical cognitive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  And just how sure are you that there is such an intersection? Or is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that also an article of faith?
</em><br />
<br />Not at all. I know it can sound weird, but once you take seriously the 
<br />
comp hyp (and the existence of the first person subjectivity), then 
<br />
physics and cognitive science are reduced to computer science (itself 
<br />
reducible to number theory).
<br />
Logically you can still believe in a material world, but this one will 
<br />
have zero explanation power, even for explaining the appearance of 
<br />
matter. So with OCCAM ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If I thought Svozil and Chaitin were near at all I might understand 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you better. At least we agree that Wolfram is wrong!
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is a key point.  Perhaps you could read my presentation of the steep 
<br />
by step Universal Dovetailer Argument (the proof that comp entails the 
<br />
reversal between theoretical computer science and natural sciences) I 
<br />
have made online for Joel (a defender of Wolfram and cellular automata 
<br />
approach in physics). The links are: ... mmh the net is sleeping: see 
<br />
the link &quot;UDA step by step&quot; in my webpage.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Now don't worry, I believe more in the quantum than in comp! I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought, in the past, that I would quickly refute comp with quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanics. But the fact are there, comp, as far as it has been tested 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implies everything we can deduce from the quantum. Comp is not yet 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refuted, and evidences add up that the quantum is derivable from comp 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or from numbers through comp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Of course, I believe in the quantum, but if comp is correct, I can no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more believe in &quot;1)&quot;, i.e. I must abandon the existence of a physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world, and the quantum describes only the way machine dreams 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interference generate the stable illusion of solidity and time from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical truth (under the form of confirmable bets, the Lobian Bp 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &amp; Dp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Lots of &quot;ifs&quot; in there!
</em><br />
<br /><br />I count just one.  IF comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since you found me circular let me just ask you this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If the physical world does not exist (you say that COMP implies this) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why even bother deriving physics? Can't machines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  dream just like we do, about lovely, terrifying and yet unphysical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Alas, &quot;normal&quot; machines get trapped in deep interfering computations 
<br />
making their most probable histories looking completely physical. 
<br />
Actually it is the the vanishing of a primitive substancial universe 
<br />
which forces us to retrieve the appearances of the physical laws (in a 
<br />
verifiable way).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Maybe there is a typo in what you say above because if that argument 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually says that &quot;any machine betting correctly and consistently on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any piece of &quot;observable&quot; reality, will bet that to simulate that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; piece of reality exactly, there is a need of simulating an infinity of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations&quot; than I would not take it to Vegas (;-) ! This is because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can in fact, not just bet but,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  predict, with certainty, and simulate with arbitrary precision, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behavior of a good number &quot;pieces of observed reality&quot; by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  themselves and even verify the certainty of those predictions with a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finite collection of finite algorithms which is what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  do call physics (classical or quantum, theoretical or empirical) ). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What we cannot do is to reproduce by any finite set of algorithms 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worth betting on the type of persistent built-in correlations that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pairs (and trios, etc..) of these pieces of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  observable reality manifestly carry between them once they have been, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once, part of the same piece! Even coins
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  don't toss that way! That is where the &quot;kabosh&quot; is! There is no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dovetailing out of it...
</em><br />
<br /><br />Remember that quantum computer does not violate Church thesis, and that 
<br />
complete indeterminacy can be simulated by iterated self-duplications. 
<br />
Again, see the Universal Dovetailer Argument.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Also if Newtonian physics is enough to shoot down your hypothesis 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than it must be dead already since Newtonian physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  is the correspondence limit of QM and QM is right!!! I really don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follow you here...
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not really, as far as you agree that classical physics can be extracted 
<br />
from quantum physics. My favorite unrigorous way: Feynman integral (see 
<br />
my paper:
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/CC&amp;Q.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/CC&amp;Q.pdf</a>
<br />
for a little summary.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Well, again, I would much like to know what these &quot;solid foundations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the quantum&quot; are but am happy in my believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  that particular(?) physical laws are *already* real general laws and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed apply to all possible observers even without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  your help or George Levy's opposition!!!
</em><br />
<br />The advantage of deriving physics from comp is that it gives at once 
<br />
the (comp)-correct physical laws. They are solid because they rely only 
<br />
on number-theoretical relations. Physicists have not that chance, they 
<br />
can hope having find the last theory, and as Lee says, it is only 
<br />
conjectural. If you derive Schroedinger Equation from Machines' 
<br />
introspection, well, if you believe in comp you don't need to even look 
<br />
at nature. You need to look at nature only to test comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I stop believing in gravity can I fly? (:-)
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is probably more correct to say that if you begin believing in 
<br />
gravity that you might fly.
<br />
(Sorry for looking as if you were serious :-)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  My fault I am sorry, I should have written &quot;interaction&quot; instead of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causation. I fully agree with you about the latter.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. Now &quot;interaction&quot; is the most difficult part to correctly get from 
<br />
comp. Here quantum physics has made impressive progresses. Logicians 
<br />
have themselves made progress, mainly through the rather interesting 
<br />
&quot;geometry of interaction&quot; by J. Y. Girard. We can come back on this 
<br />
later.
<br />
<br />[...]
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Now, I could prove that all of them are tractable in the sense that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less than a CETI project could solve them (like you can simulate a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;few-bits&gt;-quantum computer with enough classical bits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  You lost me here. Are they tractable or not? I wasn't aware that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CETI project can solve intractable problems !!!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Come on. &quot;intractable&quot; problems can be tractable by brute force when 
<br />
the number of arguments is not too big. Think about the truth-table 
<br />
method for deciding tautologies. 2^n does not grow so quickly. Now the 
<br />
quantum tautologies are not so big. The problem is that I am not 
<br />
finding, nor really searching, a good cheap and not too heavy Lisp 
<br />
Interpreter. I have also find ways to simplify some of them. We will 
<br />
see. It is true that O prefer to concentrate myself on the enunciation 
<br />
of the problem than on its solutions ...
<br />
It is perhaps time I begin to (re)-awake my programs for G, G* ...
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/G.html">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/G.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Seriously for a second: I doubt that I know enough to understand all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your demonstrations and arguments or judge their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  correctness in detail, and I am no Dr. Phil, but I have the distinct 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impression that you are too enamoured with your COMP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hyp to let it go. Is this possible?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not enamoured with comp. I am just overblashed (if that is the 
<br />
term) by the infinitely fascinating consequences of comp.
<br />
You could say I am a little bit enamoured with the Lobian Machine, 
<br />
though. She is a very sensible person. If you ask her just if she is 
<br />
conscious, or if she beliefs in one (at least) observer-moment (see 
<br />
above my definition of consciousness), then she crash!
<br />
Actually she crash in front of most interesting questions!
<br />
Thanks to Solovay's logics G and G* you can now resume infinite 
<br />
conversations with her without crashing, and even figure out why she is 
<br />
so sensible, and why she seems to be forever unsatisfied and so 
<br />
demanding in space time information and memory, and so error prone, if 
<br />
not lying (or joking!) in front of fears  and/or contrarieties.
<br />
You can read &quot;Forever Undecided&quot; by Raymond Smullyan for a gentle 
<br />
introduction to the theorems of Godel, Lob and Solovay, and to the 
<br />
modal logic G.
