original message (below) in any way illustrated &quot;how ridiculous&quot; the 
<br />
concept of heaven is.  It may suggest that it is inconceivable that we 
<br />
could live for eternity leading anything like the life we know now, but 
<br />
his points aren't in the slightest pursuasive to me.  I think the 
<br />
problem is a lack of imagination.  Why would I have to choose to spend 
<br />
the afterlife with a certain spouse.  I would assume the ties that bind 
<br />
us together here probably wouldn't apply.  Why would I need to choose a 
<br />
body to be in that matched something from this earlier stage? 
<br />
<br />I'll readily concede all of this is pure speculation, and so I'll just 
<br />
stop here and say that I think assumptions that an afterlife would be 
<br />
ridiculous is as much speculation as assumptions in a specific afterlife 
<br />
experience.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; - and no, I don't think heaven, hell, etc., are even remotely likely.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that when I'm dead, I'm dead, never again to be congnizant. 
</em><br />
<br />Now this statement is fraught with all kinds of issues and problems for 
<br />
me.  Clearly you do not accept the QTI.  No problem there.  I've never 
<br />
really sold myself on that either.  But if it is true that our focus for 
<br />
understanding should be on the first person, is there any meaning in 
<br />
saying you are dead &quot;never again&quot; to be aware?  Isn't it just crazy 
<br />
speculation on your part that anything is continuing?  And even if we 
<br />
accept there is some &quot;reality&quot; or &quot;truth&quot; to the world &quot;out there&quot;- the 
<br />
objective appearing environment that we seem to interact in- are you 
<br />
saying we are to assume that it will continue for ever and ever, but 
<br />
never replicate your experiences that you had in your life?  Or perhaps 
<br />
we should assume that it should end at some point, and that there will 
<br />
never be another multiverse.  Was all of this a one time deal?  If so, 
<br />
how do you explain such a &quot;miracle&quot; without invoking some intelligence.  
<br />
How can something (big bang) happen only once in all of existence and be 
<br />
a natural phenomenon? 
<br />
<br />It seems to me that at least from a perspective, the &quot;block multiverse&quot; 
<br />
view makes sense.  It must exist eternally- I just can't wrap my mind 
<br />
around a &quot;pre-existence&quot; era or a &quot;post existence&quot; era.  A careful 
<br />
examination of time does seem to suggest that, as D. Deutsch says, 
<br />
&quot;different times are just special cases of different universes,&quot; each 
<br />
existing eternally from at least some perspective.
<br />
<br />I'm not so sure that there are yes/no answers to many of the questions 
<br />
that we ask.  Even a question such as &quot;is there a god&quot; may  have an 
<br />
answer that depends on your location in time or in the multiverse.  If 
<br />
it is ever possible in the future to replicate my experiences on a 
<br />
computer through artificial intelligence, and the AI me asks the 
<br />
question, then obviously the answer should be yes.  But perhaps there 
<br />
really was a natural, fundamental reality in which the original me 
<br />
existed in which the answer would be no.  Or take a Tipler-like theory 
<br />
that has the universe evolving to the point that it can replicate or 
<br />
emulate itself.  The question &quot;is there a god&quot; at the point that a 
<br />
universal computer exists would be yes, while the question at some prior 
<br />
point would be at best &quot;unknown.&quot; 
<br />
<br />I do not want to toss out there there is fundamental truth, fundamental 
<br />
reality of some nature, but any questions going to the underlying nature 
<br />
of existence seems to not easily lend itself to yes/no answers.  Is 
<br />
there a fundamental &quot;realness&quot; to the physical world, or is this all a 
<br />
&quot;machine dream.&quot;?  Why isn't it both, depending on where you are at?  
<br />
Now some would accuse of speculation here, but on close inspection it 
<br />
seems I'm only choosing one form of speculation over another.  Does this 
<br />
mean science is pointless?  Absolutely not.  Science opens great doors 
<br />
of understanding in, for instance, describing how a description of the 
<br />
multiverse fits observable data.     However, I am simply choosing not 
<br />
to close doors in the absence of proof against.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The thing I'm agnostic about (defining &quot;agnostic&quot; as &quot;without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge&quot;) is whether an infinitely powerful God is reponsible for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe we see.   And if this God exists, why?  And where did IT 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; come from?
</em><br />
<br />Despite arguments I have made previously, I would say I most closely fit 
<br />
the agnostic description for God as well.  I certainly do not believe in 
<br />
a God separate and apart from our existence that &quot;created&quot; the 
<br />
universe.  Any answer for me will be some form of a self explanatory, or 
<br />
bootstrapping concept in which God and all of existence are really one 
<br />
in the same.  I must admit I am partial to a Tipler like theory in which 
<br />
the universe evolves to the point that it can create itself.  Then again 
<br />
you are left without a yes-no answer.  Does it even make sense to ask 
<br />
whether the universe evolved until it was able to create its creator, or 
<br />
whether God existed first?  Its a chicken and egg argument that doesn't 
<br />
have a correct answer IMO.
<br />
<br />You ask &quot;why&quot; God would exist.  Equating God with purposeful action, or 
<br />
intentional action, you question in a sense is asking why we should 
<br />
consider intelligence to play a role in the shaping of our reality.  
<br />
Again, I think Deutsch described very well in FOR why we have to 
<br />
consider intelligence as a fundamental force in the universe.  He 
<br />
pointed out that over the last several billion years, the determination 
<br />
of the color and brightness of the Sun could be made solely on the 
<br />
consideration of physical laws.  However, if one were to consider such 
<br />
questions for the future of the Sun, one had to factor in the potential 
<br />
role that intelligence may play in such a question.  The role of 
<br />
intelligence in understanding, shaping, and even replicating 
<br />
environments, both in the &quot;real&quot; world and in virtual environments must 
<br />
be admitted to seem fundamental to an understanding of our reality.  In 
<br />
this sense I am considering &quot;God&quot; broadly as all of the knowledge, 
<br />
intelligence, and experience that will exist across the multiverse.  My 
<br />
take on the &quot;where did it come from I have already answered.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you have an answer to &quot;Why does anything exist?&quot; I'd be glad to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hear it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With respect to the personal gods that much of humanity prays to and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has faith in, I think they're the result of human nature, fables, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fiction, and the machinations of priests.  The fact that so many have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;faith&quot; that these gods exist is dire testimony about a flaw 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in humanity that embraces the irrational.
</em><br />
<br />I agree with you that belief in orthodox religion based on statements 
<br />
made by a handful of people 2,000 years ago, or whatever else, is 
<br />
irrational.  However, I do not see a general belief in God as 
<br />
irrational.  Lets assume science were to somehow prove the MWI was 
<br />
correct.  And subsequently, we create artificial intelligence that 
<br />
passes the Turing test, or whatever tests would satisfy reasonable 
<br />
scientists.  Finally, lets say science eventually proved that it were 
<br />
indeed correct that in some universes that would allow for the 
<br />
development of intelligent life, these universes would be designed in 
<br />
such a way that it was possible to create a computational device with 
<br />
infinite processing power. 
<br />
<br />None of these things are proven yet, by any means, but very reasonable 
<br />
scientists have made arguments on behalf of each of these theories.  If 
<br />
the MWI is the correct interpretation and the other two things are 
<br />
physically possible, how do we avoid something essentially equivalent to 
<br />
God?  Its not speculation to say that a universal computer would be 
<br />
created that would develop artificial intelligence that would then be 
<br />
processed through an infinite number of experiences (thus equating our 
<br />
&quot;multiverse&quot;), because in the MWI if its physically possible- it happens. 
<br />
<br />This is where I have stumbled back into a bias in favor of God.  I do 
<br />
believe in the MWI, I do believe it will become possible to create 
<br />
artificial intelligence, and I think that given  just these two things 
<br />
it is hard to avoid the role of intelligence in explaining experience .  
<br />
Even if one universe never develops a universal computer- an infinite 
<br />
number of universes capable of creating artificial intelligence would 
<br />
lead to an infinite number of emulated first person experiences.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My personal observation that is in the same way lay persons are drawn 
<br />
toward God as a comfort, scientists seem to avoid God like the plague 
<br />
for fear that it is irrational, or does not fit the conceptions they 
<br />
should have as scientists.  Now, I don't mean to paint with too broad a 
<br />
brush here because I am aware that many scientists believe in a God, but 
<br />
in general the belief is much weaker than as shown in the general 
<br />
population.  It just seems to me that science is moving closer and 
<br />
closer to a TOE that includes a role for intelligence in the 
<br />
explanation, in one form or another, and this intelligence in whatever 
<br />
capacity is what would generally be considered God.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even though I don't think that personal gods exist, there are benefits
