Hi Abram, Him Kim,
<br />
<br />Kim, while answering Abram, I realised I was doing the KIM 2.3, you  
<br />
can read it before KIM 2.2 without problem I think, in any case tell  
<br />
me if you have follow the argument. I don't answer the questions, so  
<br />
you or Abram, or anyone else can answer.
<br />
<br />Abram, The answer to your post is really the step 3 of the UDA  
<br />
reasoning. It is the justification of the first person indeterminacy,  
<br />
and the definition of (relatively) normal machine.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From what assumptions could a probability ultimately be derived?
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;From the assumption that when I do an experience or an experiment, I  
<br />
will observe a result.
<br />
<br />And from the hope I will be able to interpret that result in my or our  
<br />
favorite current theory from which I can *deduce* the probability laws.
<br />
<br />This is akin to a self-consistency assumption.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems that a coherent theory of the probability of future events is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needed (otherwise the passing of time could be white noise), but I do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not see where such probabilities could come out of more basic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptions.
</em><br />
<br />UDA is a non constructive proof that in the MEC theory, we have to  
<br />
derive the probabilities from the discourse of the &quot;normal machine&quot;,  
<br />
which I will define below (anticipating on the KIM 2 thread).
<br />
<br />AUDA is a path toward a constructive derivation of the probability  
<br />
laws. The basic idea is simple: let us ask the question directly to  
<br />
the universal machine.
<br />
<br />In QM, without collapse, Everett (+ Gleason theorem)  has convinced me  
<br />
that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. There is no probabilities in the theory.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Quantum and classical probabilities are justified in the &quot;normal&quot;  
<br />
self-observing machines by the SWE only.
<br />
<br /><br />But there is a &quot;hic&quot;. A &quot;little&quot; problem.
<br />
<br />That derivation assumes MEC (or weakenings). And MEC forces the  
<br />
probabilities to be derived from all type of computations, no way to  
<br />
chose a particular universal machine at the start, any must do. This  
<br />
is really what UDA shows. The good news is that such an extraction can  
<br />
then justify both the quanta and the qualia. Quanta are (should be  
<br />
here) particular case of (sharable) qualia.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To reason about the future, we assume that we are in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; randomly chosen computation--
</em><br />
<br /><br />Right now I don't feel like being on a randomly chosen computation.  
<br />
&quot;I&quot;  &quot;belong(s)&quot; on all computations which have reached my actual  
<br />
state(s) (singular for the 1-state, and plural for the 3-states, or  
<br />
the 1-plural states, see below).
<br />
My next state will be chosen partially randomly among many consistent  
<br />
continuations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but then we are already using some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability distribution.
</em><br />
<br /><br />At some level it is the Gaussian distribution. See the definition of  
<br />
the &quot;normal machine&quot; below.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Evolution is at the root of our ability to predict probabilistically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We use one probability distribution over another because it helps us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; survive. However, this is not good enough of an answer in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse: every possible form survives anyway.
</em><br />
<br />Once you bet on everything you have to accept also, among many  
<br />
realities, those who does not &quot;survive&quot;, the cul-de-sac.
<br />
At the level of reasoning in comp this is equivalent with a &quot;self- 
<br />
consistency&quot; assumption, which is implicit in teleportation experiment.
<br />
The multiverse idea is not so different from the Darwinian idea of  
<br />
&quot;all the species&quot;, of course restricted to the relatively consistent  
<br />
one.
<br />
Relatively to what? Relatively to their most probable histories/ 
<br />
computation.
<br />
<br />Below, to define the notion of &quot;normal machine&quot;, I will construct a  
<br />
case where in a sense &quot;every possible form survives&quot;. despite this  
<br />
fact, the probabilities will emerge clearly once we distinguish the  
<br />
third person discourses from the first person discourses.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To keep talking about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolution, we would need to talk about which forms are more common in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the multiverse. But to count how common forms are, we would need some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure over the multiverse, which could give us a probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distribution in the first place. So every possible argument seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circular.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think so. See below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, I don't need all the details of your derivation of a probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (though I'm interested); but what assumptions can you get a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability distribution from?
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;From the assumption of mechanism. Digital mechanism. The assumption  
<br />
that you survive with a relative probability 1 in case of scanning,  
<br />
annihilation and reconstitution done at some level.
<br />
<br />Then you are duplicable. I can &quot;cut&quot; you and &quot;paste&quot; you in two  
<br />
identical rooms, except that I have put a &quot;one&quot; in a closed box in one  
<br />
room, and I have put a &quot;zero&quot; in a similar and similarly disposed box,  
<br />
in the other room. Ah! To help for some probable cutting the air  
<br />
argument, I put a cup of delicious coffee near the boxes in the two  
<br />
rooms. All right?
<br />
<br />(If you don't mind I will of course assume you really want a cup of  
<br />
coffee, at the moment of the experience).
<br />
<br />Now the third person discourses is the content of a diary (or the  
<br />
memory) of an observer which, typically does not enter the  
<br />
teleportation boxes. The first person discourse(s) is (are) any  
<br />
content of the diary (diaries) of those who does enter the  
<br />
teleportation boxes, and get out of reconstitution boxes. Note that  
<br />
first and third person can develop discourses about third and first  
<br />
person discourses.
<br />
<br />Here is the protocol of the experiment, which is told to you in  
<br />
advance. You will be scanned, annihilated and reconstituted  
<br />
simultaneously in the two rooms. And I am asking you now some question:
<br />
<br />Assuming MEC (that is &quot;probability 1&quot; in case of simple teleportation).
<br />
<br />What is the probability that you will survive this duplication  
<br />
experiment/experience(s) ?
<br />
What is the probability that you will drink a cup of coffee in that  
<br />
experiment/experience(s) ?
<br />
What is the probability that you will drink a cup of coffee and think  
<br />
&quot;OK I have survived, that coffee is good, I don't know what number  
<br />
belongs to that box, obviously it cannot be both one and zero!&quot;
<br />
What is the probability that you will write in your diary &quot;1) I have  
<br />
survived, 2) the coffee is good, 3) the number in the box is zero.
<br />
<br />I don't want to give a definition of what is a normal machine, just  
<br />
that you feel the point.
<br />
<br />Let me give you another illustration which exploits the freedom of  
<br />
thought a bit more. Indeed, let me duplicate you, or better,  
<br />
polyplicate you into 2^(16180*10000)*(60*90)*24.
<br />
<br />I explain. I multiply you by 2^(16180*10000) in front of a  
<br />
(16180*10000) pixels screen, with each possible images (black and  
<br />
white) on it.
<br />
And I reiterate every 1/24 of a second that multiplication, and this  
<br />
during 90 minutes, that is 90*60 seconds.
<br />
<br />What do you predict you will feel, as personal, subjective, first  
<br />
person experience. What do you think is more probable, among:
<br />
<br />I will feel seeing a white screen
<br />
I will feel seeing a black screen
<br />
I will feel seeing a movie
<br />
I will feel seeing a good movie
<br />
I will feel seeing &quot;2001 Space Odyssey&quot;
<br />
I will feel seeing &quot;2001 Space Odyssey&quot; with the subtitle of Caligula
<br />
I will feel seeing a random-noise-movie (what you see on TV when there  
<br />
is no emission).
<br />
<br />Of course there is a sense to say: I will see all possible movies, but  
<br />
this means you are talking about yourself at the third person point of  
<br />
view, and here what is asked, is what do you expect to experience or  
<br />
live in your future if you are invited to practice it. By MEC, you  
<br />
survive, and any of your first person experience is unique, on which  
<br />
of the above you would bet? What bet will you do if I tell you that I  
<br />
will accompany you in the multiplication. And send you to hell if your  
<br />
bet is wrong. What bet you will do if you want to optimize the chance  
<br />
of not going to hell?
<br />
<br />The rest of the UDA reasoning shows that &quot;this&quot; thought experience  
<br />
happens all the time in arithmetic, but the &quot;probabilities&quot;, which  
<br />
eventually could be credibilities or other uncertainty measure, are  
<br />
constrained by computer science/number theory. It extends the notion  
<br />
of normality from the protocol above to the whole Universal Deployment  
<br />
(which I will (re)define in KIM 3).
<br />
<br />Exercise: define the notion of &quot;normal first person experience&quot; for  
<br />
machine in the protocol above. With the UD protocol, things are so  
<br />
much complex that I will interview the Universal Machine directly to  
<br />
provide hints ...
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
