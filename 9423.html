I agree with the comments made by Jesse Mazer and Saibal Mitra, and
<br />
would go further to suggest that there *necessarily* exists a continuous
<br />
series of intermediates between any two minds, if you allow that
<br />
essentially a mind is a mathematical structure - an algorithm or a
<br />
computer program. You are not then restricted to constructing only those
<br />
minds which could in theory be implemented on a human brain, or by
<br />
making sequential changes in one person's brain to arrive at another
<br />
person's brain. Using your PC/ Mac example, this would be like saying
<br />
that although it might not be possible to convert one into the other by
<br />
means of wirecutters and soldering iron, there are a large number of
<br />
possible operating systems between OS X and Windows XP, all running on a
<br />
general purpose computer, which would provide the required gradual
<br />
transition.
<br />
<br />Having said that, I still think it misses the point. The fact that
<br />
Parfit's thought experiments sometimes seem to have a degree of
<br />
scientific plausibility is just a bonus that makes his writing more
<br />
entertaining. Parfit's ideas on personal identity are squarely in the
<br />
tradition of John Locke, who wrote about transfer of &quot;consciousness&quot;
<br />
from one person to another, suggesting that it is this consciousness
<br />
(which importantly includes the donor's memories) which determines
<br />
identity rather than the physical body in which it happens to reside.
<br />
Clearly, this kind of mind transfer was a completely ridiculous notion
<br />
in the 17th century, and probably still is. But technical feasibility
<br />
(or indeed physical possibility) was not part of Locke's argument, nor
<br />
was it used as ammunition against him by his philosophical opponents.
<br />
His argument was that IF it were possible to transfer memory etc. from
<br />
one person to another, THEN the recipient would feel himself to be the
<br />
donor, even though he would notice that he had a completely different
<br />
body. Opponents of this view argue that it is NOT the case that transfer
<br />
of memories etc. from one body to another - WERE it possible - would
<br />
result in transfer of personal identity (see R. &amp; P. chap 10.82 for
<br />
Bernard Williams' thought experiment, for example).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We need to be a bit more precise than &quot;magically&quot;. In Parfit's book he

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talks about swapping out my neurons for the equivalent neurons in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Napoleon's brain. Sure this is not exactly technically feasible at

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present, but for thought experiment purposes it is adequate, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suffices for doing the teleporting experiment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The trouble I have is that Napoleon's brain will be wired completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differently to my own. Substituting enough of his neurons and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connections will eventually just disrupt the functioning of my brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps there is some other way of passing through functioning brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states, but not in the way Parfit describes it. Perhaps there is a way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going through a sequence of brains states to when I was an embryo,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then reversing the process via developing Napoleon's brain. But would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each stage be conscious? It is still debatable whether children under
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the age of 12 months are conscious (eg in the sense of being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-aware), let alone the mind of a foetus.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All I can say is that things are definitely more subtle than Parfit

was
