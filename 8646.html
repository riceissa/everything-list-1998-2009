<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for giving me your feeling. I obviously agree with you that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atheism is a religion. Actually I see this as a reason to keep the word 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;theology&quot; , although I remain open to the possibility of changing my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind on this issue. I have (G*) reason to consider that just the belief 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in one Observer-Moment, or World, State, Situation, etc. is already 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theological, like the hope in our own sanity or consistency. Physics is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already theological too; in particular most physicists endow implicitly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Aristotle &quot;solution&quot; of the mind-body problem, which is in part a sort 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of bullet making impossible to really progress there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />You seem to be confusing a study of metaphysical beliefs with a study
<br />
of a subset of metaphysical beliefs called the belief in one or more
<br />
Gods (which is what theology means to most people). I would not use
<br />
the word theology to describe the study of physics' foundational
<br />
beliefs - not sure what word I would use actually, it probably an
<br />
indication that very few people think about it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, I think &quot;God&quot; is just a chapter in theology, 
</em><br />
<br />again this seems to be using theology in a more expansive meaning than
<br />
it usually is. Theology to me is the study of belief in God, although
<br />
I note that the Oxford concise dictionary defines it thusly:
<br />
<br />&quot;a study of or system of religion; rational analysis of a religious
<br />
faith&quot;
<br />
<br />Using this definition, the study of Kosher practices would be
<br />
considered theology, which doesn't seem right to me. It should come
<br />
under the label of cultural studies, or comparative religion perhaps.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I don't even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; address that chapter neither in &quot;Conscience et Mecanisme&quot;, where I do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introduce the term theology, nor in &quot;Calculabilit? Physique et 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cognition&quot;, where I have been asked to use &quot;machine psychology&quot; instead 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of &quot;theology&quot;, and then I am  beginning to think it is a sort of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;logical&quot; error. Like I said to George, either I try to be as clear as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible, but then it looks provocative; or I try to manage the ten 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thousands human susceptibilities, but then the message will take more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that one millenium to be conveyed :(
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah la la..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One of my current motivation for using the label &quot;theology&quot; is the fact 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that my work can be framed into the Pythagorean, Platonist and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; NeoPlatonist tradition.
</em><br />
<br />Indeed, however most people would not regard Pythagoranism, Platonism
<br />
et al as a topic of theology. If you insist on using the term, you
<br />
will be condemned to defining the word theology so as to include
<br />
Pythagoranism etc as part of its domain of study in every paper your write.
<br />
<br />Psychology, on the other hand seems unproblematical, as psychology
<br />
normally covers belief as part of its remit. About the only real
<br />
problem I see with it is those who think machine psychology is an
<br />
oxymoron (contradiction of terms). But those same people would think
<br />
computationalism is incoherent as well...
<br />
<br />On a related point, which I meant to comment on earlier, but ran out
<br />
of time. In French and German, there is no distinction between the
<br />
words &quot;mind&quot;, &quot;soul&quot;, &quot;ghost&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot;. In French the word &quot;esprit&quot; covers
<br />
all these notions, and in German, the words are &quot;Geist&quot; and &quot;Seele&quot;. Yet
<br />
in English soul as well as ghost/spirit (the latter two being largely
<br />
synonymous) imply an independent existence apart from the body,
<br />
whereas &quot;mind&quot; has no such connotation. &quot;Soul&quot; tends to be used in a
<br />
theological setting, whereas &quot;ghost&quot; appears more in  literature or movies
<br />
- &quot;ghost stories&quot; :). But apart from that, I cannot see any obvious
<br />
distinction.
<br />
<br />Interestingly in my aforementioned Oxford dictionary, it defines mind
<br />
as &quot;seat of consciousness&quot; (def 6.) and &quot;soul&quot; (def 7.) Oh well, maybe
<br />
everyday people's understanding of these things is muddied, or perhaps
<br />
my usage of these terms is particularly Australian (Australia being
<br />
one of the least religious countries in the world)
<br />
<br />Cheers
