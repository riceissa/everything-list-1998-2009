Hello Jacques

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;    Of course, if we already had a theory of quantum gravity, and if the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; math calculation already yielded the prediction that p=x, then p(o|1) (if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you like, p(x|1)) would be 1 - based on that math, not on the fact that we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; do see x.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I took Candidate #1 to be - we have a theory that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematically constrains all parameters either to particular values or to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ranges which are consistent with SAS's.  If that was not what you meant by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Candidate #1 (and apparently it wasn't), why didn't you consider that as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Candidate #4; after all it's what most physicist hope and work for.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    The whole point is that right now, we don't have such a theory!  And 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what my analysis seems to point to is that there isn't one.
</em><br />
<br />What analysis is that?  The hypothesis that every mathematically consistent
<br />
universe exists may admit infinitely many in which there are no free
<br />
parameters and in which there are sentient beings.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    If, on the other hand, we had a theory that exactly specified (up to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many decimal places) each physical constant, and it predicted the values we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see, then that theory would have a huge probability advantage over #2 (which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only constrains the values to a range, albeit a narrow one).
</em><br />
<br />I assume you say this because, although p(o|2)=p(o|4)=1, you assign a lower
<br />
prior probability to 4 so that p(4)&gt;&gt;p(2).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The advantage will always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belong to *some* type of ensemble theory, erasing the anthropic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;coincidence&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Ensemble #2 easily beats non-ensemble #1, but &quot;apparent ensemble #2 with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tegmark ensemble&quot; is not necessarily any more likely than such an &quot;apparent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-ensemble #1 with Tegmark ensemble&quot;.  Tricky!  (And similar to the effect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the MWI on &quot;god's coin toss&quot;.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    But important to point it out now, lest physicists should come up with a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unique consistent set of physical constants, and then try to use that as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence against the MWI way of thinking about physical laws!  It wouldn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be.)
</em><br />
<br />It would not disprove an ensemble theory, but it would make it irrelevant. 
<br />
Imagine Ptolemy saying to Newton, &quot;That all possible epicycles exist is the simplest
<br />
hypothesis.  Your elliptic orbits and theory of gravity are not evidence
<br />
against it.&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    You still don't seem to understand what the MWI says.  In both 1) and 2) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you seem to assume branching is some special physical process beyond normal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Shrodinger evolution.  You probably have seen a lot of books characterize 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the MWI that way.  
</em><br />
<br />Apparently I don't.  I was relying on David Deutsch's description of an
<br />
experiment to distinguish Everett's MWI from the other interpretaitons [Quantum
<br />
Concepts in Space and Time, Penrose &amp; Isham, pp 219]. &quot;...At this point an
<br />
outside observer could measure O(T) but the result would be to transfer the
<br />
split to himself...&quot;  Deutsch seems to think a split has occured in the quantum
<br />
process, which is a parallel computation, and if it is observed the observer
<br />
will split.  Is it your interpretation that these splits don't occur or that
<br />
they are not physical processes or they are just part of the unitary evolution?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    As I said, in both my version of the MWI and Everett's, &quot;branching&quot; is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just a manner of speaking about the typical behavior in Shrodinger evolution 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where decoherence occurs.  
</em><br />
<br />I understand decoherence is just part of the unitary evolution and hence to get
<br />
from the *almost* diagonal density matrix to a definite classical value still
<br />
takes a step.
<br />
<br />A theory of mind is needed by *any* theory to 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generate *any* prediction about observations.  I attempt to formulate one in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my CWIA.
</em><br />
<br />In Deutsch's paper [ibid] he requires a 'mind' for his crucial experiment; but
<br />
the mind seems a very simple one.  The hard part about the experiment is
<br />
keeping all the interactions reversible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Finally, it's obvious to me that a stochastic theory, which says that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Kolmogorov complexity of the physical world increases with every event, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuously violates Occam's razor.
</em><br />
<br />It certainly leads to an increase in information - but not number of
<br />
hypotheses.  In any case Occam's razor is a rule-of-thumb; you're trying to
<br />
promote it to a law of physics.
<br />
