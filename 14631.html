<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Nichomachus,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; decision. If she measures the particle's spin as positive, she will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; elect to switch cases, and if she measures it with a negative spin she
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will keep the one she has. This is because she wants to be sure that,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; having gotten to this point in the game, there will be at least some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; branches of her existence where she experiences winning the grand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; prize. She is not convinced that, were she to decide what to do using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; only the processes available to her mind, she would guarantee that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; same result since it is just possible that all of the mutiple versions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of herself confronted with the dilemma may make the same bad guess.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have also thought along these lines some time ago (to use a qubit to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ensure that all outcomes are chosen, because one should not rely on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one's mind decohering into all possible decisions).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The essential question is this: what worlds exist? All possible worlds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But which worlds are possible? We have, on the one hand, physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility (this also includes other physical constants etc, but no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; totally unphysical scenarios).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have long adhered to this &quot;everything physically possible&quot;, but this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does break down under closer scrutiny: first of all, physical relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are, when things come down to it, mathematical relations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So we could conclude with Max Tegmark: all possible mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures exist; this is ill defined (but then, why should the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything be well defined?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Alastair argues in his paper that everything logically possible exists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (with his non arbitrariness principle) but, while initially appealing,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it leads to the question: what is logically possible? In what logic?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Classical/Intuitionist/Deviant logics etc etc...then we are back at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Max's all possible structures.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For all this, I am beginning very much to appreciate Bruno's position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the Sigma_1 sentences; but I still have to do more reading and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; catch up on some logic/recursion theory for a final verdict ;-))
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are on the right track :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One objection comes to mind immediately (already written above): why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should the Everything be well defined?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think you should ask Brian Tenneson. Personally I follow Plotinus and 
<br />
many Buddhist, Israelites, Muslims, and Christians, (and more) on the 
<br />
fact that the Big Picture (Brian's Universal set, I think) is not a 
<br />
member of what belongs to the Big Picture, so the everything cannot be 
<br />
described, nor really belonging to the everything.
<br />
Even restraining ourself to the mathematical universe (i.e. adopting 
<br />
mathematicalism), they are good reasons to believe that the whole of 
<br />
mathematics cannot be considered as a mathematical object. One reason 
<br />
is that all attempts to make the mathematical everything purely 
<br />
mathematical have failed. Set theories (like ZF) miss some mathematical 
<br />
object and also, in some sense, produce to much unwanted mathematical 
<br />
objects. Lawvere made an attempt to get the Big Mathematical Picture as 
<br />
a category, but he fails, although he (re)deiscovered the topos 
<br />
catehories in the process, which captures more the mathematician's mind 
<br />
than the mathematical reality (realities). The set theory NF does 
<br />
capture Universal Sets, but then I have doubt that it does it in a 
<br />
genuine sense, or if it is not in inconsistent theory.
<br />
Another reason is a not yet clear generalization of Gödel's 
<br />
incompleteness phenomenon along the line of Grim (ref in my thesis).
<br />
With comp, we have also a universal object (the universal machine), but 
<br />
again, like the toposes, it is more on the side of the &quot;mathematician&quot; 
<br />
than of the &quot;mathematical reality&quot;. With comp (actually with the 
<br />
arithmetical comp, i.e. with the lobian interview) we have good reason 
<br />
to suspect that the notion of &quot;truth (about) us&quot;  *is* the big picture 
<br />
(Plotinus' One), but we can prove, then, that IF comp is true, and IF 
<br />
we are self-referentially correct (and thus lobian) then such a notion 
<br />
of truth cannot be expressed by any means by us. So I do thing that the 
<br />
everything, curiously enough, perhaps, does not belong to any 
<br />
everything thing we can defined (despite its name, probably because of 
<br />
its name).
<br />
I am not sure about the motivation of Brian for his search of a 
<br />
universal set. May be he could tell us a bit more?
<br />

<br />
<br />PS I intended to comment some other posts but I have work to do, and I 
<br />
think this week I will be very buzy. I keep reading the list and 
<br />
absence or delay in comments does not reflect lack of interest but 
<br />
accumulation of time consuming jobs those days. Normally I will have 
<br />
more time next week. Best regards to all of you.
<br />
Ah ... A colleague of mine (the one who actually suggested me to look 
<br />
at that movie)  told me that &quot;The Prestige&quot; is the most 
<br />
anti-computationalist movie ever conceivable, and he gave me a very 
<br />
good argument! Cannot say more now without trigging the &quot;spoiler alert&quot; 
<br />
... :)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To go back to your original question: to consider if both variants are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chosen by the player of the game by herself (without qubit) seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depend on which kind of Everything you choose. And that, I think, is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; crux of the matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cheers,
</em><br />
