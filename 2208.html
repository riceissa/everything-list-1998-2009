John Bailey reminds us davidsmyth's question:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Could there be a universe where the rules  concerning number theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be different than in this universe?
</em><br />
<br />He gives us a nice Reference (John Foy quant- ph/0001074
<br />
An ``Epistemological Derivation of Quantum Logic)&quot; + the well
<br />
known ``Machines, Logic and Quantum Physics&quot;
<br />
David Deutsch and Artur Ekert and (don't forget!) Rossella Lupacchini.
<br />
<br />I was about sending a reply, but then Brent Meeker send an answer
<br />
which is better than mine:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Logic and number theory and in fact any mathematical theory are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;independent of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical reality since they are simply sets of axioms and their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consequences according to some rule of inference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Euclidean geometry didn't change in 1823; only the idea that it necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;applied to the physical world changed.  There are many physical entities that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number theory does not apply to.  It's just that the the non-applicability is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so obvious that one doesn't usually think of number theory applying.  For an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;example that sometimes trips up 4th graders; consider that there are two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;school
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;clubs, one with 15 members and one with 20 members.  They have picnic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;together. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How many are at the picnic?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Similarly the application of logic is empirical.  Ordinary predicate calculus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has a limited range of applicability - you get into trouble if you quantify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;over predicates.  Logic ordinarily deals with propositions which have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;true-false values and connectives (and, or,...).  But it could be extended to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;include things like 'red implies not-green'.  All of this is independent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical world.  It's just that we like to adapt our language so as to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;make it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;easy to talk accurately about the world.
</em><br />
<br />I want just add some comments. 
<br />
<br />1) It is well known (by logician) than
<br />
any axiomatisation of number theory admit so called non-standard model.
<br />
In these model addition and multiplication are not computable. This show
<br />
that we can consider curious structure in which number obeys different
<br />
rules. But this has nothing to do with the fact that in all universe
<br />
the standard rule apply. In fact without the standard logic you cannot
<br />
even give meaning to the non standard structures. Algebra has been 
<br />
invented to care about non isomorphic structures.
<br />
<br />2) Those like Putnam who have try to use quantum logic to give a realist
<br />
account of quantum mechanics have failed. Quantum logic just highlights
<br />
the many worlds feature of quantum mechanics (and/or the non realism
<br />
of the isolated system).
<br />
<br />3) Deutsch, Ekert and Lupacchini wrote in the mentionned paper:
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;Though the truths of logic and pure mathematics are objective and
<br />
independent of any contingent facts or laws of nature, our knowledge of
<br />
these truths depends entirely on our knowledge of the laws of physics.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />I could understand that some physicist believe (unlike me) that
<br />
our knowledge of these mathematical truth depends on the laws of physics.
<br />
But that such knowledge depends on our *knowledge* of the laws of 
<br />
physics: well I cannot make sense of that at all.
<br />
It looks like young children should apply Schroedinger equation on their
<br />
own brain to understand that 1+1 gives 2.
<br />
