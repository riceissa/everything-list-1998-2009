<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But can you do both without circularity?



</em><br />
Yes. That &quot;circularity&quot; is worked out through a mathematical theory of 
<br />
self-reference. Of course that is not something I can explain in just 
<br />
one post.

<br />
I suggest you search in the archive, or you consult my papers, or you 
<br />
could wait some explanation I have promised to David (but he seems busy 
<br />
right now).

<br />
What can be explained in a few lines is that *discourses* about 
<br />
&quot;subjective experience&quot; and &quot;time&quot; appears naturally in the modal 
<br />
variant of self-reference.

<br />
I study what a &quot;ideally correct&quot; machine can prove about herself. Then 
<br />
I borrow one of Theaetetus' definition of the knower/first person: so 
<br />
that
<br />
&quot;to know p&quot; is defined by to &quot;((I can justify p) &amp; p)&quot;. This makes 
<br />
sense thanks to the fact that no machine can prove that&quot; proving p 
<br />
entails necessarily p&quot; (and this is a consequence of incompleteness). 
<br />
Then math shows that the &quot;arithmetical knower&quot; so defined has a 
<br />
discourse similar to the &quot;Berson/Brouwer ...&quot; theory of the creative 
<br />
and temporal subject, + a lot of mathematical property making it closer 
<br />
to some intuitionistic view of math. This gives a subjective time 
<br />
theory, but also an arithmetical topos, etc.
<br />
In the same way we get a &quot;physics&quot; (according to the UDA) when we 
<br />
define &quot;I observe p&quot;, by &quot;I am measuring p with a 
<br />
probability/credibility of one&quot;. This means we can define &quot;observing p&quot; 
<br />
by &quot;I  can justify p and p is consistent&quot;. By Godel *completeness* 
<br />
theorem this is equivalent with p is true in all accessible world and p 
<br />
is true in at least one accessible world). Note that here I am using 
<br />
implicitly a lot of theorems in the math of self-reference---I just 
<br />
summarize, look into my papers for more). Here we should get some 
<br />
geometry, and we already get a quantum like probability logic, 
<br />
including a purely arithmetical interpretation of it.

<br />
Of course nobody can prove the existence of subjective experience in 
<br />
Platonia or anywhere. We know that &quot;exists&quot; because somehow we live 
<br />
them, but they cannot be communicated.
<br />
But once we grant that similarity of some possible &quot;discourses&quot; on 
<br />
subjective experience can be taken as evidence of the presence of 
<br />
subjective experience (what I have sometimes refer to as the 
<br />
&quot;politeness principle&quot;), then what I say above can help to figure out 
<br />
how subjective experiences and subjective times can appear as internal 
<br />
modality of any arithmetical realm. Put in another way, if this would 
<br />
not be true, it would entails the existence of many zombies in 
<br />
platonia. But of course this is a short way to present this and I ask 
<br />
you to not taking too much literally what I try to explain shortly.

<br />
To sum up: circularity is handled by the mathematical theory of 
<br />
self-reference (encapsulated by the modal logic G and G* at the 
<br />
propositional level). Psychological and physical things are either 
<br />
modelised or recovered by &quot;intensional variants&quot; of the self-reference 
<br />
logic G (for the provable) and G* (for the true but not necessarily 
<br />
provable).

<br />
Note that here I was talking on &quot;subjective time&quot;. The running UD in 
<br />
platonia defined implicitly another notion of time, which is just the 
<br />
number of steps the UD needs to access states. This can be well defined 
<br />
up to some constant thanks to machine independence theorem in computer 
<br />
science. But this as nothing to do with subjective time, or with the 
<br />
feeling or seeming of time flows.
