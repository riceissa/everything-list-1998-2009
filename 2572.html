<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Would it be possible to elaborate on this? Could it be that for a transition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to &quot;make sense for the consciousness that experiences it&quot; such a transition must

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not contradict any other previous experience?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no &quot;previous&quot; in the sense of previous time, only in terms of logical

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; antecedent.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Umm, let me break this down into chucks and try to see if we are understanding
<br />
each other. My notion of a &quot;previous time&quot; was couched within a notion that is similar
<br />
to J. A. Wheeler's notion of a &quot;Surprise 20 Questions Game&quot; and I did not state so
<br />
explicitly. I am playing with the idea that time is a &quot;first person&quot; attribute and thus
<br />
is not to be considered as &quot;objective&quot; nor absolute (as in the Newtonian sense). I think
<br />
that our ideas are similar but we may have semantic differences here. ;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In addition, the conscious points are multiply connected and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connections are a function of the points themselves. In other words each point could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have several priors and several successors.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would agree, but I would argue that we could cause some confusion if we are not
<br />
careful.  We have to distinguish the a priori possible (or probable) experiences from
<br />
the a posteriori experiences themselves. I am exploring the idea that communication
<br />
between observers plays an important role in restricting and/or distinguishing the two.
<br />
I hope that you understand this difference between a priori and a posteriori that I am
<br />
writing about. ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The structure is &quot;web-like.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I agree. I have been exploring this idea with several people for some time
<br />
using the notions of Leibniz and Spinoza. Let me recap. Are you saying that conscious
<br />
points (I can them them &quot;monads&quot; ala Leibniz) has a &quot;web-like structure?&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (The universe does not just splits with each Quantum event, it can also merge) I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; best to view each points as a set of states independent of past information (i.e.,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first order Markov chain). To make sense, a transition needs only satisfy the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current states. The &quot;past&quot; states are irrelevant or ambiguous.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Umm, here I have a problem! You say that the universe splits and merges; how do you
<br />
define such a Universe? Is it the Totality of existence or is it the union of all
<br />
possible first person perceptions? If it is the former then there are powerful arguments
<br />
that such a Universe is completely static and timeless, which causes the notion of
<br />
splitting and merging to fall apart because it can have nothing external to it to act as
<br />
a clock to parametrize its splitting and merging. If it is the latter then we still have
<br />
a problem since the the notion of a &quot;current state&quot; is ambiguous at best.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could think of the splitting and merging as local topological properties of a
<br />
multiply connected manifold and I think that such a thought would be in line with the
<br />
idea of first order Markov chains, but I am not sure now you are thinking about how the
<br />
points are related (via transitions). It is obvious that &quot;past states&quot; refer to
<br />
information that is encoded within the current state and that is what I meant by my
<br />
statement. I think that we agree that the &quot;past&quot; is not something that is &quot;out there&quot;
<br />
outside of the experience of the present moment. ;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I certainly wouldn't claim that for my own train of thoughts.  Also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't see how transition and simultaneity can be defined until time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is defined.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Time and space are not defined yet. The only thing that is defined so far is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; a logic and an associated consciousness. So a transition is just an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; unidirectional logical arrow from this conscious point to another conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; point. Time is an experience emerging from the unidirectionality of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; arrows.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Some have argued that the time, in the sense that it can be considered as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; transition of the physical state of a system, is the dual of the logic. See:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; <a href="http://boole.stanford.edu/chuguide.html#P5">http://boole.stanford.edu/chuguide.html#P5</a> Additionally, I think that we should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distinguish the different aspects of time. There is the notion of time as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; measure of change, time as an order of succession and time and time as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; directed transition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Interesting.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested in your thoughts of Pratt et al's ideas. ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     If you are considering the aspect of time that is an order of succession,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then I would agree, but I believe that Brett (?) was considering the directed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; transition aspect. By the way, space is definable as the order of co-existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (Leibniz).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Let's define third person perspective as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; one shared by observers occupying the same logical/physical laws frame of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; reference as well as having the same set of contingencies on their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; existence. They will experience the world in the same way and therefore have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the illusion that their perception of the world is absolute when in fact it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; isn't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     I agree with this definition of the third person perspective! Note that if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; each observer has their own &quot;time&quot; and &quot;space&quot; which is their first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; perspective, then the third person perspective is the intersection of many first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person perspectives.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Right!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ...each OM is connected to other OMs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; by unidirectional logical arrows formulated according to a logic of which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; a characteristics of the OM themselves.  Thus each OM defines its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; allowed set of transitions.Time is an emergent experience resulting from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; these arrows. Conscious flow is a static phenomenon, EXPERIENCED BY EACH
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; POINT THAT IS CAPABLE OF EXPERIENCING IT.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     I think that we need to find a way of defining the act of experiencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; itself! Several philosophers have argued to that experience involves a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; correlation or synchronization of sorts between &quot;external&quot; and &quot;internal&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; attributes. Your statements would imply, then, that a &quot;point&quot; has some kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;internal&quot; structure...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. This is the next step which is anthropically driven. The structure is necessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because of the attributes of consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, would we agree that the anthropic principle (weak?) is true in the sense that
<br />
any observer will have first person perspectives (experiences) that have a probability
<br />
of 1 if and only if such are consistent with its existence. Also, if you are going to
<br />
say that consciousness is a static phenomenon then could you explain how the appearance
<br />
of change comes about? Have you by chance read Julian Barbour's book The End of Time?
<br />
