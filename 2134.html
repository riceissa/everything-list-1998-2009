<br />Thank you John for your feedback. I am sure others will not be as generous.
<br />
What you say is partially true. We are deeply influenced by &quot;Gaia&quot;, our 
<br />
environment. However, there are certain concepts which have bearing far 
<br />
beyond our earth. For example the current physical sciences apply almost to 
<br />
the begining of time and to the end of space. Concepts like evolutionary 
<br />
selection of the fittest and the anthropy principle have an almost 
<br />
mathematical quality to them, and are surely universal.
<br />
<br />I just want to be more explicit in my characterization of the guardian 
<br />
angels, the fatalisitic slobs and the narcissistic gods. 
<br />
<br />The guardian angels are outwardly focussed. Their view of the MW provides 
<br />
them with boundless optimism which stems from their relativistic belief that 
<br />
their measure does not decrease upon death. Since, they believe in their own 
<br />
immortality their attitude is to live to the fullest, to cooperate, be good 
<br />
to each other and enjoy their unending experience of the MW. Even though they 
<br />
may be in the valley of the shadow of death, their cup runneth over. QS is 
<br />
anathema to them. Their highest regards is to respect, preserve, protect and 
<br />
promote creation. They strive to shield lesser civilizations that haven't 
<br />
reached their level, just as earth's environmetalists are protecting 
<br />
endangered animals. Their contribution to the MW is one of creation.
<br />
<br />The fatalistic slobs also believe that measure does not decrease upon death. 
<br />
Measure does not decrease and does not increase no matter what. So why 
<br />
bother? Their lack the moral drive of the guardian angels and the narcissism 
<br />
of the gods leads them to achieve their nirvana by denying their own self and 
<br />
by merging with the &quot;whole&quot; MW.  This leads them to a kind of suicide which 
<br />
you may call ZS (Zen suicide), and in this regards they are similar to the 
<br />
gods. Their contribution to the MW is zero.
<br />
<br />The narcissistic gods are egocentric, self centered, self interested, 
<br />
egostistical, and egomaniacal. Their goal in life is to seek self 
<br />
satisfaction. Their disrespect for creation is so extreme that they sacrifice 
<br />
their own life to reach divinity. The creation of their world involves their 
<br />
own destruction in ours. They rather be the god of a small pond then a fish 
<br />
in a big one. (Except, they can argue that the size of the pond always 
<br />
appears to be the same, no matter how many times they die, and in this they 
<br />
share the optimism of the guardian angels) Their contribution to the MW is 
<br />
one of destruction.
<br />
<br />It is possible I suppose for gods to become guardian angels and vice versa, 
<br />
or for fatalistic slobs to change to angels or to gods.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;misguided QS the cause of doom for most civilisations? As you mention,

<br />I agree.

</em><br />
<br />Quantum Suicide (QS) uses the hypothesis that, when, from an observer A point 
<br />
of view,  person B appears to die or commit suicide, person B perceives 
<br />
himself to continue living even though he will appear to be dead according to 
<br />
person A. The basis for this hypothesis is that the Multiple World 
<br />
Interpretation postulates that the &quot;universe splits&quot; upon every quantum event 
<br />
and that the person who appears to die actually, &quot;may&quot; continues to live in a 
<br />
small number of branches in which the conditions prevailing in his 
<br />
environment are not supporting his death. 
<br />
<br />QS is the concept that you could for example set up a suicide situation in 
<br />
which you instantly die unless you win one million dollars at the lottery. 
<br />
The result is that you die in most world where you don't win the lottery, but 
<br />
in those worlds where you do win, you will perceive yourself winning - 
<br />
obviously. In no world will you lose AND be conscious. The issue that has 
<br />
been argued in this group is whether the number of branches where a person 
<br />
lives (the measure) is an absolute number or a relative one. If it is 
<br />
absolute, then death does decrease the &quot;measure&quot; of a person. On the other 
<br />
hand, if it is relative, then measure appears to be the same to any observer, 
<br />
no matter, how many times he has performed QS. 
<br />
<br />BTW, PLEASE DON&quot;T QS. IT&quot;S ONLY A HYPOTHESIS. In any case, you'll find out 
<br />
soon enough through entirely natural means about death and immortality!
