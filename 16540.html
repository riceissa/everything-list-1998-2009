<em class="quotelev1">&gt; birds landing could stand for &quot;0&quot;, and on a Saturday it could stand

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for &quot;1&quot; again.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But this makes sense only relatively to a &quot;stable universal&quot; machine  
<br />
in which you can encode what you are telling me.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this way you could take the physical activity

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carried out by a store-bought computer calculating factorial(5) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; map it onto the forest with the birds.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right, I see your point, you take any physical activity, and then  
<br />
an ad hoc sequence of universal machine which interpret each piece of  
<br />
birds behavior into a computation of fact(24). That sequence should be  
<br />
capable to be infinite and the birds behavior have to resume more and  
<br />
more complex problem dues to the adhocness of the representations.   
<br />
The complexity of the sequence of universal machine will grow  
<br />
exponentially. Hmm. perhaps. Again this will change nothing, After  
<br />
all, the UD does generate *all* implementation of all computations  
<br />
including your very complex (to encode) interpretation of rocks and  
<br />
forest.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, this won't give you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the answer to factorial(5) unless you already have the answer, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that just means that the computation is obscured,
</em><br />
<br />It is obscured and blurred relatively to its most probable histories.  
<br />
In normal physics (normal in the Gauss meaning) you cannot count on  
<br />
those computations. It would be like saying you win the lottery given  
<br />
that you have the right numbers, in disorder, but after all you can  
<br />
read them in the right order, and someone in Platonia does read them  
<br />
in that different order.
<br />
I could still disagree because, as you seem to accept, such &quot;physical  
<br />
implementation&quot; can reduce to zero the needed amount of physical  
<br />
activity, and an interpretation of your computation of the factorial  
<br />
of 4, in the rock, will be made by an actual computation of 24 by a  
<br />
&quot;real universal machine&quot; which does not need to be physical, in  
<br />
platonia, and which has a lot of imagination in front of the rock. You  
<br />
need something like this, for your argument to go through, but this  
<br />
*is* mainly the comp supervenience. So what you show is that indeed,  
<br />
we don't need, or cannot use in any genuine sense a primitive notion  
<br />
of physical activity to build a notion of supervenience.
<br />
Yet I think that the notion of interpretation is more constrained that  
<br />
just invoking some ad hoc sequence of platonist universal  
<br />
interpreters. At some level, we must bet on &quot;just one&quot;, if only to be  
<br />
able to talk (even to talk to oneself).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the same way a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; message is obscured if encoded with a one-time pad that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subsequently destroyed and forgotten. In fact, even with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; store-bought computer the computation is obscured if there are no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligent beings around who can understand it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not at all. If the computer evaluate fact(4), even alone in a room,  
<br />
the probability it gives 24 is one, in a verifiable way by a third  
<br />
person. With or without physicalism we accept the idea that the  
<br />
physical neighborhood is locally Turing universal, and does interpret  
<br />
the computation of 4.
<br />
If I put a computer evaluating Stathis here and now, under your  
<br />
substitution level, then, despite the computer being alone in the  
<br />
room, the probability that you are where you feel you are (here and  
<br />
now) or  in that &quot;room&quot; is 1/2 (accepting the usual probability). Cf  
<br />
step 5.
<br />
You will not say &quot;yes doctor&quot;, but only if you take a permanent look  
<br />
on my working artificial brain&quot;. The point of comp is that some  
<br />
program can observe themselves (at some level). And this can be made  
<br />
mathematically precise (by Kleene second recursion theorem).
<br />
<br />Accpeting your &quot;interpretation of the rock&quot;, The probability that you  
<br />
are in the rocks, relatively to you here and now, is  
<br />
0,00000000000000........1, given that you have to wait the UD  
<br />
generates that immensely long sequences of more and more complex &quot;ad  
<br />
hoc&quot; universal interpreters.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, if the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation supervenes on the activity of the store-bought computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without regard for whether any external observer is around to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand, then it also supervenes on the activity of the forest with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the birds.
</em><br />
<br />You illustrate well that the only question which makes sense is the  
<br />
question of which most probable computation bears us, or which more  
<br />
probable universal machine or number &quot;executes&quot; us.  What you say is  
<br />
that the UD will generate stupid program interpreting the empty input  
<br />
like if it was a code for fact(4).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Other possibilities are that the computation supervenes on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical activity only when an external observer understands it (which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; poses difficulties for a closed virtual reality with its own conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers),
</em><br />
<br />And leads also to an infinite regression, unless you postulate an  
<br />
absolute external witness with cognitive abilities based on ...  
<br />
nothing (which makes not much sense).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or that the computation does not supervene on physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity at all.
</em><br />
<br />It seems to me that we agree that physical supervenience leads to many  
<br />
absurdities. Is your argument purely academical, or do you think it  
<br />
can be used to prevent the conclusion that physics has to be explained  
<br />
by the purely mathematical notion of &quot;most probable computation as  
<br />
seen from inside&quot;, among the 2^aleph_0 computations going through the  
<br />
current states, in UD* or in arithmetic?
<br />
<br />With you argument, the movie-graph is conscious.  But is all  
<br />
consciousness at once, not just the consciousness corresponding to the  
<br />
filmed boolean graph. This not change the problem measure in any way.  
<br />
It makes the primitive physicalness idea even more absurd.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that your point just recall that in Platonia, there are  
<br />
complex sequence of universal machine which can interpret any  
<br />
computation, including the empty one, as being any other computations.  
<br />
But this is akin to white rabbits (from the probability pov) and akin  
<br />
to the fact that, with its terrible redundancy and &quot;free  
<br />
imagination&quot;,  the UD generates also conspirator interpretations.
<br />
<br />With just arithmetic, when we stop to postulate a primitive or  
<br />
ontological material world, all primitive ad-hocness is removed, given  
<br />
that the existing internal interpretations are all determined, with  
<br />
their relative frequency, by addition and multiplication rules, and  
<br />
physics will be defined by the (absolute) probability of relative  
<br />
computations (here = probability of relative number theoretical  
<br />
relations. &quot;to be a finite piece of computation&quot; is decidable even in  
<br />
very tiny fragment of arithmetic, and this can be used to avoid any  
<br />
starting ambiguity. This is made possible through Church thesis, and  
<br />
it eventually forces us to realize that a rock is the result of an  
<br />
infinity of computation, and the rock &quot;we see&quot; a crude local average,  
<br />
but comp makes it possible that a rock implements all computations to,  
<br />
but only by an explicit call to a sequence of universal machine in  
<br />
Platonia. Meaning; there is no room for providing an explanative power  
<br />
(both for mind and matter) to the notion of primitive substance and  
<br />
primitive substancial incarnated laws.  Due to the failure of logicism  
<br />
we need numbers or combinators and primitive immaterial laws to agree  
<br />
on, like addition and multiplication, or lambda abstraction and  
<br />
application, etc. The measure does not depend on which first universal  
<br />
system you choose, by non completely trivial application of computer  
<br />
science. And to use a primitive quantum computer for a primitive  
<br />
physics is treachery with respect to the comp mind body problem.
<br />
<br />OK?
