</em><br />
<br />Russell, this is daft!  Surely the argument is getting completely lost
<br />
in the terminology here.  What on earth could you (or Colin, or
<br />
anyone), whether arguing pro or con, imagine 'qualia' could possibly
<br />
mean in this context?  And yet something (presumably) based on neurons
<br />
(and on whatever one's model-of-choice claims neurons are based on)
<br />
'possesses' them.  Or rather (since I think the 'possessing qualia'
<br />
way of speaking leads to utter incoherence) whatever exists
<br />
intrinsically (e.g. our personal world) is based on them.  Which is
<br />
equivalent to saying that this 'base' exists 'completely' (as opposed
<br />
to its *incomplete* - because abstract(ed) - 'physical description').
<br />
<br />As I've argued (interminably) elsewhere, when we analyse our personal
<br />
worlds stringently, we find that our claims about them rest
<br />
principally on two capabilities (that are actually inseparable when
<br />
examined): 'sensing' and 'acting'.  These are the primitive intrinsic
<br />
semantic components of relationship, or 'grasp'.  'Absolute qualities'
<br />
are not at issue here.  These are ineluctably sui generis: a 'personal
<br />
modelling medium' can't *in itself* be communicated in terms of
<br />
'extrinsic objects' modelled within it.  But we can refer to it
<br />
ostensively: i.e. we *demonstrate* how elements of our personal worlds
<br />
relate to an inter-subjective 'extrinsic reality' (which is I think is
<br />
at root what Colin calls 'doing science').  But we *must* postulate
<br />
that all 'emergent' motivational and sensory modalities - i.e. what
<br />
comprises our personal worlds - *must* 'reduce' to components of the
<br />
same *completed* ontic category.
<br />
<br />Now, if you want to try to imagine 'what it's like to be a neuron', I
<br />
can't help you.  But I do say that you shouldn't expect the relation
<br />
between this and 'what it's like to be Russell' to be any less complex
<br />
than, say, what a 'physical' description of a neuron 'is like' as
<br />
compared to an equivalent description of Russell.  IOW, pretty
<br />
tenuous. But - crucially - we accept in the case of the 'physical'
<br />
account that the components and the assembly belong in (a 'reduced'
<br />
version of) the *same ontic category*.  And, mutatis mutandis, the
<br />
'completed' relationships at fundamental and emergent levels likewise
<br />
belong in the same completed ontic category (i.e. the unique one - the
<br />
'abstracted physical' one now being revealed as merely partial).
<br />
<br />A crucial aspect of this is that it emphasises - but crucially
<br />
*completes* - the causal closure of our explanations.  We can now see
<br />
that any 'physical' action-only account is radically incomplete - in
<br />
the massively real sense that *it can't work at all*.  Without the
<br />
'sensing' component of 'grasp', 'action' is snuffed out at the root
<br />
(Kant had to invoke divine intervention to get out of this one).  And
<br />
the 'grasp' itself must crucially be intuited as intrinsically self-
<br />
motivated (i.e. 'physical law' reduces to the self-motivated relating
<br />
of differentiated 'ultimate actors'). The self-motivation of the
<br />
'componentry' can then emerge somewhat later, transformed but intact
<br />
(mutatis mutandis) as the self-motivation of all manner of personal
<br />
and extrinsic emergents.
<br />
<br />Our explanations about our motivations and the causal sequence from
<br />
personal to extrinsic worlds can now 'emerge' as indeed 'something
<br />
like' what we intuit in our personal worlds (phew!!).  I really did go
<br />
'ouch' *because it hurt*.  I fled the situation *because I was really
<br />
suffering*. The computer isn't conscious *purely in virtue of any
<br />
program I impute to it* (though like any other entity it is an
<br />
emergent with its proper fundamental 'grasp'). And BTW (pace Bruno)
<br />
all this could AFAICS equally well be postulated on AR - i.e. the
<br />
'self-motivated' primitive elements (relata) and operators (mediators)
<br />
of COMP.
<br />
<br />What this means is that 'neurons' - whether further reduced to
<br />
particles, electromagnetic fields, or indeed the number realm: however
<br />
we choose to model the 'base' - must supervene on 'ultimate relata'
<br />
that interact in virtue of intrinsic 'grasp' (see my posts to Colin
<br />
and Bruno for more): i.e. 'sense' and 'action' united.  If we lose
<br />
this basic insight, we also lose the ability to map emergent 'mental'
<br />
and 'physical' phenomena to any ultimate entities on which we can
<br />
coherently claim they supervene.  Or rather, we retain only the
<br />
ability to map the *action* half of the sense-action 'grasp' (an
<br />
omission which should now be seen as fatally incoherent - how can
<br />
entities be claimed to act on each other without mutually sensing
<br />
their presence?).
<br />
<br />This only ever *seemed* to make sense insofar as the physical
<br />
description of the world yields models abstracted from the 'completed'
<br />
existents to which they refer - not those existents themselves.  The
<br />
puzzlement over the lost 'sensing', however, returns with a vengeance
<br />
when the modelled existent becomes reflexive - i.e. it's *ourselves*.
<br />
Why aren't we zombies?  Because the physical model of ourselves is
<br />
just that - an incomplete, uninhabited abstraction - 'action' without
<br />
'sense' - a zombie in fact.  But the completed version can't be a
<br />
zombie, because like one, it wouldn't work at all.  And, crucially,
<br />
neither would anything else.
<br />
<br />All this has massive implications for issues of will (free or
<br />
otherwise), suffering, software uploading of minds, etc., etc. - which
<br />
I've indicated in other posts.  Consequently, I'd be really interested
<br />
in your response, because AFAICS this must be either right(ish),
<br />
wrong(ish), or not-even-wrong(ish).  But if right(ish), potentially it
<br />
gives us a basis for speaking the same language, even if my suggested
<br />
vocabulary is jettisoned for an improved version.  It's certainly
<br />
intended to be Occamish.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The distinction between 'magical emergence' and 'emergence' is quite

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'emergence' that does not ultimately rely on a necessary primitive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'Magical emergence' is when you claim 'qualitative novelty' without having

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any idea (you can't point at it) of the necessary primitive, or by

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Ok. Here's where we find the big assumption. Feedback? HOW?...by who's

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rules? Your rules. This is the real circularity which underpins
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computationalism. It's the circularity that my real physical qualia model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cuts and kills. Mathematically:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; * You have knowledge KNOWLEDGE(t) of 'out there'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; * You want more knowledge of 'out there' ....so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; * KNOWLEDGE(t+1) is more than KNOWLEDGE(t)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; * in computationalism who defines the necessary route to this?...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;      d(KNOWLEDGE(t))

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;      --------------- = something you know = YOU DO.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;             dt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So this means that in a computer abstraction.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No its not. dK/dt is generated by the interaction of the rules with

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; genome, or whatever representation you're using to store the solutions.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; My scientific claim is that the electromagnetic field structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; literally the third person view of qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Eh? Electromagnetic field of what? The brain? If so, do you think that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; chemical potentiation plays no role at all in qualia?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Chemical potentiation IS electric field.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bollocks. A hydrogen molecule and an oxygen atom held 1m apart have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemical potential, but there is precious little electric field
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between them. Furthermore, the chemical potential is independent on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the separation, unlike the electric field.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There's no such thing as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'mechanical' there's no such thing as 'chemical'. These are all metaphors
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in certain contexts for what is there...space and charge (yes...and mass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; associated with certain charge carriers). Where did you get this weird
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; idea that a metaphor can make qualia?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do you think space and charge are not metaphors also? I would not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be so sure on this matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The electric field across the membrane of cells (astrocytes and neurons)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is MASSIVE. MEGAVOLTS/METER. Think SPARKS and LIGHTNIING. It dominates the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; entire structure! It does not have to go anywhere. It just has to 'be'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You 'be' it to get what it delivers. Less than 50% of the signalling in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the brain is synaptic, anyway! The dominant cortical process is actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; an astrocyte syncytium. (look it up!). I would be very silly to ignore the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; single biggest, most dominant process of the brain that is so far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; completely correlated in every way with qualia...in favour of any other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cause.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You're obviously suggesting single neurons have qualia. Forgive me for
