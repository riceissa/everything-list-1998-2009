<br /><br />There is no problem of induction. There is a problem of induction only  
<br />
for those who believe that science can prove a fact about reality.  
<br />
There are only worst, bad, good and better theories, but all theories  
<br />
are hypothetical belief. from the baby theory according to which he  
<br />
has parents, to the existence of moons, suns and bosons, theories are  
<br />
hypothetical, and their interpretations preserve the &quot;hypotheticalness&quot;.
<br />
A scientist never say &quot;I know&quot;.  (and this I think is the way Popper  
<br />
solved the &quot;unduction problem&quot;. But it appears only to those who want  
<br />
their theory to be true ... by authority.

<br /><br />Sure. I will ask a bank to lend me huge amount of money, I promise  
<br />
them to reimburse when I will win ten times the big lottery in a row.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But there's really not a better option that I can think of, so we

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might as well stick with our expectations and probabilities.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not that we have a choice, since free will is an illusion also...

<br /><br />Free will does not exist for those who live to work.
<br />
Free will does exist for those who work to live. If not, they are  
<br />
exploited? From universal they are forced to be particular. that's how  
<br />
souls falls and englue themselves, they loss their free will. Now work  
<br />
no war can make you free. You are, and can remain by resistance and  
<br />
vigilance.
<br />
In the normal worlds.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Without giving me a measure, it is like your theory predicts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; everything.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Right, it does basically predict everything.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Logicians call such theories inconsistent.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Except an end to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience.  There is no sweet, sweet release of death if I'm right.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There will be no final rest in the comforting embrace of oblivion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Only the endless grind of a weary existence.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is true. But no theories can predict this. Er... well, no  
<br />
consistent theories can predict this. Inconsistent theories can prove  
<br />
we are immortal indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is contradicted by the fact.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How so?  What fact?  You know for certain that you are the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno?  You know for certain that there aren't parallel realities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; containing Brunos with different experiences?  How did you come by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this fact?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it a fact, or just a belief?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Come on Kelly, you know my favorite postulate assume all computational  
<br />
histories (Robinson arithmetic) so I have no doubt there is a  
<br />
continuum of Bruno, even densely distributed between any two points of  
<br />
the M sets), all englued in their history and soon or later quite  
<br />
different, as different as Kelly and Bruno in short time, as different  
<br />
as Bruno and the amoeba on longer time ...
<br />
<br />The question is just this. I want coffee. How is it that I can realize  
<br />
the dream &quot;drinking of cup of coffee&quot;. I am good willing. I have try  
<br />
your theory this morning. At first it works. It was a real and big  
<br />
pleasure to await for the white rabbit bringing my cup of coffee in my  
<br />
bed, where I could stay longer. But  after two hours i was a bit  
<br />
missing something, and I ask myself: why did I bet I would necessarily  
<br />
be the Bruno in the White rabbit world instead of I seems (at least)  
<br />
the usual normal (and a bit sadder) world where in most circumstances  
<br />
I have to use my free will, my free time, my free action, my (not so  
<br />
free) coffee and this up to the point I bring the warm product to my  
<br />
mouth.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If I want coffee now, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; know all to well I have to do something for that. Sorry but I cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; wait for a white rabbit bringing me my cup of coffee.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God helps those who help themselves.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah! This is indeed in the &quot;guardian angel&quot; theory of the machine M, on  
<br />
the machine M.
<br />
<br />But of course the machine M, if she wants to remain scientific, or  
<br />
just self-referentially correct, should say instead:
<br />
<br />If God exists, then God helps those (universal machines) which help  
<br />
themselves.
<br />
<br />Plato's &quot;truth&quot; helps in the limit That why god is good, in Plato.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, some Brunos are more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fortunate with respect to helpful rabbits than other Brunos.  Stay
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; optimisitic.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I tell you. I will not try the white rabbit method of realizing the  
<br />
experience of drinking coffee no more, in the morning.
<br />
<br />OK, I admit I do it everyday implictly in the evening, it is perfect  
<br />
how the white rabbit seems to understand I don't want a cup of coffee,  
<br />
he never bring me coffee at that time. Is that an evidence that I am  
<br />
in a world with white rabbits?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I say that every possible event is perceived to happen, and so  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; is more or less rare than anything else.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It has to be at least in the relative way, if not your theory  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; predicts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all happenings, even in practice, but the facts contradict this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, what facts?  If everything was happening in alternate versions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of reality, how would you detect this?  What facts do you possess that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rule this out?
</em><br />
<br /><br />? I don't rule out the whole structure of possibilities, and I defend  
<br />
the idea that actuality is possibility from inside. I include type of  
<br />
relative or conditionnal possibilities. Indeed I explain that once you  
<br />
assume comp, you have to take into account the interference of  
<br />
histories due to your personal finite level of distinguishability  
<br />
among a continuum of histories.
<br />
<br />Mathematics illustrates that immaterial beings, like numbers and  
<br />
digital machines, obeys laws. Of course you can contemplate the  
<br />
picture, not trying to use it. I like very much poetry and many arts.
<br />
Actually to use the comp physics to measure the mass of the Higgs  
<br />
(Brout Englert)  Boson would be like using String Theory to prepare a  
<br />
pizza, but comp gives a global coherent picture, and it gives a frame  
<br />
where the &quot;laws of physics&quot; can emerge from.
<br />
Nobody can be sure it is true, but once you say yes to the doctor,  
<br />
then if your survive,  you are under its play.
<br />
<br />Bruno
