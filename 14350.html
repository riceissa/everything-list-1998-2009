Hey Günther, thanks for the comments.

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmm - your real existing nothing is just a word without referent - like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a null pointer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Q: &quot;What is on the paper?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As answer you expect that what is written.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As the paper is still blank:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A: &quot;Nothing.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are being returned a null pointer, not a metaphysical reference to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; balance, uniformity, symmetry or whatever.
</em><br />
<br />What properties are plainly visible on the white paper which cause the
<br />
return? Duality, distinction, form? The white paper displays
<br />
uniformity, sameness, identical to properties of balance i.e., balance
<br />
of color, neutrality, equilibrium. Such are real and plainly observed
<br />
properties, not metaphysical. We nullify the distinction and form of
<br />
writing on paper (A. Nothing) in response to an observation of
<br />
something else (physical uniformity).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your concept of _nonexistence_ would then be a metaphysical null
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pointer. Attributing either concept some kind of &quot;existence&quot; is major
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphysical error IMHO.
</em><br />
<br />Beyond the argument that nonexistence cannot &quot;be&quot;, we can recognize
<br />
that the term nonexistence attempts to meaningfully reference or
<br />
identify an assumed potential that itself has no meaning. If I say non-
<br />
white I am referring to some other color, off white. If I draw or
<br />
metaphorically refer to an arrow, the arrow points to something, such
<br />
defines the meaningfulness of &quot;arrow&quot;. What is a &quot;metaphysical null
<br />
pointer&quot; pointing to? Nonexistence? Something outside of the realm of
<br />
meaning? Such is not a meaningful statement or reference as there
<br />
aren't &quot;somethings&quot; outside of meaning. Nonexistence, metaphysical
<br />
null pointer, non-being, meaninglessness...any attempt to refer to
<br />
that which has no meaning commits a semantic error. What has no
<br />
meaning? Nonexistence or non-meaning cannot be referenced or pointed
<br />
in any use of meaning. It is a fundamental mistake simply to refer to
<br />
nonexistence, since the concept has no meaning whatsoever. Doing so is
<br />
merely a trick of language, a misnomer, a null pointer that isn't a
<br />
null pointer. We can and only refer to actual properties of nature or
<br />
real nothings: a nullification of form, a uniformity, sameness,
<br />
symmetry. Confusing nothing and nonexistence is thus is a major
<br />
&quot;physical&quot; error, albeit a very common one.
<br />
<a href="http://everythingforever.com/ywexist.htm">http://everythingforever.com/ywexist.htm</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It isn't a cancellation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; properties or existence, it is a unification or synthesis into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; single form, which we see as nothing. Cook everything in the frig
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; together and you end up with one thing with far fewer properties. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; property-less &quot;one&quot; in mathematics is zero.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These are all features of language. I recommend Niiniluoto's &quot;Critical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Scientific Realism&quot; how to resolve these issues - indeed, how they have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been resolved through diligent work of many philosophers (that does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean that there is no disagreement anymore ;-))
</em><br />
I'd rather hear what of Niiniluoto you are referring to over a
<br />
reference to many esteemed philosophers. Eliminating the confusion
<br />
between nonexistence and real properties is made in defense of
<br />
scientific realism and actually even ends the debate.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; converging toward an infinitely small value. What we are doing is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fragmenting zero, we are slicing it up into parts, and since our...
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You seem to have a certain preconception of what a number is; or at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least develop a conception which one must not naturally share.
</em><br />
<br />Symmetry math in no way effects the concept of number in classical
<br />
mathematics, instead it offers another way of seeing the same physical/
<br />
mathematical reality without finitivity or abstraction. However,
<br />
symmetry math is not disconnected from classical math. Our present
<br />
conclusion that the sum of all reals is indefinite is incorrect, made
<br />
in defense of classical math. In evaluation of the question, is zero
<br />
the sum of all reals?, if we don't preconceive the value of zero, and
<br />
genuinely consider zero as the sum of all reals based upon x + -x = 0,
<br />
then we are moved into the domain of symmetry math. We cannot say the
<br />
sum of all reals is only indefinite, or the sum of all physical things
<br />
is only an indefinite infinity, the sums are indefinite in cmath and
<br />
&quot;zero&quot; in smath.
<br />
<br />Where the finitivity of cmath has led many to doubt the Universe is
<br />
infinite, smath and seeing the two types of order, grouping and
<br />
symmetry, reveals the interdependent relationship between finitivity
<br />
and infinity.
<br />
<a href="http://everythingforever.com/st_math.htm">http://everythingforever.com/st_math.htm</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; high symmetry internally while relative to zero they are perfect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; asymmetry) and time evolves towards a whole other kind of order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (unity, balance, perfect symmetry) which is actually the infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suppose you do not mean the heat death of the universe. But what would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perfect symmetry be but heat death?
</em><br />
<br />Good, yes I DO mean the heat death of the universe, not the heat death
<br />
scenario where the universe expands endlessly without ever reaching
<br />
zero, rather a big rip type of future where time reaches a common zero
<br />
for mass, density, temperature, energy, gravity, volume, and time,
<br />
i.e., maximum entropy, equilibrium, symmetry (not maximum disorder).
<br />
Caldwell also describes the end of accelerating expansion as the
<br />
ultimate singularity. Maximum heat/energy is the pendulum swung all
<br />
the way to one side, to imbalance. Energy is a measurement or quantity
<br />
of improbability, the improbability of imbalance over balance. Entropy
<br />
always increases due to the improbability of imbalance over balance,
<br />
not the improbability of order over disorder (http://
<br />
everythingforever.com/st_order5.htm). Balance is a very powerful kind
<br />
of order, and each day in an expanding universe we move increasingly
<br />
nearer to the balance of zero and perfect symmetry. What would perfect
<br />
symmetry be? The default setting of reality, the inevitability of
<br />
being. What is classic physical reality? The fragmentations of zero,
<br />
the internal boundaries and differentations (+x, -x).
