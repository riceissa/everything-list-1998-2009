<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;book in order to make it seem more unlikely, in fact there are 970,200

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the Heinlein example, you wouldn't have chosen the precise gestalt of

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;In two words: Conclusions first.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Can you really offer no scientific procedure to evaluate Heinlein's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;story?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;At the cookie jar level, can you at least grudgingly admit that the word 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Szilard&quot; sure looks like &quot;Silard&quot;?  Sounds like it too.  Or is that a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;coincidence as well?  What are the odds.  Should be calculable--how many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;stories written in 1939 include the names of Los Alamos scientists in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;conjunction with the words &quot;bomb&quot; , &quot;uranium. . .&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;You're shaking your head.  This, I assume is already a done deal, for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;And that, in my view, is the heart of the problem.  Rather than swallow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;hard and look at this in a non-biased fashion, you seem to be glued to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;the proposition that (1) it's intractable or (2) it's not worth analyzing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;because the answer is obvious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I think you misunderstood what I was arguing in my previous posts. If you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;look them over again, you'll see that I wasn't making a broad statement 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;about the impossibility of estimating the probability that this event 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;would have happened by chance, I was making a specific criticism of *your* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;method of doing so, where you estimate the probability of the particular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;gestalt&quot; of Szilard/lens/beryllium/uranium/bomb, rather than trying to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;estimate the probability that a story would anticipate *any* possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;gestalt associated with the Manhattan Project. By doing this, you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;incorporating hindsight knowledge of Heinlein's story into your choice of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the &quot;target&quot; whose probability you want to estimate, and in general this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;will always lead to estimates of the significance of a &quot;hit&quot; which are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;much too high. If you instead asked someone with no knowledge of of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Heinlein's story to come up with a list of as many possible words 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;associated with the Manhattan Project that he could think of, then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;estimated the probability that a story would anticipate *any* combination 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of words on the list, then your method would not be vulnerable to this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;criticism (it might be flawed for other reasons, but I didn't address any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of these other reasons in my previous posts).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Good starting premise.  But words have meaning, and while &quot;the sun also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rises&quot; may be interpreted to presage the bomb, it in fact is about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bullfighting.  No nukes there.
</em><br />
<br />My example had nothing to do with nukes, it was just about the fact that 
<br />
Hemingway's book title &quot;anticipated&quot; three of the words on my random list of 
<br />
100 words.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Heinlein's story is clearly about energy being derived from uranium--*and* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has the name &quot;Silard.&quot;  These can not be compared with random number 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;associations, simply because these words involve more information.  To use 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a crude example, in the science community the name &quot;Szilard&quot; conjures up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one prime association.
</em><br />
<br />This is a complete non sequitur--the fact that the words have meaning has 
<br />
nothing to do with calculating the probability that someone like Heinlein 
<br />
would guess them by chance (similarly, in my example it wouldn't really make 
<br />
a difference if the 100 words were part of a meaningful poem rather than 
<br />
being selected at random). The point of the analogy is just that there are 
<br />
lots of other words associated with the Manhattan Project ('Oppenheimer', 
<br />
'mushroom', 'fat man', etc.), words which of course all have meaning too, 
<br />
and that calculating the probability of the *particular* words 
<br />
&quot;Szilard/lens/uranium/etc.&quot; appearing in a story is not legitimate because 
<br />
that choice of target is completely based on your hindsight knowledge of 
<br />
Heinlein's story. You should instead calculate the probability that a story 
<br />
would contain *any* combination of meaningful words associated with the 
<br />
Manhattan project. This is exactly analogous to the fact that in my example, 
<br />
you should have been calculating the probability that *any* combination of 
<br />
words from the list of 100 would appear in a book title, not the probability 
<br />
that the particular word combination &quot;sun&quot;, &quot;also&quot;, and &quot;rises&quot; would 
<br />
appear.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Look over the analogy I made in my last post again:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Suppose you pick 100 random words out of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;dictionary, and then notice that the list contains the words &quot;sun&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;also&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and &quot;rises&quot;...as it so happens, that particular 3-word &quot;gestalt&quot; is also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;part of the title of a famous book, &quot;the sun also rises&quot; by Hemingway. Is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;this evidence that Hemingway was able to anticipate the results of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;word-selection through ESP? Would it be fair to test for ESP by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;calculating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the probability that someone would title a book with the exact 3-word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;gestalt &quot;sun, also, rises&quot;? No, because this would be tailoring the choice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of gestalt to Hemingway's book in order to make it seem more unlikely, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;fact there are 970,200 possible 3-word gestalts you could pick out of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of 100 possible words, so the probability that a book published earlier
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;would contain *any* of these gestalts is a lot higher than the probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;it would contain the precise gestalt &quot;sun, also, rises&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To repeat, Heinlein's story is about uranium energy, the possibility of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;factory blowing up, etc.  The context is fairly clear.  Hemingway's story 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is about Spain, bullfighting and affairs of the heart.  No nukes there.
</em><br />
<br />I thought it was pretty clear that my analogy was about general issues 
<br />
relating to calculations of probabilities, it wasn't meant to have anything 
<br />
to do with nukes specifically.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;To simplify things even further, let's say you simply make a list of ten 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;random numbers from 1 to 100, and before you make the list I make the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;prediction &quot;the list will contain the numbers 23 and 89&quot;. If it turns out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;that those two numbers are indeed on your list, what is the significance 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of this result as evidence for precognition on my part? Your method would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;be like ignoring the other 8 numbers on the list and just finding the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;probability that I would hit the precise target of &quot;23, 89&quot; by chance, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;which (assuming order doesn't matter) would be only about a 1 in 5025 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;shot, if my math is right. But the probability that both the numbers I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;guess will be *somewhere* on the list of ten is significantly higher--I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;get that the probability of this would be about 1 in 121. So if this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;experiment is done in many alternate universes, then if in fact I have no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;precognitive abilities, in about 1 in 121 universes, both numbers I guess 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;will happen to be on your list by luck. But then if you used the method of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;tailoring the choice of target to my guess, in each such universe you will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;conclude that I only had a 1 in 5025 chance of making that guess by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;chance. Clearly, then, you get bad conclusions if you use hindsight 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;knowledge to tailor the choice of target to what you know was actually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;guessed in this way. But it's also clear that this example is sufficiently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;well-defined that I would have no general objection to estimating the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;probability that my &quot;hit&quot; could have occurred by chance, it's just that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the correct answer is 1 in 121, not 1 in 5025.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Sorry. In the raw sense, numbers merely represent values---unless you want 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to get into that weird set of coincidences about 1/139--i.e. Enrico 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Fermi's hospital room, etc.   (And I sincerely hope you *don't*.)
</em><br />
<br />Another non-sequitur. When you talk about the probability of someone 
<br />
guessing something in advance by pure luck (ie under the null hypothesis of 
<br />
no ESP), it doesn't make a difference whether the thing he is supposed to be 
<br />
guessing is meaningful words, meaningless words, numbers, playing cards, 
<br />
Presidents, etc. (unless the nature of the thing is such that even without 
<br />
ESP, he can narrow down the options somehow by using information available 
<br />
to him--but there was no information available to Heinlein at the time that 
<br />
would allow him to reasonably anticipate that a name like &quot;Szilard&quot; was any 
<br />
more likely to be associated with a nuclear bomb than any other name).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Again, my concern is that scientists are too willing to prejudge something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;before diving into it.
</em><br />
<br />OK, but this is a tangent that has nothing to do with the issue I raised in 
<br />
my posts about the wrongness of selecting the target (whose probability of 
<br />
guessing you want to calculate) using hindsight knowledge of what was 
<br />
actually guessed. If you don't want to discuss this specific issue then say 
<br />
so--I am not really interested in discussing the larger issue of what the 
<br />
&quot;correct&quot; way to calculate the probability of the Heinlein coincidences 
<br />
would be, I only wanted to talk about this specific way in which *your* 
<br />
method is obviously wrong. Like I said before, any method that could be 
<br />
invented by someone who didn't know in advance about Heinlein's story would 
<br />
avoid this particular mistake, although it might suffer from other flaws.
