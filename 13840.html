<br />
Objective values are NOT specifications of what agents SHOULD do.
<br />
They are simply explanatory principles.  The analogy here is with the
<br />
laws of physics.  The laws of physics *per se* are NOT descriptions of
<br />
future states of matter.  The descriptions of the future states of
<br />
matter are *implied by* the laws of physics, but the laws of physics
<br />
themselves are not the descriptions.  You don't need to specify future
<br />
states of matter to understand the laws of physics.  By analogy, the
<br />
objective laws of morality are NOT specifications of optimization
<br />
targets.  These specifications are *implied by the laws* of morality,
<br />
but you can understand the laws of morality well without any knowledge
<br />
of optimization targets.
<br />
<br />Thus it simply isn't true that you need to precisely specify an
<br />
optimization target ( a 'goal') for an effective agent (for instance
<br />
an AI).  Again, consider the analogy with the laws of  physics.
<br />
Imperfect knowledge of the laws of physics, doesn't prevent scientists
<br />
from building scientific tools to better understand the laws of
<br />
physics.   This is because the laws of physics are explanatory
<br />
principles, NOT direct specifications of future states of matter.
<br />
Similarly, an agent (for instance an AI)  does not require a precisely
<br />
specified goal , since imperfect knowledge of objective laws of
<br />
morality is sufficient to produce behaviour which leads to more
<br />
accurate knowledge.  Again, the  objective laws of morality are NOT
<br />
optimization targets, but explanatory principles.
<br />
<br />The other claim of the objective value sceptics was that proposed
<br />
objective values can't be empirically tested.  Wrong.  Again, the
<br />
misunderstanding stems from the mistaken idea that objective values
<br />
would be optimization targets.  They are not.  They are, as explained,
<br />
explanatory principles.  And these principles CAN be tested.  The test
<br />
is the extent to which these principles can be used to understand
<br />
agent motivations - in the sense of emotional reactions to social
<br />
events.  If an agent experiences a negative emotional reaction, mark
<br />
the event as 'agent sees it as bad'.  If an agent experience a
<br />
positive emotional reaction, mark the event as 'agent sees it as
<br />
good'.  Different agents have different emotional reactions to the
<br />
same event, but that doesn't mean there isn't a commonality averaged
<br />
across many events and agents .  A successful 'theory of objective
<br />
values' would abstract out this commonality to explain why agents
<br />
experienced generic negative or positive emotions to generic events.
<br />
And this would be *indirectly* testable by empirical means.
<br />
<br />Finally, the proof that objective values exist is quite simple.
<br />
Without them, there simply could be no explanation of agent
<br />
motivations.  A complete physical description of an agent is NOT an
<br />
explanation of the agent's teleological properties (ie the agent
<br />
motivations).  The teleological properties of agents (their goals and
<br />
motivations) simply are not physical.  For sure, they are dependent on
<br />
and reside in physical processes, but they are not identical to these
<br />
physical processes.  This is because physical causal processes are
<br />
concrete, where as teleological properties cannot be measured
<br />
*directly* with physical devices (they are abstract)  .
<br />
<br />The whole basis of the scientific world view is that things have
<br />
objective explanations.  Physical properties have objective
<br />
explanations (the laws of physics).  Teleological properties (such as
<br />
agent motivations) are not identical to physical properties.
<br />
Something needs to explain these teleological properties.  QED
<br />
objective 'laws of teleology' (objective values) have to exist.
<br />
<br />What forms would objective values take?  As explained, these would NOT
<br />
be 'optimization targets' (goals or rules of the form 'you should do
<br />
X').  They couldn't be, because ethical rules differ according to
<br />
culture and  are made by humans.
<br />
<br />What they have to be are inert EXPLANATORY PRINCIPLES, taking the
<br />
form:  'Beauty has abstract properties A B C D E F G'.  'Liberty has
<br />
abstract properties A B C D E F G' etc etc.  None the less, as
<br />
explained, these abstract specifications would still be amenable to
<br />
indirect empirical testing to the extent that they could be used to
<br />
predict agent emotional reactions to social events.
