HM:
<br />
&#x2026;consciousness is just one way of interpreting
<br />
the functioning of a brain: it is a complex and observer-dependent
<br />
attribution like beauty, not a simple physical property like gravity.
<br />
<br />SLP: Consciousness in its known forms is a property of brains, which are
<br />
physical systems.  Therefore it can be reduced to a description in
<br />
purely physical terms, which has nothing whatever to do with an
<br />
&quot;observer.&quot;  The term &quot;observer&quot;, incidentally, is a very bad one.  In
<br />
EVERY physical situation, it can be replaced with a wholly neutral term
<br />
such as &quot;registering device&quot; or &quot;recording device&quot;.
<br />
<br />HM
<br />
So &quot;you&quot; (accepting &quot;your&quot; existence for the sake of argument!) believe
<br />
you are conscious.
<br />
But for all that, it is an arbitrary attribution, and doesn't
<br />
invalidate the position of my super-alien, who understands your
<br />
construction and function precisely, and can predict and affect
<br />
your behavior much better than I (or you!) can, and has no need to
<br />
attribute a fuzzy, made-up psychological concept like consciousness
<br />
to interact effectively with you.  The alien finds plain, unadorned
<br />
physics a much more satisfactory way to interpret your functioning.
<br />
<br />SLP:
<br />
This is absolutely correct.  Only WE will be the &quot;super-alien&quot;. 
<br />
Sometime in the 21st century brain function will be fully understood in
<br />
purely physical terms.  Further, in the 21st century also (as your
<br />
excellent books point out) conscious computers and robots will make
<br />
their appearance.  Whether we will still use the term &quot;consciousness&quot;
<br />
then is an open question, however.  I don't know whether there will be a
<br />
smooth reduction of our common and admittedly folk-psychological concept
<br />
of consciousness to strict
<br />
physics (the position called &quot;reductive materialism&quot;) or whether this
<br />
concept is so flawed that it will have to be junked completely
<br />
(&quot;eliminative materialism').  Until we actually understand how brains
<br />
work, and what we crudely call &quot;consciousness&quot; is generated, it is
<br />
simply premature to attempt an answer.
<br />
<br />HM:
<br />
In fact, I think our experience of time is also a subjective
<br />
attribution tied up in the way our conscious self-defines.
<br />
<br />SLP:
<br />
No, time is something purely physical.  However, an &quot;anthropic&quot; version
<br />
of what you are saying is wholly consistent with this.  This is clear by
<br />
considering Gell-Mann and Hartle's (GMH) work in extending the basic
<br />
Everett picture to a full cosmological context.  GMH ideas suggest how
<br />
perceivable time evolves from a quantum reality that is timeless (i.e.,
<br />
lacking a &quot;forced&quot; temporal direction) at its most fundamental level. 
<br />
In GMH, we see that a given quantum state of the universe can evolve in
<br />
many different ways.  But most of these are &quot;sterile&quot; from the point of
<br />
view of living or self-aware substructures (SASs).  Gravity causes
<br />
massive objects to clump up, but since life and informational processes
<br />
depend on thermodynamic diseqilibrium, there should be at least one
<br />
non-clumpy (or smooth) temporal pole in the reality perceived by SASs. 
<br />
Two such poles (a smooth &quot;beginning&quot; and smooth &quot;end&quot;) can be calculated
<br />
to be very unlikely, so from the point of view of SASs the most probable
<br />
type of perceivable universe is one where there is a smooth beginning
<br />
and a tendency to ever-greater clumpiness.  This means that an arrow of
<br />
time can be defined, but it is an arrow that (as Paul Davies has pointed
<br />
out) is analogous to spatial symmetry-breaking.  Just as galaxies can
<br />
have rotation axes that point in different spatial directions, different
<br />
universes containing SASs can (conceivably) have different temporal
<br />
axes.  Directional time appears to be an evolved phenomenon that comes
<br />
out of broken symmetry, just as so many other aspects of fundamental
<br />
physics also come out of broken symmetry.
<br />
<br />HM:
<br />
Self-aware systems are logical constructs involving psychological terms
<br />
that can be mapped onto
<br />
any(!) physical or abstract systems, though particular observers,
<br />
because of their own perspective, will find some mappings easier to make
<br />
than others.
<br />
<br />SLP:
<br />
Self-aware systems are what they are because of their underlying
<br />
physics, period.  The computational basis of self-awareness is
<br />
instantiated in physics.  The notion of &quot;psychological terms&quot; is otiose
<br />
<br />HM:
<br />
Everett only showed that it was consistent to model a measurement
<br />
without collapse by expressing it as the superposition of 
<br />
a number of correlated observer and system states, each representing
<br />
a different measurement outcome.  I'm for that 100%: gets rid of
<br />
ill-defined collapse, and gains you many-worlds.  But he didn't
<br />
touch the question of why the decomposition should be into the
<br />
particular semi-classical alternatives we experience.  
<br />
<br />SLP:
<br />
Right.  As you point out, it takes decoherence ideas and GMH to
<br />
understand why we perceive things in the narrow, cramped, crippled,
<br />
perspectival way we do, being evolved quasiclasscial objects confined to
<br />
an effective quasiclasscial domain.
<br />
<br />HM:
<br />
After all, the wave function just goes on happily evolving in toto.  Who
<br />
needs any kind of decomposition?
<br />
<br />SLP:
<br />
Complete understanding of all branches of the universal wave function,
<br />
in a full cosmological sense, without any restrictions whatever, is a
<br />
proper goal of physical science.  With the development of adequate
<br />
computational power in the near future, there is no reason for this goal
<br />
not to be reached. There are in fact no foreseeable limits to
<br />
computational power. Malament-Hogarth space-times, relying on nothing
<br />
more than classical general relativity, actually allow explicitly
<br />
tranfinite computation.  You may already be very familiar with MH
<br />
machines.  If not, read a fascinating paper by Lucian Wischik on this at
<br />
<a href="http://www.wischik.com/lu/researcher.html">http://www.wischik.com/lu/researcher.html</a>.  It shouldn't be very long
<br />
(maybe a century or so) before we have the technology to manipulate
<br />
spacetime as a building material and constrict MH machines.  And MH
<br />
machines, giving the ability to do denumerably tranfinite computations
<br />
in finite times, are just the beginning.  Once time itself can be fully
<br />
controlled, or stepped outside of, much more still will be possible. 
<br />
Once Mind Fire (to use your wonderful term, which is both elegant and
<br />
colorful) takes off, there will be no stopping it.
<br />
<br />HM:
<br />
The chain of cause is not a pyramid, it is a circle.  You can stand on
<br />
one part of a circle and say all the rest of the circle follows
<br />
from this point.  But you can also stand elswhere on it and say
<br />
the same thing! We physical scientist types tend to think in terms of
<br />
how we evolved
<br />
under the physical laws.  But that doesn't invalidate the position
<br />
that these particular physical laws exist because they're necessary
<br />
to produce us.
<br />
<br />SLP:
<br />
The chain of cause is hierarchical, not a circle.  And in an ultimate
<br />
TOE, such as Tegmark's, physical laws exist because they CAN exist, in
<br />
the modal logical sense of consistent possibility.  SAS's  are purely
<br />
consequences, and not causes, of these laws.
<br />
<br />HM:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From what I've seen in the last few days, most of the folks on this
</em><br />
list have positions closer to mine than to yours.  In the larger
<br />
scientific world, your position is orthodoxy.  I love this list!
<br />
<br />SLP:
<br />
My &quot;position&quot; is simply the consistent application of Ockham's Razor,
<br />
which in its turn can be justified rigorously in terms of Kolmogorov
<br />
complexity theory, as Li and Vitanyi have demonstrated.  And,
<br />
unfortunately, I don't think this &quot;position&quot; is very widely followed. 
<br />
The most egregious counter-example is the fact that for many decades
<br />
Bohr's Copenhagen crackpottery was quasi-orthodoxy--and to some older
<br />
physicists, still is.  In my own field, clinical medicine (which is not
<br />
yet a real science), there are still many practitioners who, in their
<br />
arrogant primtivism, disparage a purely reductive point of view and talk
<br />
of treating the &quot;whole person,&quot; as though people were (in some vague,
<br />
undefined way) something &quot;more&quot; than physical systems.
