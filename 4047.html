<br /><br />As it stand, the comp hypothesis is only a philosophical exercise 
<br />
because it does not reproduce the same phenomenon as QM in particular 
<br />
the phenomenon of complementarity. Therefore, to establish a meaningful 
<br />
relevance between comp and QM we must show that such phenomena can be 
<br />
incorporated in comp.
<br />
<br />The following thought experiment is an attempt to illustrate how 
<br />
complementarity can be incorporated into a duplication experiment. This 
<br />
experiment raises some interesting questions regarding the relationship 
<br />
between the scientific MW and the philosopical plenitude.
<br />
<br />Thought Experiment:
<br />
<br />We are onboard the starship Enterprise, and captain James T. Kirk is 
<br />
asking Chief Engineer Scotty to beam him down planet Alpha where a large 
<br />
contigent of Klingon troops is attacking a human settlement mining 
<br />
Dilithium crystals. There is not enough military personnel aboard the 
<br />
Enterprise to engage the Klingons. Kirk comes up with a brilliant idea.
<br />
<br />Resolutely turning toward his science officer he says,  &quot;Spock!&quot; is it 
<br />
possible to set the transporter to send two or more copies of an 
<br />
original person?&quot;
<br />
<br />It has never been done captain, but there is no theoretical reason why 
<br />
it could not be done&quot; Spock replies with a puzzled look on his face. But 
<br />
that would be a brilliant way to quickly generate an army on the planet 
<br />
surface to fight the Klingons! Each copy will have to be sent to a 
<br />
slightly different location to avoid having the copies materialize 
<br />
inside each other. But this is not a problem. This can be done by 
<br />
setting a grid on the planet's surface and set the transporter to send 
<br />
each copy to a different point of the grid.
<br />
<br />&quot;Scotty,&quot; Kirk says, could you please modify the transporter to send a 
<br />
thousand copies of myself to the planet's surface. Set up a 1024 point 
<br />
grid on the planet's surface exactly centered at a Latitude of 32° 44' N 
<br />
&nbsp;and a Longitude of 117° 10' W. I want each point of the grid to be 
<br />
spaced by approximately one meter so I won't bump into myself. Send me 
<br />
to the center of the grid and all the copies to the other points of the 
<br />
grid.
<br />
<br />&quot;What you're asking me is impossible, Captain&quot; exclaims Scotty. &quot;The 
<br />
transporter will not let me do this!&quot; I can't specify which of you is 
<br />
the copy and which is the real you! The noise level in the transporter 
<br />
is so low that the copies will be as good as the original, and there 
<br />
will be no way to tell which is the copy and which is the original. 
<br />
There is one more restriction. It's the grid. I can't make the grid any 
<br />
size or shape that you want.
<br />
<br />&quot;Why can't the grid be any size or shape?&quot; responds Kirk. Explain yourself!
<br />
<br />&quot;Excuse me captain&quot; interjects Spock, can I please answer for Scotty?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;By all means&quot; Spock, Kirk replies, but make it short!
<br />
<br />&quot;It's actually very simple.&quot; Spock explains, the transporter has a beam 
<br />
width which is determined by the transporter's antenna. Since our 
<br />
distance to the planet is comparatively large, the transporter beam 
<br />
intersects the planet's surface over an area approximately 6.6257 square 
<br />
miles. Changing the shape of the antenna will result in changing the 
<br />
shape of the grid. The grid can be circular, ellipsoidal, square, or 
<br />
rectangular. You can pick any shape you want. However, the area of the 
<br />
beam intersecting the planet is a constant. It must remain at 6.6257 
<br />
square kilometers.  Thus if the grid forms an elongated rectangle with 
<br />
100 to 1 proportions  (25.74x0.2574=6.6257), any one copy of you may 
<br />
find itself anywhere within that surface up to 25.74 kilometers from 
<br />
another.
<br />
<br />Spock! Are you telling me that my location on the planet surface will be 
<br />
indeterminate?
<br />
<br />Yes Captain. And there is not much you can do about it, except to change 
<br />
the shape of the gird but the overall grid area must remain equal to 
<br />
6.6257 square kilometers. For the simple case of a rectangular grid, the 
<br />
indeterminacy in your  x and y position is complementary. Consider 
<br />
yourself lucky that this positional uncertainty is only confined to the 
<br />
surface of the panet and not to three dimensions. Some of your copies 
<br />
might have found themselves transported into solid rock or 10000 feet 
<br />
above ground.
<br />
<br />&quot;Thank you Mr. Spock.&quot;
<br />
<br />Positioning himself in a transporter Kirk orders, &quot;Scotty energize!&quot; and 
<br />
he is gone to fight his battle.
<br />
<br />The end of the story is left to the reader to imagine how the thousand 
<br />
copies of Kirk are transported to the planet, defeats the Klingons and 
<br />
then, in the end, how the copies decide which ones will commit Hara Kiri 
<br />
and which one will be allowed to go back to the Enterprise.
<br />
<br />End of Thought Experiment
<br />
<br />Caveat
<br />
I am well aware that there is a contradiction if the transporter antenna 
<br />
can resolve a single point of the grid to better than 1 meter square but 
<br />
cannot resolve the whole grid to better than 6.6257 square kilometers. 
<br />
Let's assume that this is due to the peculiarities of the transporter 
<br />
design: because of the very high power levels, the transporter makes use 
<br />
of cosmic string segments to connect each of the grid point to the 
<br />
transporter antenna. Thus, a single cosmic string is attached to a a 
<br />
single grid point and can therefore provide a high resolution for the 
<br />
point. However, the antenna which is used to control the bundle of 
<br />
strings has a resolution of 6.6257 square kilometers. :-)
<br />
<br />Questions
<br />
This thought experiment, attempt to provide a model of how MW relates to 
<br />
the Comp hypothesis. Many questions arise.
<br />
1) Why is it that the Plenitude is not directly accessed by QM as 
<br />
explained by comp. Why is there a need for an intermediate MW 
<br />
characterized by complementarity?
<br />
2) Why is complementarity two-dimensional? Could it be 
<br />
three-dimentional?  or higher?
<br />
3) Is the two-dimensionality of complementarity fact-like? Are there 
<br />
other worlds in the Plenitude which have a complementarity with a higher 
<br />
dimensionality?
<br />
4) Is the MW only one instance in the Plenitude? How many levels do we 
<br />
have to go from the scientifically determined MW to the philosophically 
<br />
determined Plenitude?
<br />
5) Is complementarity anthropically necessary?
<br />
<br />This is only a feable attempt in the generation of a physical model to 
<br />
relate comp to the MW. I hope that we can improve on it through our 
<br />
discussions.
