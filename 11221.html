<br />COLIN HALES:
<br />
Yay!.... someone 'got' my little dialogue!
<br />
<br />The point is that scientists are actually ALL tacit solipsists. The only
<br />
way a solipsist can exist is to outwardly agree with the massive
<br />
confabulation they appear to inhabit whilst inwardly maintaining the only
<br />
'real truth'. There's no external reality...It's not real!...so being
<br />
duplicitous is OK.
<br />
<br />But to go on being a tacit solipsist affirmed by inaction: not admitting
<br />
consciouness itself of actually caused by something...is equivalent to an
<br />
inward belief of Bishop Berkeley-esque magical intervention on a massive
<br />
scale without actually realising it. The whole delusion is maintained by a
<br />
belief in an 'objective-view' that makes it seem like we're directly
<br />
accessing an external world when we are not - it's all mediated by MIND,
<br />
which we deny by not admitting it to be evidence of anything.... and
<br />
around we go.... the whole picture is self consistent and inherently
<br />
deluded and ultimately not honest. This is the state of science.... the
<br />
last 2 paragraphs of the latest version of my little monologue are as
<br />
follows:
<br />
<br />where:
<br />
CASE (a) world: Virtual solipsist world. In this world I accept my mind as
<br />
conclusive proof supporting continued fervent adherence to the belief in a
<br />
magical fabricator.
<br />
<br />CASE (b) world: In this world I let a real external world be responsible
<br />
for all phenomenal mirrors. Concsiousness is held as proof of a separately
<br />
described underlying natural world, totally compatible with normally
<br />
traditional empirical science of appearances _within_ consciousness.
<br />
<br />============================
<br />
&quot;If I am right to be a solipsist scientist I live in the universe of the
<br />
magical fabricator, forced to play a pretend life ‘as-if’ there is a real
<br />
external world with fictitious scientific colleagues, all doing the same
<br />
thing. What is the reality of my life as a scientist telling me? I look
<br />
around myself and what do I see universal evidence of? The world I
<br />
actually live in is world (a). This evidence acts in support of my
<br />
solipsism. No scientist anywhere has, for any reason other than
<br />
accidentally, ever looked at systems producing worlds with scientists in
<br />
them complete with minds inside it, built of it. The world I actually live
<br />
in is the world of the 'as-if' ficticious objective view where scientist
<br />
believe without justification that they are literally describing the
<br />
natural world, and not how it appears to them. Indeed when someone tries
<br />
to describe an underlying world they the scientific world snaps back,
<br />
declares the attempt irrelevant, empirically unsupportable and therefore
<br />
unscientific metaphysics....consistent with an implicit outward
<br />
methodological denial of mind.
<br />
<br />But if I am wrong to be a solipsist, then the evidence paints a very odd
<br />
picture of science. In this bizarre world, ‘objective’ scientists
<br />
outwardly all act ‘as-if’ an external world exists yet scientists are
<br />
actually virtual solipsists outwardly acting ‘as-if’ there is no such
<br />
thing as mind whilst being totally reliant on their mind to do science and
<br />
also unaware that is the case. And, like me, being in methodological
<br />
denial of their own mind, are tacitly affirming belief in a magical
<br />
fabricator through a cultural omission of paying due attention to
<br />
reviewing their own scientific evidence system. Scientists in this world
<br />
will go on forever correlating appearances within their denied phenomenal
<br />
mirrors and never get to do science on phenomenal mirrors. Which one to
<br />
choose? Perhaps I’ll stay where the fictitious money is… in the land of
<br />
the virtual magical fabricator…and keep quiet.&quot;
<br />
======================
<br />
<br />I'm done with yet another paper. This ..place... I have reached in
<br />
depicting science I have reached from so many different perspectives now
<br />
it's almost mundane... So many I don't know where to submit them any more!
<br />
.....each different approach results in the same basic conclusion....
<br />
science is structurally flawed and never questions itself - there's never
<br />
any science done on science - since when did we earn the right to be one
<br />
corner of the natural world immune from scientific method? Is this a club
<br />
or a professional discipline? The current state of science - complete
<br />
failure to solve the physics of phenomenal consciousness - is a scientific
<br />
prediction of the state of science with the current virtual-solipsistic
<br />
belief stystem. - that is what science done on science tells you. We
<br />
scientists are the evidence....(except me, of course... I dissent!!! Long
<br />
and hard!!!)
<br />
