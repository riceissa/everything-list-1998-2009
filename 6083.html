<br />
It is true that there are some physical systems for which we can
<br />
predict the future state without calculating all intermediate states.
<br />
Periodic systems will fall into this category if we can figure out
<br />
analytically what the period is.  But there are other systems where
<br />
this is thought to be impossible; for example, chaotic systems.
<br />
<br />Chaotic systems are ones whose future behavior is sensitively dependent
<br />
on the current state.  Making even an infinitisimal change to the current
<br />
state will cause massive changes in the future.  I don't think it would be
<br />
possible with any computational model to predict the state of a chaotic
<br />
system far in the future without computing intermediate states.
<br />
<br />My guess is that consciousness as we know it is inherently chaotic.
<br />
It seems like small changes to our beliefs and knowledge can lead to
<br />
large changes in behavior.  So often we experience being torn between
<br />
alternate courses of action, where the tiniest change could tip us from
<br />
one choice to the other.
<br />
<br />Neural behavior is inherently chaotic as well.  Neurons are believed to
<br />
sum the recent activity levels on their synapses and when this exceeds a
<br />
threshold, the neuron suddenly and catastrophically fires a nerve impulse.
<br />
It then goes through a refractory period (about 1 millisecond) in which it
<br />
is unable to fire again until it has &quot;rested&quot; and regathered its strength,
<br />
at which point it goes back to summing its inputs.  If we plotted the net
<br />
input strength to the neuron, it would be an irregular line with lots of
<br />
little jags and bumps, and whenever it manages to exceed a certain level,
<br />
there is a sudden firing.  Probably we would often see the stimulation
<br />
level approach that threshold line and fall back, not quite meeting the
<br />
threshold, until we just reach it and another nerve impulse is fired.
<br />
This kind of sensitive dependence on initial conditions is a recipe for
<br />
mathematical chaos.
<br />
<br />Of course, this is not a rigorous proof, and it is conceivable that
<br />
consciousness is not in fact chaotic even though it subjectively
<br />
seems so, and even though its subtrate (the brain's neural net) is.
<br />
Nevertheless it would be almost unbelievably bizarre to imagine that
<br />
you could calculate the mental state of an 80 year old man, with all
<br />
the memories of a lifetime, without actually calculating the experiences
<br />
that led to those memories.
<br />
<br />In Egan's story, the computer is supposed to calculate his conscious
<br />
experience of the 10th second first, then the 9th second, and so on.
<br />
Suppose in the first (subjective) second he stutters on saying the number
<br />
&quot;one&quot;, out of nervousness.  Then the memory of that stutter will be
<br />
present as he recites all the other numbers.  Perhaps he will enunciate
<br />
them more carefully in order to compensate.  So when the system calculates
<br />
that 10th second, it has to know what happened during the first second.
<br />
Those events will be latent in his memories during the 10th second, and
<br />
may influence his behavior.  His conscious reactions to earlier events
<br />
are in his memory at later times.  So I don't see how it could possibly
<br />
work to calculate the 10th second first.
<br />
<br />Two other minor points: in Egan's story, this experiment was not being
<br />
done on &quot;dust&quot;.  It was done on an ordinary computer.  It was the result
<br />
of this experiment, which is of course that there was no subjective
<br />
awareness of the time scrambling, which was supposed to lend credence
<br />
to the dust hypothesis.
<br />
<br />Second, quantum computers cannot efficiently solve NP complete problems,
<br />
or at least they are not known to be able to.  It's possible that ordinary
<br />
computers can solve NP complete problems; no one has ever proven that
<br />
they can't (this is the famous P = NP problem of computer science).
<br />
And if it turns out that ordinary computers can handle them efficiently,
<br />
then of course quantum computers will be able to as well, since they
<br />
are a superset of ordinary computers.  But if it turns out that P !=
<br />
NP and ordinary computers can't solve NP problems efficiently, there is
<br />
no evidence that the situation will be different for quantum computers.
