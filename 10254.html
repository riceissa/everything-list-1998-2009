</em><br />
<br />Hi George
<br />
<br />I think I agree with this.  It could correspond with what I'm trying to
<br />
model in terms of FP1 etc. Perhaps it might be expressed as:
<br />
<br />First person perception of the world comes about when our own
<br />
observation and existence are mutually contingent
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Third person perception comes about in situations when our own existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not contingent on our observation.
</em><br />
<br />Now here I'm not so clear.  I understand what you mean in terms of the
<br />
quantum suicide.  The observers observe the deceased version of the
<br />
suicide and he does not, but here surely it is *their* observations
<br />
that are relevant, and these are first person by your definition. The
<br />
suicide doesn't get to have any further 'observations' on this branch -
<br />
not because the ontology of his dead body has magically changed out of
<br />
FP1, but because the 'observational activity' within his first-personal
<br />
domain has shut down.  To make this perhaps intuitively clearer,
<br />
suppose it turns out that although he is definitively 'dead' by the
<br />
medical standards of the observers, Mr Spock from Star Trek turns up
<br />
and resuscitates him with advanced technology.  In this case, he starts
<br />
to 'observe' again, but once more we need posit no change of ontology.
<br />
<br />In sum, I'm not clear what sort of observation is *not* contingent on
<br />
our existence, except someone else's observation, and so far as I can
<br />
see this is always first person by your definition.  Do you simply mean
<br />
to define any observation not involving ourselves as 'third person'
<br />
from our point-of-view?  OK but I don't see where it gets us. We appear
<br />
to agree that all observations are first person from the point-of-view
<br />
of the observer, IMO in virtue of instantiation in a primitive first
<br />
person context (FP1g). All representations of such observations in the
<br />
'shareable knowledge base' (SKB) of an FP1i person are likewise
<br />
instantiated in this context with the rest of his model of the world,
<br />
and are flexibly metaphorised as 'third' (TP) or 'first' person (but
<br />
importantly in this latter case FP2, as I discuss below - the
<br />
representation of 'my arm' is not my arm).  An example of a flexible
<br />
re-metaphorisation is that I may shift the representation of 'my arm'
<br />
from FP2 to TP if it is amputated.
<br />
<br />Thus third person in my schema refers exclusively to the relata
<br />
comprising the content of a first person observation (i.e. one that is
<br />
contingent on our existence).  Consequently all observations entail
<br />
third person relata, but both the observations and the relata are
<br />
exclusively instantiated in a first person context.  The structure of
<br />
the context *comprises* the third person relational model, which
<br />
through inter-personal communication (instantiation of the SKB) is thus
<br />
mutually interrogable on a precisely equal epistemological footing by
<br />
ourselves or others.  This is the third person world which is the
<br />
content of our experience and discourse, and its referential
<br />
correspondence with the remainder of the FP1g context could be modelled
<br />
semantically as a network of co-varying nodes.  Those 'nodes' modelled
<br />
within the SKB as other 'first persons' I term FP2i to crucially
<br />
distinguish them from embodied FP1i first persons.  FP2i are thus
<br />
co-varying third person analogs of embodied or instantiated first
<br />
persons.  I believe that terminological confusion around these issues
<br />
leads directly to many conceptual problems.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; More generally, one can assume that the laws of physics themselves are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contingent on the observer -ie. the world is being destroyed every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nanoseconds or faster when it diverges into MW branches not supporting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life. - the only worlds we can observe are those worlds upholding those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical laws supporting life.
</em><br />
<br />Do you mean:
<br />
<br />The observer is contingent on the laws of physics (i.e. there can be
<br />
observation only where the laws of physics permit this)?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;According to this hypothesis our primary
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perception of the world is first person.
</em><br />
<br />I agree that perception is first person, and as I have already said I
<br />
don't understand what could be meant by an observation not contingent
<br />
on our existence, except that it is some other observer's (first
<br />
person) observation.  However I'm not sure that your hypothesis
<br />
replaces my schema. What you appear to be saying is that we can't
<br />
observe situations where either we're not present or alive to observe
<br />
(but in either case someone else could be observing), or situations
<br />
which in their nature cannot sustain observers (in which case nobody is
<br />
observing).  I would agree with all of this, but I would like you to
<br />
comment further on the implications for the basic ontology of existence
<br />
per se - e.g. what you consider 'real' as opposed to metaphorical
<br />
distinctions of ontology, which is what my schema attempts to address.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perception is first person. Witnesses to the experiment are likely to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see the subject die and their point of view is third person. Thus first
