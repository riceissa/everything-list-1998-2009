Hi,
<br />
<br />I give the solution of the first of the last exercises.
<br />
<br /><br />I reason aloud. I go slowly for those who did not get some math  
<br />
courses, or just forget them.  I cannot stress the importance of the  
<br />
notion of bijection in the &quot;mathematical discovery of the universal  
<br />
machine&quot; (the quote means that a nuance will be added here).
<br />
<br />Counting is not so important. Th exercise motivation is in to develop  
<br />
familiarity with the notion of function and bijection. Then counting  
<br />
things provides example of functions from N to N.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) count the number of bijections from a set A to itself.  (= card{x
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such that x is bijection from A to A})
</em><br />
<br /><br />This does not seem very obvious, so let us begin with the simplest  
<br />
set, for example the one which admits the shorter description when  
<br />
written in extension, that is the empty set { }.
<br />
<br />The question in this case is: count the number of bijection between  
<br />
{ } and { }.
<br />
<br />Hmm... This smells the subtle trap and it may be a good advise to  
<br />
avoid the simplest set or number. Zero and the empty set may be  
<br />
simplest in term of description but may be harder conceptually.
<br />
<br />A simple case, in this and many cases, would be a set with not much  
<br />
elements. Let us count the number of bijections from {a, b} to itself.  
<br />
i.e. the bijections from {a, b} to {a, b}.
<br />
<br />Here some beginners could have a trouble: &quot;I don't remember what is a  
<br />
bijection&quot;. Well, the exercise is obviously with notes. I am not yet  
<br />
asking to buy a webcam so that I can look if you are not cheating, all  
<br />
right?
<br />
<br />Two things can happen. Either you find the passage in your diary where  
<br />
I explain bijection with the legendary story of the humans who cannot  
<br />
count, and compare the bigness of sets by using ropes.
<br />
<br />You may remember how the farmer compare their *set* of animals,  
<br />
without being able to count. They compare two sets of animals by  
<br />
attaching a rope to ONE animal belonging to the set of your animals,  
<br />
say, and you bring that to ONE animal of your neighbor.
<br />
Three things can happen:
<br />
1) All your animals get attached to a rope, and got attached to some  
<br />
neighbor's animals, but some other animal of the neighbor are still  
<br />
freely going here and there. In this situation we say &quot;damned, the set  
<br />
of animals of my neighbor is bigger than mine&quot;.
<br />
2) All your animals get they rope, and got attached  to the neighbor's  
<br />
animals. And all neighbor's animals are attached. In this situation we  
<br />
say &quot;OK, my set of animals has the same cardinality than the set of my  
<br />
neighbor animals. Cardinality is the measure of set, when we compare  
<br />
it in this way. Now, this is the situation where a bijection exists.
<br />
3) All the neighbor's animal are attached to the rope, yet some of  
<br />
your own animals remain free. You can attach the rope to those free  
<br />
animals, but you will be unable to attach them to some neighbor  
<br />
animal, they are already all attached. In this situation you say  
<br />
nothing, because you are polite, you just let the neighbor saying  
<br />
&quot;damned, the set of animals of my neighbor is bigger than mine&quot;.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;.... Or you don't remember that story, so you consult the austere  
<br />
notes with the definition. A, B ... represent sets.
<br />
<br />A bijection between A and B is a function from A to B which is ONE-ONE  
<br />
and ONTO.
<br />
<br />And what is a function? A set of couples (x, y), x in A, y in B,  
<br />
verifying the condition that no x in A is sent on different y in B. In  
<br />
a very large sense, the element of B depend on the element of A, and  
<br />
that dependence is represented by a couple (x, y).
<br />
<br />With the farmer, the couples where made with one animal x attached by  
<br />
a rope to one animal y:  (x, y).
<br />
<br />Well let us go back to the bijections from {a, b} to {a, b}. Oh, I see  
<br />
some anxiousness can rise due to the fact that we have the same set of  
<br />
both side. Why would ever a farmer compare the bigness of its set of  
<br />
animals with the bigness of its set of animals? Is that not a pure  
<br />
mathematical absurdity?
<br />
<br />To ease the pain, in math, consists always in simplifying, so, just to  
<br />
keep the intuition provided by the farmer, let us distinguish the  
<br />
animal's neighbor, those which makes the arrival set, by different  
<br />
letters. And let us first search the bijections from {a, b} to {c, d}.  
<br />
{a, b} is the set of my animals. {c, d} is the set of animals of my  
<br />
neighbor. OK?
<br />
<br />Well I have to build a bijection, which is a set, so I have to begin  
<br />
by &quot;{&quot;, indicating I am building a set. Of course, this is implicit in  
<br />
the farmer's mind, because his goal consists in just comparing the two  
<br />
sets. But our goal is to find all bijections. So we have to be clear  
<br />
about them as mathematically represented objects, and bijections, like  
<br />
functions, have been defined or represented as sets.
<br />
<br />Now I have to choose one of my animals; let us choose a. and attach  
<br />
the rope. The description of the bijection looks like:
<br />
<br />{(a,
<br />
<br />I have to choose an animal belonging to the set of my neighbor's  
<br />
animals. Well, I have two choices: c or d. Let us choose c. The  
<br />
description of the bijection looks like:
<br />
<br />{(a, c),
<br />
<br />And then
<br />
<br />{(a, c), (b, d)}
<br />
<br />This *is* a function, which is ONTO and ONE-ONE.
<br />
<br />Is there another?
<br />
<br />Yes. I choose the other animals (cf the two choice above). But note  
<br />
already, that for the second animals I have only once choice.
<br />
<br />The other is {(a, d), (b, c)}. Is there another one? No.
<br />
<br />There are two bijections from {a, b} to {c, d}.  {(a, c), (b, d)}  and  
<br />
{(a, d), (b, c)}.
<br />
The set of bijections from {a, b} to {c, d} is the set {{(a, c), (b,  
<br />
d)}, {(a, d), (b, c)}}. This is more easy to build than to read.
<br />
<br />Now the name of the element, or even what they consists in (animals,  
<br />
numbers, letters) is not relevant OK?
<br />
<br />In particular there are as many bijection from {a, b} to {a, b} than  
<br />
from {a, b} to {c, d}. They are
<br />
<br />{(a, a), (b, b)}
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;and
<br />
<br />{(a, b), (b, a)}
<br />
<br />A bijection from A to A is called a permutation of A.   {(a, a), (b,  
<br />
b)} is called the identity permutation on {a, b}.
<br />
<br />Oh, card(A) = 02 (= A has two elements) entails that there is 2  
<br />
bijections.
<br />
<br />WE may generalize and believe that there are as many bijections from A  
<br />
to A, than there are elements in A.
<br />
<br />OK? Let us test this theory on the simpler set {a}. How many  
<br />
bijections are there from (a} to {a}. Well, there is {(a,a)}, and  
<br />
that's all. One! Our theory succeeds.
<br />
<br />If we infer that theory on { }, we may be tempted to say 0, for the  
<br />
number of bijections between { } and { }. But with a sample of two  
<br />
elements ...,  it is dangerous to infer too much quickly.
<br />
<br />Let us look at {a, b, c}. Are there three bijections? And only three  
<br />
bijections? (Well if you remember the number of function from A to B  
<br />
is card(B)^card(A), so we could be astonished our conjecture is  
<br />
tenable).
<br />
<br />And indeed, I go systematically trying to figure out how to count the  
<br />
number of bijections from A to A for a finite set A in general.
<br />
<br />Let us build a bijection from {a, b, c} to {a, b, c}.
<br />
<br />It has to be something like {(a , _) , (b,  ),   (c,  ) }. Given that  
<br />
in a set the order has no importance, so the choices of beginning by  
<br />
(a,  or by (b,  or by (c   is not relevant. But once I choose say {(a,  
<br />
the number of choice to complete the second bijection is relevant {(a,  
<br />
b) ..., will not give the same bijection that {(a, c), ...
<br />
<br />So I start with {(a,  I have three choices. Let us take c for the  
<br />
first choice, how many choices there is for the next element?
<br />
<br />Well, given that the bijective function (bijection) have to be ONE- 
<br />
ONE, you loose a possibility at each choice. So there will be three  
<br />
possibility, then 2, the 1, and the bijection is completed.
<br />
<br />So there will be 03 x 2 x 01 bijections. the number of choices are  
<br />
multiplied for the same reason that for the number of functions. Once  
<br />
a choice is made, the remaining choices are independent.
<br />
<br />Let us look
<br />
<br />{(a, a) (b, b), (c, c)}
<br />
{(a, a) (b, c), (c, b)}   choice: &quot;{(a,a) ...&quot;  multiplied by the  
<br />
bijections from {b, c} to {b, c}.
<br />
<br />{(a, b), (b, a) (c, c)}
<br />
{(a, b), (b, c) (c, a)}
<br />
<br />{(a, c), (b, a) (c, b)}
<br />
{(a, c), (b, b) (c, a)}
<br />
<br />So three elements leads to 3 x 2 x 1 bijections; that is 06 bijections.
<br />
<br />If there is n elements in the set, there will be n choices for the  
<br />
first couples, then, by the one )one condition, it will remains
<br />
(n-1) choices, then (n-2) .... up to the last 1 choice.
<br />
<br />We have a &quot;formula&quot;. if card(A) = n then then number of permutation on  
<br />
A, or of bijection from A to A, is n*(n-1)* ... 1.
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />Er, how many bijections from { } to { } ? In this case card(A) = 0.  
<br />
The formula we get does not seem to apply. What could be
<br />
<br />0*(0-1)*(0-2)*  .... * 1   ?
<br />
<br />At first sight it should be 0. Because 0*&lt;anything&gt; = 00 isn't it?    
<br />
false: 0 * any number = 0. But who could claim that the expression  
<br />
above is well determined: it is like you will never get to that &quot;1&quot;.
<br />
<br />I'm afraid we have to tackle the &quot;simplest&quot; case by reason alone,  
<br />
taking our definition seriously into account.
<br />
<br />How many bijection are there, from { } to { }?
<br />
<br />Well, bijections are sets, so we can begin {, and we have to put in  
<br />
that set couples (x, y) with x in { } and y in { }. But there is no x  
<br />
in { }, so we will not find any couples. So our set is empty, so we  
<br />
can close it directly, and the bijection looks like { }. It is the  
<br />
empty bijection. So we have find one, and only one.
<br />
<br />So the number of bijections from the empty set to the empty set is  
<br />
ONE. (For the same reason, if you remember, that the number of  
<br />
functions from { } to { } is one. Card({ }^{ }) = 1).
<br />
<br />That was the harder case.
<br />
<br />Now let us write A° for the set of permutation on A. A permutation is  
<br />
defined by a bijection from A to A.
<br />
<br />We have seen that if Card(A) = n, card(A°) = n*(n-1)*(n-2)* ... *1 if  
<br />
A is not empty, and Card(A°) = 1 if A is empty.
<br />
<br />This motivates the definition of the following function from N to N,  
<br />
called factorial.
<br />
factorial(0) = 1, and factorial(n) = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3) * ... *1, if  
<br />
is n is different from 0.
<br />
<br />Note this: if n is different from 0, for each n we have that fact(n) =  
<br />
n*fact(n).
<br />
<br />factorial is a function from N to N, so it is the following set of  
<br />
couples:
<br />
<br />{(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 6), (4, 24), (5, 120), (6, 720), (7,  
<br />
5040), (8, 40320), (9, 362880), (10, 3628800), (11, 39916800), ...}
<br />
<br />A good thing I did not ask you to give me all the bijections from a  
<br />
set from 10 elements to itself. See that if two farmer have 10 animals  
<br />
each, they is already 3628800 bijections between their two sets of  
<br />
animals.
<br />
<br />Compare with the exponential function, which send n to 2^n
<br />
<br />{(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 8), (4, 16), (5, 32), (6, 64), (7, 128),  
<br />
(8, 256), (9, 512), (10, 1024), (11, 2048), ...}
<br />
<br /><br /><br />OK?
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) describe some canonical bijection between 2^A and the powerset of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) I say that a set S is a proper subset of A if it is a subset of A,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and different from A.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     We have seen that there is a bijection between N and 2N = {0, 2,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4, 6, ...}. (see below *)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     2N is a proper subset of N.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     So we see that an infinite set can have a bijection with a proper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subset.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The question is, could that be possible for a finite set?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The bijection between N and 2N is the set {(0,0), (1,2), (2, 4), (3,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 6), (4, 8), ...}.  More schematically, if you remember the ropes:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; N          2N
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 0 ------- 0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1 --------2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2 --------4
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3 --------6
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) Be sure that you have been convinced by Brent  that there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bijection between N and NxN, and between N and NxNxN, and etc. That is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be sure there is a bijection between N and N^m for each N.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5) Key exercise for the sequel. First a definition. An alphabet A is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non empty finite set. I call its elements letter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exemple. A = {a, b, c},, B = {0, 1}.. By A+ I mean the set of finite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; words on the alphabet A. A word is a finite sequence of letters, from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some alphabet, like, on the alphabet A, aaabab, abbbbcbababcccacab,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IA+ is obviously infinite, it contains *notably* a, aa, aaa, aaaa,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aaaaa, aaaaaa, aaaaaaa, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The word &quot;word&quot; has a larger meaning in math than in natural language.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the usual alphabet {A, B, ... Z}, an expression like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; HHYUJLIFSEFGXWKKODENN is a fully respectable word.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Show that for any alphabet A, there is a bijection between N and A+
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Soon (asap, though) the proof of many theorems found by Cantor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Notably that there is NO bijection from N to N^N.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then Cantor proof will be done again and again, and again, ... in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deeper and deeper and deeper contexts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please ask any questions. It is not too late before we go in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *very* interesting matter, and very illuminating with respect to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question of the existence of universal machines, languages and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers.
