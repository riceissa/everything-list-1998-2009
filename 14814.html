2008/7/29  &lt;marc.geddes.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Point (1) there is a clear evolution to the universe. It started from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a low-entropy-density state, and is moving towards a higher-entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; density, which, remarkably, just happens to coincide with an increase
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in physical complexity with time. In the beginning the universe was in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a state with *the lowest possible* entropy. This is expressed in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws of thermodynamics and big bang cosmology. So it simply isn't true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there is no teleology (purpose) built into the universe. The laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of thermodynamics and modern cosmology (big bang theory) clearly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; express the fact that there is.
</em><br />
<br />You'll have to explain what you mean by teleogy/purpose. If you claim
<br />
that rocks roll downhill because it is their purpose to do so, that's
<br />
not using the term in a conventional way.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is the point that most haven't quite grasped - Occam's razor is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *a set of aesthetic principles* - the notion of 'simplicity' is *a set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of aesthetic principles*; Why? Because it is simply another way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying that some representations are more *elegant* than others, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the very notion of aesthetics! I repeat: the whole of science only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; works because of a set of *aesthetic principles* - a *set of values*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If all values are only subjective preferences, it would follow that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the whole of science relies on subjective preferences. But subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preferences have only existed as long as sentiments – therefore how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could physical laws have functioned before sentiments? The idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all values are subjective leads to a direct and blatant logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contradiction.
</em><br />
<br />Not necessarily. It may be that some mindless, valueless objective
<br />
quality coincidentally produces aesthetic feelings. For example, we
<br />
may find the human form beautiful, and some human forms more beautiful
<br />
than others. But that doesn't mean that there is some absolute,
<br />
objective sense in which humans are beautiful; it's just that our
<br />
minds have evolved to think this way. Similarly, if we find that some
<br />
other aspect of physical reality corresponds with what we recognise as
<br />
an aesthetic principle, this is just a contingent fact about the way
<br />
our minds work. There are plenty of things in nature which are
<br />
complicated and ugly, and they don't try to reform themselves on our
<br />
account.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Both these points are related and simply inexplicable without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appealing to objective terminal values. At the beginning of time the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe was in the simplest possible state (minimal entropy density).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why? Occam's razor is wide-ranging and pervades the whole of science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The simple is favored over the complex – that is– Occam's razor is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of aesthetic value judgments without which not a single Bayesian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result could be obtained.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *Every single Bayesian result rests on these implicit value judgments*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to set priors. It must be repeated that *not one single scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result could be obtained* without these secret (implicit) value
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; judgments which set priors, that our defenders of the Bayesian faith
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on these forums are trying to pretend are not part of science!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The secret to intelligence is aesthetics, not Bayesian math.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Initially, this statement seems preposterous, but the argument in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next paragraph is my whole point, so it merits careful reading (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paragraph is marked with a * to show this is the crux of this post):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *As regards the optimization of science, the leverage obtained from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; setting the priors (Occam's razor – aesthetics – art) is far greater
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that that obtained from logical manipulations to update probabilities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based on additional empirical data (math). Remember, the aesthetic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principles used to set the priors (Occam's razor) reduce a potentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite set of possible theories to a manageable (finite) number,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whereas laborious mathematical probability updates based on incoming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirical data (standard Bayesian theory) is only guaranteed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; converge on the correct theory after an infinite time, and even then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the reason for the convergence is entirely inexplicable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The * paragraph suggests that aesthetics is the real basis of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence, not Bayesian math, and further that aesthetic terminal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; values are objectively real.
</em><br />
<br />I've long been puzzled by the phenomenon of delusion in intelligent,
<br />
rational people who develop psychotic illness. For example, out of the
<br />
blue, someone starts to believe that their family have been replaced
<br />
by impostors. Their facility with deductive logic remains intact, and
<br />
it is tempting to try to argue with them to show that their belief is
<br />
false, but it doesn't work. The Bayes equation is:
<br />
<br />Pr(A|B) = Pr(B|A).Pr(A)/Pr(B)
<br />
A = they are impostors
<br />
B = they're acting weird
<br />
<br />The problem is that they overestimate Pr(A), the prior probability,
<br />
and underestimate Pr(B). A very dull, but sane, person can see this,
<br />
but they can't. Intelligence doesn't seem to help at all.
