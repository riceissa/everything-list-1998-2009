<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: Wei Dai &lt;weidai.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consider the following thought experiment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Two volunteers who don't know each other, Alice and Bob, are given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;temporary amnesia and placed in identical virtual environments. They are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then both presented with three buttons and told the following:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you push 1, you will lose $9
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you push 2 and you are Alice, you will win $10
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you push 2 and you are Bob, you will lose $10
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'll assume that everyone agrees that both people will push button 2.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course it depends on their utility functions, but we can assume they 
<br />
will push 2.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The paradox is what happens if we run Alice and Bob's minds on different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;substrates, so that Bob's mind has a much higher measure than Alice's. If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they apply anthropic reasoning they'll both think they're much more likely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to be Bob than Alice, and push button 1.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No paradox, but this time the choice of utility function is more 
<br />
important.  While they have amnesia, their utility functions will surely be 
<br />
different than what they usually are, since it could be a big giveaway if 
<br />
(for example) the person knows it doesn't give a hoot about Bob.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To an outside observer who cares about Bob and Alice equally, the best 
<br />
outcome _would_ be if button #1 is pressed more often in this situation.  
<br />
(Assuming the substrate would not later be switched.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you don't think this is paradoxical, suppose we repeat the choice but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with the payoffs for button 2 reversed, so that Bob wins $10 instead of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Alice, and we also swap the two minds so that Alice is running on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;substrate that generates more measure instead of Bob. They'll again both 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;push button 1. But notice that at the end both people would have been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;better off if they pushed button 2 in both rounds.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they knew during the first round that this would happen, they 
<br />
probably wouldn't press #1.  What they would have thought is equivalent to 
<br />
&quot;I'm probably Bob, and after this round I'm probably going to die while 
<br />
Alice will replace me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then look at the expected utilities.  First, assume that they place 
<br />
equal utility on Bob's and Alice's money.  Then they will press #2.  The 
<br />
expected utility of this is:
<br />
= (-10) (final measure of Bob) + (10) (final measure of Alice)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might think that the current measures of Bob and Alice (during the 
<br />
first round) should be a factor.  Although the person in round 1 is more 
<br />
likely to be Bob, it's also true that if he is Bob the effect of his action 
<br />
will be more diluted (afterwards); if she is Alice, the effect will be 
<br />
magnified.  The final measure distribution is what counts.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, they could be more &quot;selfish&quot;.  Effectively they are playing a 
<br />
prisoner's dilemma type of game where first Bob is given a move, then Alice 
<br />
is.  In this case they might both push 1, but only if they don't expect to 
<br />
interact in the future, and don't care about each other.  (And also don't 
<br />
expect to gain a bad reputation.)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still no paradox; this case is an example of game theory.  Consider the 
<br />
case where they always have the same measure and never lose memory.  They 
<br />
have the choice of 1) hurt yourself a little, or 2) hurt yourself a lot but 
<br />
help the other person by an equal amount.  They might both choose 1, but 
<br />
that's no paradox.
<br />
<br />From:  George Levy &lt;GLevy.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Erasing their memory puts a big cabosh on the meaning of who they really 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are. I could argue that Bob is not really Bob and Alice is not really 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Alice. Their identity has been reduced to a *bare* &quot;I&quot;
</em><br />
and they are actually identical!!!!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, he didn't say they were now identical.  For example, if Bob was evil 
<br />
and likes to smoke, while Alice was good and likes to yoyo, we can assume 
<br />
they still have those traits.  They just don't remember who they are or who 
<br />
has their traits.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, hardware doesn't make the man.  Nothing does, really: 
<br />
&quot;Bobness&quot; is just a loose set of traits.  This shows the hurluberlu nature 
<br />
of &quot;1st person&quot; merde.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, if you want to base your utility function on &quot;what's good for 
<br />
'you'&quot;, you will find that this means nothing.  The closest you can come is 
<br />
to place utility upon certain traits within the measure distribution that 
<br />
are based on what you remember.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most naive forms of selfishness are not really possible utility 
<br />
functions, but it is certainly easy to be _effectively_ selfish, e.g. you 
<br />
value traits which are mostly just associated with certain thoughts _highly_ 
<br />
similar to your own.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you could measure your measure you would find the measurement always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;identical no matter where, when or who you are.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that were true there would be as many white rabbits as there are 
<br />
crackpots.
