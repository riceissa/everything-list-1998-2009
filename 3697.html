This is an excellent idea Wai. I guess we look up the thread called
<br />
&quot;JOINING POST&quot; to the info.
<br />
<br />As for me, I studied mathematics and physics at an undergrad
<br />
level. Whilst still at high school, I was studying quantum mechanics
<br />
and general relativity, and started my science degree wanting to
<br />
research beyond these theories. By the time I finished my BSc, I had
<br />
decided that &quot;reductionism&quot; has gone too far, and that there was a
<br />
whole world of &quot;mesoscale&quot; or &quot;complex&quot; physics that was opening
<br />
up. As a result I moved into nonequilibrium statistical physics for my
<br />
PhD. The field of Complex Systems basically took off at this time.
<br />
<br />At age 19, I toyed with an idea (no doubt inspired by Corewars from
<br />
Martin Gardiner's column) of evolving small self-reproducing creatures
<br />
as a means of understanding evolution. By the time I had finished my
<br />
formal requirements for entering scientific research (ie a PhD), Tom
<br />
Ray had achieved this task with Tierra. So after my PhD I got into
<br />
artificial life, and I developed my own evolutionary model called
<br />
Ecolab. As a result I've taken part in some of the big intellectual
<br />
debates of the 90s in complex systems, including self-organised
<br />
criticality as an explanation of punctuationlism, complexity trends
<br />
through evolution and explanations of diversity growth during the
<br />
history of the biosphere.
<br />
<br />During the mid-90s I started musing over the MWI and the anthropic
<br />
principle, and realised that the univserse was not just some accident
<br />
of creation, but the result of an evolutionary process. These thoughts
<br />
finally culminated in my paper &quot;Evolution in the Multiverse&quot;, where
<br />
the MWI is analogous to variation in Darwin's theory of evolution, and
<br />
the Anthropic principle is analogous to selection. 
<br />
<br />Whilst riding a bicycle, I would speculate on what would be happening
<br />
in the &quot;neighbouring&quot; universes where I was a little faster or slower,
<br />
and that car that nearly missed me actually hit me and killed me. I
<br />
realised at that time I would never know, and came up with my own
<br />
formulation of what has become known as the Quantum Theory of
<br />
Immortality.
<br />
<br />About this time, David Deutsch's book Fabric of Reality appeared, which
<br />
I bought and devoured. It is truly an excellent book, although has its
<br />
failings like any work. Later, I saw the New Scientist article about
<br />
Max Tegmark, and I thought - here's someone with guts! As they say,
<br />
most of the rest is history, documented in the Everything and FOR
<br />
lists.
<br />
<br />As a result of discussions on this list, I have written a paper &quot;Why
<br />
Occams Razor&quot;, which develops these ensemble theories to the point of
<br />
deriving all the postulates of quantum mechanics, except the
<br />
correspondence principle. The paper was first written 2.5 years ago,
<br />
and is in its 3rd revision. It is very difficult to get this sort of
<br />
stuff published, but I'm perservering, because I suspect this will be
<br />
one of the most important papers I'll write.
<br />
<br />I have to say I have little time for deliberate obfuscation, whether
<br />
by excessive use of obscure verbal terms, or execessive mathematical
<br />
rigour. However, I do believe that mathematical concepts and terms are
<br />
about our only chance of comprehending and communicating this subject
<br />
area. For this reason, I am disappointed at the approach the FOR list
<br />
takes of banning all mathematical description.
<br />
<br />Relevant References:
<br />
<br />Stuart Kauffman:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Origins of Order: Self Organization and Selection in Evolution&quot;
<br />
<br />This is quite a well written book, curiously aside from the description of
<br />
Kauffman's own contribution to the field, the NK model. One problem is
<br />
that many readers of this book assume that Kauffman invented the whole
<br />
field.
