<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Everett  'Many Worlds Interpretation' of quantum physics
<br />
postulates that that all systems evolve according to the Schrödinger
<br />
equation, whereas the more conventional Copenhagen Interpretation says that
<br />
this is true until the moment of observation, at which point the equation
<br />
'collapses'.  The proposed paper examines some philosophical questions
<br />
arising from the MWI interpretation. In particular, it synthesises the
<br />
Tegmark (1997) 'quantum suicide' experiment with the Stapp (1998) analysis
<br />
of the quantum effects on calcium ions in neural synapses, to develop a
<br />
'Quantum Theory of Immortality' (QTI). 
<br />
The 'Many-Worlds' Interpretation of Quantum Physics
<br />
<br />First, a disclaimer for those new to the subject: Niels Bohr, the founder of
<br />
modern quantum theory said, &quot;Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has
<br />
not understood it&quot;. And he didn't understand the Many-Worlds Interpretation
<br />
(MWI).  The quantum mechanics (QM) presented here is quite mainstream, even
<br />
though it still seems crazy to physicists, who have no choice but to accept
<br />
it.  The major assumption I have made is to adopt Everett's (1957) MWI,
<br />
which is just one of half a dozen competing interpretations of QM. According
<br />
to various polls, MWI and the original 1927 'Copenhagen Interpretation' now
<br />
have a similar share of the votes among physicists, but many of the 'big
<br />
names' (Hawking, Feynman, Deutsch, Weinberg) are said to () have subscribed
<br />
to the MWI.
<br />
<br />The weirdness of quantum physics can be seen in the famous parallel-slit
<br />
experiment. This shows that individual photons seem to split into two
<br />
particles which can nevertheless interfere with each other as if they were
<br />
waves. The 'Copenhagen Interpretation' of the phenomena and the equations
<br />
which describe them, agreed at the 1927 Solvay conference, essentially says
<br />
that the 'wave packet' somehow associated with a particle 'collapses' when
<br />
it is observed - this necessitates a relationship between the observer's
<br />
consciousness and the particle.  The MWI, on the other hand, holds that the
<br />
equations used to predict quantum mechanical events continue to hold after
<br />
observation - it is just that all things happen simultaneously, but due to
<br />
'decoherence' we do not actually see, for example, a radioactive source both
<br />
decay and not decay.  For an explanation of how this implies parallel
<br />
universes, see Vaidman (1996). 
<br />
<br />There is one way of proving that the MWI is true and the Copenhagen and
<br />
other interpretations are wrong.  Unfortunately, the experimenter can only
<br />
prove it to himself, and never persuade anyone else of its validity.  
<br />
<br />The Tegmark 'Quantum Suicide' experiment
<br />
<br />Tegmark (1997) describes the 'Quantum Suicide Experiment' as follows (I have
<br />
simplified the text and removed the mathematical proofs):
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apparatus is a &quot;quantum gun&quot; which each time its trigger is
<br />
pulled measures the z-spin of a particle [particles can be spin up or spin
<br />
down, seemingly at random]. It is connected to a machine gun that fires a
<br />
single bullet if the result is &quot;down&quot; and merely makes an audible click if
<br />
the result is &quot;up&quot;.... The experimenter first places a sand bag in front of
<br />
the gun and tells her assistant to pull the trigger ten times.  All [QM
<br />
interpretations] predict that she will hear a seemingly random sequence of
<br />
shots and duds such as
<br />
&quot;bang-click-bang-bang-bang-click-click-bang-click-click&quot;. She now instructs
<br />
her assistant to pull the trigger ten more times and places her head in
<br />
front of the barrel.  This time the &quot;shut-up-and calculate&quot; [non-MWI
<br />
interpretations of QM] have no meaning for an observer in the dead state...
<br />
and the [interpretations] will differ in their predictions.  In
<br />
interpretations where there is an explicit non-unitary collapse, she will be
<br />
either dead or alive after the first trigger event, so she should expect to
<br />
perceive perhaps a click or two (if she is moderately lucky), then &quot;game
<br />
over&quot;, nothing at all.  In the MWI, on the other hand, the ... prediction is
<br />
that [the experimenter] will hear &quot;click&quot; with 100% certainty.  When her
<br />
assistant has completed this unenviable assignment, she will have heard ten
<br />
clicks, and concluded that the collapse interpretations of quantum mechanics
<br />
[all but the MWI] are ruled out to a confidence level of 1-0.5n ~ 99.9%. If
<br />
she wants to rule them out &quot;ten sigma&quot;, she need merely increase n by
<br />
continuing the experiment a while longer.  Occasionally, to verify that the
<br />
apparatus is working, she can move her head away from the gun and suddenly
<br />
hear it going off intermittently.  Note, however, that [almost all
<br />
instances] will have her assistant perceiving that he has killed his boss.
<br />
<br />What this means is that, in most universes, there is one less experimenter,
<br />
but the experimenter herself does not experience death.
<br />
<br />The QTI is formed by reformulating the 'Quantum Suicide' experiment so that
<br />
the movement of a calcium ion in a brain is used as a proxy for the
<br />
spin-watching 'quantum gun', following the work of Stapp.
<br />
<br />Stapp's work on 'Quantum Theories of the Mind'
<br />
<br />Stapp does not accept the MWI, but prefers the Copenhagen Interpretation for
<br />
reasons - essentially matter of philosophical preference - given in Stapp
<br />
(April, 1996) and (July 21, 1998). This does not affect the useful analysis
<br />
he puts forward concerning the quantum effects inside synapses.
<br />
<br />Stapp shows that quantum effects are indeed important in the way the brain
<br />
operates. In fact, they must have a dramatic effect on the function if the
<br />
brain - perhaps allowing it to function as a 'quantum computer' and take
<br />
advantage of search algorithms, perhaps similar to that proposed by Grover
<br />
(1997)
<br />
<br />Stapp's (April, 1996) evidence that quantum effects must be present in the
<br />
brain is as follows:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) A calcium ion entering a bouton through a microchannel of
<br />
diameter x must, by Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle, have a momentum
<br />
spread of hbar/x, and hence a velocity spread of (hbar/x)/m, and hence a
<br />
spatial spread oin time t, if the particle were freely moving, of
<br />
t(hbar/x)/m. Taking t to be 200 microseconds, the typical time for the ion
<br />
to diffuse from the microchannel opening to a triggering site for the
<br />
release of a vesicle of neurotransmitter, and taking x to be one nanometer,
<br />
and including a factor of 10-5 for diffusion slowing, one finds the diameter
<br />
of the wave function  to be about 40 times 10-8 centimeters, which is
<br />
comparable to the size of the calcium ion itself.  
<br />
<br />In other words, it is quite feasible that in some universes a
<br />
neurotransmitter will activate its target, whereas in others it will not,
<br />
simply due to the 'Heisenberg uncertainty principle'.
<br />
<br />This is important when trying to understand how the brain can act as a
<br />
'quantum computer', and very interesting when we take these ideas in
<br />
conjunction with Tegmark's experiment.
<br />
<br />Integrating Tegmark and Stapp
<br />
<br />Consider a calcium ion which has a 50% probability, according to
<br />
Schrödinger's equations, of activating its target receptor.  Imagine that
<br />
that receptor will make the difference between two possible states of mind:
<br />
one corresponding with a motorcyclist's decision to overtake a car on a
<br />
dangerous road, and the other corresponding with the opposite decision.
<br />
Assume that the overtaking manoeuvre would be fatal. 
<br />
<br />The motorcyclist is the experimenter in Tegmark's quantum suicide. According
<br />
to the MWI prediction, the cyclist will perceive that he has made the
<br />
decision corresponding to the staying-alive outcome with 100% certainty. Of
<br />
course, onlookers in 50% of universes will see a messy accident. 
<br />
<br />The Quantum Theory of Immortality developed here avers that all
<br />
life-or-death decisions correspond with the same quantum mechanical
<br />
equations. In all life-or-death decisions, the 'experimenter' finds that he
<br />
has chosen life.
<br />
<br />Further implications
<br />
<br />Deutsch (1997) argues that it follows from MWI that anything possible exists
<br />
- somewhere in the 'multiverse'.  If this is true, we can say that there are
<br />
many universes (but a very tiny proportion of the multiverse) where you,
<br />
dear reader, are a billion years old.
<br />
<br />Could it follow that you, the experimenter's consciousness, will inevitably
<br />
'end up' in one of those universes?  If so, we are immortal - from our own
<br />
point of view.
<br />
<br />Problems with Quantum Theory of Immortality
<br />
<br />The QTI rests on some contentious premises: Deutsch's development of the
<br />
Everett 'many-worlds' hypothesis; the Tegmark 'quantum suicide' experiment,
<br />
Stapp's work on quantum effects on the brain and, most tentatively, the idea
<br />
that the specific case of the 'quantum gun' can be generalised into any
<br />
life-or-death scenario.
