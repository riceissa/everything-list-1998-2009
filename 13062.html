<br />
<br />JM:
<br />
<br />I suppose 'our intelligence' is part of 'us' and we are part of the &quot;nature
<br />
of reality&quot; (whatever that may be, god, or existence, or...).
<br />
<br />My grandparents had a cellar with a trap door to descend, a maid-girl came
<br />
crying that the door does not open. As it turned out: she was standing on it
<br />
when trying to lift it....
<br />
<br />(parable for us understanding 'all' we are part of). 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Bruno asked:
<br />
<br />God has to choose only among QM universes? Does that God obey QM Eself?
<br />
<br />JM:
<br />
<br />whatever WE decide is our restrictive opinion. Bruno accepted that 'we' are
<br />
'god' so mu answer to the question is: NO, I as god do not.
<br />
<br />I consider QM a product of the product (etc) of that 'reality' we try to
<br />
assign to it. 
<br />
<br />(Sorry,Bruno, I do not start from 'numbers' to build up the existence. So
<br />
far they stayed unidentified/able upon the many questions I (and others)
<br />
asked. They still seem to be - as Bohm said - products of the human
<br />
thinking. (See above: product of the product of the pr...etc.)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think I agree with you on this.  However, numbers are ultimately
</em><br />
representations of information.  And it seems possible, perhaps probable,
<br />
that everything can be reduced to information.  As with most other things,
<br />
maybe it is just a matter of perspective. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Bruno:
<br />
<br />It is impossible to build a universal *prover* or knower. But we can build
<br />
universal classical or quantum constructor or computer.
<br />
JM:
<br />
<br />&quot;Build&quot;, or &quot;think about it&quot;? (Alice, the builder?)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Bruno:
<br />
<br />...I prefer translate the &quot;primitive physical idea&quot; as the idea that there
<br />
is a primitive physical world which is responsible for appearances. 
<br />
<br />JM:
<br />
<br />I like the translation into &quot;idea&quot;. It implies that an 'idea' cannot be
<br />
responsible for appearances we think to receive in our mind. Appearances are
<br />
just that. Our - if you prefer - mind's interpretation of 'something' -
<br />
&quot;reality&quot;. 
<br />
<br />Still: human thinking. 
<br />
<br />Question: which one of us (humans) CAN think with anything else than a human
<br />
mind? If we accept Bruno's &quot;we are god&quot; then it is a human god. Not capable
<br />
of 'building' the existence from the existing existence. (Cf: trapdoor)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Danny:
<br />
<br />...If the answer is yes the whole debate over God seems to become a silly
<br />
argument over semantics. 
<br />
<br />JM:
<br />
<br />If the answer is 'no' or anything, it IS as well. If somebody 'believes' in
<br />
a personal relationship  with any god-phantom halucination based on ANY
<br />
selective hearsay assumption, you cannot make him accept (substitute) a
<br />
scientific'  scrutiny. (I may elaborate on selective, hearsay, and
<br />
assumption, if I must).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;I disagree and think you misunderstood the point of my original post.  I
</em><br />
don&#x2019;t really have time to get into it in detail now, but I was really trying
<br />
to get outside of any faith-based aspect of the question.  Perhaps the word
<br />
God should not be used.  The question I guess boiled down to its essence is
<br />
can you have an ensemble theory of any kind (everything exists) that does
<br />
not end up having intelligence playing an &#x201c;interesting&#x201d; role in the process.
<br />
For future reference, when I refer to &#x201c;God&#x201d; in a post I will not be
<br />
referring to anything relating to personal relationships (in the general
<br />
understood sense that I think you meant) or hallucinations, but will be
<br />
referring very specifically to an entity capable of emulating or creating in
<br />
one manner or another the &#x201c;universe&#x201d; we observe, either from a 3rd person
<br />
viewpoint or from the 1st person viewpoint.  The question is can you have
<br />
ensemble theories without having these entities, and if so, what assumptions
<br />
do you have to make about our underlying reality (or the ensemble theory) to
<br />
avoid them.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I don&#x2019;t see those types of questions as being exclusive of some type of
<br />
tentative scientific scrutiny, but I guess you do or perhaps you thought I
<br />
meant something else when I said &#x201c;God&#x201d; (despite my defining the term in the
<br />
original post). 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />It may be that I just totally don&#x2019;t understand you John.  To be honest I
<br />
more than occasionally have a difficult time understanding what you are
<br />
conveying in your posts.

<br />
<br />If you assume an ensemble theory, whether it be an infinite MWI or Bruno&#x2019;s
<br />
UD in the plenitude, is it POSSIBLE to avoid God?  For the purposes of this
<br />
question I&#x2019;ll define &#x201c;God&#x201d; as an entity capable of creating everything that
<br />
would be observed to exist in a (all possible) quantum mechanical universe.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />God has to choose only among QM universes? Does that God obey QM Eself?
<br />
<br />To avoid God are we back to some kind of &#x201c;primitive physical&#x201d; idea that
<br />
there is something about the nature of reality that will forever prohibit
<br />
intelligence from emulating it?  
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />We cannot, knowingly, emulate a first person in any third person way. For
<br />
example we can emulate perfectly both the comp and the quantum indeterminacy
<br />
.. up to the measurement procedure, which can still be emulate but only by
<br />
emulating the observer himself. But this can be done with any classical or
<br />
quantum universal machine, but then only serendipitously.
<br />
I prefer translate the &quot;primitive physical idea&quot; as the idea that there is a
<br />
primitive physical world which is responsible for appearances. But this
<br />
already contradict the comp hypothesis (for example by the UDA argument, but
<br />
you can also look at Plotinus or Proclus).
<br />
<br />That it is impossible even in theory to build a kind of &#x201c;universal quantum
<br />
constructor&#x201d;?  
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />It is impossible to build a universal *prover* or knower. But we can build
<br />
universal classical or quantum constructor or computer.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Or is the idea one that physics will forever prohibit intelligence from
<br />
acquiring the resources necessary to achieve such a feat? 
<br />
<br /><br />Neither math nor physics prohibit this. Math only prohibit universal machine
<br />
prover or knower.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />How can you have everything, but not have something capable of creating
<br />
everything?  If you assume for instance the UD in the plenitude (no
<br />
intelligent action required), doesn&#x2019;t it eventually describe intelligence
<br />
with access to infinite or near infinite resources capable of creating an
<br />
&#x201c;artificial&#x201d; UD?  
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Sure. But why? The UD is needed in an argument. Real platonic UDs are enough
<br />
for the rest. Note that this can and should be tested.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />If the answer is yes the whole debate over God seems to become a silly
<br />
argument over semantics.  
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />You are quite fuzzy about God, and your basic assumptions. Do you assume a
<br />
*primitive* physical universe? 
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I&#x2019;ll be happy to hear where I&#x2019;m wrong on all this.  Please be kind, I&#x2019;ve
<br />
been away from these sorts of discussions for quite a while!
<br />
<br /><br /><br />No problem, but you could be clearer about your assumption, or I am perhaps
<br />
missing something.
