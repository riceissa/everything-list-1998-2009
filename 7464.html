<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Hmm? You are still seeing that I'm making an *ethical* statement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; here somehow? Well, I suppose that in some sense highly selfish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; behavior could conceivably be described as ethical in some sense,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but it's sure confusing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The statement of what a person should or shouldn't do falls under
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the domain of ethics. When you say
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;definitely in the case of very close copies, to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consistent one should to the greatest degree he can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; extend the boundary to include close duplicates.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You're making a normative statement.
</em><br />
<br />I cannot believe that all normative statements have to do
<br />
with ethics. To say &quot;you ought to do X to be logical&quot;,
<br />
or &quot;you ought to go outside if you want some sun&quot; has
<br />
absolutely nothing to do with ethics so far as I can see.
<br />
<br />I might even endorse the statement &quot;to kill the maximum
<br />
number of people, you should start an Ebola plague&quot;, and
<br />
yet I am totally against death. There is no inconsistency
<br />
here; in the statement I am making a statement that has
<br />
nothing to do with ethics, just logic and rationality.
<br />
<br />You should agree that 2+2=4. You should agree that you'll
<br />
be the same person tomorrow. Not ethical. But if I say
<br />
that you should contribute to charity, well, then probably
<br />
I've crossed the line into ethics?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was arguing that one's intuitions will likely pull the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other way. You may say that &quot;your duplicate is you&quot;, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is undeniable that there are two organisms present,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and an organism normally acts in such a way to prevent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; damage to its body, and as you say, these instincts are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forged by evolution.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but I contend that while there are two organisms present,
<br />
there is only one person.  It's much as though some space
<br />
aliens kidnapped you and tried to say that Pete at spacetime
<br />
coordinates (X1,T1) could not possibly be the same person as
<br />
Pete at coordinates (X1,T2) because the times weren't the same.
<br />
You'd have to get them to wrap their heads around the idea that
<br />
one person could be at two different times in the same place.
<br />
They might find this bizarre.
<br />
<br />I'm trying to tell you a possibility that you think equally
<br />
bizarre: namely that Pete(X1,T1) is the same person as Pete(X2,T1),
<br />
namely that the same person may be at two different locations at
<br />
the same time.  That's all.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What would the Lee who stands to receive $5 in my experiment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say to the Lee who is observing in a remote room, pondering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which choice to make? &quot;Please kill yourself so that I might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; live; after all, I'll have $5 more than you and so will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slightly better off.
</em><br />
<br />Well, he'd *think* that, at least.  No need to say it.  It would
<br />
be obvious to the other Lee. But yes, if forced to vocalize, that
<br />
would be what he would be saying.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, if you do decide to kill me instead, I won't mind so much,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since $5 isn't really that much money.&quot; ? 
</em><br />
<br />Right.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can we really imagine people saying these things without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; previously carrying out some intense philosophical gymnastics?
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps not.  But consider these discussions to be those
<br />
gymnastics. The same person will awake in your bed tomorrow
<br />
morning whether you take the $5 or not. Or whether you remember
<br />
tonight or not. From the viewpoint of physics, these things
<br />
don't matter: all that matters is whether the organism in your
<br />
bed tomorrow sufficiently resembles Pete Carlton or not.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know; I think Stathis has a good point that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplication isn't really possible so all the conclusions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we're drawing from it might be suspect - and entities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that are duplicatable might have vastly different intuitions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about what is moral and what is not. 
</em><br />
<br />I still think that morality has NOTHING to do with it. I'm
<br />
merely talking about what it means, rigorously, to *survive*.
<br />
It's sort of a statement of fact, or at least a concern of
<br />
fact: do you survive teleportation? do you survive by being
<br />
replaced by a back?  and so on.
<br />
<br />And as has just been pointed out in another thread, with
<br />
uploading all these questions will return with a vengeance.
<br />
<br />Lee
