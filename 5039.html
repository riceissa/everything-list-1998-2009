<br />
There are a couple of peculiarities of our universe which it would be
<br />
nice if the All-Universe Hypothesis (AUH) could explain, or at least
<br />
shed light on them.
<br />
<br />One is the apparent paucity of life and intelligence in our universe.
<br />
This was first expressed as the Fermi Paradox, i.e., where are the aliens?
<br />
As our understanding of technological possibility has grown the problem
<br />
has become even more acute.  It seems likely that our descendants
<br />
will engage in tremendous cosmic engineering projects in order to take
<br />
control of the very wasteful natural processes occuring throughout space.
<br />
We don't see any evidence of that.  Similarly, proposals for von Neumann
<br />
self reproducing machines that could spread throughout the cosmos at a
<br />
large fraction of the speed of light appear to be almost within reach
<br />
via nanotechnology.  Again, we don't see anything like that.
<br />
<br />So why is it that we live in a universe that has almost no observers?
<br />
Wouldn't it be more likely on anthropic grounds to live in a universe
<br />
that had a vast number of observers?
<br />
<br />The second peculiarity is the seemingly narrow range of physical laws
<br />
which could allow for our form of life to exist.  Tegmark writes about
<br />
this at <a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html">http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html</a>.  He shows a chart of
<br />
two physical constants and how if they had departed from their observed
<br />
values by even a tiny percentage, life would be impossible.  In the
<br />
full paper linked from there he offers many more examples of physical
<br />
paramters which are fine-tuned for life.
<br />
<br />So why is this?  Why does it turn out that our form of life (or perhaps,
<br />
any form of life) can exist for only a tiny range of variation?
<br />
Why didn't it turn out that you could change many parameters a great
<br />
deal and still have life form?
<br />
<br />I don't see anything a priori in the AUH that would have led to this
<br />
prediction.  Now, it may just be one of those things that &quot;happens to
<br />
happen&quot;, a fundamental mathematical property like the distribution of
<br />
primes or the absence of odd perfect numbers.  Self-aware subsystems
<br />
just mathematically turn out to only be possible in a very tiny region
<br />
of parameter space.
<br />
<br />Now, you might be able to make the argument that &quot;tiny&quot; is not well
<br />
defined, that there is no natural length scale for judging parameter
<br />
ranges.  Tegmark could as easily have zoomed in on the appropriate region
<br />
of his graph and shown a huge, enormous area where parameters could be
<br />
moved around and life would still work.
<br />
<br />However I think there is a more natural way to put the question, which is,
<br />
what fraction of computer programs would lead to simulated universes that
<br />
include observers?  And here, if we follow Tegmark's ideas, the answer
<br />
appears to be that it is a very small fraction.  (Of course, you still
<br />
need to use your own judgement to decide whether that is &quot;tiny&quot; or not.)
<br />
<br />In a way, then, these two questions are both related, and perhaps the
<br />
same.  They both ask, why so few observers?  One question looks around the
<br />
interior of our universe, and the other looks at the set of all universes.
<br />
In each case, it seems that intelligent life is terribly uncommon.
<br />
