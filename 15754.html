Hal,
<br />
<br />I have entertained quite similar musings some time ago, and this led me 
<br />
to a position I called &quot;naive materialism&quot; NMAT some time ago on this 
<br />
list - that causality does not matter, and consciousness would supervene 
<br />
on the material states directly - and both backward and forward versions 
<br />
would actually be &quot;the same&quot; from an endophysical perspective.
<br />
<br />But the problem of these considerations is that indeed we get the BB 
<br />
issue and causality loses it's role, leaving us with a quite strange 
<br />
tangle of states. Considering that in a fundamental theory, time 
<br />
shouldn't be a parameter chugging along, and we are still considering an 
<br />
&quot;external time&quot; (where the cosmic perturbations are actually happening) 
<br />
as opposed to the endophysical time registered by the brains in the 
<br />
fluctuations, the thinking along these lines reveals itself to be even 
<br />
more disappointing.
<br />
<br />In the meantime I have come to agree with Bruno:
<br />
<br />&quot;It seems to me that your reasoning illustrates well the problems with
<br />
physical supervenience and physicalism, and perhaps ASSA.&quot;
<br />
<br />The solution Bruno has worked out is much more satisfying - 
<br />
supervenience on computations, and the &quot;physical&quot; emerging from the most 
<br />
probable histories. It is a form of objective idealism, avoiding the 
<br />
problems of subjective idealisms which are inimical to scientific inquiry.
<br />
<br />In sum, BBs and perturbing universes are, I think, more evidence that 
<br />
there is something wrong with materialism (and I say this having arrived 
<br />
on this list being a materialist ;-).
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moments need to be linked to one another, the role of causality in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, etc. I thought of an interesting puzzle about Boltzmann
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brains which offers a new twist to these questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As most readers are aware, Boltzmann Brains relate to an idea of Boltzmann
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on how to explain the arrow of time. The laws of physics seem to be time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symmetric, yet the universe is grossly asymmetric in time.  Boltzmann
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposed that if you had a universe in a maximum entropy state, say a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uniform gas, then given enough time, the gas would undergo fluctuations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to regions of lower entropy.  Sometimes, purely at random, clumps of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecules would happen to form. Even more rarely, these clumps might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; large and ordered. Given infinite time, one could even have an entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; visible-universe worth of matter clump together in an ordered fashion,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from which state it would then decay into higher entropy conditions. Life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could evolve during this decay, observe the universe around it, and find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself in conditions much like our own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Boltzmann Brain is a counter-argument, suggesting that the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and everything else is redundant; all you need is a brain to form via
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a spontaneous random fluctuation, and to hold together long enough to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; engage in a few moments of conscious thought. Such a Boltzmann Brain is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far more likely to form than an entire universe, hence the vast majority
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of conscious thoughts in such a model will be in Boltzmann Brains and not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in brains in large universes. If we were tempted to explain the arrow of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time in this way, we must accept that the universe is an illusion and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we are actually Boltzmann Brains, a conclusion which most people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't like.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now this scenario can be criticized in many ways, but I want to emphasize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a couple of points which aren't always appreciated. The first is that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Boltzmann scenario, whether a whole universe or just a Brain is forming,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is basically time symmetric. That means that if you saw a movie of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Boltzmann universe forming and then decaying back to random entropy,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you would not be able to tell which way the movie was running, if it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were to be reversed. (This is an unavoidable consequence of the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symmetry of the underlying physics.) It follows that while the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is moving into the low-entropy state, it must be evolving backwards. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is, an observer from outside would see time appearing to run backwards.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Eggs would un-scramble themselves, objects would fall upwards from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ground, ripples would converge on spots in lakes from which rocks would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then leap from the water, and so on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At some point this time reversal effect would stop, and the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would then proceed to evolve back into a high entropy state, now with time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going &quot;forwards&quot;. Now, the forward phase will not in general be an exact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mirror image of the reverse, because of slight random fluctuations and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the like, but it will be an alternate path that essentially starts with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same initial conditions. So we will see one path backwards into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minimum-entropy state, and another path forwards from that state. Both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paths are fully plausible histories and neither is distinguishable from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the other as far as which was reversed and which was forward, if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ran a recording of the whole process backwards.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One might ask, what causes time to run backwards during the first half of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Boltzmann scenario? The answer is, nothing but very, very odd luck.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Time is no more likely to continue to run backwards, or to run backwards
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same everywhere in the local fluctuation-area, than it is to start
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; running backwards right now in the universe around you. Nothing stops
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eggs from unscrambling themselves except the unlikelihood, and the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle is at work during the Boltzmann time-reversal phase. It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; merely that we select, out of the infinity of time, those rare occasions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where time does in fact &quot;happen to happen&quot; like this, that allows us to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discuss it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I want to emphasize that this picture of how Boltzmann fluctuations would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; work is a consquence of the laws of thermodynamics, and time symmetry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sometimes people imagine that the fluctuation into the Boltzmann
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; low-entropy state is fundamentally different from the fluctuation out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of it. They accept that the fluctuation out will be similar to our own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence, with complex events happening. But they imagine that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fluctuation into low entropy might be much simpler, molecules simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aggregating together into some convenient state from which the complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fluctuation out and back to chaos can begin. While this is not impossible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and hence will happen occasionally among the infinity of fluctuations in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Boltzmann universe, it will be rare. It will be no more common for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;simple&quot; fluctation-in process to occur than for a simple fluctuation-out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process. In our universe, knowing it will evolve to a chaotic heat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; death, we might imagine that molecules would just fly apart into chaos,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but we know that is highly unlikely. Instead, by far the most likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; path is a complex one, full of turbulence and reactions and similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity. By time symmetry, exactly the same arguments apply during
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fluctation-in phase. The vast majority of Boltzmann fluctuations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that achieve a particular degree of low entropy will do so via complex,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turbulent paths which if viewed in reverse will appear to be perfectly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plausible sequences of events for a universe which is decaying from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order to disorder, like our own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Following on to this, let us consider the nature of consciousness during
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these Boltzmann excursions. Again let us focus on larger scale ones than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just Boltzmann Brains, although the same principles apply there. During
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the time reversal phase, if conscious entities are present, their brains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are running backwards. They are talking backwards, walking backwards,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doing everything in reverse. They remember things that are coming in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the future, and forget everything as soon as it has happened.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question is, is there any difference in consciousness during the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reverse and forward phases? Consider that during the forward phase, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; started with a low entropy state, and now the laws of physics are playing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out just as they do in our own universe. Everything is happening for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason, depending on what has happened before. Events cause memories to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appear in brains by virtue of the same causal effects which give rise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to our own memories. Hence I imagine that most would agree that brains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during the forward phase are conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, during the reverse phase, things are quite different. Brains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have memories of things that haven't happened yet. Again, one might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ask how this can be. The reason is because we stop paying attention
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to fluctuations where this doesn't happen. We only focus on Boltzmann
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fluctuations which take the universe into a plausible and consistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; low-entropy state, one from which things can evolve in a way that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar to what we see. When a brain remembers something, if that doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen, the fluctuation is inconsistent. We skip over that one and look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for one that is consistent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the consistent fluctuations, brain memories turn out to be correct,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purely by luck. Similarly, every internal function of the brain which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we might attribute to macroscopic-type causality, like neuron A firing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because neuron B fired, will happen instead by luck, with neuron A firing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as though neuron B is going to fire, and then neuron B just happening
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to fire in precisely the anticipated way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The point is that during the time-reversal phase, causality as we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normally think of it is absent. Subjectively-past events do not cause
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjectively-future ones; rather, subjectively-future events take place
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before subjectively-past events, and it is merely through luck that things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen in a consistent pattern. Again, if we hadn't gotten lucky so that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things work out, we wouldn't have called this a Boltzmann fluctuation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the kind we are interested in (Boltzmann Brain or Boltzmann Universe).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By paying selective attention to only those fluctuations where things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; work, we will only observe cases where luck, rather than causality,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes things happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But things do happen, in the same pattern they would if causality were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; active.  So the question is, are brains conscious during this time? Do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the thoughts that occur during the time reversal (which recall is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly the same as what happens during the forward-time phase) have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same level of subjective reality as thoughts which occur when time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; runs forward?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can argue it either way. In favor of consciousness, the main
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument is that time is fundamentally symmetric (we assume). Hence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is no fundamental or inherent difference between the forward and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reverse phases.  The only differences are relative, with the arrow of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time pointing in opposite directions in the two phases. But within each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phase, we see events which can both be equally well described as leading
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to consciousness, and therefore conscious experiences will occur in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both phases.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other side, many people see a role for causality in the creation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or manifestation of consciousness. And arguably, causality is different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the two phases. In the forward phase (the part where we are returning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from a low-entropy excursion to the high-entropy static state), events
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follow one another for the usual reasons, and it is correct to attribute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a role for causality just as we do in our own experience. But in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reverse phase, it is purely by luck that things happen in a consistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way, and only because we have an infinity of time to work with that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are able to find sequences of events that look consistent even they arose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by simple happenstance. There is no true causality in this phase, just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; random sequence of events where we have selected a sequence that mimics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causality. And to the extent that consciousness depends on causality,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we should not say that brains during this reverse phase are conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I lean towards the first interpretation, for the following reason. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness really was able to somehow distinguish the forward from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reverse phases in a Boltzmann fluctuation, it would be quite remarkable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given that the fundamental laws of physics are time symmetric, nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be able to do that, to deduce a true &quot;implicit&quot; arrow of time that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; goes beyond the superficial arrow of time caused by entropy differences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The whole point of time symmetry, the very definition, is that there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be no such implicit arrow of time.  This suggestion would seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to give consciousness a power that it should not have, allow it to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something that is impossible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And if the first interpretation is correct, it seems to call into question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the very nature of causality, and its posible role in consciousness. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are forced to attribute consciousness to sequences of events which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occur purely by luck, then causality can't play a significant role. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the rather surprising conclusion which I reached from these musings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on Boltzmann Brains.
