<br />Thank for telling me.
<br />
<br /><br />OK, people, good time to solve the problems. Please don't read this  
<br />
post, unless you find it is the good time for you to do some math. If  
<br />
not, postpone until a good time. Technical posts have to be studied,  
<br />
not read. Take the time needed. Tell me if I am too quick.
<br />
<br />The solution of &quot;3)&quot; has been given.
<br />
<br />Let us look at:
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If card(A) = n, and card(B) = m. What is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; card(A^B)?
</em><br />
<br /><br />card(A) = n
<br />
This means A is a finite set with n elements.
<br />
<br />card(B) = m
<br />
This means B is a finite set with m elements.
<br />
<br />Let us simplify by supposing that m = 3, and n = 2. Hoping that the  
<br />
reasoning done for finding the solution on the particular case will  
<br />
inspire the reasoning for finding the solution in the general case.
<br />
<br />Let us imagine that A is the set {a, b, c}, with its three elements,  
<br />
and that B is the set {1, 2}, with its two elements.
<br />
<br />And let us try now to remember what is the question.
<br />
<br />The question is: what is card(A^B)?
<br />
<br />Well, card(A^B) is the number of elements of A^B.   By definition of  
<br />
the cardinal.
<br />
<br />What is A^B?
<br />
<br />Well, A^B is the set of functions from B to A. By definition of set  
<br />
exponentiation.
<br />
<br />Well, if the question was just &quot;what is card(A^B)?&quot;, this would  
<br />
provide the best solution, or the best note if you want. But the  
<br />
teacher provided the information that A has n elements, and that B has  
<br />
m elements, and intuitively we can bet that the number of functions  
<br />
from a set to another can depend on the number of elements of each  
<br />
sets involved, so that &quot;what is card( A^B)?&quot; meant probably how to  
<br />
compute card(A^B) in function of card(A) and card(B).
<br />
<br />Ok, we decided to look on the particular case with A = {a, b, c}, and  
<br />
B = {1, 2}.
<br />
<br />A^B = the set of all functions from B to A.
<br />
<br />That is the set of functions from {1, 2} to {a, b, c}.
<br />
<br />Well, let us try to find, or to build, one function from B to A.
<br />
<br />But , here a moment of panic can occur, (empirical observation). For  
<br />
the unnameable sake, what *is* a function? What is a function from B  
<br />
to A.
<br />
Well, if it is an open manual home work, such panic can be eased by  
<br />
looking in the math notes. You may remember the motivation or the  
<br />
informal sense of what a function represents, which is a relation of  
<br />
dependency, and this is in the most general sense, so that all  
<br />
possible dependency are tolerated. For a function from B to A, it  
<br />
means the element of A depends in function of the elements of B. Such  
<br />
a dependency is well described by a couple (x, y) with x in B and y in  
<br />
A.
<br />
<br />we have (x,y) belongs-to F representing the meaning that y depends &quot;in  
<br />
the function F&quot; of x.
<br />
<br />Think about x as time and y as temperature.
<br />
<br />So, a function from B to A is just a set of couples (x, y) with x in B  
<br />
and y in A, with the functional restriction that x is not send to two  
<br />
different values y. At each time x, you can have only one temperature y.
<br />
<br />That is, here: a set of couples (x, y) with x in {1, 2} and y in {a,  
<br />
b, c}, and such that if (1, x) belongs-to F, no other (1, y) belongs  
<br />
to F.
<br />
<br />Let us build one function from {1, 2} to {a, b, c}.
<br />
<br />OK, 1, from B,  can determine what in A ? Well, we have three  
<br />
possibilities a, b and c. OK, i will use my free will to decide that  
<br />
for this function I want now, 1 will determine a. So I put the couple  
<br />
(1, a) in the function.
<br />
<br />At this stage, the &quot;function&quot; looks like {(1, a)}.
<br />
<br />Finished?
<br />
<br />No, a function from a set to another one gives a values, outcomes,  
<br />
outputs for all elements of its domain. I have to say what is  
<br />
determine by 2, in B. OK, I will use my free will again, and decide to  
<br />
add the couples (2, a).
<br />
<br />At this stage, the function looks like {(1, a) (2, a)}.
<br />
<br />Finished?
<br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br />We do have a function from B to A. The set {(1, a) (2, a)} describes  
<br />
completely a function from B to A, a so-called &quot;constant function&quot;.  
<br />
think of 1 and 02 as moment of times, and think of a, b, c, as possible  
<br />
temperature. The function  {(1, a) (2, a)} describe a case here the  
<br />
temperature is constant and equal to a.
<br />
<br />Finished? No, we have to find all functions from B to A. All functions  
<br />
from {1, 2} to {a, b, c}.
<br />
<br />Well actually, we need to find only the number of such functions. For  
<br />
1 I have three choices, then for 2, I have still three choices, and  
<br />
the choices are independent, so that for each choice the remaining  
<br />
three choice will lead to distinct functions, this make 03 X 3  
<br />
functions = 09 functions:
<br />
<br />{(1, a) (2, a)}
<br />
{(1, a) (2, b)}
<br />
{(1, a) (2, c)}
<br />
<br />{(1, b) (2, a)}
<br />
{(1, b) (2, b)}
<br />
{(1, b) (2, c)}
<br />
<br />{(1, c) (2, a)}
<br />
{(1, c) (2, b)}
<br />
{(1, c) (2, c)}
<br />
<br />so A^B = {{(1, a) (2, a)}, {(1, a) (2, b)}, {(1, a) (2, c)}, ... ,  
<br />
{(1, c) (2, c)}}, and card(A^B) = 9. In this case. This give all the  
<br />
way the a, b, c can depend on 1 and 2.
<br />
<br />I stop here. I let you train on the following question:
<br />
<br />How many functions from {a, b, c} to {1, 2}?
<br />
<br />How many functions from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} to {a, b, c, d, e}?
<br />
<br />What is the general solution, in term of cardinal n and m of the sets  
<br />
involved ?   (the original question).
<br />
<br />Take your time, and ask any question. This is the type of stuff rather  
<br />
easy for exact scientists, and rather new for those who buried math in  
<br />
their unconscious in high school, so take each your own time.
<br />
<br />I hope I am not too long. We will see many many examples of functions.
<br />
<br />Bruno
