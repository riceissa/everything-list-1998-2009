<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, that is not a fair paraphrase of what I said. I meant exactly what I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said I meant--if a hypothesis is not well-defined enough to tell you the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relative probability of different possibilities, that does not justify the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim that the hypothesis predicts each possibility is equally likely. Do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you agree with this principle or not?
</em><br />
<br />If a hypothesis is not well-defined enough to tell you the
<br />
relative probability of different possibilities, the claim
<br />
that they are not all the same is unsupported.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;That isnot really analogous becasue the CC can only have one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;value at a time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That difference is irrelevant to my point about probabilities. Again, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *always* unjustified to say that because a theory doesn't predict the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relative probabilities of different outcomes, that means it predicts they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are equally likely; it doesn't matter whether or not we are talking about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the probability in the context of a large ensemble of events (say, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability a certain type of atom will decay in a 1-minute time period,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where we are repeating the test with a large number of atoms) or in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context of a single event.
</em><br />
<br />In the absence of evidence to the contrary , you have to
<br />
assume that probabilites are even.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, it is quite possible that even if string theory could make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predictions about the value of the cosmological constant, it would only be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilistic prediction rather than predicting a single unique value, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means that if you are prepared to entertain either the MWI of quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanics or &quot;chaotic inflation&quot; where new universes bubble from prior ones
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; via inflation, then there might in fact be different &quot;universes&quot; with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different values of the cosmological constant.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We can make &quot;sense&quot; of &quot;unicorns have horns&quot;, despite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the lack of reference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; In this case I would say the reference would be to a certain concept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; humans have collectively defined;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;No, that's the sense. Sense is in-hte-head , reference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is out-of-the-head.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, I see. So what if we are talking about a concept in itself, as in &quot;most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people's concept of a unicorn is that of a horse-like creature with a single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; horn&quot;; would the &quot;concept&quot; itself be a reference?
</em><br />
<br />Only the reference of &quot;a concept&quot; is a concept.
<br />
<br />Fictional terms don't have referents. That's why they are unreal.
<br />
<br />The point is that you don't need reference for meaning.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree, and even a &quot;modal realist&quot; philosopher like David Lewis (see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher</a>) ), who thinks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; propositions about possibilities can only be objectively true or false
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; assume all possible worlds actually exist, would not say that there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; kind of causal interaction between worlds needed to explain our ability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; reason about them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;If we can reason about (for instance)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;historical what-is without concrete ferefernces is parallel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;dimensions, we can reason about maths without taking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;a trip to Plato's heaven.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I have already made clear that I *don't* think that we need to refer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonic forms which somehow causally interact with people's brains in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation of how people reason about math, just like David K Lewis doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think we need a causal interaction between different possible worlds to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain how people reason about possibilities.
</em><br />
<br />So how do we need to refer to them ? Why do we need to refer to them ?
<br />
If they are causally inactive, an evil daemon could snap his
<br />
fingers and make them vanish. How do we know that hasn't happened
<br />
already ?
<br />
<br />We can interact with real-world objects, and we must interact it them
<br />
in order to confirm the truth of non-mathematical, not-fictional
<br />
sentences.
<br />
<br />If we had reason to think mathematical sentences were uniform with
<br />
empirical sentences, we would be forced to require the existence of
<br />
mathematical objects in spite of their lack of a role to play.
<br />
<br />But it is the very fact that we do not need experiment or observation
<br />
to confirm mathematical sentences that shows they are differnt
<br />
from empirical sentences, and different in a way that absolves them
<br />
from requiring reference.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The question was to try to help me grasp what you meant by &quot;sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; reference&quot; and &quot;mind-independent&quot;. If it's impossible to come up with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; examples outside of math, that should make you suspicious whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; mathematics really has the strange and marvellous property of there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; objective mind-independent truths about mathematical terms even though
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; lack any reference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;No it shoudn't. Maths is obviously unique in a number of respects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;That is why there is such a subject as philosophy-of-mathematics.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's pretty vague--unique in what respects? Does uniqueness in these other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respects somehow justify the belief that it is unique in the respect of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involving both sense-without-reference and mind-independence?
</em><br />
<br />Yes. Maths is apriori. It doesn't require experiment or
<br />
observation. Aprioriness is explained by analycity.
<br />
An analytical sentences contains in its meaning everything
<br />
necessary to determine its truth-value. Analycity is explained
<br />
by sense. Analycity requires a kind of meaning that is
<br />
in-the-head, in addition to reference.
<br />
<br />Analycity and aprioriness explain objectivity and necessity. if
<br />
mathematical sentence doesn't require anything outside
<br />
itself to arrive at its truth value, then its truth-value
<br />
is not going to vary between times, places and persons.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;  If you really believe this, you should at least be able
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; to give an argument about *why* math is different from every other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;domain in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; this respect.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It is on a deeper level of abstraction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That doesn't remotely resemble an argument--can you define precisely what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;deeper level of abstraction&quot; means, and why &quot;deepness of abstraction&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be in any way related to statements that lack sense but are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objectively true?
</em><br />
<br />Don't you mean &quot;lack reference but are objectively true&quot; ?
<br />
<br />This is hardly contentious. To lack references is (on my
<br />
view) to lack concrete references. To lack concrete
<br />
references is to be abstract. (Even Platonists
<br />
think mathemtical statements have *abstract* references,
<br />
but that leads to the same conclusion).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;The case for mathematical Platonism needs to be made in the first
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;If you are going to claim we are already inside Plato's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;heaven, as many on the list do, you are already dealing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;with a stronger definition of ontology than that,
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; No I'm not. In terms of the notion that &quot;existence&quot; just means the entities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you'd need to refer to in an exhaustive list of all objective truths, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea that &quot;we are already inside Plato's heaven&quot; could be understood to mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that as long as you include all the true statements that deal with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical question of how a theoretical universe with our laws of nature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and initial conditions would behave, then your exhaustive list of truths
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't need to include any additional non-mathematical truths which tell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you this particular mathematical description is actually &quot;physically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiated&quot; or something like that.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You don't need to refer to any entities to establish mathematical
<br />
truths.
<br />
You do need to refer to entities to establish which particular
<br />
mathematics
<br />
is exemplified by the physics in this universe. So your list
<br />
of truths is going to be partnered with a much shorter list
<br />
of necessary references.
<br />
<br />Even if you insist that every truth must have a reference, even if it
<br />
is causally, and therefore epistemolgocially, idle, that just leaves
<br />
you,
<br />
as usual, with the HP problem.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, I'm not sure I believe myself that the exhaustive list of true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statements would include *nothing* but mathematical statements--I think it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might also have to include some truths about consciousness and qualia.
</em><br />
<br />If they are a different kind of truth (presumably contingent),
<br />
wouldn't they require a different kind of instantiation (presumably
<br />
physical) ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this sense, it is conceivable that the exhaustive list of truths would tell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you that only some mathematically-describable worlds containing intelligent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life would actually lead to conscious experiences, while others wouldn't--in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this sense only some (or one) possible world would be &quot;real&quot;. I think it's a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lot simpler to just assume all mathematically-possible observers are equally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real with respect to consciousness, but I can't prove it obviously.
</em><br />
<br />Mathematics is no good at all in telling us
<br />
which mathemtical structures would be consciouss,
<br />
whether all would be, whether none would be,
<br />
or what consciousness is.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, consciousness exists.
<br />
<br />So there is at leat one non-mathematical fact!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Still, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have no idea what it would mean to say that some mathematically possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds are *physically* real if &quot;physical&quot; was meant as anything other than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a shorthand way for talking about consciousness.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If mathematical reality is constituted by being the reference
<br />
of a mathematical statement, then physical reality is constituted
<br />
by being the reference of an objective but non-mathematical
<br />
statement. You have conceded that such truths could exist.
<br />
<br />Or, to take my usual line,
<br />
<br />1) You are physically real.
<br />
2) Physically real things can interact with you
<br />
3) Physically unreal things can't.
<br />
<br />(Of course, if everything is mathematical, and if mathematical
<br />
entities are casually idle, as you have said, nothing can interact
<br />
with anything).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Incidentally, does your definition of &quot;exists&quot; mean that you don't think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; anything exists beyond the boundaries of the observable universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;That depends on what the &quot;able&quot; means in &quot;observable&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, put it this way--as long as the expansion of the universe is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slowing to zero in the limit as time goes to infinity (and observational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence suggests the rate of expansion is actually accelerating), then any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; event beyond the boundaries of the observable universe at this moment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cosmological time will never, ever be able to have any causal influence on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us, because the space between us and the point where the event occurred will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always be expanding faster than light from the event can close the gap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between it and us. So unless relativity is wrong and it's possible to travel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; faster than light, you would not in principle be &quot;able&quot; to observe anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happening beyond the observable universe, at any point in the future. So do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you think that anything &quot;exists&quot; beyond the observable universe? And what if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you and I are in different galaxies, so that the boundaries of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;observable universe&quot; are slightly different for each of us? Do you think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that existence is relative to the observer, rather than being objective and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It's all causally connected providing it starts from the BB.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you think there is any sense in which your projection could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; objectively wrong, even if you believe it is correct?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It could be wrong. So it doesn't necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;deliver objectivity, Hiwever it allows us to understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;what objectivity is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But again, to have a notion of objectivity you must have at least an ideal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of an error-free theorem-producer
</em><br />
<br />Objective doesn't mean &quot;infallible&quot;, it means &quot;not subjective&quot;,
<br />
ie not varying with personal opinions and prejudices.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Formalism is a bit iffy. Apart from that, they all do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you sure? Does empiricism say there are objective mathematical truths
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separate from whatever empirical &quot;observations&quot; we happen to make, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example?
</em><br />
<br />No, it says there are objective truths
<br />
which are not separate from empircal investigation.
<br />
<br />Empirical truths are
<br />
mind-independent too.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; You are still misunderstanding, of course MP is an ontological thesis,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; do you think I was arguing otherwise? What I'm saying is that any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;statement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of the form &quot;there is a mind-independent truth about X&quot; is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;ontological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; statement, by necessity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It is obviously epistemoligcal, It deals with truth, not being.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But as I pointed out, it is common among philosophers to define &quot;being&quot; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms the set of all possible objective truths.
</em><br />
<br />I think you'll find that's &quot;all true facts&quot; or &quot;all obtaining
<br />
states-of-affairs&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I certainly don't think many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophers would define &quot;being&quot; the way you do in terms of ability to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causally interact with us.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Are there any philosophers who think non-existent things can interact
<br />
with them ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;  It is not a &quot;necessity&quot; to believe that statements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; about math are ontological ones, though, because you are free to deny
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; there is any mind-independent truth about them (in which case you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; obviously not a mathematical platonist).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I believe there is mind-independent truth about them AND deny they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;ontological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then I think you are defining &quot;ontological&quot; in a different way from most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophers, or at least most analytic philosophers of the 20th century
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (the 'continental' philosophers have their own way of thinking about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontology, but then continental philosophers hardly ever deal with philosophy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of math).
</em><br />
<br />Hmmm. But if you were extensively versed in  analytical
<br />
philosophy, would you need readings from St Frege and St Carnap on the
<br />
subjects
<br />
of Sense and Analycity ?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;How can it be ontological when it says nothing about being, existence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;etc ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Bearing in mind that *my* definition of existence entails the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;possibility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of causal interaction...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I acknowledge that with *your* definition of existence, mathematical objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do not exist. But I think you're using a pretty idiosyncratic definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that would be miles away from how most analytic philosophers would define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence, in particular those who work with philosophy of math.
</em><br />
<br />All Analyticals are Platonists ?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, but that's because my notion of &quot;existence&quot; is simply a shorthand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; an element of reality about which there exist objective truths.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Oh come on, that's like defining God as a necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;existing being. You need to *show* that truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;implies existence, not just assert it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You're acting as though we have some mutually agreed-upon prior definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of &quot;existence&quot; which is separate from objective truth,
</em><br />
<br />Dictionaries do not define &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;existence&quot; as synonyms.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that I am trying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to make an *argument* that objective truth implies existence in this sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But that's not what I'm doing at all--I am *defining* the word &quot;existence&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in terms of objective truth, not making an argument.
</em><br />
<br />That is exactly what I am complaining about.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence is defined in your way instead of my way, then objective truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't imply existence, but then I think you're using a very weird
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition which is different from how virtually any analytic philosopher
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would define it,
</em><br />
<br />As truth ?
<br />
<br />1) existence is truth, truth existence
<br />
2) some false statements exist
<br />
3) therefore, from (1), false statements are true
<br />
<br />By reductio, (1) is false.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and which leads to internal problems like the issue of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether anything &quot;exists&quot; beyond the boundaries of the observable universe.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; But that would make &quot;existence&quot; local too, rather than objective. My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; cones are different from yours, so if you want to say that the past is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;real&quot; in a sense that the future is not, that would make the reality of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; events different for each observer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Not if ptoetnial causal interaction is allowed to run in both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;directions. There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is chain of ackward causes linking me to the BB; running forward again,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;another chain connects to events outside my light-cone.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but as I pointed out above, events happening at the current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cosmological time outside the current observable universe cannot ever have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an effect on anything in your future light cone, nor can they have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; affected by any event in your past light cone, assuming the expansion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space is not slowing to zero.
</em><br />
<br /><br />As I say, I allow causality to work both ways.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; His argument simply assumes that a moment can &quot;become existent&quot;, without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; addressing this question of whether we need a second time dimension to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; sense of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;We don't, since nothing changes once it has come into existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't understand how this response addresses the issue of needing a second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time dimension.
</em><br />
<br />The regress of time dimension comes in when you require that
<br />
moments in time themselves change as time progresses.
<br />
<br />'(7) The argument that the A series cannot exist is as follows: On the
<br />
one hand, (a) past, present, and future are
<br />
incompatible determinations (whether relations or qualities) of an
<br />
event; if any event is present, it cannot be past,
<br />
nor be future. On the other hand, (b) every event has them all; if any
<br />
event is past, it has been present and future.
<br />
These two, (a) and (b), are simply inconsistent, and therefore the A
<br />
series, and consequently change and time, cannot
<br />
exist. (468) Notice that we cannot presuppose the existence of time, in
<br />
order to evade this argument.
<br />
<br />(8) An obvious objection against this argument is that (a) or (b), or
<br />
both, involves equivocation in terms of verb-forms for
<br />
tense; the determinations as past, present, and future are only
<br />
incompatible when they are simultaneous, and there should be no
<br />
contradiction when an event has all of them successively. However, this
<br />
objection involves a vicious circle, because it presupposes the
<br />
existence of time, in that those determinations are supposed to be
<br />
taking place in time. (468)
<br />
<br />(9) Thus the previous conclusion cannot be evaded. Since the notions of
<br />
A series and of time contain a contradiction, they cannot
<br />
be applied to reality, and hence time is unreal. (470-471) It must be
<br />
remembered that this whole argument is taking place
<br />
within the context of attributing time to the reality itself, not to
<br />
subjective consciousness. (471-472) '

<br />
<br /><br />My basic point is that it is only contradictory for a thing (in this
<br />
case an event, or moment-of-time)
<br />
to be variously past, present and future if those are
<br />
&lt;em&gt;intrinsic&lt;/em&gt; properties. There
<br />
is no contradiction in having different relational properties, scuha s
<br />
being both a mother
<br />
and a daughter!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our notion of spatial movement depends on the idea of a time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimension for something to have moved from one location in space at an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; earlier time to another location at a later time; if you believe the present
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is &quot;moving forward&quot; along our universe's time dimension, that requires some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort of meta-time for it to make sense in the same way (as in, 'at an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; earlier point in meta-time, the present moment was 1985; but later in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meta-time, the present moment had moved forward to 2006').
</em><br />
<br />I don't believe the present  is &quot;moving forward&quot; along our universe's
<br />
time dimension.
<br />
I think new present states are popping into existence
<br />
and remaining unchanged thereafter.

<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And then you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same issue with whether you take an A-series view or a B-series view of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meta-time, and if you want to adopt an A-series view you'd have to introduce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meta-meta-time to make sense of that, and so forth.
</em><br />
<br />It's all B-series, as I have said.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; . And as he admits, he is &quot;assuming that such a thing as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; becoming is possible without describing or explaining it&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It is philoosphically respectable to regard tiem as fundamental.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;something has to be fundamental.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's &quot;philosophically respectable&quot; because it has such a long history, but I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can think of a number of similar ideas with a long history that don't seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in any way coherent to me, like the notion of &quot;free will&quot; as distinct from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determinism or randomness or  any combination of the two.
</em><br />
<br />Well I have an argument for that too...
<br />
<br />In any case, it is a question of showing a contradiction,
<br />
not of things &quot;seeming incoherent&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Mathematical Platonism also doesn't (obviously) have the resources
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to keep &quot;worlds&quot; separate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure it does. Different Turing machine programs are mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;objects,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; no?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Different substrings within TM programmes can be identical, no ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sure, but you still aren't explaining how this suggests beings in one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program would have knowledge of programs different from their own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you had two simulations which behaved identically in some region of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulated space and time, then simulated observers within these regions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have identical experiences, but they are still both experiencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things which happen in their own simulation, they have no knowedge of events
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which don't correspond to anything in their simulation, which is what you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seemed to be suggesting earlier when you claimed that if the &quot;everything&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea was right we should be able to observe events in alternate worlds which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; didn't happen in our own world.
</em><br />
<br />The set of every mathematical possibility includes possibilites where
<br />
the internal thoughts, memories etc are completely out of
<br />
sync with what is going on externally (and/or with each other).
<br />
<br />Platonia is NOT a Matrix theory. In the Matrix , one world
<br />
is simulated, in Platonia every mathematical possibility is.
<br />
<br />Most mathematical possibilities make no sense physically.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Bearing in mind that the physical  universe provides us with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;mechanism --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;spatio-temporal location -- which allows identical things to be kept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;separate,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;and which doesn't exit in Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But we're not talking about keeping identical things separate, we're talking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about keeping *different* things separate, namely different worlds within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;everything&quot; (like a lawlike universe vs. a universe that obeys one set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of laws up to a given moment but then switches over to totally different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Harry Potter' laws after that moment).
</em><br />
<br />The two universes you mention are identical up to a point. They both
<br />
might include verions of me.
<br />
<br />(I notice that time seems to have come bac into the picture, BTW)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;  If you run a particular Turing machine program which contains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligent beings, will they somehow have psychic knowledge of what's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; happening in other distinct programs? Obviously not, we could run the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; program on a real computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;uh-uh! Real programmes are run at distinct spatio-temporal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;locations. They don't exist in Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the programs themselves are distinct, just like the integers 8 and 9 are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinct. Are you saying that we can have no concept of 8 and 9 being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different numbers without referring to specific collections of 8 objects and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 9 objects at different spatio-temporal locations? If you're not saying this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what makes programs any different from integers? After all, you can make a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one-to-one mapping between the set of all integers and the set of all turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine programs.
</em><br />
<br />But substrings in the programmes will be identical, as I have said.
<br />
The &quot;running on different machines&quot; analogy doesn't work, since
<br />
space is supposed to emerge form programmes in Platonia.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;  and see that the beings have no such mysterious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; knowledge, and barring errors the ideal &quot;Platonic&quot; program should have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; same output as the 'physical' instantiation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;That is beside the point. The question is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;waht it woould feel like to be in the programme.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unless you are an extreme mind/body dualist, the feelings and thoughts of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being in a computer program should correspond to the type of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information-processing going on in his simulated brain,
</em><br />
<br />Not quite. Physicalists can reject computationalism. Feelings
<br />
(particularly) might supervene on non-information-processing
<br />
physics.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and should generally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correspond to what the simulated being claims to be experiencing within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation.
</em><br />
<br />It's very possible that they actually wouldn't.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If he doesn't say he's experiencing an infinite number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes at once when you examine the program's output, then you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably assume he isn't.
</em><br />
<br />That is entirely academic, since no Platonic simulation exists.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course there is still the issue of whether he's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually &quot;experiencing&quot; anything at all, or whether he's a philosophical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zombie with no qualia at all (see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie</a> ).
</em><br />
<br />Quite.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; ('physical' from the perspective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of the most fundamental laws of our universe, which could itself be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; program running in a bigger universe or in 'Platonia').
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The laws of physics, then, are &quot;in&quot; the programme -- not vice--versa.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't understand this comment. What would it mean for the program to be in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the laws of physics?
</em><br />
<br />It means a phsyical computer, like the one in front
<br />
of you, in a physical universe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And what relation does this have to the context of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim that 'barring errors the ideal &quot;Platonic&quot; program should have the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; output as the 'physical' instantiation'?
</em><br />
<br />We just have to hope or assume the programme isn't a zombie.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;All mathematical multiverse theories have the implication that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I have many identical counterparts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Identical&quot; only to the extent they are experiencing the exact same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; you are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Nope. Also identical in that they share all my memories up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;until time T , when things turn Harry Potter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, but the point is that the version of you in the universe where the laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of nature *didn't* change after time T is no longer identical to the version
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of you in the universe where they did,
</em><br />
<br />But he would still identify himself as me. What entitles me
<br />
to claim to be the real me, when we have 99.99% of our memories in
<br />
common ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and there's no reason that you in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-Harry-Potter universe would have any awareness of what he's experiencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at this moment.
</em><br />
<br />It's mathematically possible for both sets of memories to splice
<br />
up again. You keep assuming Platonia has sensible laws of physics.
<br />
<br />But physical laws are a constraint on All Mathematical Possibilities.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; There's no reason to think that counterparts basically similar to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; you but having different experiences (say, of a hippogriff flying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the window) would have some sort of psychic knowledge of each other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;They would share my memories, identify themselves as me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;and so on. There would be counterparts which have my memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;up to time T, then an outpurst of HP, then normal memories from time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;T+1 onwards.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I agree. But again, the version of you in the universe with no HP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events would not have any awareness of them.
</em><br />
<br />And the other version would. Yet my memories are consistent.
<br />
That can only be a coincidence , if I am in Platonia.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have my doubts that philosophers of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mathematics would see the categories described here as mutually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;exclusive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, a formalist, to the extent he believes there is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truth about whether certain statements are derivable from a set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;axioms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and rules of inference, is just a species of platonist as I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;which is not how eeverybody else defines it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; If not, then perhaps that's just because they don't in fact think that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;formalism&quot; means believing there's an objective truth about whether a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; statement is derivable from a given set of axioms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It's because they do think Platonism means numbers exist in some sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Only in the sense that they must be included in an exhaustive list of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective truths about reality. Again, my understanding is that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basically is how most analytic philosophers would *define* existence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; including philosophers studying philosophy-of-math.
</em><br />
<br />That would be question-begging.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; If you are claiming that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;everybody&quot; does think that formalists believe this, yet they are still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; considered &quot;Platonists&quot; in any way, I'd like to see some evidence for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; claim.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Formalism is alaways cited as a different position to Platonism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I didn't just ask for evidence that formalists and Platonists are different,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I asked for evidence that there is anyone who considers them completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different but who *also* understands &quot;formalists&quot; to be acknowledging that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are objective mind-independent truths about whether a given formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system produces a given theorem (as opposed to just understanding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'formalists' to be saying that mathematics is a game we humans play with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deriving theorems from axiomatic systems, without making any claims that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is an objective truth about whether our derivations are 'correct' or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not).
</em><br />
<br />Whatever. If formalism is true, Platonism is false.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;But if any non-Platonic hteory is correct, truths do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;need to refer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you provide a quote or citation for the idea that any philosophers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; math subscribe to a view where there are objective truths about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; objects yet the statements do not refer?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;Logicism is the thesis that mathematics is reducible to logic, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;hence nothing but a part of logic (Carnap 1931/1883, 41). Logicists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;hold that mathematics can be known a priori, but suggest that our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;knowledge of mathematics is just part of our knowledge of logic in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;general, and is thus analytic, not requiring any special faculty of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;mathematical intuition&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics</a>
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, but are you assuming that purely logical statements don't refer?
</em><br />
<br />Yes. &quot;Analytic&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I said earlier, this criticism would only make sense if we had some prior
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion of &quot;existence&quot;, and I was trying to make the argument that objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth necessarily implies this prior notion. But I'm not, I'm just defining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the word &quot;existence&quot; in terms of objective truths, because I can't think of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any way to define the word that seems coherent and which doesn't lead to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bizarre conclusions like &quot;nothing exists beyond the boundaries of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observable universe&quot; (except possibly for the notion of equating existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with consciousness, which might make sense and would potentially allow for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical structures containing intelligent observers which nevertheless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't 'exist'). I agree that if we define &quot;existence&quot; in your way,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical objects do not exist. I just don't think your way of defining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is how most philosophers would define it, particularly the analytic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophers who study philosophy of mathematics;
</em><br />
<br />OTOH, they don't all define it your way,
<br />
or they would all be Platonists.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; most of them would define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it in a way more similar to mine, I think. This is a sociological question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather than a philosophical one, I suppose we'd have to do a poll or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something to be sure.
</em><br />
<br />No, it can be settled. Empirically, you are conscious.
<br />
I am conscious. Those are not mathematical
<br />
facts. Therefore there are non-mathematical
<br />
truths. Therefore, there is non-mathematical
<br />
existence, by your definition.
<br />
<br />Moreover, nothing beyond non-mathematical existence
<br />
is needed to explain mathematical truth, since it
<br />
is analytic.
