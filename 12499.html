<br />
Bruno,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Thank you for responding. Of course I have no right to expect a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response from anybody, but I was starting to just wonder if I HAD
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been a bit rude! :-) And of course now it serves me right if I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can't understand some of what you have written ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. 'Assuming the digital mechanist thesis, ...  least there could be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an ultimate *partial* sort of meta-answer.'
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmmmm, and is there a plain English version accessible to anyone
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with far less than a degree in mathematics? [ En Francaise tres
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simple, c'est aussi possible pour mois avec l'assistance des
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;services Google de traduction. Mais il faut que mes responses fut
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;en Anglaise par ce que detruir la lange Francaise a cause de mois
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fut tellment triste a tois et n'aurais pas d'utilite. ]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Me here, you there. You are an other to me. And I assume, in light
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the 'Tit for Tat' strategy and its intrinsic simplicity and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;empirically tested/modelled effectiveness, that acting ethically
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;towards you and [other] others is the approach most likely to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;facilitate the creation of value accessible to us both. In plain
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English I like to put that now as: My vocation is that I help
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others. My preferred method is to Enquire, Inform, Empower and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entertain.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will all die. There is no good evidence to support any other
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assertion about how we ultimately end up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. ' ... say also that there was nothing before birth. In that case I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(the first person &quot;I&quot;) would have emerge from nothing. ...'  Yep!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In plain English, rough and ready terms that's it! But actually we
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can of course quibble about what is 'nothing', because 'nothing'
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;isn't anything. So a more sophisticated assertion is that each of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us is an emergent property of, well, the universe. I can be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;romantic and say: this experience of being here now is what it is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like to be the universe looking at itself from a particular point
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of view. It works or me, probably because I now know how to not
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take myself too seriously.  [Sh*t a brick! One look in the mirror
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;makes that one clear -] But I have been disappointed at the number
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of people who have quibbled at the idea.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. That 'I' might 'come back again' ... DOESN'T RING TRUE! To put it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;succinctly, all these ideas of human awareness being related to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some non-physical entity and possibly being able to endure beyond
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the death of the body are all from the pre-scientific universe:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the time before this. There is nothing amongst all of the new
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge discovered about the world through the application of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scientific method that lends support to any of these soul or
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disembodiable spirit based ideas concerning our awareness. The
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only reason these kinds of ideas still have some kind of general
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;currency is ignorance concerning the mind blowing efficacy of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scientific method and the fruits of its application. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......................... I will now dismount from that soap box,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not before reminding readers that the effect that scientific
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;method has had on the human species is of the same order of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;importance as the acquisition of versatile grammar. Before true
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grammar people had the ability to refer to things not present but
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only in the very simplest of terms, and to use a limited
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vocabulary and simple two-item juxtapositions to associate a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subject with a simple predicate with no recursions. That state of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affairs may have lasted several hundred thousand years. The advent
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of versatile grammar allowed the creation of complex predicates
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with multiple recursions ie phrases, clauses and sub-clauses. This
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allowed the telling of stories and thus discussion, in principle
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at least, of absolutely anything.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Ask the question: Why would anybody want to reconstitute and let
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loose a person from the distant past?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. It does not seem particularly coherent to say: 'There is no
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;universe' because this is equivalent to saying that nothing exists
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. People who are completely paralysed depend on others whose muscles
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARE in working order and properly connected to their brains/CNS.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe this dependency may be mitigated in the future by the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creation of implants and prosthetic attachments which allow the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;direct reading of brain states to control other prosthetic machinery.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;10. '...except when you are witnessing what I would call a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reductionist view of numbers and machine...' I am not clear about
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what you mean here. I see numbers as human constructs;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mathematical objects embodied in the logico-mathematical language
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system. As I see it, mathematical objects derive their existence
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and power from the way they are defined. Because of their clarity
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fixed meanings numbers and other math. objects have allowed
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people to express summarised and succinct descriptions of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;processes in the world, where the world has manifested groupings
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and recursively generated properties amenable to algorithmic
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;analysis. This almost certainly indicates that the universe is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made of parts or processes which are constituted at their smallest
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;levels by existents  which are many, small, and relatively simple.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the fact that so many apparently completely arbitrary
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numbers [such as ratios and constants] are needed to describe the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relationships between physical things indicates I think that the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ground base of physical reality may not be constituted by
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relationships equivalent to integers. Perhaps it is that the true
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constituents of nature are more akin to bundles of connections
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with fractal dimensionality because they are not in anyway static.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our concept and perception of apparent enduring structures and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identity of things in the world being entirely emergent properties.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;11. 'I could even argue (as I do from times to times) that modern
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(post-godelian) mechanism is a sort of very powerful vaccine
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against a vast class of reductionist view of both human and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machine' -------  What does that mean?  :-[

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This already depends a lot of what you mean by &quot;me&quot; and &quot;you&quot;. In any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case I am not sure you can *know* things like that. It could be a form 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of wishful thinking. And in order to add something obvious: the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prediction &quot;you will not live forever&quot; is neither confirmable (with or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without comp) nor refutable (with comp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You may be right and sometimes I hope so, but I have no certainty 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here. After all most among those who say that there is &quot;nothing&quot; after 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; death say also that there was nothing before birth. In that case I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (the first person &quot;I&quot;) would have emerge from nothing. Going back to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing when dead, how could I be sure I will not come back again? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps by being some new born baby? Perhaps with my memories 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconstituted by some far away future technologies?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the fact is, being conscious is inherently paradoxical, and there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     is no escape from the paradox, just like there is no escape from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the universe - until you die that is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us hope! To be sure even G* provides a hope we can die eventually, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but evidences are there that it could be less easy than we are used to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think. There could be a rather long Tibetan like Bardo-Thodol to go 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through before ... I really don't know, for sure. I *can * ask the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lobian machine, but it is today intractable, the machine will answer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after the sun blows up.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Your impressions, perceptions, feelings, intuitions, etc. of being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     here now [where you are of course] is what it is like to be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     updating of the model of self in the world which you brain is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     constantly constructing all the time you are awake. When you sleep
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     there are times when enough of the model gets evoked that you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     a dream that you can remember. The paradox is that for most of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     time we assume that this awareness - consciousness, call it what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     you like - IS the world, i.e. what it is like to be 'me' here now,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     whereas in fact it is only what it is like to be the model of 'me'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     here now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To assert without doubt that GOD, NATURE or the UNIVERSE exist is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neither correct science and/or theology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Think about it! This is what you should be really concentrating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     on, because you and I are NOTHING if our muscles can't be made to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     move in exactly the right way and the right time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Certainly not. Just think about people who are &quot;completely&quot; paralyzed. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;completely&quot; relatively to the local available technologies. To say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they are nothing is a exaggerated shortcut. Have you see the movie: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Jonathan got his gun&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think I can agree with many things you are saying, except when you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are witnessing what I would call a reductionist view of numbers and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine. I could even argue (as I do from times to times) that modern
