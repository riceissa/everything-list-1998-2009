While it's true that you don't NEED infinite chains of Great Programmers,
<br />
they happen anyway.  Since all possible worlds exist, then all possible
<br />
programmers exist, and all possible (finite) programs will eventually be
<br />
written by them given sufficient time.
<br />
<br />And they don't necessarily have to be great programmers.  Obviously, the
<br />
vast majority of the infinite collection of programs that are written within
<br />
these infinite worlds will be buggy, ill-behaved, or even ill advised,
<br />
resulting in many worlds containing no self-aware-substructures at all, or
<br />
perhaps even lawyers and politicians.  But an infinite number of them will
<br />
give rise to things like chocolate and love, and even more programmers
<br />
capable of great programs.  (Actually, I just thought of a Great Program,
<br />
but alas the margins of this message are too small to contain it.)
<br />
<br />Of course, even the greatest of these great programs may not be fully
<br />
appreciated by their authors, who generally only have time to observe a very
<br />
small portion of their output bitstrings.  How many times throughout the
<br />
multiverse has a careless slip of the hand sent a blast of particularly
<br />
strong caffeinated beverage (or a particularly hot cup of tea) cascading
<br />
into the mechanism, prematurely terminating one of the greatest of all Great
<br />
Programs?
<br />
<br />Fortunately for us, there are lots of worlds where the program doesn't get
<br />
aborted.  For any given Great Program, there ought to be a very large number
<br />
of worlds wherein that particular program is written, and in some of them
<br />
that program may have the opportunity to run long enough to give rise to
<br />
beautifully complex worlds, which give rise to even more programmers writing
<br />
more programs that define even more worlds, and on and on, until someone
<br />
writes that original program again.  And of course it doesn't stop there
<br />
(and it definitely doesn't start there either).
<br />
<br />So for any given world, there are a large number of programmers in a large
<br />
collection of worlds who can justifiably take credit for writing it, and
<br />
also no credit at all, since there is also a large collection of worlds
<br />
containing mindless automatons busily enumerating all possible programs.
<br />
<br />Seems to me there may be somewhere in all this a proof of the existence or
<br />
non-existence of God, depending on which God Model one subscribes to (if
<br />
any).  Perhaps a proof of the existence of the immortal soul can be
<br />
glimpsed.  Of course, all this is impossible.  But then, I long ago
<br />
reconciled myself to the notion of living in a world of measure zero.
<br />
<br />Gotta go, the water is boiling and my teacup awaits.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Great post from Juergen Schmidhuber. A superb explanation, from an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unexpected source (computer science), of the subjective nature of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything. Lots of people - like me until recently - talk about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjectivity and fail to see the enormity of the idea.  I have ccd this to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Vic Stenger, who I have failed to move even slightly towards this view,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which he regards as bordering on solipsism (Hi, Vic, hope Japan
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't sink
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into the sea as our economic data indicate).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One point of disagreement with Juergen: you don't need  infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strings of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; great programmers.  There need be no great programmer, just the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program. And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since there's no programmer to make it complicated, the program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is as simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as it can be.
