<br />Not at all. I am just a logician showing that any consistent being  
<br />
(human, machine, extraterrestrial, angels, gods, etc.) cannot believe  
<br />
both in digital mechanism and materialism. It *is* the only  
<br />
consequence I have ever been interested in. My primary goal is to show  
<br />
that mechanism does not solve the mind body problem per se, as  
<br />
Descartes understood quite well already. Indeed with mechanism, you  
<br />
have to justify the appearance of matter without postulating a  
<br />
universe. The math part just makes the same reasoning a bit more  
<br />
constructive, to please some local mathematicians who found my work  
<br />
too much easy as to give a PhD thesis (sic). It is a bit ironical  
<br />
because I found the math part before the non math part. But both  
<br />
amounts to the same thing. If I am a machine, physical laws are  
<br />
emerging from the logic of numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's nothing wrong with focusing on the issues that interest you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most. But for the world-at-large, the primary issue is *why* we should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accept in the first place that persons represented by unimplemented
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations are conscious.
</em><br />
<br />I interpret your &quot;unimplemented computation&quot; by &quot;not implemented in  
<br />
the *physical* world&quot; because a computation is always implemented in  
<br />
some universal machine language, be it Conway game of life, Fortran,  
<br />
Combinators or or Elementary Arithmetic.
<br />
All my work (theses, papers, and my talk on this and other lists)  is  
<br />
just that: the notion of matter does not even make sense for a  
<br />
mechanist. Many got the point with the first seven steps of the UDA,  
<br />
and the MGA is intended for people, like Peter Jones, who insists that  
<br />
consciousness can appear only when the computation is implemented in a  
<br />
&quot;real primary material word&quot;. For many this is just an ad hoc moves to  
<br />
save physics as the fundamental science. The MGA is intended to show  
<br />
that even that magical move does not work. Indeed, from a purely  
<br />
logical point of view, you can still believe that the seven first  
<br />
steps of the UDA proves only that our physical universe is too much  
<br />
&quot;little&quot; to run any significant part of a real UD. After the MGA, as I  
<br />
suspect you already understand, we just don't need to run the UD. Its  
<br />
&quot;natural&quot; atemporal running is already contained in the set of  
<br />
elementary arithmetical truth.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ok, I see your point. Computations are actions that people (or

<br />Why in our world? In (or relatively to) any universal machine,  
<br />
material or immaterial. Sorry for not having been clear of that. I use  
<br />
the term &quot;implementation&quot; in the sense of theoretical computer  
<br />
science. By using Godel's trick I could define implementation purely  
<br />
with numbers and addition + multiplication.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So it's still not quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right to refer to &quot;persons represented by unperformed computations&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I still want some concise way of correctly saying what I'm trying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to say.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Some believe that for having a real conscious person, you have to  
<br />
implement it in a real primary material universe. It is clearly what  
<br />
Peter Jones thinks. I am saying that a person can be fully conscious  
<br />
like you or me, even when implemented either directly in arithmetic,  
<br />
or in a mathematical physical universe itself implemented in  
<br />
arithmetic (or fortran, whatever). I think your point is just the same  
<br />
than mine: we don't need a material bottom.
<br />
The question for the existence of mathematical physical universe   
<br />
(your mathematical physicalism) is an open one. If it exists, we have  
<br />
to explain how it wins the &quot;measure of uncertainty&quot; battle on all  
<br />
other programs which reach also your mind computational state in the  
<br />
universal deplyment. All right? (this follows from step seven).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Mathematical facts play the role that physical existence is supposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to play for materialists.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />I would say &quot;some mathematical facts&quot;. But I agree with that. And  
<br />
those mathematical facts, after Godel Turing and Co., can even explain  
<br />
consciousness, where pure physicalism fails (and the UDA-MGA) explains  
<br />
in detail why physicalism has to fail there.

<br /><br />Yes sure. Although in some context (like the prove by absurdo that

on the vocabulary so as not to confuse the other. For that reason I am

not sure you will appreciate the MGA, because you clearly seem to be

aware we don't need material stuff. (Unlike Greg Egan, by as Stathis

said, he needs the stuff for making his story novel).
