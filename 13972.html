<br />
If I understand the Measure Problem correctly, we wonder why we find
<br />
ourselves in a &quot;Goldilocks Universe&quot; of stars and galaxies rather than
<br />
a simpler universe consisting solely of blackbody radiation, or a more
<br />
complex, unpredictable Harry Potter universe.
<br />
<br />1. An attempt at the solution was that more complex universes are less
<br />
probable; they are less likely to be produced by a random UTM. This
<br />
explains why induction works, why we don't live in a Harry Potter
<br />
universe. But this also means a simple blackbody radiation universe is
<br />
more probable than a Goldilocks Universe.
<br />
<br />2. So we say, &quot;There are more observers in a Goldilocks Universe,
<br />
where observers evolve through natural selection, than in a blackbody
<br />
radiation universe, where observers can only occasionally emerge
<br />
through extremely infrequent statistical anomalies.&quot; But if both the
<br />
Goldilocks Universe and the blackbody radiation universe are infinite
<br />
in size, then both have an infinite number of observers.
<br />
<br />3. Maybe we say, &quot;The Goldilocks Universe produces more observers per
<br />
cubic meter.&quot; But then someone can propose the Tiny Blackbody
<br />
Universe, which looks like an infinite region of blackbody radiation
<br />
in our universe, but where everything is smaller by a factor of 10 to
<br />
power of 1000. Why don't we live in the Tiny Universe? And at the very
<br />
least, why does the universe waste all this empty space around us?
<br />
<br />Here is one possible solution: the UTM instead directly produces a
<br />
qualia (or, if you prefer, substitute &quot;observer moment&quot; or whatever
<br />
terminology you deem appropriate). We'll use a broad definition of
<br />
&quot;qualia&quot; that can encompass complex observations like &quot;Rolf sits at
<br />
his keyboard, reflecting on past observations and wondering why he
<br />
seems to live in a Goldilocks Universe&quot;, since that's exactly the type
<br />
of observation that we're trying to explain when we ponder the Measure
<br />
Problem.
<br />
<br />Each qualia, in the proposed model, is a long, finite-length string
<br />
that is output by a UTM running every possible random program. (This
<br />
is the same type of UTM that some of you have been proposing, but it
<br />
outputs an attempt at a single qualia, rather than outputting an
<br />
entire universe.) Very few strings are qualia; most UTM programs fail
<br />
to produce qualia. The proposed model additionally postulates that
<br />
many qualia are compressible in a certain interesting way, such that
<br />
the World-Index-Compression Postulate (below) is true.
<br />
<br />World-Index-Compression Postulate: The most probable way for the
<br />
output of a random UTM program to be a single qualia, is through
<br />
having a part of the program calculate a Universe, U, that is similar
<br />
to the universe we currently are observing; and then having another
<br />
part of the program search through the universe and pick out a
<br />
substring by using an search algorithm SA(U) that tries to find a
<br />
random sentient being in U and emit his qualia as the final output.
<br />
<br />As an example, take two qualia, that we will call Q(Goldilocks) and
<br />
Q(Potter):
<br />
<br />Q(Goldilocks): &quot;All my life I have read that all swans are white. And
<br />
indeed, today I just saw a white swan.&quot;
<br />
<br />Q(Potter): &quot;All my life I have read that all swans are white. But,
<br />
today I just saw a black swan.&quot;
<br />
<br />The measure (or &quot;probability&quot;, if you prefer) of Q(Goldilocks) is
<br />
greater than the measure of Q(Potter). Why? Perhaps Q(Goldilocks) and
<br />
Q(Potter) are both 5000 bits long; it's almost impossible that any
<br />
random UTM program would output either qualia directly by using a 5000
<br />
bit program. But postulate that there are shorter programs to emit
<br />
these types of qualia:
<br />
<br />Smallest Goldilocks Program's code: (outputs Q(Goldilocks))
<br />
<br />1. Execute subroutine to internally generate the Goldilocks Universe.
<br />
(This subroutine is 1000 bits long)
<br />
<br />2. Search through the infinite universe you generated, until you find
<br />
something that has a head and seems to react to swans. Look inside its
<br />
head, and output the contents of whatever is inside its head. (This
<br />
subroutine is 500 bits long)
<br />
<br />Total program size: 1500 bits.
<br />
<br /><br />Smallest Potter Program's code: (outputs Q(Potter))
<br />
<br />1. Execute subroutine to internally generate the Potter Universe.
<br />
(This subroutine is 1020 bits long, since Potter is more complex than
<br />
Goldilocks)
<br />
<br />2. Search through the infinite universe you generated, until you find
<br />
something that has a head and seems to react to swans.  Look inside
<br />
its head, and output the contents of whatever is inside its head.
<br />
(This subroutine is 500 bits long)
<br />
<br />Total program size: 1520 bits. The Potter qualia is 20 bits longer,
<br />
and therefore is literally a million times less likely than the
<br />
Goldilocks qualia in this scenario.
<br />
<br /><br />What about the blackbody radiation universe? Because the universe is
<br />
totally random, you can't efficiently use the same trick as in the
<br />
more orderly universes. Your Search Algorithm will eventually find a
<br />
thermal fluctuation that looks like &quot;something reacting to a swan&quot; and
<br />
will output the contents of its head; however, the head is just going
<br />
to contain an uncorrelated sea of thermal radiation, rather than a
<br />
qualia.
<br />
<br />Q(Goldilocks) is a more likely output than Q(Potter), and is also more
<br />
likely than a similar qualia output from a blackbody radiation
<br />
universe. Therefore, the World-Index Compression Postulate, if true,
<br />
provides one possible solution to the Measure Problem.
