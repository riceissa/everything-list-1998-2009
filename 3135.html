<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: hal.domain.name.hidden
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So you believe these people are insane, that they are mentally ill.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You believe that they perhaps would benefit from consulting a doctor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps they are even a danger to themselves or others?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.  Themselves primarily, but possibly others too.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What category of mental illness would you attribute to those who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe in quantum immortality?  Looking at the list of disorders at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://www.mentalhealth.com/">http://www.mentalhealth.com/</a>, the most likely possibility seems to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Delusional Disorder, <a href="http://www.mentalhealth.com/dis1/p21-ps02.html">http://www.mentalhealth.com/dis1/p21-ps02.html</a>,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or perhaps Schizophrenia.  These are the ones which mention delusions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which is apparently what you consider this belief to entail.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delusional of grandiose type, perhaps.  Shared Psychotic Disorder 
<br />
(<a href="http://www.mentalhealth.com/fr20.html">http://www.mentalhealth.com/fr20.html</a>) seems a better fit.  But I'm no 
<br />
doctor and even a doctor would need to learn a lot more about people's 
<br />
personal lives than I would care to to make a diagnosis.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I'll tell you what I do know.  I have had many encounters with 
<br />
crackpots on the internet.  I'm talking about people who believe in 
<br />
perpetual motion (free energy), that relativity is wrong, that quantum 
<br />
mechanics is wrong, etc.  These people do not simply hold mistaken beliefs.  
<br />
They hold them religiously.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first the problem seems simple: they need someone to explain some 
<br />
physics to them and correct their misconceptions.  Explaining the physics to 
<br />
them doesn't work, though.  They rationalize their way around anything you 
<br />
can say to them.  I know I'm personally somewhat ineloquent and tend to be 
<br />
overly frank, but I've seen many other people try to help out as well.  The 
<br />
observing crowd is firmly on the side of accepted science, so someone will 
<br />
often help.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know if there is a medically accepted disorder that covers 
<br />
crackpots, but there should be.  Perhaps their ego is so much on the line 
<br />
that it blinds them.  It doesn't help that the arguments end up getting 
<br />
bogged down deeper and deeper into technical issues simply because the 
<br />
rationalizations they use get more complicated.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I would say that I've seen a similar phenomenon with the FIN 
<br />
crowd.  You may not agree, but at least you should believe that I do think 
<br />
they aren't rational, and am not just saying that as a rhetorical device.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Despite the difficulty of the concepts, the slipperiness of the reasoning, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the many alternative interpretations, you are so convinced of your own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;correctness that you think someone must be insane to disagree with you?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of FIN, yes.  Of course I do not think that anyone who 
<br />
merely entertains the idea is insane, just those who hold to it.  For 
<br />
example, Don Page at one time thought &quot;quantum suicide&quot; would work.  Another 
<br />
person (and I) explained the problems with it, and he soon realized that it 
<br />
wouldn't.  I have no problem with that.  (see 
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m592.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m592.html</a>, ironically with a comment 
<br />
by James Higgo that presumably he would have later disclaimed.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of James Higgo, I actually think that the fact that there 
<br />
was a long pause at a certain time in the activity of this list, and 
<br />
especially in my posts, allowed him time to come to his own rational 
<br />
conclusions (and thus reject FIN) without the ego-problem of losing a heated 
<br />
argument.  Perhaps my posts do more harm to the anti-FIN cause than good you 
<br />
might then say, but on the other hand the alternative of letting the FIN go 
<br />
unchallenged and presumably be likely to snare new recruits seems a larger 
<br />
risk.
