<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand [Saibal's] point, but I think you are making an invalid assumption 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the relationship between a random sampling of all the OM's available 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to an individual and that individual's experience of living his life. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose a trillion trillion copies of my mind are made today on a computer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and run in lockstep with my biologically implemented mind for the next six 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; months, at which point the computer is shut down.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, and I note that these are *precisely* identical instantiations.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This means that most of my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure is now in the latter half of 2005, in the sense that if you pick an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moment at random out of all the observer moments which identify 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves as being me, it is much more likely to be one of the copies on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computer.
</em><br />
<br />What?  And I thought that I had understood how the term &quot;Observer
<br />
Moment&quot; is used on this list!  :-(
<br />
<br />Is the following true, or isn't it:  identical OMs are identified.
<br />
That is, N identical instances (say, running on N identical mainframes)
<br />
are thought of as *one* observer moment, because they are (1st person)
<br />
indistinguishable.  At least that is how *I* have been using the term.
<br />
(They're also 3rd person indistinguishable, of course.)
<br />
<br />Bruno wrote, incidentally, &quot;With comp the relative measure from one OM
<br />
is based on all comp histories going through [those] states. We should
<br />
not measure the OM by its finite description...&quot;, and so it's possible
<br />
that he is agreeing with my usage of the term &quot;Observer Moment&quot;.&quot;
<br />
<br />Thanks for any clarification.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But what does this mean for my experience of life? Does it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean that I am unlikely to experience 2006, being somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suspended in 2005?
</em><br />
<br />I would say &quot;no&quot;. I would say that *you* must experience 2006
<br />
in your experiment, and in fact, in any universe where you
<br />
live through 2006.
<br />
<br />If we say that there are 2006 AD versions of Stathis running
<br />
anywhere in the multiverse, then it is by definition true that
<br />
you get runtime in 2006 (or that you experience 2006). What a
<br />
number of us have tried to do, perhaps mainly so that our ideas
<br />
conform with our daily values of trying to stay alive, is to
<br />
regard the *benefit* one receives from a certain amount of
<br />
runtime as the measure of the OM.
<br />
<br />Hal has very satisfactorily described the idea that you get superior
<br />
benefit if your pleasant, even-numbered-days are given twice the
<br />
measure of your odd, unpleasant days.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; More generally, if a person has N OM's available to him at time t1 and kN at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time t2, does this mean he is k times as likely to find himself experiencing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; t2 as t1?
</em><br />
<br />To me &quot;to find oneself at X,t&quot; in spacetime means to make an
<br />
observation that one is at position X at time t, or perhaps
<br />
better, that one is alive at X,t, a very 1st person description.
<br />
But then, that would tend to distinguish the experience at t2
<br />
from the experience at t1, and that is contrary to your hypothesis.
<br />
<br />By the definition I thought was in vogue here, &quot;from inside&quot;
<br />
there is just one OM, even though it's manifested at a number
<br />
of spacetime locations (the entity doesn't know the difference).
<br />
<br />On a 3rd person objective bird's-eye view the greater number of
<br />
instances do have, of course, a greater measure than does a 
<br />
single instance. So how does this translate to 1st person?
<br />
I'd suggest that one's 1st person experience---though not
<br />
memorably different---is &quot;richer&quot; and &quot;fuller&quot;, and of more
<br />
benefit to one!  :-)   Admittedly, this sounds like nonsense
<br />
if one believes that one's memories capture all of one's
<br />
experience.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suggest that this is not the right way to look at it. A person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only experiences one OM at a time, so if he has &quot;passed through&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; t1 and t2 it will appear to him that he has spent just as much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time in either interval...
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but appearances can be deceiving!  And it won't be the first
<br />
time that a patient is incorrect about which of two time intervals
<br />
actually provided him the greater benefit.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only significance of the fact that there are &quot;more&quot; OM's at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; t2 [and I take it to mean that, using the terms as I do, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OM at t2 has greater measure than the OM at t1] is that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person can expect a greater variety of possible experiences at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; t2 if the OM's are all distinct.
</em><br />
<br />Again, to me, if the experiences are distinct, then it's not the
<br />
same OM.
<br />
<br />Lee
