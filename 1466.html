&nbsp;Alastair,
<br />
<br />I will try to make my post more explicit.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Under AUH, unfortunately it is neither *necessary* for a SAS to perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; totally law-like behaviour, nor try to fit all observed behaviour to laws.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Firstly, there will be a relatively few unlucky SAS's who *do* perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dragon/WR events in any AUH (some will have more than can be explained away
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as hallucinations etc); secondly, it is the case that the majority of SAS's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on this planet would ascribe at least some paranormal events that they see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or think they see (like miracles, angels, or nde's) to divine, rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; law-based, explanations - this doesn't disqualify them from being SAS's.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />An SAS will do its best to fit its universe to some set of laws. However, like
<br />
fitting a simple curve to data, this will not be perfect. What happens if there
<br />
is an outlier data point (corresponding to a witnessed dragon event)? Choices
<br />
are, you can discard it (the hallucination response), or, if you can, you can
<br />
fit a better fitting curve (update/posit lawlike explanation). A divine
<br />
explanation still refers to a set of principles unknown to yet accepted by the
<br />
believer, but this is probably no better than just simply assuming there is a
<br />
non-divine law-based explanation, which is unknown.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that a minimal number of dragon events could in practice be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dismissed as a mass-hallucination or something like that, but one cannot use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this fact to *explain* the lack of established dragon events, not least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the main counter to the AUH is that there should be *maximal*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; law-less behaviour, consistent with the existence of a SAS (so perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events on Earth would be straightforward, but elsewhere (except for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life-supporting Sun) they would be chaotic). To refute this we need more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; careful analysis, such as that in Russell's paper, or my web site. (For MWI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instead of AUH it's a whole different ball-game.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />What I am driving at is the SAS will do its best to minimize its perception of
<br />
lawlessness in its universe, by doing the curve-fitting, so to speak. With
<br />
complete or too much lawlessness, it will cease to be aware of itself, or
<br />
practically of anything, because there is no stable environment and no
<br />
principles it can use to learn and predict. An awareness of self requires a
<br />
stable enough, predictable enough background provided by laws. Knowledge of
<br />
these laws is another matter.
<br />
<br />Rather than taking the dragon event to be an example of lawlessness, it is
<br />
probably more helpful to treat it as a very complex event, requiring complex
<br />
laws or complex corresponding algorithms. So, your justification that dragons
<br />
are very improbable is the same as justifying that (overly) complex universes
<br />
are very improbable.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't agree that the range of fine-tuning is subjective, given a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasonable physics framework. We may have problems assessing it, or there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may be other types of SAS that we are not aware of, but that is a different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />What I mean here is best posed as a question: what is the difference between the
<br />
number of possible values for the fine structure constant, alpha, in the
<br />
following interval:
<br />
<br />(1/137.0359895-10^-25,1/137.0359895+10^-25)
<br />
<br />assuming this interval is anthropically allowed, i.e., it allows humans to
<br />
evolve. (Note: I am using the central value 1/137.0359895 from Max Tegmark's
<br />
paper,&quot;Is 'the theory of everything' merely the ultimate ensemble theory?&quot;
<br />
published in Annals of Physics, vol. 270, pp.1-51 (1998).) The point is, you
<br />
already have an infinite number of universes corresponding to each real number
<br />
contained in this anthropically allowed interval. If you make this interval
<br />
larger or smaller while preserving the SAP, how much larger or smaller an
<br />
infinite set would be enough to say there is or is no fine-tuning? There may be
<br />
a question of precision in determining alpha, but then the question is really
<br />
where do you draw the line, why, and does it matter if you already have an
<br />
infinite number of universes? To me, it seems kind of subjective.
<br />
<br />Fred
