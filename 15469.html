<br />
Bruno,
<br />
<br />It seems to me that this runs head-on into the problem of the
<br />
definition of time...
<br />
<br />Here is my argument; I am sure there will be disagreement with it.
<br />
<br />Supposing that Alice's consciousness is spread out over the movie
<br />
billboards next to the train track, there is no longer a normal
<br />
temporal relationship between mental moments. There must merely be a
<br />
&quot;time-like&quot; relationship, which Alice experiences as time. But, then,
<br />
we are saying that wherever a logical relationship exists that is
<br />
time-like, there is subjective time for those inside the time-like
<br />
relationship.
<br />
<br />Now, what might constitute a time-like relationship? I see several
<br />
alternatives, but none seem satisfactory.
<br />
<br />At any given moment, all we can be directly aware of is that one
<br />
moment. If we remember the past, that is because at the present moment
<br />
our brain has those memories; we don't know if they &quot;really&quot; came from
<br />
the past. What would it mean to put moments in a series? It changes
<br />
nothing essential about the moment itself; we can remove the past,
<br />
because it adds nothing.
<br />
<br />The connection between moments doesn't seem like a physical
<br />
connection; the notion is non-explanatory, since if there were such a
<br />
physical connection we could remove it without altering the individual
<br />
moments, therefore not altering our memories, and our subjective
<br />
experience of time. Similarly, can it be a logical relationship? Is it
<br />
the structure of a single moment that connects it to the next? How
<br />
would this be? Perhaps we require that there is some function (a
<br />
&quot;physics&quot;) from one moment to the next? But, this does not exactly
<br />
allow for things like relativity in which there is no single universal
<br />
clock. Of course, relativity could be simulated, creating a universe
<br />
that was run be a universal clock but whose internal facts did not
<br />
depend on which universal clock, exactly, the simulation was run from.
<br />
My problem is, I suppose, that any particular definition of &quot;timelike
<br />
relationship&quot; seems too arbitrary. As another example, should any
<br />
probabilistic elements be allowed into physics? In this case, we don't
<br />
have a function any more, but a relation-- perhaps a relation of
<br />
weighted transitions. But how would this relation make any difference
<br />
from inside the universe?
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is the last MGA !
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I realize MGA is complete, as I thought it was, but I was doubting this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recently. We don't need to refer to Maudlin, and MGA 4 is not necessary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maudlin 1989 is an independent argument of the 1988 Toulouse argument (which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I present here).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that Maudlin's very interesting &quot;Olympization technic&quot;  can be used to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defeat a wrong form of MGA 3, that is, a wrong argument for the assertion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that  the movie cannot be conscious. (the argument that the movie lacks the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterfactual). Below are hopefully correct (if not very simple) argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ( I use Maudlin sometimes when people gives this non correct form of MGA 3,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and this is probably what makes me think Maudlin has to be used, at some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MGA 1 shows that Lucky Alice is conscious, and MGA 2 shows that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;luckiness&quot; feature of the MGA 1 experiment was a red herring. We can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construct, from MEC+COMP, an home made lucky rays generator, and use it at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will. If we accept both digital mechanism, in particular Dennet's principle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that neurons have no intelligence, still less prescience, and this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  *together with* the supervenience principle; we have to accept that Alice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious dream experience supervenes on the projection of her brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity movie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us show now that Alice consciousness *cannot* supervene on that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *physical* movie projection.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I propose two (deductive) arguments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mechanism implies the following tautological functionalist principle: if,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for some range of activity, a system does what it is supposed to do, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this before and after a change is made in its constitution, then the change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not change what the system is supposed to do, for that range of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Example:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - A car is supposed to broken but only if the driver is faster than 90
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; miles/h. Pepe Pepito NEVER drives faster than 80 miles/h. Then the car is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supposed to do what she is supposed to do, with respect of its range of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity defined by Pepe Pepito.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Claude bought a 1000 thousand processors computer. One day he realized
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that he used only 990 processors, for his type of activity, so he decided to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get rid of those 10 useless processors. And indeed the machine will satisfy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Claude ever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Alice has (again) a math exam. Theoreticians have correctly predict that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this special circumstance, she will never use neurons X, Y and Z.  Now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Alice go (again, again) to this exam in the same condition, but with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neurons X, Y, Z removed. Again, not only will she behaved like if she
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; succeed her exam, but her consciousness, with both MEC *and* MAT still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continue.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The idea is that if something is not useful, for an active process to go on,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for some range of activity, then you can remove it, for that range of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, consider the projection of the movie of the activity of Alice's brain,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;the movie graph&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it necessary that someone look at that movie? Certainly not. No more than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is needed that someone is look at your reconstitution in Moscow for you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be conscious in Moscow after a teleportation. All right? (with MEC
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumed of course).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it necessary to have a screen? Well, the range of activity here is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one dynamical description of one computation. Suppose we make a hole in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; screen. What goes in and out of that hole is exactly the same, with the hole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and without the hole. For that unique activity, the hole in the screen is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functionally equivalent to the subgraph which the hole removed. Clearly we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can make a hole as large as the screen, so no need for a screen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this reasoning goes through if we make the hole in the film itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Reconsider the image on the screen: with a hole in the film itself, you get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a &quot;hole&quot; in the movie, but everything which enters and go out of the hole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remains the same, for that (unique) range of activity.  The &quot;hole&quot; has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trivially the same functionality than the subgraph functionality whose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; special behavior was described by the film. And this is true for any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subparts, so we can remove the entire film itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does Alice's dream supervene (in real time and space) on the projection of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the empty movie?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remark.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1° Of course, this argument can be sum up by saying that the movie lacks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causality between its parts so that it cannot really be said that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computes any thing, at least physically. The movie is just an ordered record
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of computational states. This is neither a physical computation, nor an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (immaterial) computation where the steps follows relatively to some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal machine. It is just a description of a computation, already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existing in the Universal Deployment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2° Note this: If we take into consideration the relative destiny of Alice,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and supposing one day her brain broke down completely, she has more chance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to survive through &quot;holes in the screen&quot; than to the &quot;holes in the film&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The film contains the relevant information to reconstitute Alice from her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain description, contained on this high resolution film. Keeping comp, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abandoning the physical supervenience thesis, means that we do no more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; associate consciousness, neither on the movie, NOR on the brain special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity in a computation, but to the computation itself directly. A brain,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and even a film,  will &quot;only&quot; be a way to make bigger the probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a consciousness to manifest itself relatively to a &quot;probable&quot; universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational history.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Strictly speaking, running the movie dimimish Alice chance to have her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious experience (life) continue, at least relatively to you, because of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the many scratches the projector makes on the pellicle, which remove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relevant information for a safe reconstitution later (again relatively to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I give now what is perhaps a simpler argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A projection of a movie is a relative phenomenon. On the planet 247a, nearby
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the galaxy, they don't have screen. The film pellicle is as big as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; screen, and they make the film passing behind a stroboscope at the right
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; frequency in front of the public. But on planet 247b, movies are only for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; travellers! They dress their film, as big as those on planet 247a, in their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; countries all along their train rails with a lamp besides each frames, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is nice because from the train, through its speed, you get the usual 24
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; frames per second. But we already accepted that such movie does not need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be observed, the train can be empty of people. Well the train does not play
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any role, and what remains is the static film with a lamp behind each frame.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are the lamps really necessaries? Of course not, all right? So now we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obliged to accept that the consciousness of Alice during the projection of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the movie supervenes of something completely inert in time and space. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contradicts the *physical*  supervenience thesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exercises.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a) Someone could propose an alternate argument that a movie does not compute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and so consciousness does supervene on it) by alluding to the lack of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causality in the movie:  the movie does not handle the counterfactual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existing implicitly in computations (physical or not).  Use Maudlin's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Olympization technic to refute that argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; b) Make fun by using a non dreaming Alice. Shows that the movie (film or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; screen) graph border is needed to get the accidental zombies (the puppet).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And then the &quot;important&quot; exercise (the original goal).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; c) Eliminate the hypothesis &quot;there is a concrete deployment&quot; in the seventh
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step of the UDA. Use UDA(1...7) to define properly the computationalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenience thesis. Hint: reread the remarks above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have a good day.
