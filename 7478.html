<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Subject: Re: What does &quot;ought&quot; mean? (was RE: Duplicates Are Selves)
</em><br />
<br />I have changed the subject line once again, because this is
<br />
no longer about what &quot;ought&quot; ought to mean.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Le 04-juil.-05, à 22:18, Lee Corbin a écrit :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes, but I contend that while there are two organisms present,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there is only one person.  It's much as though some space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; aliens kidnapped you and tried to say that Pete at spacetime
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; coordinates (X1,T1) could not possibly be the same person as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Pete at coordinates (X1,T2) because the times weren't the same.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You'd have to get them to wrap their heads around the idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one person could be at two different times in the same place.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; They might find this bizarre.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm trying to tell you a possibility that you think equally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bizarre: namely that Pete(X1,T1) is the same person as Pete(X2,T1),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; namely that the same person may be at two different locations at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the same time.  That's all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I like that idea, but if they are the *same* person then we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the same person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or, perhaps you were just meaning that they are very close/similar;
</em><br />
<br />That is so: but moreover, being very very close/similar is what
<br />
should be meant by &quot;the same person&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which case you can say Pete(X2,T1) is much closer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Pete(X1,T1) than Bruno(x, now) is close to Lee(y, now).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then, strictly speaking Pete(X1,T1) is not the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person as Pete(X2,T1).
</em><br />
<br />Well, that's up for discussion!  That's what we are trying
<br />
to decide.
<br />
<br />I say that it gets pretty silly to formulate our ideas so
<br />
that we turn out not to be the same person from second to
<br />
second. Now, yes, in order to evade the notion that one is
<br />
the same person as one's duplicate across the room, people
<br />
will try anything, even denying that they have any identity
<br />
whatsoever. They are, apparently, more comfortable with the
<br />
notion that they are not the same person from second to
<br />
second that the shocking idea that they and their duplicates
<br />
are the same person.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In any case I am not sure that those distinctions have any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bearing on the existence of first person indeterminacy and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the problem to quantify that indeterminacy.
</em><br />
<br />(Yes, maybe it is detached from the question you are trying
<br />
to answer.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Imagine you are duplicated iteratively. At the start you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are in room R. You are scanned and destroyed, painlessly,
</em><br />
<br />given some of the discussions we have, :-) this is rather
<br />
pleasant to entertain
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and we tell you that you will be reconstituted in room 0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and in room 1. Then Lee0 and Lee1 are invited in room R
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again and the experience is repeated. Rooms 0 and 1 are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identical and quite separate. The only difference is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that in room 0 there is a big 0 drawn on the wall and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in room 1 there is a big 1 drawn on the wall.
</em><br />
<br />So as this is repeated, there are 2, then 4, then 8, etc.,
<br />
copies, and each of them remembers a different sequence of
<br />
0's and 1's.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are asked to bet on your immediate and less immediate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future feeling. Precisely: we ask you to choose among the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; following bets:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Immediate:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A. I will see 0 on the wall.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B. I will see 1 on the wall.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; C. I will see 0 on the wall and I will see 1 on the wall.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; D. I will see 0 on the wall or I will see 1 on the wall.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Less immediate:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A'. I will always see 0 on the wall.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B'. I will always see 1 on the wall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; C'. I will see as many 0 and 1 on the wall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; D'. I will see an incompressible sequence of 0 and 1 on the wall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And there are three versions of the experiences. In a first version you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are always reconstituted in the two rooms.
</em><br />
<br />Okay, let's handle just that for now.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We suppose obviously that you want maximize &quot;your&quot; benefit(s).
</em><br />
<br />Well, since you are asking *me*, then naturally I'll want a
<br />
global maximum for me, and so a maximal sum for each instance.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Each Lee-i is offered 5$ each time his bet is confirmed, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; loses 5$ if he makes a wrong bet.
</em><br />
<br />And yes, it would be possible to emphasize to each instance that
<br />
he is to attempt to maximize &quot;his own instance's&quot; earnings.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What will be your strategy in each version? Will your strategy differ?
</em><br />
<br />Now if the Lees know all these facts, then they'll anticipate being
<br />
in both rooms upon each iteration. Therefore, they'll anticipate
<br />
losing $5 in one room and gaining $5 in the other. They'll also
<br />
realize that all bit sequences are being carried out. Therefore,
<br />
it doesn't make any difference whatsoever. The expectation of
<br />
each sequence is exactly the same number of dollars: zero.
<br />
<br />I don't get the significance of this.
<br />
<br />Lee
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that I have purposefully avoided the use of &quot;first person&quot; in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question, and so &quot;C&quot; can be considered as a little ambiguous. My point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be to make you accept there is indeed an ambiguity in C.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the second version we tell you in advance that once on 2 iterations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are reconstituted in one room only, and this one is chosen by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; random with a coin.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the third version we don't tell you if we choose the first version
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or the second version.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We suppose obviously that you want maximize &quot;your&quot; benefit(s). Each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lee-i is offered 5$ each time his bet is confirmed, but loose 5$ if he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes a wrong bet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What will be your strategy in each version? Will your strategy differ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that I have purposefully avoided the use of &quot;first person&quot; in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question, and so &quot;C&quot; can be considered as a little ambiguous. My point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be to make you accept there is indeed an ambiguity in C.
