<br />
meaning to data, creating informations from that data.&quot;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; WHAT do you &quot;observe&quot; if you have to create the meaning? I find &gt;&gt;it a

reverse route, to learn the quantities (data) and then enrich &gt;&gt;them with

meaning to make it 'information'.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, that is what I've been saying.&lt;
</em><br />
<br />I formulated it poorly. What I meant: the way to 'sense' quantities and THEN
<br />
find out what they refer to is against my logic, I find qualities sense-able
<br />
and a
<br />
quantitative arrangement is the secondary. You cannot compare 2 with 3 if
<br />
the 2 are apples and the 3 are punches in the mouth. Quantities can be
<br />
realized
<br />
in their given association to wht thet refer to, otherwise it is 'pure math'
<br />
with
<br />
no reference, just numbers. In this realm I accept &quot;math&quot; as a separate
<br />
world,
<br />
a &quot;life&quot; itself, without meanings attached to numbers. Once you attach
<br />
meaning
<br />
it enters the world of limited models since the 'quantities' have defined
<br />
limitations. A comparison is feasible only in at least one identical
<br />
dimension.
<br />
I think (don't know if I am right) meanings with unlimited connotations
<br />
cannot
<br />
be computed, with their unlimited variability by unlimited variables. When
<br />
the undefinable, unrestricted 'wholeness' enters, comp loses its
<br />
applicability
<br />
(bit-representation). 'Natural' systems (unlimited) are not computable, only
<br />
their (reductionistically) defined models.
<br />
&nbsp;SNIP
<br />
RS:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not sure what you mean by &quot;unquantizable&quot;. Both data and meanings &gt;can be
</em><br />
mapped into the set of natural numbers, and are countable.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps where we differ is that you seem to think &quot;meanings&quot; are out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there as disembodied ideals, rather like Platonic forms, whereas as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for me, meanings cannot be detached from the observers interpreting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the data.&lt;
</em><br />
<br />Example meaning: validity of a legal opinion, or the beauty of a sunset
<br />
Would you deem these quantizable?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;SNIP
</em><br />
RS:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No sure what you mean by non-quantitative. Data is simply a bunch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of bits - differences if you like. It needs meanings attached to become
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;numbers.
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure what you mean. Do 'numbers' have meaning? IMO:
<br />
only in the so called 'applied math' as quantities of &lt;something&gt;.
<br />
Then again &quot;data&quot; are poorly identified, in the sense you apply them
<br />
they are numbered connotations, while more generally they may refer
<br />
to qualifiers unattached to numbers. A &quot;datum&quot; is 'added to something'.
<br />
If 'data' are a bunch of bits, as you qualified: differences, they HAVE the
<br />
mening already attached, to arrive at those 'differences'. Otherwise the
<br />
bits are just waiting for a sense they refer to.
<br />
A datum needs 'meaning attached' not to become &quot;number&quot;, but info.
<br />
&nbsp;SNIP
<br />
RS:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How can you compare two things without bringing them together?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps we should say &quot;connecting&quot; them?
</em><br />
<br />If they 'are' together - connected, if you like, without &quot;us&quot; bringing them
<br />
together. Like: projected overlapping graphs (unequal components).
<br />
Or a bifurcaion (trivially: a road-fork, one going up, one down).
<br />
Of course you may say that you look at them one part after the other,
<br />
to prove your time-relatedness. I may evaluate the composite image,
<br />
looking at the picture in one, to make MY (atemporal) point.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (JM earlier):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; First I find it an 'out-of-bounds' argumentative twist to change my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;term&quot;human representational way of OUR world model&quot; into your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;accidental feature of our world&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps I misunderstood what you meant by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;human representational way of OUR world model&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />I meant 'thinking about it', (as WE perceive it upon our limited skills
<br />
of observation-understanding) - while your expression refers to the
<br />
'it' itself as if we had a way to learn as it is indeed - what we have not.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Linearity of QM and nonlinearity of classical dynamics are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually related to each other. The mathematical term &quot;orthogonal&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a good metaphorical description of this. And yes, QM's linearity is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feature of the world. The world need not be linear in the way QM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;says it is, but experimentally it is known to be linear to some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;extremely high fidelity.
</em><br />
<br />Let me pass on discussing QM (especially Liouville equation(?) with you.
<br />
Your 'feature' that 'need not be' is based on experimental high fidelity -
<br />
in theory laden and slanted experiments of course, to proove a point.
<br />
With explanations formulated in the same spirit. No repetitive chance,
<br />
because the Q-measurement destroys the substrate. (Similar models?)
<br />
And assigning &quot;meanings&quot; to the bits as required for the theoretical fit.
<br />
Now this may seem exaggerated and unfair, - dismissable as such.
<br />
SNIP ...
<br />
RS:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there would be a &quot;hidden variable&quot; theory - and this, as much as is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible, has been ruled out by experiment.
</em><br />
<br />Hidden variables can only be ruled out with a complete epistemology.
<br />
We are far from that. Our models are limited, the 'out of boundary'
<br />
connotations are cut off, we do not encompass the wholeness into our
<br />
thinking. Besides the 'world' is in a ceaseless function of change. How
<br />
can we 'rule out' hidden (not yet discovered?) variables on the basis of
<br />
the model-experiments we chose to observe - and their evaluation on
<br />
the basis of the applied part of contemporary knowledge?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (Skip the rest, 'religious' etc.connotations all the way to the
</em><br />
Anthropic Principle remark)*
<br />
RS:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is not the AP at all. The AP, in effect, says that the world is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent with our existence within that world. It says nothing about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; importance - it is merely a contraint.
</em><br />
<br />I put it in reverse: WE (as products of this world) are consistent with
<br />
the world however that evolved. In 'different' universes different &quot;us&quot;
<br />
may be, with characteristics beyond our earthbound imagination.
