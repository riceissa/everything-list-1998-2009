Dear Bruno:
<br />
<br />At , you wrote:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your critics on the usefulness of the notion of consistency is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;similar to the critics by Schmidhuber on the use of provability.
</em><br />
<br />I also see my critique as similar to and something of an extension of 
<br />
Juergen's argument.  However, I believe I see different consequents.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You still seem to believe that there is a particular evolving formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;systems capable of generating &quot;our (perhaps splitting) universe&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />I do not see the evolution of a particular universe as a &quot;generation&quot; or 
<br />
any sort of extraction from an initial packet of compressed information.
<br />
<br />I do intend to study your argument over the summer, but for now I will try 
<br />
to clarify my position as it currently stands as an interim response to 
<br />
your post.
<br />
<br />Each of my &quot;formal&quot; systems has a single axiom and a set of rules [rather 
<br />
like rules of grammar] for judging which other strings are &quot;well formed 
<br />
successor&quot; strings to the axiom or to each of its successors in turn.  The 
<br />
acceptable strings are not &quot;well formed formulas&quot; in the sense of being 
<br />
theorems that extract &quot;truth&quot; from the original axiom.
<br />
<br />There are no independent rules of inference.
<br />
<br />The strings to be judged are all present in the Everything as parts of a 
<br />
meta &quot;pattern&quot;.
<br />
<br />The meta pattern is &quot;stirred&quot; by an Everything/Nothing alternation based on 
<br />
an incompleteness or undecidable re the stability of both.
<br />
<br />Each of my &quot;formal&quot; systems is actually a shifting isomorphism to the 
<br />
strings within the Everything.  A shift is a state to state transition for 
<br />
a universe - what I consider the observable.  The rules of inference [the 
<br />
physics and mathematics] of a particular system are derived from the rules 
<br />
of grammar.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In particular you seem to believe that a pure third person description
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of that evolving system is enough.
</em><br />
<br />My conscious observer is a structure within a given one of my &quot;formal&quot; 
<br />
systems that is necessarily the frequent nexus of multiple acceptable 
<br />
successor configurations to its isomorphic portion of the current string.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But in that case comp is false.
</em><br />
<br />At the moment I can not judge but I suspect that my position encompasses 
<br />
comp as one type of included rules of grammar.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And you will need some strong non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computationalist hypothesis.
</em><br />
<br />I do not see my position as supporting Juergen's because I see Chaitin's 
<br />
type of incompleteness as countering a computationalist approach.  Each of 
<br />
my &quot;formal&quot; systems has at least a little &quot;do not care&quot; in its rules of 
<br />
grammar.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And you take the risk of hiding the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mind-body problem in the process. (This follows from UDA and/or the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;movie-graph argument or Maudlin's one).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;With comp you have no choice, for isolating the laws of physics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other than to compute the measure on your computational (DU-accessible)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consistent continuations as seen by some &quot;first person point of view&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That is what the UDA argument explicitely shows, isn'it?
</em><br />
<br />Actually [if DU is UD] I think that is what I just said - sort of.  My 
<br />
particular rules of grammar imply the particular rules of inference.  The 
<br />
&quot;computation&quot; is a judgement as to acceptability of successor strings and 
<br />
the result is &quot;consistent&quot; with these rules.  However, the rules of grammar 
<br />
can have a &quot;do not care&quot; component.
<br />
<br />As to the rest of your post I will wait until I think I understand your 
<br />
position much better than I do now.
<br />
<br />As for the comments from John Mikes:  John I think your first part is an 
<br />
agreement with my position.  However, I do not see a SAS as accepting a new 
<br />
state but rather its current configuration establishes the set of possible 
<br />
alternate next states.  All of these may be accepted in a branching 
<br />
universe.  My argument against splitting is a narrow one applied to my 
<br />
application of Chaitin's type of incompleteness and its series of 
<br />
resolutions for a particular universe.
<br />
<br />Hal
