</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mind mind was ticking over a comment made by Wei Dai in his last
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;post. I had a thought, that I'll share with this group, even though it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;might be completely crazy:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What if there were an absolute measure that favours increased
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complexity of the mind (ie more complex minds are more likely), along
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the lines Wei Dai suggested in the last post. Also, it seems likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that at a certain level of complexity, minds become self reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(observe themeselves). By my observer-dependent measure arguments,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each self-reflective mind (regardless of complexity) will observe a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe, containing a mind that is just complex enough for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-reflection.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This would neatly explain why we're not ants (minds are too simple),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and why we're not superhumans (we may be, but we'll only observe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;minimal complexity self-reflective minds).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Crazy perhaps, but hopefully food for thought.
</em><br />
<br />Aha! You've hit on something similar to my own pet TOE, which is that the 
<br />
global measure on observer-moments can somehow be derived from a sort of 
<br />
&quot;theory of the anthropic principle&quot; which would have to blend in with some 
<br />
type of formal theory of consciousness, a bit like what the philosopher 
<br />
David Chalmers proposes. Here was a post I wrote on this in September:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3143.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3143.html</a>
<br />
<br />A section from this post:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm not sure it's possible to take a third-person perspective on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-sampling assumption. For one thing, the reasoning only works if I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assume *my* observer-moment is randomly selected--I can't use anyone else's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or I may get incorrect results, as if I reasoned from Adam and Eve's point 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of view in the doomsday argument. Then there is what Nick Bostrom calls the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;problem of the reference class,&quot; and I think there is a very good case to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be made that the problem can only be solved by making reference to some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sort of objective measure of  the &quot;consciousness level&quot; of a particular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moment. For example, suppose I find that I was created as one of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;two &quot;batches&quot; of humans, the first batch containing 950 members and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;second containing only 50. One batch is all-male and the other is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all-female, and I know that which batch is which sex was determined by a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;coinflip, so that a third-person observer would say there is a 50% chance 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the large batch is the male batch. However, since I observe myself to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be a male, I use the self-sampling assumption to reason that there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actually a 95% chance that the large batch was all-male, simply because I'm 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assuming that I'm as likely to be any human as any other, and 95% of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;humans were members of the large batch.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;All right so far. But suppose I now find out that one of the two batches 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was genetically engineered to lack a brain, having no consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whatsoever? Or, if you prefer, suppose that one batch is not made of real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;humans at all, but just marble statues of them. Can I still assume I am as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;likely to be any individual as any other? I don't think so--I think some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;kind of &quot;anthropic principle&quot; must come into play here, guaranteeing that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will be a conscious individual rather than an unconscious one. So, even if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the small-batch was the all-male one, I would still be guaranteed to find 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;myself a male, simply because all the &quot;females&quot; in this experiment are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;going to totally lack consciousness. It's just the same as how I can't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assume I'm &quot;randomly sampled&quot; from the set of all computations being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implemented in the universe, because the vast majority of computations, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;associated with things like the random collisions of gas molecules in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nebula, will not lead to any high-level conscious experiences...only the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very rare ones associated with biological brains which have evolved on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;planets with just the right conditions will have these sorts of experiences 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(or so I'd assume, anyway). Again, the anthropic principle must be taken 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;into account.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think this should be a matter of degree, rather than an all-or-nothing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;affair. I think other animals, at least other mammals and birds, almost 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;certainly have some kind of high-level conscious experience, so there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;something it is like&quot; to be them, but I don't think I should reason as if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I was randomly sampled from the set of all these animals, either. Indeed, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't think it's just a lucky break that I find myself to be a member of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what is probably the most intelligent species that has ever existed on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;planet earth, despite the fact that the number of animals who have ever 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lived probably vastly outweighs the number of homo sapiens who have ever 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lived. I think some sort of graded anthropic principle is likely to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;responsible here...the usual self-sampling assumption perhaps needs to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;replaced by some kind of weighted self-sampling assumption, with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;weights&quot; on an observer-moment having something to do with the complexity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the consciousness involved. Indeed, I think it would be particularly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;elegant if the whole global measure function turned out to be nothing but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this sort of weighted self-sampling assumption, although the weights would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probably have to be determined by more than *just* the level of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness (after all, an observer-moment experiencing a white rabbit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could be just as complex as a 'normal' one). In other words, I think a TOE 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;should incorporate a &quot;theory of the anthropic principle&quot; rather than just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;adding it onto a sort of global &quot;physical&quot; measure as in theories like Max 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tegmark's. The anthropic principle/physical measure distinction seems to me 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to be another version of the old mind/body duality, and it would be nice if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a TOE could erase this distinction.
</em><br />
<br />The other idea I have is that there might be an interrelationship between 
<br />
the &quot;global measure&quot; and some kind of &quot;relative measure&quot; (which tells me 
<br />
what my next experience is likely to be like, given the experience I am 
<br />
having now). In other words, the probability of being a particular 
<br />
observer-moment would not depend solely on that observer-moment's level of 
<br />
consciousness (ant vs. human, for example) but also on how many other 
<br />
observer-moments have memories of having had an experience similar to the 
<br />
one that observer-moment is having. So in some sense each observer-moment's 
<br />
&quot;degree of reality&quot; (its absolute measure) might depend on the degree to 
<br />
which other observer-moments &quot;recognize&quot; it (the relative measure between 
<br />
them and it), and their &quot;votes&quot; might themselves be weighted by their own 
<br />
absolute measure (so if I'm 'recognized' by an observer with a higher 
<br />
absolute measure it counts for more than being recognized by one with a 
<br />
lower absolute measure). This is all very sketchy and needs to be fleshed 
<br />
out, but my idea is that somehow this might give something like an infinite 
<br />
set of simultaneous equations which would allow you to bootstrap into 
<br />
existence a unique global measure function, a function which would be the 
<br />
only self-consistent way to solve these equations.
