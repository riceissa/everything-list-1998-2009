Explorations of the definitional basis of a universe and its effect on the 
<br />
idea of decisions:
<br />
<br />First examine a deterministic universe j such that [using notation from a 
<br />
post by Matthieu Walraet]:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tj                        Tj                               Tj
<br />
Sj(0) ----------------&gt; Sj(1) ----------------&gt; Sj(2) .... 
<br />
----------------&gt; Sj(i)
<br />
<br />An interpretation is that all the information needed to get from Sj(0) to 
<br />
Sj(i) is contained in Sj(0) and the rules of state evolution for that 
<br />
universe that is Tj.
<br />
<br />I see a problem with this interpretation.
<br />
<br />Suppose we write an expression for the shortest self delimiting program 
<br />
able to compute Sj(i) as:
<br />
<br />(1) Pj(i) = {Tj[Sj(i - 1)] + DLj(i)} computes Sj(i)
<br />
<br />where DLj(i) is the self delimiter.
<br />
<br />Compressing Sj(i - 1) it can be written as Pj(i - 1) and this short hand 
<br />
substituted into (1) to yield:
<br />
<br />(2) Pj(i) = {Tj[Pj(i - 1)] + DLj(i)} computes Sj(i)
<br />
<br />Note that Pj(i) is always longer than Pj(i - 1) because it contains Pj(i - 
<br />
1) plus the Tj plus the delimiter so Sj(i) contains more information [using 
<br />
the program length definition of information] than Sj(i - 1) and thus more 
<br />
information than Sj(0).
<br />
<br />What kind of information is it? I see it as location record keeping 
<br />
information. The universe is at state i of the recursion and this extra 
<br />
information is the tag providing that location. The effect has several results:
<br />
<br />1) This new information can never be removed from such a universe so its 
<br />
local &quot;time&quot; has an arrow.
<br />
<br />2) New information can manifest as either a decorrelation of the bit 
<br />
pattern of and/or an increased length of the string representing Sj(i). The 
<br />
length of the string is interpretable as &quot;space&quot; [a fixed number of bits 
<br />
say x bits describe the configuration of a small region of that &quot;space&quot; and 
<br />
there are y regions requiring description so an increase in length of the 
<br />
string causes y to increase.].  Note that the effect increases as the 
<br />
recursion progresses since DLj(i) increases monotonically with i. Thus such 
<br />
a universe should see a long term acceleration in the rate of expansion of 
<br />
its &quot;space&quot;.
<br />
<br />3) So how do we define a universe?  Suppose many universes are following 
<br />
the same recursion some at earlier states and some at later states than 
<br />
universe j.  It seems best to define such universes by the state they are 
<br />
in [which includes Tj and DLj(i)].  Where did the additional information 
<br />
come from?  The additional information is not that a universe can follow 
<br />
the recursion but rather as stated above the location of a particular 
<br />
universe in the recursion.  Since this information is not in Sj(0) or Tj it 
<br />
must have come from outside universe j.
<br />
<br />Universes that are not deterministic but have rules that allow external 
<br />
true to enter are easier to analyze in this regard since the current state 
<br />
seems the only reasonable definition.
<br />
<br />4) For a deterministic universe is the additional information true 
<br />
noise?  In at least one sense it is because a particular universe j is 
<br />
defined by its current state it can not tell which state including the 
<br />
current state was or is Sj(0) so there is no clue as to what the 
<br />
information means or if it is somehow even additional or new or which 
<br />
information is involved.  This is the same as the situation for a universe 
<br />
whose rules allow external origin true noise.
<br />
<br />5) This would seem to enhance the case against the idea of &quot;decision&quot; since 
<br />
noise [chance] of some sort seems to be everywhere.
<br />
<br />6) Behavior similar to (2) is found in universes that are sufficiently well 
<br />
behaved so that it is possible to propose a prior state such that the 
<br />
universe's rules when stripped of their allowance for external true noise 
<br />
can deterministicly arrive at the universe's current state.  This proposed 
<br />
prior state need not have been the actual prior state.
