I share most of Paddy Leahy's concerns and areas of confusion with
<br />
regard to the &quot;Why Occam&quot; discussion so far.  I really don't understand
<br />
what it means to explain appearances rather than reality.  It's hard to
<br />
get my mind around this kind of explanation and what to expect from it.
<br />
Also the way the Anthropic Principle applies to infinite strings seems
<br />
extremely vague until we have a clearer picture of how those strings
<br />
relate to reality.
<br />
<br />One area I differ:
<br />
<br />Paddy Leahy writes, quoting Russell:
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; However, as the cardinality of &quot;my&quot; ensemble is actually &quot;c&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (cardinality of the real numbers), it is quite probably a completely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; different beast.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There you go again with your radical compression. Without the reading I've 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been doing in the last two weeks, I wouldn't have been able to decode this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement as meaning:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2^\aleph_0 = \aleph_1 (by definition)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To assume c = \aleph_1 is the Continuum Hypothesis, which is unprovable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (within standard arithmetic).
</em><br />
<br />Actually Russell did not bring aleph_1 into the picture at all.  All that
<br />
he referred to was aleph_0 and c which by definition is 2^aleph_0.
<br />
c is the cardinality of the reals and of infinite bit strings.  This is
<br />
all just definitional.  Whether c is the &quot;next&quot; infinite cardinal after
<br />
aleph_0 is the Continuum Hypothesis, but that is not relevant here.
<br />
<br />Another area I had trouble with in Russell's answer was the concept of
<br />
a prefix map.  I understand that a prefix map is defined as a mapping
<br />
whose domain is finite bit strings such that none of them are a prefix
<br />
of any other.  But I'm not sure how to relate this to the infinite bit
<br />
strings that are &quot;descriptions&quot;.
<br />
<br />In particular, if &quot;an observer attaches sequences of meanings to sequences
<br />
of prefixes of one of these strings&quot;, then it seems that he must have a
<br />
domain which does allow some inputs to be prefixes of others.  Isn't that
<br />
what &quot;sequences of prefixes&quot; would mean?  That is, if the infinite string
<br />
is 01011011100101110111..., then a sequence of prefixes might be 0, 01,
<br />
010, 0101, 01011, ....  Does O() apply to this sequence of prefixes?  If
<br />
so then I don't think it is a prefix map.
<br />
<br />I want to make it clear by the way that my somewhat pedantic and labored
<br />
examination of this page is not an attempt to be difficult or stubborn.
<br />
Rather, I find that by the third page, I don't understand what is going
<br />
on at all!  Even the very first sentence, &quot;In the previous sections, I
<br />
demonstrate that formal mathematical systems are the most compressible,
<br />
and have highest measure amongst all members of the Schmidhuber ensemble,&quot;
<br />
has me looking to see if I skipped a page!  I don't see where this is
<br />
discussed in any way.  So I hope that by pinning down and crystalizing
<br />
exactly what the first page is claiming, it will help me to see what
<br />
the more interesting third page is actually able to establish.  I think
<br />
Paddy is in much the same situation.
