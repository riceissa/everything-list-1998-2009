<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them. So although having feelings may be necessary for ethical behaviour, it

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not sufficient.

<br />You are ignoring the distinction I made between three different kinds
<br />
of general intelligence.  I gave there different definitions remember:
<br />
<br />*Pattern Recognition Intelligence
<br />
*Symbolic Reasoning Intelligence
<br />
*Reflective Intelligence
<br />
<br />A mere 'determination of the motivational states of self and others'
<br />
does not by itself constitute *reflective intelligence* according my
<br />
definitions.  Not only must the motivational states of self/others by
<br />
determined and represented (this process by itself does not require
<br />
ethics or sentience), these representations must be *reflected* upon.
<br />
Only this final step, I'm saying, leads to ethical behaviour.  Once
<br />
you have a system performing *full* reflection correctly, you get
<br />
feelings.  And, I maintain, there is no real difference between
<br />
feeling and motivation.
<br />
<br />.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Psychopaths are often very good at understanding other peoples' feelings, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidenced by their ability to manipulate them. The main problem is that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't *care* about other people; they seem to lack the ability to be moved
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by other peoples' emotions and lack the ability to experience emotions such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as guilt. But this isn't part of a general inability to feel emotion, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they often present as enraged, entitled, depressed, suicidal, etc., and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these emotions are certainly enough to motivate them. Psychopaths have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slightly different set of emotions, regulated in a different way compared to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the rest of us, but are otherwise cognitively intact.
</em><br />
<br />See what I said above about the distinction between three different
<br />
kinds of general intelligence.  It's true that the psychopath can
<br />
indeed understand others in an *abstract* *intellectual* sense
<br />
(pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning intelligence), but what
<br />
the psychopath lacks is the ability to fully *reflect* upon this
<br />
understanding (reflective intelligence).
<br />
<br />You yourself admit: 'psychopaths have a slightly different set of
<br />
emotions, regulated in a different way compared to the rest of us'.
<br />
Therefore it simply isn't true that the psychopath is 'cognitively
<br />
intact'.  Again, the psychopath can obtain an abstract, intellectual
<br />
understanding of others, but lacks the ability to fully reflect upon
<br />
this information in order to directly experience it (as qualia).
<br />
<br />It is documented that psychopaths are lacking the ability to
<br />
experience the full range of emotions - specifically they appear
<br />
unable to fully experience certain negative emoptions such as fear and
<br />
sadness.  (Although they can, as you point out, experience *some*
<br />
kinds of emotions).  See the book 'Social Intelligence' ( by Daniel
<br />
Goleman) for references about the emotional deficits of psychopaths.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus it appears that reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intelligence is automatically correlated with ethical behaviour.  Bear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in mind, as I mentioned that: (1) There are in fact three kinds of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; general intelligence, and only one of them ('reflective intelligence')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is correlated with ethics.    The other two are not.  A deficit in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reflective intelligence does not affect the other two types of general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intelligence (which is why for instance psychopaths could still score
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; highly in IQ tests).  And (2) Reflective intelligence in human beings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is quite weak.  This is the reason why intelligence does not appear to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be much correlated with ethics in humans.  But this fact in no way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; refutes the idea that a system with full and strong reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intelligence would automatically be ethical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps I haven't quite understood your definition of reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence. It seems to me quite possible to &quot;correctly reason about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cognitive systems&quot;, at least well enough to predict their behaviour to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; useful degree, and yet not care at all about what happens to them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Furthermore, it seems possible to me to do this without even suspecting that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the cognitive system is conscious, or at least without being sure that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis Papaioannou-
</em><br />
<br />See you haven't understood my definitions.  It may be my fault due to
<br />
the way I worded things.  You are of course quite right that: 'it's
<br />
possible to correctly reason about cognitive systems at least well
<br />
enough to predict their behaviour to a useful degree and yet not care
<br />
at all about what happens to them'.  But this is only pattern
<br />
recognition and symbolic intelligence, *not* fully reflective
<br />
intelligence.  Reflective intelligence involves additional
<br />
representations enabling a system to *integrate* the aforementioned
<br />
abstract knowledge (and experience it directly as qualia).    Without
<br />
this ability an AI would be unable to maintain a stable goal structure
<br />
under recursive self improvement and therefore would remain limited.
