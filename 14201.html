<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability is unknown and you can gain enough experience with both

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kinds of outcomes. So, if you first expected some event to be very

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unlikely, and then you experience that event, you probably should

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increase your assessment of its probability.
</em><br />
<br />That's a different question, I think. If someone keeps winning the
<br />
lottery, then there is reason to speculate that he is cheating in some
<br />
way. But if the lottery is perfectly fair, and every participant is
<br />
equally unlikely to win, someone still has to win. That person can
<br />
then look back and say that his win was unlikely at the time he bought
<br />
the ticket. It might sound as if this is the same as saying it is
<br />
unlikely that he should find himself a winner rather than a loser, but
<br />
there is a difference. If he is a winner then *of course* he is a
<br />
winner; it was the becoming a winner that was unlikely. There is no
<br />
equivalent process of becoming a human that can be pointed to as
<br />
unlikely.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here confusion is similar: you experience an event (being born on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Earth), and based on that you try to update probability of being born
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on Earth. But data is insufficient, so you can't do that.
</em><br />
<br />Would it make any difference if you had data for how many inhabited
<br />
planets there are in the Universe?
