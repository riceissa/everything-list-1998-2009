<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;structure, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What relationship, what mathematical structure ?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure what you want to know (beyond what I've said) when you ask 
<br />
what relationship.  Any mathematical structure can be used.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;You know where to find my thoughts on how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;to restrict the mappings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes but I don't see how that defines an implementation.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I explained what the concept is that I want to get at.  The formal 
<br />
mathematical definition will be in terms of the restricted mapping, and then 
<br />
I will claim that it satisfies the desired role for purposes of 
<br />
consciousness.  Of course, it is not possible to prove that something is 
<br />
conscious.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Sounds like Platonism, but doesn't define existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I use &quot;existence&quot; as a quantifier, like in logic, not as a property which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;need a definition.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any word you use needs a definition.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The key number of existence is 24.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you mean 42?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    Suppose instead they are all &quot;material&quot; by hypothetical logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;necessity.  Tell me what would be different. i.e. define &quot;material&quot;.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The point is that they would be no difference, and that is why I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe in matter and I don't need to search a definition of it.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there would be no difference, you are wrong to have said they are not 
<br />
material.  Just say there is no difference.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now I was a little quick in saying that all Universe are in Plato's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;heaven. I should have said only that all apparence of universes are in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;plato heaven, and this only through the &quot;eyes&quot; of Heaven's inhabitant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Matter and Universes are just sort of superstitions. (With COMP).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly disagree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    I guess by &quot;relatively&quot; you mean there is no objective measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;distribution...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Not at all!!!!  The measure is objective, and objectively relative.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn't make any sense.  Do you believe in an overall, objective 
<br />
measure distribution?  It is a yes or no question, and if you say for 
<br />
example &quot;yes but relative&quot; then you are for some reason misspelling the word 
<br />
&quot;no&quot;.  I guess English spelling is a little hard sometimes for a French 
<br />
speaking person.  And you can't get Darwin unless you say &quot;yes&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  (I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;comp&quot; though, since you like to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;talk about whether &quot;you&quot; survive substitutions but did not define &quot;you&quot;.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then forget computationalism and think about computationalists! In that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;case you can follow the entire UDA without any other definition than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the computationalist *belief*: &quot;me is the guy who will survives with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an artificial digital body&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know what you mean.  You just seem to be substituting the less 
<br />
formal word &quot;guy&quot; in place of the &quot;me&quot;.  I don't see how that helps, except 
<br />
that presumably COMP predicts that a sex change operation is a form of 
<br />
murder since there is no guy left :)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if I pick my own computationalist definition of &quot;self&quot;; for 
<br />
example, an implementation of a computation.  Could you rephrase your UDA to 
<br />
work around that?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Everett never defined &quot;machines&quot;, which is why his formulation leads to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;paradoxes&quot; like a stationary state being able to be &quot;conscious&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This seems to be an interesting remark. Could you developpe it a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;little bit.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He assumes that a conscious observer is present when a certain term is 
<br />
present in a superposition.  Obviously, this will be that case for any state 
<br />
that is not orthogonal to the given term, even a stationary state.  It is 
<br />
not a computationalist formulation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    First, memory (which he [Everett] deals with) is nothing like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the kind of &quot;flow&quot; QTI freaks talk about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What do you mean by &quot;flow&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my term, so I don't know what people mean by it, but I know 
<br />
they attribute miraculous properties to it that lead to the QTI.  Try 
<br />
looking it up in the archives.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is only states of consistent machines and the (big) class of their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consistent computational extensions appearing in UD*.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's a consistent computational extension?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Read DeWitt &amp; Graham page 63seq. He says for exemple (emphasis by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Everett):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&lt;&lt;However, we do not do justice to the theory of pure wave mechanics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;until we have investigated what the theory itself says about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*appearance* of phenomena to observers, rather than hastily concluding that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the theory must be incorrect because the actual states of systems as given 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by the theory seem to contradict our observations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We shall see that the introduction of observers can be accomplished
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a reasonable manner, and that the theory then predicts that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*appearance* of phenomena, as the subjective experience of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers, is precisely in accordance with the predictions of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;usual probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As you can see the probabilities are subjective and belong to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appearance, to the first person, with my &quot;strange&quot; language.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he is probably just using 'subjective' as a redundant synonym of 
<br />
'experience'.  He does not really want to deny the objective existence of 
<br />
experiences, or of an objective measure distribution on the same, but just 
<br />
wants to emphasize that different observers see different things.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, when he says 'predicts' he is clearly invoking an objective 
<br />
measure distribution, since while the observers with greatest measure see 
<br />
(approximately) the usual 'probabilities' (in terms of frequency), there are 
<br />
certainly observers of lower measure who see different 'probabilities'.  
<br />
(Indeed, there are some who are totally insane and see only white rabbits.)  
<br />
He couldn't predict a thing without an objective measure distribution, and 
<br />
clearly he is not just talking about himself so forget the relative stuff.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;You need to realize that the notion of &quot;1st person&quot; used on this list is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just an extra-crackpot version of mind-like hidden variables that has no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;basis in objective reality:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Refer me to a post where &quot;1st person&quot; is used as  mind-like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hidden variables.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look it up in the archives and find any post that includes the term, 
<br />
that's one.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And recall me what you mean by &quot;objective reality&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Recall that for me objective reality is just arithmetical truth.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The set of things that exist has objective reality.  You still owe me a 
<br />
definition of &quot;existence&quot; so I'm not going to define that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    That's not an objective measure distribution if it depends
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;on you...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let us say it is conditionalised by &quot;me&quot; (my history).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well ... (flipping a coin*) ... no, let's not say that.
<br />
[* ==&gt; a joke, in response to a ridiculous statement]
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;.. I said there is one unique objective measure distribution - if you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't believe it you must believe in hidden variables and other crackpot 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nonsense.  There is no other consistent possibility (except, you could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe in both).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I dislike hidden variables. But by reading your post I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more and more willing to belief in the existence of crackpot nonsense :-)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a start.  You can see a reversed pictoral representation of a 
<br />
crackpot if you have a mirror handy.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What does differentiate different people?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;Memories. Cosmological, genetical, individual memories. I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;say. Most of the time there are organized into histories, so I could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have said simply: Histories. Isn't it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    Suppose my memory is a set of bits.  A cosmic ray comes in and flips 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one bit.  Did the ray kill me and create a new person?  If so, OK, but no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;QTI.  If not what if it keeps happening?  I could end up with identical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;memories to a completely different person.  So, really, there is no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distinction between 2 people.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So you agree that, provided that there is no end for the human race,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you *are* immortal, because if there is no distinction between two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;people, there is no distinction between you and any of our descendants, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;isn't it?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.  First, I was using your definition of what distinguishes people, 
<br />
not my own.  I certainly wouldn't want to be the same person as you.  
<br />
(Non-humans get included too, so what you are saying is that there is only 
<br />
one person in the multiverse.  I don't think a QTIer has in mind &quot;survival&quot; 
<br />
via his children, without his old memories, though, so I think no one would 
<br />
agree with that definition.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would define &quot;immortal&quot; not as having no end, but as having an 
<br />
infinite median age over the measure distribution.  Thus an exponentially 
<br />
decaying long-time tail is not immortality.  Third, as you know I agree with 
<br />
the (modified for what we know) Doomsday argument, so even collectively 
<br />
humanity is not immortal.  It's basically the same argument as for an 
<br />
individual.
