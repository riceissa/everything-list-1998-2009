<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it seems that we have skipped

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and individuation follow from the mere existence of Platonic Forms, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;process&quot; is merely a &quot;relation&quot; between Forms (as Bruno et al claim)?!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     In my previous post I tried to point out that *existence* is not a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; first-order (or n-th order) predicate and thus does nothing to distinguish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one Form, Number, Algorithm, or what-have-you from another.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know about that; I do know that 34 and 3 are not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same thing, nor are they very similar. I wonder if you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; joining those who might say that I cannot speak of 34 or 3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without mentioning the process by which I know of them. (In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my opinion, that puts the cart before the horse. A lot more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people in history were more certain, and rightly so, that there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was a moon than that they had brains.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The property of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; individuation requires some manner of distinguishability of one &quot;thing&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;process&quot;, etc. from another. Mere existence is insufficient.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     We are tacitly assuming an observer or something that amounts to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; same thing any time we assume some 3rd person PoView and such is required
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for any coherent notion of distinguishability to obtain and thus something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;to whom&quot; existence means/affects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I just disagree. Before there were people or even atoms, quarks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and leptons were not the same thing. They didn't have to be perceived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by anyone in order for that to be true. I know that you disagree with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this: they didn't even have to affect anything in order for that to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be true. If there had been just one quark and one electron in the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, and if they were separately by almost infinitely many light-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years, then there would still have been one quark and one electron.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unfortunately, I probably can be of no more assistence to you on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question.

<br />Lee, Bruno, Stephen,
<br />
<br />I think this is an issue that lies at the heart of the matter.  (I
<br />
don't know if it's the same as Smullyan's heart of the matter, but in a
<br />
sense it very well could be.)
<br />
<br />The difference between a quark and a lepton can be described with
<br />
mathematics, even though perhaps it's harder to pin down than the
<br />
difference between 3 and 34.  I think most of us wouldn't have a
<br />
crucial problem with that.  But alas the difference between 3 and 34 is
<br />
in the counting.  Here is the heart of the matter, I believe.  It takes
<br />
an observer to count, since it takes an observer to decide when to
<br />
start counting, or to define a group of things.  This is where meaning
<br />
and affect comes in.  Even numbers require an observer.  Bringing in
<br />
prime numbers and multiplication doesn't prove that you don't need an
<br />
observer.
<br />
<br />(=&gt;) Yes, numbers are observer-independent (hence the success of
<br />
&quot;looking for invariance&quot;), but this doesn't necessarily imply that you
<br />
don't need an observer in the first place!  (&lt;=)
<br />
<br />Extra, to Bruno:  In my view, we define numbers with invariance, by
<br />
recognizing, when we make sense of what is around us, or even when we
<br />
make sense of our own thoughts.  On the TV program &quot;Sesame Street&quot; they
<br />
have small children singing &quot;One of these things is not like the
<br />
others&quot; even before they introduce numbers.  This is what I mean by
<br />
&quot;looking for invariance&quot;.
<br />
