<br />I had a smart response here, and I just realised I had misinterpreted
<br />
the word &quot;copy&quot; here, so I just deleted it. &quot;Copy&quot; in English also
<br />
means to send something (envoyer) (&quot;I copied him in on the
<br />
conversation&quot;), as well as to reproduce something.

<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it not seem incoherent to use terms that imply some form of 
<br />
*process* when considering notions that are implicitly changeless and 
<br />
static? This has perpetually bothered me in the discussions of the 
<br />
neoplatonians...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, copying is the identity morphism for computations (and 
<br />
informorphisms in general) in Pratt's discussion of Chu spaces...
<br />
**
<br />
<br />Yes you are quite right (under COMP, and under the more regular meaning
<br />
of &quot;copy&quot;). However, I don't think this is how a Geiger counter works...
<br />
<br />***
<br />
[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does seem that Bruno is considering the ticks, etc. of the Geiger 
<br />
Counter as included in the over all 1st person aspect of the bit string, 
<br />
this would include all aspects of the experience of the &quot;Geiger Counter&quot;...
<br />
***
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the idea of getting the quantum indeterminacy as a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case of the comp first person indeterminacy. I think it is the idea of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everett and everything-like theories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;but rather trivial from a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;real, physical machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Accepting not only weak-materialism (existence of primitive matter) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the quantum theory that is accepting the existence of primitive matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that it obeys to the quantum. But this is the kind of things we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to explain (from simpler things, like numbers and/or comp etc.).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />This is one point where I depart from your metaphysics. Traditional
<br />
aristotelianism asserts existence of matter, and that psyche emerges
<br />
from that. You assert the existence of numbers, and of psyche, and
<br />
show how matter arises from that.
<br />
<br />I think both are needed. The psyche supervenes on matter, and the
<br />
properties of matter depend on the psyche. All of which exists because
<br />
numbers exist. There is a name for such a concept - &quot;strange loop&quot;. I
<br />
thought this name was due to Stewart and Cohen, but it appears
<br />
Hofstadter got there first in GEB.
<br />
<br />**
<br />
[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you considering a Categorical difference of classes here, in the 
<br />
sense that the classof matter structures/processes is different (in kind not 
<br />
degree) from the class of psychies? Have you considered Vaughan Pratt's idea 
<br />
for a relationship between them?
<br />
**
<br />
<br />The reason I have come to this position is that try as I might, I
<br />
cannot remove the Anthropic Principle as an axiom. I would dearly love
<br />
someone to show that it is a consequence of other assumptions, or can
<br />
be derived from such by means of a simple, obvious assumption. But
<br />
most people I talk to don't even see the problem (perhaps because
<br />
they're still grounded in Aristotelian ways...)
<br />
<br />**
<br />
[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I concurr with this observation; it is as if most people do not see the 
<br />
deep conundrum that exist within the Aristotelian hylemorphism 
<br />
(<a href="http://radicalacademy.com/jdcosmology2.htm">http://radicalacademy.com/jdcosmology2.htm</a>) in its assumption of a primal 
<br />
&quot;substance&quot; which, if I understand correctly, is seperated into its plethora 
<br />
of forms by many processes. It is the origin of the latter that I argue 
<br />
should be considered as fundamental, as a primitive class Becoming (ala 
<br />
Bergson), and substance is then shown to be the class of all forms that can 
<br />
emerge (think morphisms) from Becoming.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pratt's idea seems to add a dual to this morphism that would include 
<br />
such notions as computations; we then have a nice duality that avoid's 
<br />
Descartes' fallasy of trying to build dualism from substantivalism, ala res 
<br />
extensa and res cognitas.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I can do it on my computer, for example,

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;showing it to be capable of more than a Turing machine.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<br />But it is. Its called a keyboard. (The faster you type, the more
<br />
genuine randomness is generated). Do a Google search on /dev/random,
<br />
or on &quot;Havege&quot;*. There is also a fantastically complicated quantum
<br />
random generator that consists of an arrangement of spinning disks
<br />
interacting with a volume of air-AT_SYMBOL- (OK perhaps not proven quantum, but
<br />
our best theories that describe the operation of the device, ie Chaos

theory, indicates quantum influence).
