<br /><br />I can certainly agree with you on all of that, Anna. In a way this is  
<br />
not what I am talking about. True - If maths could not predict change,  
<br />
then the armaments industry for one would never have arisen. Flight  
<br />
would never have become possible. Getting a satellite into orbit would  
<br />
be a fantasy not to mention the whole uncertain certainty of quantum  
<br />
probability measurement
<br />
<br />Math will usually cope with change when we assume a static background  
<br />
against which to measure something evolving. Some fields of math will  
<br />
even predict behaviour where no absolute background is assumed. We are  
<br />
getting better and better by the day at this kind of thing.
<br />
<br /><br />I guess what I am on about is a bit closer to the 80s idea of &quot;chaos&quot;  
<br />
- something that is inherently unpredictable; at least if you adopt  
<br />
the stance of always launching your prediction from a single present -  
<br />
the one you happen to find yourself in.
<br />
<br />What I am asking is: can we RELY on mathematical reasoning to predict  
<br />
future outcomes with precision? Isn't this kind of like an act of  
<br />
faith? If we could perfectly model where things are heading then  
<br />
please tell me why all the BTSOAPs of the dismal science of the  
<br />
economics world could not arrange a more stable financial future for  
<br />
us than the one we are currently moving into?
<br />
<br />If mathematical modelling of alternative futures is so efficient
<br />
<br />Why is it that we can now see the inevitability of:
<br />
<br />water wars
<br />
rising sea levels
<br />
economic stagflation
<br />
food shortages/riots
<br />
runaway greenhouse warming
<br />
endemic terrorism
<br />
the catastrophic reduction of biodiversity
<br />
<br />to name but a few glowing futures ahead of us at this time. You cannot  
<br />
blame the politicians for everything. It is no use telling me that the  
<br />
politicians and the people in power are not listening to the number  
<br />
crunchers and that short term gain, political expediency and human  
<br />
greed are to blame.
<br />
<br />Problem solvers often complain that they have worked out ideal  
<br />
solutions but that no one will use the solutions. They complain that  
<br />
they have solved the problem brilliantly with their modelling but that  
<br />
the person or entity who has to carry through the solution refuses to  
<br />
do so.
<br />
<br />If this is the case, they have not solved the problem at all.
<br />
<br />Isolated problems are not real problems. Real problems include not  
<br />
only the specified problem situation but also the &quot;person situation&quot;  
<br />
which includes the people who have to accept and act on the solution.  
<br />
It may be better to have a suboptimal solution which everyone will  
<br />
accept rather than an optimal solution which no one will accept.
<br />
<br />Why for example, is humanity wasting its intellectual energy on this  
<br />
ridiculous argument about who or what is responsible for global  
<br />
warming? As if it would make any form of difference to the situation  
<br />
if someone were to &quot;win&quot; the argument. As David Deutsch said in his  
<br />
2005 TED Talk, it was probably too late to do anything about it by the  
<br />
mid 70s of last century. We should be doing everything in our power to  
<br />
plan for living on a warmer planet. So what if Nature throws up these  
<br />
things - so what if mankind has buggered the planet - we still have to  
<br />
cope with the outcome! Just because I am right and you are wrong (or  
<br />
vice versa) does not make the problem go away. Humans seem to  
<br />
endlessly want to fidget about with logical argument because they  
<br />
believe (with Socrates) that all you have to do is remove all logical  
<br />
error, then what you are left with must be the truth.
<br />
<br />The &quot;truth&quot; is simply where our thinking ran out of puff. Something  
<br />
may well be academically &quot;correct&quot; (it takes two hours for two men to  
<br />
dig a hole five feet deep, so 10 men will dig a hole 25 feet deep over  
<br />
the same period) - but the simple fact is it probably WILL NOT TURN  
<br />
OUT THAT WAY!!!!!! (in the real, evolving, changing chaotically  
<br />
unpredictable universe)
<br />
<br />A car is driving down the highway. The car comes to a halt, having run  
<br />
out of gas. The people inside get out and dance about and congratulate  
<br />
each other on &quot;having arrived at the destination&quot;.
<br />
<br />Truth is like that.
<br />
<br />regards,
<br />
<br />Kim
