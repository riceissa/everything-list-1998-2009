From: Osher Doctorow osher.domain.name.hidden, Fri. Sept. 6, 2002 11:45AM
<br />
<br />I have read about half of J. Schmidthuber's *A computer scientist's view of
<br />
life, the universe, and everything,* (1997), and he has interesting ideas
<br />
and clarity of presentation, but I have to disagree with him on a number of
<br />
places where he uses conditional probability including his section
<br />
Generalization and Learning.   I hasten to add that I do not view
<br />
alternative theories as *wrong* but as competing and that they should almost
<br />
all survive for competition, motivation, and also because many of them turn
<br />
out to have useful contributions long after they have been regarded as
<br />
*discredited*.
<br />
<br />Schmidthuber (S for short) concludes that generalization is impossible in
<br />
general by using a proof based on conditional probability, and similarly he
<br />
concludes that the learner's life in general is limited by also a
<br />
conditional probability proof.  Most readers will undoubtedly stare at this
<br />
statement in bewilderment, since as far as they know nothing is wrong with
<br />
conditional probability.
<br />
<br />They are partly correct and partly wrong.   Nothing is wrong with
<br />
conditional probability, which is the main tool of the Bayesian school (or
<br />
as I abbreviate it, the BCP or Bayesian Conditional Probability-Statistics
<br />
school), for Fairly Frequent Events.    For Rare Events, something very
<br />
strange happens.   This was how my wife Marleen and I began our exploration
<br />
of Rare Events in 1980.   Conditional probability divides two probabilities
<br />
and regards that as an indication of the probability of one event *given*
<br />
another event, where *given* is used in the sense of *freezing the other
<br />
event in place*.   Some real analysis experts will argue that this is all
<br />
justified by the Radon Derivative of the Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym theorem(s),
<br />
not quite realizing that the proof of those theorems only hold up to
<br />
equivalence classes outside sets of measure ZERO.   But events of
<br />
probability zero are the Rarest Events.   Moreover, division of
<br />
probabilities blows up even in small (one-sided) neighborhoods of
<br />
probability 0 since division by 0 is impossible.   Thus, not only can
<br />
conditional probability not model events of probability 0, but it cannot
<br />
even model events of probability close to 0 (Rare Events).
<br />
<br />Is there a simple solution?   Yes!    Product/Goguen fuzzy multivalued
<br />
logical implication x--&gt;y is defined as y/x for x not 0.   So it corresponds
<br />
to conditional probability where x and y are carefully chosen probabilities
<br />
in the probability-statistics analog.   Lukaciewicz and Rational Pavelka
<br />
fuzzy multivalued logical implications (Rational Pavelka is the predicate
<br />
logic generalization of Lukaciewicz propositional logic) are x--&gt;y = 1 + y -
<br />
x for y &lt; = x for the non-trivial case.   The latter does not involve
<br />
division by 0 and does not blow up in any (one-sided) neighborhood of zero.
<br />
Logic-Based Probability (LBP) uses precisely the same definition of 1 + y -
<br />
x in place of y/x for exactly the same probabilities x, y which BCP uses.
<br />
My wife and I introduced LBP in 1980.   It may be remarked here the Godel
<br />
fuzzy multivalued logic, which we showed applies to Very Frequent (Very
<br />
Common) Events, uses x--&gt;y = y and refers in the probability-statistics
<br />
analog to INDEPENDENT events, and since in general events are not
<br />
independent unless that can be established in special cases, LBP is the
<br />
correct result to use.
<br />
<br />So when S claims that generalization is impossible in general and that the
<br />
learner's life is limited in general, he has to be referring to Fairly
<br />
Frequent Events, not Rare Events or even Very Frequent Events (which use the
<br />
Godel analog).
<br />
<br />But surely that leaves much room for S to maneuver in?    In a way, yes, and
<br />
in a way, no.  S is very interested in the Great Programmer or even a
<br />
decreasing sequence of Great Programmers each delegating authority to the
<br />
other in different universes and so on.   The Great Programmer thinks on the
<br />
level of the Universe or All Universes or the particular Universe in the
<br />
sequence.   So we have to ask: which type of fuzzy multivalued logic or its
<br />
probability-statistics analog (or proximity function - geometry - topology
<br />
analog, which we developed as exact analogs of the above) most influences
<br />
the Universe(s)?
<br />
<br />The answer turns out to be very simple, namely Lukaciewicz/Rational Pavelka
<br />
(Rare Event) or its probability-statistics analog LBP.    This is because in
<br />
our universe it is generally agreed that a Rare Event called a Big Bang
<br />
occurred (I have proven that even if it did not, as in Steinhardt-Turok and
<br />
Gott-Li cyclic or backward time loop cosmological theories, LBP is the key
<br />
influence probability), and that very rare events such as inflation and the
<br />
transition from radiation-dominated to matter-dominated eras and transition
<br />
from non-accelerating to accelerating universe which fairly recently
<br />
occurred - that all of these Rare Events played critical roles in the
<br />
development of the Universe.
<br />
<br />I should also mention that Shannon Information-Entropy and its Kolmogorov
<br />
generalizations blow up near zero because the logarithm does, and that the
<br />
only *influence* type of Shannon Information-Entropy is based on conditional
<br />
probability, which of course also blows up at zero.   Rare Event
<br />
Information-Entropy does not use logarithms but (positive or negative)
<br />
exponentials, and of course does not divide probabilities so it does not
<br />
blow up at or near zero denominator.
<br />
<br />Quantum-field-theory-oriented physicists may be slightly disturbed at this
<br />
point, since QFT totally eliminates probabilities except in the *formal*
<br />
location of Schrodinger's equation which is regarded as a *deterministic*
<br />
equation (another anomaly that I will be glad to argue about at another time
<br />
or place).   Happily or unhappily, they have no choice in the matter of the
<br />
above results, since they hold across about 10 different branches of
<br />
mathematics and almost an equal number of branches of physics.   Curiously
<br />
enough, Quantum Mechanics theorists manage to get probability back into the
<br />
picture, including their much-used CONDITIONAL probability, while
<br />
simultaneously disavowing the stochastic (probability) school and claiming
<br />
allegiance to the Statistics School (apparently unaware that there is no
<br />
statistics without probability) which plays an only *formal* role in
<br />
supporting the *deterministic Schrodinger and Heisenberg* equations.
