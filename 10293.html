<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks, yes it does.  However, for the sake of clarity:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Why not? What *does* implementation consist of ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Being the stuff, the substrate. It's the only thing actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, given your view that there is only 1st-person, and also given that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our experience is 1st-person, does that imply:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) That we are instantiated as the substrate behaving in some specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ways that are in principle empirically determinable?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but only in brain material. It is only there that we get anomalous
<br />
presentation of two aspects to the one process... brain and mind. Only there
<br />
can a model of appearances and a model of structure be bound intimately by
<br />
the special behaviour delivering qualia to us. Brain material is
<br />
epistemologically anomalous and unique.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) That such behaviour, presumably, can be construed both as our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'ability to perceive' and as our 'perceptions'?
</em><br />
<br />I think I know what you are after. I'd say that one expression of the
<br />
'relational structure' is atoms, cells etc which literally are the brain
<br />
which, as a result of its behaviour provides 'ability to perceive'. The
<br />
'perceptions' are also an aspect of the very same structure behaving
<br />
'brainly' but only perceived from the perspective of being the brain.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) If the foregoing two points are ontologogical (what we are), then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does our epistemology (what we can know) derive from the internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relata of the perceptually-derived models thus instantiated + their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inferred relation to 1st-person referents?
</em><br />
<br />Yes. I know my own and Bruno's terminology is mixed and probably at odds.
<br />
Nevertheless I'd couch it as saying that the relational structure is
<br />
literally what we are. It provides a first person presentation of a slice
<br />
across the structure at a given scale. Our brains are brilliant at capturing
<br />
apparent causality within the appearances. That 'capture' formulated into a
<br />
statement of regularity in the universe using scientific method becomes what
<br />
we 'know' (natural 'laws'), which is identical to a belief. We are not
<br />
justified in claiming that we have captured the structure itself, only that
<br />
we have captured the behaviour of a representational slice across it (eg at
<br />
the level of an atom via instruments, or an elephant by eyeball).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) If there is only 1st person, what is the most coherent way to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguish the ontology of persons (e.g. you, me) from that of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-persons (e.g. some volume of interstellar space)? Or, in what way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the ontology of non-persons still 1st-person?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />There are 2 questions that can be asked of every'thing' X in the universe.
<br />
<br />Q1 What is X?			A1) That which behaves Xly
<br />
Q2 What is it like to be X?	A2) It is like Xness
<br />
<br /><br />Mind is to brain as
<br />
XXXX? is to a coffee cup?
<br />
<br />The fact that we can only distinguish between the two questions from the
<br />
point of view of being a brain does not mean that the two questions are
<br />
valid for everything. Space included. It may not 'be like anything' to be,
<br />
say, a coffee cup. That is not the point. The point is that the structure
<br />
supports the possibility of 1st person presentation and, once we understand
<br />
whether the structure of a coffee cup we can than make a scientific
<br />
statement about W.I.I.L. to be a hot coffee cup vs a cold coffee cup. It may
<br />
be 'nothing', but at least it will be justified to some extent.
<br />
<br />There's a real issue here with language. We have words like ontology and
<br />
epistemology and atom, mind and brain. I'd like to simply ignore them all.
<br />
Being embedded in a relational structure off the type we are enables us to
<br />
hold beliefs. Some of those beliefs are phenomenal presentations (redness),
<br />
some are visceral(a belief that I have 10 toes, the expression of which is
<br />
phenomenally void until recall, the belief is brain material configuration).
<br />
Beleifs can be innate (genetically programmed such as the capacity to
<br />
breath) and some learned (language). Beliefs can be about the self or about
<br />
the natural world outside the self.
<br />
<br />My fervent hope is that some of those beliefs will, in the future, include
<br />
models of the relational structure that delivers the phenomenality
<br />
containing/depicting the behaviours then used to assemble the existing set
<br />
of scientific beliefs. All as one consistent system. A 'Dual aspect science'
<br />
without all the anomalous thinking and empirically backed throughout (but
<br />
initiated in a science of brain material inclusive of a physics of qualia)
<br />
<br />That's as complicated as it needs to be.
<br />
<br />I think you and I are on the same wavelength here.
<br />
<br />Speaking of coffee ..... I'm off!
