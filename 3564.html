Dear Matthieu:
<br />
<br /><br />At 1/23/02, you wrote:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;An universe can be an oriented graph of states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Each state has no, one or more next states. It also has no, one or more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;previous states.
</em><br />
<br />While I allow that a universe can have more than one possible previous 
<br />
state or no previous state [when in the initial state] - in fact my model 
<br />
insists on it - I do not allow that there is more than one actual previous 
<br />
state for a particular universe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This universe may be computable.
</em><br />
<br />I allow that the current state of a universe contains the information 
<br />
necessary to list all the possible future and prior states but not to 
<br />
determine the actual prior and future states.  This information is useless 
<br />
because to use it internally is itself a change of state.  Further I do not 
<br />
agree that there is any external point of view or any observer with any 
<br />
point of view at all for that matter.  That would just be excess entities 
<br />
[i.e. too complex a theory]
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To compute it doesn't means you start from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an unique initial state and you go from it to the only next one and so on.
</em><br />
<br />The point I am exploring in these posts is that if one can associate a 
<br />
particular history with a particular universe [its current state defines a 
<br />
universe - see below] then that history must be computable or one could not 
<br />
make the association.  In this case Juergen seems to make such an 
<br />
association and so the paper seems to assume that which was to be demonstrated.
<br />
<br />If the initial state of a universe is sufficient to establish it as a 
<br />
universe then it is not necessary for a universe to have a history.  Each 
<br />
state of a universe can be an initial state in the sense that new 
<br />
information is introduced from an outside source at each transition.  An 
<br />
evolving universe needs one extra property: the &quot;capability of finding a 
<br />
next state&quot;.  This can be random choice or partly random choice but my 
<br />
model does not admit a choice via rules with no random content.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If there is conscious beings in this universe. They will perceive the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;flowing as they go from a state to a next one, and again.
</em><br />
<br />Not at all IMO.  I can not demonstrate that my universe had a prior 
<br />
state.  What may seem to be my history is just the current state of a part 
<br />
of a sub system of a universe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But from a third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person point of view, this univers is a static (and so deterministic)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical object.
</em><br />
<br />Again I see &quot;observation&quot; of any sort as an unnecessary complication of a TOE.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;When for a given state there is more than one next state, it is for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concious being as if random rule their future.
</em><br />
<br />Again IMO observers are not necessary or even possible for that matter.
<br />
My model does insist that for currently finite universes there will always 
<br />
be more than one possible next state but only one actual next state.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;They may think their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe is not deterministic, except for those who has an Everett-like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory.
</em><br />
<br />Multiple actually realized future states as opposed to multiple possible 
<br />
future states is also unnecessarily complex.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;When there is no next state, it's the end of times.
</em><br />
<br />There is indeed the possibility of no actual next state, but IMO there is 
<br />
always multiple possible next states for currently finite universes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This kind of universes doesn't have an history, but many histories.
</em><br />
<br />As I said my model insists that there are multiple possible prior and next 
<br />
states for finite universes but only one actual prior state and only one 
<br />
actually realized next state.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way in the oriented graph is an history.
</em><br />
<br />I will suppose you mean over possible prior states.  In my view each state 
<br />
has only one actual prior state but many possible prior states and the 
<br />
current state only has the information that could list the full set of 
<br />
possible prior states but there is never any information re the 
<br />
determination of the actual prior state.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Even loops are possible.
</em><br />
<br />Yes this could happen for universes with rules of evolution that have a 
<br />
high random or &quot;do not care&quot; content.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different histories can lead to a given state.
</em><br />
<br />IMO - as I have said - for any particular universe any state has multiple 
<br />
possible immediately prior states but only one actual prior state.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If our universe is this kind of graph, the big-bang may not start from an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inital &quot;eden&quot; state (which has no previous state) but from a set of states
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that can loop. After the big-bang I suppose there is no loop.
</em><br />
<br />I see this as too complex.  My generating mechanism is very simple.
<br />
<br />Hal
