<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Is God good? Well, according to Plato, accepting the rather natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;theological&quot; interpretation of the Parmenides (like Plotinus), there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is a sense to say that God is &quot;good&quot;, but probably not in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Christian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sense (if that can be made precise). Indeed, Plato's God is just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Truth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And Truth is not good as such, but the awareness of truth, or simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the search of truth,  is, for a Platonist,  a prerequisite for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *possible* development of goodness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Truth is necessary for justice, and justice is necessary for goodness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That's the idea. It makes knowledge (and thus truth) a good thing, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; principle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But Vance's novel rises a doubt. Actually, that doubt can rise through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the reading of the first Pythagorean writings, which insist so much on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hiding their knowledge to the non-initiated people, making them 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; secret.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (according to the legend, their kill a disciple who dares to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; public the discovery of the irrationality of the square root of 2).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Maimonides also, in his &quot;Guide for the perplexed&quot; insists that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fundamental knowledge has to be reserved for the initiated or the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; elite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; people.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Fundamentally I don't know. I know a lot of particular case where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; knowledge can be bad. But this happens always in &quot;human, too much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; human&quot; practical circumstances, like during war, illness, etc.  (it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not good that your enemies *knows* where are your missiles; it is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; good to tell a bad new to some old dying people, etc. But this never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; concerns fundamental truth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But what truth is &quot;fundamental&quot;?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />OK. I should not have talk about &quot;fundamental truth&quot;, but about 
<br />
&quot;fundamental question&quot;. By which I mean &quot;where do I come from?&quot;, &quot;what 
<br />
can we hope&quot;, &quot;what is the nature of matter&quot;, &quot;is life a dream?&quot; etc.
<br />
None of those question are really addressed by today's science which 
<br />
focuses on the physical aspect of reality without really tackling 
<br />
seriously (in the doubting way) its metaphysical aspect and its psycho 
<br />
or theo logical aspect.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quantum gravity seems like an esoteric game to most people and so you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can say anything you want about it without any ethical implications.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But when quantum gravity seems to provide a non-supernatural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cosmogony, religions are threatened and suddenly it's like bad news to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a dying man (and we're all dying).
</em><br />
<br /><br />If a religion is threatened by science, it means it is build on bad 
<br />
faith. At least with comp science has to be a part of theology. If 
<br />
theology does not extend science, it means it is wrong. Now sometimes 
<br />
some scientist talk like if they were priest, and that is two times 
<br />
more wrong than usual priest talk. Religion, like science, is 
<br />
threatened by bad science, and even more by bad religion (religion 
<br />
based on &quot;blind&quot; faith or authoritative argument).
<br />
Now, don't tell me that a theory like quantum gravity  provides a non 
<br />
supernatural cosmogony given that quantum gravity study quantum gravity 
<br />
and perhaps the physical universe, but not the mind, nor the soul, the 
<br />
person or consciousness. It is not its subject a priori. To look at 
<br />
quantum gravity as a cosmogony is a confusion between subject like 
<br />
physics and theology. This threatens theology, because without making 
<br />
some very strong physicalist assumption, which are incompatible with 
<br />
the mechanist thesis, it consists to make physics a religion without 
<br />
saying! This is just dishonest. Such a physical universe is worst than 
<br />
a white male God, because it looks scientific (unlike the male God), 
<br />
but it isn't.
<br />
<br />It looks that in winter, people forget all about the 1/3 distinction. 
<br />
In Quantum gravity this 1/3 distinction is a bit hidden. You have to 
<br />
postulate comp, and thus Everett before. (Well, as you know, you have 
<br />
to derive Everett but it is not the point here).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Coincidentally, James Watson has just lost his job because he said 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some things that, while narrowly true, support a racist view of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Africa.  Were they &quot;fundamental&quot;  or does &quot;fundamental&quot; = &quot;of no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; import in society&quot;?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I love Watson because I discover &quot;the math of computer science&quot; by 
<br />
myself  in his book &quot;Molecular Biology of the Gene&quot;. This book has 
<br />
played a so big role in my youth that I have been using for years the 
<br />
word &quot;Watson&quot; as a synonym of &quot;Bible&quot;.
<br />
<br />But J. Watson has become the worst materialist I have ever heard about. 
<br />
According to a talk I have followed some years ago (I should search for 
<br />
the reference) Watson seems to believe only in ATOMS&quot;. Someone told him 
<br />
&quot;Surely you believe in molecules M. Watson&quot;. And James Watson would 
<br />
have answered: &quot;No, I don't, there are only atoms!&quot;.
<br />
Weird ....
<br />
<br />By &quot;fundamental&quot; I really mean the same as in &quot;fundamental science&quot;. 
<br />
Unless in company of theological hypothesis, it has no more impact on 
<br />
society other than its technical products.
<br />
Einstein discovered the relation between matter and energy only through 
<br />
a deep motivation for fundamental question: what is matter, what is the 
<br />
nature of light, how could resemble the universe when seen by  a 
<br />
photon, etc.
<br />
<br />But of course, its questioning led him to the discovery of precise and 
<br />
refutable empirical statements, most of them did have incredible 
<br />
impacts of our live today.
