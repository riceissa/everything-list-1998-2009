<br /><br /><br />It isn't. It's American ;-) (ducks quickly, like George Bush the other

day and the shoes)
<br />
<br />Military talk - if you have seen the movie &quot;Contact&quot; (based on Carl  
<br />
Sagan's novel of the same name) the character Ellie Arroway (played by  
<br />
the superlative Jodie Foster) says this many times as she sits inside  
<br />
&quot;the Machine&quot; - the teleporter or whatever that purportedly sends her  
<br />
to Vega. There is great doubt in the minds of the controllers outside  
<br />
the machine that it will work properly but she affirms her deep  
<br />
conviction that the voyage should be undertaken in this fashion as  
<br />
they continually check in with her during the launch countdown. See it  
<br />
if you haven't already - a truly inspirational sci-fi (novel and  
<br />
film). Also has a lot to say about the interface of science and  
<br />
religion. Are you a Sagan freak? I miss Carl sorely...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You should print it and put it in your kitchen or toilet, and put a

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elementary encouragement tricks. Never mind.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Good idea. Given that she is ahead of me without even studying any of  
<br />
this stuff, maybe SHE should put the big red cross on each step when  
<br />
she is happy with my progress!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course Everett could be wrong, and comp could be wrong, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; naturalism could be right: but it is up to the naturalist to say  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; is the machine's atomic operation that a Turing machine cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; complete. If it is the generation of a truly random event, and if  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; is based on the wave collapse, then I can understand (but you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; have to solve all the problem raised by the collapse, you will  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; abandon the theory of relativity like Bohm and Bell suggested,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; etc.).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Or you say like Searle that &quot;only special machine can think:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; biological brain&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If Searle (and Penrose) are right, then why not a simple biological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; brain transplant? Why bother with looking for &quot;the right substitution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; level&quot; at all in this case?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Just pilfer a wet, messy brain from a road accident victim and shove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it into your skull. But where would we now stand with respect to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; indeterminacy?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I asked my partner today whether she felt she would be the same  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; after receiving a biological brain transplant and she said &quot;Of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not! I would now be the dead person whose brain I have inherited. Who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am is generated only by MY brain.&quot; Proves she is a materialist/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physicalist, I guess. We all know people like this. Sigh.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah gosh Kim, be careful or add enough smileys when you do jokes.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK - will use emoticons from now on - I promise! (I am very slack  
<br />
here, agreed, but then - as you now know - the Everything List Court  
<br />
Jester reserves the right to lace a lot of his discourse with humour!  
<br />
What are court jesters for, after all? Smilies ultimately weaken the  
<br />
power of the humour, just like in (a good many but by no means all)  
<br />
Hollywood films where the moral of the story is ALWAYS given at the  
<br />
end in case the audience was too dumb or too drunk to follow the  
<br />
discourse and its implications. There appears to me to be a certain  
<br />
point in leaving the listener to wonder whether it was a joke or not -  
<br />
this, for me, is the 'serious' aspect of humour, that I have alluded  
<br />
to in the past - if that isn't too self-contradictory. Comes of being  
<br />
a composer (of music) - an aesthete. I like to occasionally trick the  
<br />
audience or test their ability to view something from an unexpected  
<br />
perspective (maybe not the best thing to do with scientists,  
<br />
mathematicians and logicians!). Example: in the second movement of Sir  
<br />
William Walton's 1st Symphony (Scherzo, con Malizia) I say that there  
<br />
is much &quot;malicious use of musical humour&quot; but some do not get this  
<br />
when they hear it. As if the composer's own use of &quot;con malizia&quot; to  
<br />
describe the mood and tempo of his piece does not already provide an  
<br />
&quot;external clue&quot;... but musical humour is hard for many to appreciate,  
<br />
particularly as here - in a symphony; an instrumental composition  
<br />
where there are no words being sung to &quot;explain&quot; the accompanying  
<br />
music. There is no musical equivalent of the emoticon because ALL of  
<br />
music is an emotional &quot;con job&quot; - much poetry is the same - would you  
<br />
ask Shakespeare to use smilies? ;-D
<br />
<br />OK - we are doing serious explanatory work here so I will cut back on  
<br />
the cryptic stuff
<br />
<br />To get back on-topic:
<br />
<br /><br />Actually I wasn't joking! Sorry to be an &quot;inconsistent machine&quot; (or  
<br />
more likely just a momentarily confused and chatty one). Up to now I  
<br />
felt that the basis of MEC was the existence of the substitution level  
<br />
which allows that all body parts, indeed anything &quot;immaterial&quot; is  
<br />
simulable. Consciousness itself is not simulable as you say; because  
<br />
consciousness is not even yet &quot;immaterial&quot; (having no shape, form,  
<br />
ideal description etc.) It probably does not supervene on brain  
<br />
activity but is the conjunction of the many-histories of the &quot;I&quot;. For  
<br />
me, that means that one functional brain (digi or wet) is as good as  
<br />
another provided it functions correctly. A brain is, in the first  
<br />
instance at least, a receiver, not a transmitter. We can transmit  
<br />
thoughts, feelings, ideas etc. to each other only after we have  
<br />
downloaded today's emails from Platonia.
<br />
<br />I now accept though, that the thing that I wasn't taking into account  
<br />
was the &quot;encoding&quot; of the neurons with the contents of the histories  
<br />
as memories. Part of my personhood is reflected in the fact that I can  
<br />
recall my own past.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is of course your partner who is right.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming the neurophysiological evidences, your biological wet brain  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in your skull is the one responsible for your personal memories,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; character and identity. That is why we have to scan and copy brain  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (in the teleportation experiences) at a sufficiently fine grained  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But I have a digi-brain. Perhaps you already have most of its contents  
<br />
backed-up on your system - so the scanning procedure can be  
<br />
simplified; just a quick synchronisation required ;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I take your brain out of your skull, and put the brain of a pig  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in there: the pig survives, with your body.
</em><br />
<br /><br />entendu - the history-traces of pighood are encoded in the neurons of  
<br />
its brain. I felt previously that these might evaporate on removal of  
<br />
the pig's brain from its body - like volatile RAM. I guess this  
<br />
thought, were it true, would be to assume that the mind is the &quot;ghost  
<br />
in the machine&quot; and then we are no longer dealing with comp
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You die or disappear, in the usual clinical sense. I guess you are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK with this, I mean with this point, if not (re)read the 2.1 posts  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or drink more coffee, I dunno ...).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Accompli - probably needs more study
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When your partner said &quot;Who I am is generated only by MY brain&quot;, she  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not making necessarily a &quot;materialist commitment&quot; . her statement  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could as well be interpreted as a computationalist commitment: she  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *has* a brain. Tell her that, assuming MEC, she could have more than  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one brain, with backup of instantaneous past state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Yes
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I then asked her if she would feel herself to be the same person  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a digi-brain transplant. She responded that this was maybe possible,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but she felt dubious about it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Would there in fact be any difference? After all, we are assuming  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; wet, messy brains and digi-brains are equivalent, all things  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; considered?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With MEC (and the neurophysiological evidences) Wet-brain and digi- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain are equivalent in their potentialities (and are indeed  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalent with any universal machine).
</em><br />
<br /><br />This affirms my feeling, expressed earlier
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But once &quot;programmed&quot;, by relative life events or by copy or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever, they are no more identical and differentiates through  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memories and experiences. Nor is your computer hard disk identical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with mine, despite they are both digi-brain, with similar capacities.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is what I was missing. Virgin tabula rasa brains are difficult to  
<br />
come across, I guess. Even the newborn does not possess this
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am talking for the short terms, the everyday life prediction,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which the UDA will show that they have to be explained or re- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explained if we assume MEC.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What you say could be interpreted again in a larger sense, at  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another level (once you identify yourself with the universal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine: then indeed you survive even with a pig brain substitution,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but not in a useful way to derive the physical laws. It concerns the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *very* long run only.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Messy brains, digi-brains, whatever- brains, what makes us is what  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is written there.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think you mean that they make us what is encoded in them, their  
<br />
contents are all-important
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You would not be so happy if we substitute our hard disks, all right?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Might be a bit dull, yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; In that case we have to suppose something very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; special about the brain: it generates consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This made me laugh out loud. I just love it when you say things like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this. Perhaps we must give up on the notion that personhood has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; anything at all to do with a brain?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm afraid I must a bit temper your enthusiasm. Without my brain and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my computer, it would be hard for me to answer your post. What will  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens, is that MEC will show that the brain is not responsible for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the existence of your consciousness, it is needed only to entangle  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your computations (going through to your states of mind) with mine,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so that we can share a conversation, indeed an history (or a sheaf  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of similar histories). OK?
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK - it is more a question of the brain's role as a node or a hub -  
<br />
not as a generator (except in the trivial, everyday sense)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; But this is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; a blocking argument: it could be interesting only if it points on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; something special in the brain that a digital machine cannot  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; imitate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Without such specification it is just equivalent with the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; *assumption*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that the brain is not a digital machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Enter the soul, enter religion - enter the supernatural. Hummmph!!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Soul? Of course it all depends on the sense of the words. I like to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identify or define the 3-soul by the coded body/brain or its backup,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the 1-soul, by the owner of that code.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Makes sense. But we are computationalist practitioners. Materialist/ 
<br />
physicalists (like Dawkins and Dennett) still do not understand this.  
<br />
I wish they did, because everything else they are doing I consider  
<br />
heroic and positively necessary! Please get onto RichardDawkins.net  
<br />
and unburden yourself, Bruno!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The immaterial one who choose a new body every morning and evening  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (if you remember 2.1).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah, oui
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Religion? Well, that could be more problematical indeed, like  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideologies or anything using long term moral authoritative normative  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguments (full of hidden or not logical errors usually).
</em><br />
<br /><br />THIS is the thing that Dawkins and Dennett heroically fight. Neither  
<br />
have yet managed to say anything about ultimate reality, if you are  
<br />
right.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Supernatural, well &quot;natural&quot; is already too much magical for me  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (unless it is for natural numbers of course ;).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Could this possibly be a Bruno &quot;quotable quote?&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hummmph?? (well this means the same everywhere I guess, even for the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Soon 2.4, 2.5, 2.6. Which correspond to UDA steps 4, 5, 6 on the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slide and in the 2004 paper.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No need of more math than we have already use for going to 2.6  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; included.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then for 2.7; either you take my word for some key point, and then  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2.7 can be made easily (as easily as the preceding steps), or, (as I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; secretly hope) you don't take my word and ask for the true  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding of the seventh step, but then we have to open the gate  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of mathematics.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I will need to invest a lot of time in grappling with that. Maybe  
<br />
better if I just take your word for it! I will try though
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is that point? It is the point of the existence of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal machine. This has to be seen as:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - a theorem in mathematical computer science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - a schema of theorems in mathematical computer science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - a thesis overlapping mathematics and philosophy
</em><br />
<br /><br />When does it become an engineering problem that we can turn over to  
<br />
Brent? ;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To understand this, it is useful to understand the explosive &quot;many  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incompleteness&quot; which is the price that the universal machine has to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pay for that universality. Assuming the MEC hypothesis, it is a big  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; price *we* have to pay ...
</em><br />
<br /><br />The prison of our consciousness - we cannot get outside
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2.7 eliminates all the trace of &quot;science-fiction&quot; of the preceding  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; steps, and is needed to understand that the UD Argument is an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eliminative argument, that is a proof, up to a remaining &quot;big&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothesis: the existence of a &quot;concrete&quot; universal dovetailing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I can &quot;see&quot; the UD? What does it look like?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then 2.8, UDA 8, or the MGA (Movie Graph Argument)  eliminates that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remaining &quot;big&quot; hypothesis, and completes the reversal. Darwin has  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be extended to the physical laws, they evolve through an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical self-reflection &quot;process&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here Dawkins may want to agree with you but he hasn't the right to  
<br />
yet, being physicalist. Send him a bag of Salvia, Doctor....
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then 3? (cf the plan). It will depend of the appetite.
</em><br />
<br /><br />My eyes are ALWAYS bigger than my belly (= my enthusiasm to understand  
<br />
always surpasses my technical ability to do so. I am working on that,  
<br />
with your expert help.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA is enough to understand the reduction of physics to the theology  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of numbers. 3 is really the &quot;UDA for the dummies&quot;, where the dummy  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person here *is* the (chatty) universal machine who knows she is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, that sure sounds like moi. Thanks for being so politically- 
<br />
correct about it!!!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3 is really far simpler that the UDA, given that for 3 we really  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presuppose only the understanding of three very elementary axioms of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic. Unfortunately, by this very token, by the fact that the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pure virgin umprogrammed universal machine is so dummy, the UDA  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; becomes far longer, and mathematics get only more sophisticated,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because  we have to shorten the conversation. It happens that Gödel,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Löb, Solovay and others have already make the hard part of that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shortening. Take it easy, one step at a time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />VERY small steps, in my case. The tempo will doubtless quicken later.  
<br />
I can always play the music at a faster tempo after I know the notes :-)
<br />
<br />regards,
<br />
<br />K
