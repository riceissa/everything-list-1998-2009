<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; subjective probabilities for the next observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; moment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's with the very notion of a &quot;continuer&quot; that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I've always had a problem. So let me ask you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a little about it. Now clearly, if ten minutes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from now the Earth Stathis is to be killed, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a Martian duplicate is made five minutes from

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;now, you---the present Stathis---don't really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have a problem with that (that is, not a problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that couldn't be fixed with a big bribe).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So next, let me ask about a new situation in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which one hour from now you are to die here,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but a duplicate of you will the same second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be established on Mars, only this duplicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has a little amnesia, and doesn't remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the last half-hour of its life. Would that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be a continuer of you?  Would it be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continuer of &quot;you+60_minutes&quot; from now?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Will it only be a continuer of &quot;you+30_minutes&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from now? Is it a continuer of the you-now?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How about this? For ten million dollars, would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you agree to have the last ten minutes of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;memory erased, where you are now?
</em><br />
<br />These are all interesting questions that have bothered me for a long time. I 
<br />
think the most useful suggestion I can make about how to decide whether 
<br />
other versions of a person are or aren't &quot;continuers&quot; or the &quot;same person&quot; 
<br />
is to avoid a direct answer at all and ask - as you have done - how much 
<br />
memory loss a person would tolerate before they felt they would not be the 
<br />
&quot;same&quot; person. This is something that comes up all the time in clinical 
<br />
situations. I would say that definitely I would not want total memory 
<br />
erasure at any price, because that would be like dying. On the other hand, 
<br />
10 minutes of memory loss for ten million dollars (especially if they were 
<br />
US dollars, instead of our prettier and more durable, but less valuable, 
<br />
Australian kind) is an offer I would definitely take up; in fact, people pay 
<br />
to get drunk on a Friday night and suffer more memory loss than this.
<br />
<br />Before you ask, this raises another interesting question: would I agree for 
<br />
the same amount of money to be painlessly killed 10 minutes after being 
<br />
duplicated? Given that I believe my duplicate provides seamless continuity 
<br />
of consciousness from the point of duplication, this should be the same as 
<br />
losing 10 minutes of memory. However, I would probably balk at being 
<br />
&quot;killed&quot; if it were happening for the first time, and I might hesitate even 
<br />
if I knew that it had happened to me many times before.
<br />
<br />Yet another variation: for 10 million dollars, would you agree to undergo a 
<br />
week of excruciating pain, and then have the memory of the week wiped? What 
<br />
if you remember agreeing to this 100 times in the past; that is, you 
<br />
remember agreeing to it, then a moment later experiencing a slight 
<br />
discontinuity, and being given the ten million dollars (which let's say you 
<br />
gambled all away). You were told every time you would experience pain, but 
<br />
all you experienced was being given the money. Would it be tempting to agree 
<br />
to this again (&quot;and this time, I'll put the money in the bank&quot;)?
<br />
<br />These are not trivial questions. The basic problem is that our minds have 
<br />
evolved in a world where there is no copying and no memory loss (memory loss 
<br />
may have occurred naturally, of course, but evolution's answer to it would 
<br />
have been to wipe out the affected individual and their genes), so there is 
<br />
a mismatch between reason and intuition.
