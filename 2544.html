<br />True, but I believe of much greater importance for this discussion is the
<br />
difference in the obervations made by two observers, of a particular event, when
<br />
their continued existence is contingent in different degree by this event. They
<br />
will experience with different degree of probability, the occurence of this
<br />
event. The key is the contingency relationship between the event and the
<br />
observers. It defines the observers' &quot;frame of reference.&quot;
<br />
<br />Each observer, then, has his own first person perspective of the event. First
<br />
person perspective is therefore the fundamental perspective. Third person
<br />
perspective is an illusion shared by two observers when they occupy the exact
<br />
same frame of reference (as defined by the set of contingencies on their
<br />
existence). Bruno, Jacques and George have a third person perspective in common
<br />
because the laws of physics and other earthly environments that sustain them are
<br />
identical.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Science is (ideally) a pure 3-person discourse and will ever be.
</em><br />
<br />Let me qualify the above statement in my own words. The development by a group
<br />
of observers of an &quot;objective&quot;  (i.e., third person) science is only possible if
<br />
they  restrict themselves to the domain of events and to the studies of laws
<br />
that affect their existence equally.
<br />
<br />Here is a thought experiment to illustrate this point. Let us say that a ***very
<br />
reliable*** machine is designed to instantly kill several scientists unless the
<br />
natural laws are modified to a different configuration than the one we currently
<br />
have, but still capable of sustaining life. The wave function of these scientist
<br />
will then be restricted to a set of worlds in which laws of physics are
<br />
different. These scientists will have absolutely no awareness of having their
<br />
wave function restricted. They could even find other scientists so restricted,
<br />
and together they could develop an &quot;objective&quot; third person science customized
<br />
to their world, and share what they believe to be  &quot;objective&quot; information.
<br />
Their science will be different from ours, but from their common points of view,
<br />
it would be objective.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Some time ago &quot;merde&quot; was considered as very vulgar, but since then it has been
</em><br />
overthrown by &quot;shit&quot;, or &gt;worse ... &quot;Merde&quot; seems almost polite in comparison. I
<br />
don't know about &quot;crap&quot;. It seems to me we don't &gt;use that word (in Belgium).
<br />
<br />Really? &quot;shit&quot; has become a French word? Talk about Franglais! I rather go back
<br />
to the good old days when Pierre Elliot Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister,
<br />
said on the steps of Parliament,  to a group of strikers, &quot;Mange la merde.&quot;
