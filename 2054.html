<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; So you admit that the observer moment is to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; experienced, precisely what I said about the &quot;I.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Are you saying that the first step in understanding

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; the world  is subjective? If you do, then we agree:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; &quot;I think&quot; = observer-moment =  subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      I don't know what you mean by subjective.  If by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  &quot;subjective&quot; you mean &quot;pertaining to a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  observer-moment&quot;, than an observer-moment would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  qualify.  But keep in mind that other observer-moments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  exist, that they are just as real, and that the ratio
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  of numbers of different types of such is a feature of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  the objective reality.
</em><br />
<br />You are expounding here the concept of objective reality, almost as if your 
<br />
&quot;other observer-moments&quot; could exist independently of observers.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;      But I don't think by &quot;I&quot; you mean an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  observer-moment, since then you would deny QTI.
</em><br />
<br />I think that in some respect we are close to agreeing on the equivalence of 
<br />
observer-moment and &quot;I.&quot; In any case, it is worth trying to find out how we 
<br />
differ. We must work out a few things. 
<br />
<br />First the name itself &quot;observer-moment&quot; presupposes the concept of time. It 
<br />
implies a infinitesimally thin slice of space-time with dt-&gt; 0. (i.e., 
<br />
moment). I find it difficult to believe that such an entity could be the 
<br />
&quot;atom&quot; of cognition. I rather work out with a slice in logical space than a 
<br />
slice in space-time. By slice in logical space, I mean a slice involving a 
<br />
single elementary logical process. In this respect I am leaning toward the 
<br />
approach advanced by Bruno, that physics should be a branch of psychology.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; If the world was wabbity then some elements of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; world would exist with absolutely no reason at all. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; ... My earlier post deriving the existence of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; the Plenitude using the rationality of the world as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; a starting point would be irrelevent and therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; irrationality would preclude the need for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Plenitude.  The Copenhagen school would actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; advocate the simplest approach to QM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      I don't think so.  It depends on what you use to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  decide what &quot;simplest&quot; means of course.  My approach
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  is algorithmic complexity, but as I have said, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  that criterion for Occam's razor, no possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  observation would falsify the AUH.  Even the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  wabbitty observation would still bear witness to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  likelihood that it is not due to a coincidence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  nature, but is instead one of many.
</em><br />
<br />I agree 100% with you that &quot;no possible observation would falsify the AUH.&quot; 
<br />
If we make a wabbity observation there are three ways to go: 
<br />
<br />1) Deny that the observation is wabbity and keep looking for a cause in the 
<br />
world which is accessible to us. This approach which may lead to infinite 
<br />
causal regress may not be falsifiable on practical grounds.
<br />
<br />2) Declare that this observation has no cause. This is the Copenhagen school. 
<br />
It denies the possibility that the world could have a completely rational 
<br />
basis. In the absence of rationality, falsifiability becomes a moot point.
<br />
<br />3) Declare that the observation is symmetrical with its opposite in a 
<br />
completely inaccessible world. This approach would conserve symmetry and 
<br />
rationality but is not falsifiable on theoretical grounds. Somehow the MWI 
<br />
does not seem to fall under this case. Even though those other worlds are 
<br />
&quot;inaccessible&quot; we do get experimental evidence that they exist and we do use 
<br />
those worlds (as in quantum computing for example). Something is missing. How 
<br />
can we be aware of and affected by worlds which are inaccessible? I believe 
<br />
that the missing link has to do with the ability of consciousness to span 
<br />
several of the MWs. I.e., consciousness has &quot;thickness&quot; across worlds? Is 
<br />
there a relationship between this &quot;thickness&quot; and Planck's constant? I don't 
<br />
know enough about physics to pursue this line of reasonning.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Yet, the root of all knowledge must start with the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; basic assumption about the self, about our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; own rationality and about our own observations. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; agree that it makes sense to talk about 3rd person,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; but only as a derived or deduced fact from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; first person perspective. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      It's deduced from known facts, which is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  observer-moment.  (Technically, from the memory + laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  of the brain *at each step*. The brain can follow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  many steps of computation; while each observer-moment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  sees only one, later observer-moments can benefit from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  the results of the calculation done by the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  earlier 
</em><br />
<br />You are really much closer here to my logical space slice idea than to the 
<br />
space-time slice concept.
<br />
<br /><br />just as they can benefit from books previously
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  read by the brain written by other people entirely or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  by a lucky coincidence of cosmic rays which implants
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  false memories.  Computationalism asserts that such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  brain is conscious, but other schools of thought would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  make a distinction such that, for example, a zombie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  brain would still make the same deductions as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  conscious brain.
</em><br />
<br />This confusion originates from the fact that the perception of consciousness 
<br />
is relativistic and tied to the frame of reference of the observer. From my 
<br />
perspective, the zombie/non-zombie paradox is a red herring. Computationalism 
<br />
+ Relativity would breeze through this problem.
<br />
<br />Even with computationalism, a
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  distinction must be maintained between the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  system (wavefunction of brain) and observers, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  such a wavefunction can give rise to multiple distinct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  observer-moments at the same time, and that number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (measure) can vary with time.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Saying that (physical) computationalism is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; (anthropically) emergent from consciousness is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; first person statement. I am referring here to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; fact that the world is rational -- seems to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; simulatable on a computer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      That's not what computationalism means.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
