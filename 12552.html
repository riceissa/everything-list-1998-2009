<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; computationalism &gt; is true; it may not be true, in which case neither 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; a rock nor a computer may be &gt; conscious. There is no natural syntax 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; or semantics for a computer telling us &gt; what should count as a &quot;1&quot; or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; a &quot;0&quot;, what should count as a red perception, and &gt; so on. These 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; things are determined by how the computer is designed to interact &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; with its environment, whether that mean outputting the sum of two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; numbers to &gt; a screen or interacting with a human to convince him that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; it is conscious. But what &gt; if the environment is made part of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; computer? The constraint on meaning and &gt; syntax would then go, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the vibration of atoms in a rock could be implementing &gt; any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; computation, including any conscious computation, if such there are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; John Searle, among others, believes this is absurd, and that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; therefore it disproves &gt; computationalism. Another approach is that it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; shows that it is absurd that consciousness &gt; supervenes on physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; activity of any sort, but we can keep computationalism and &gt; drop the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; physical supervenience criterion, as Bruno has.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I have a view that seems to me to be slightly different.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Consciousness requires interaction with an environment; consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; implicitly requires a distinction between &quot;I&quot; and &quot;the world&quot;.  So 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; when you attribute consciousness to a rock, incorporating &quot;the world&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; as part of the rock, while the remainder of the rock is &quot;conscious&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that raises problems.  We can say that this part of the rock is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; conscious of that part; making some arbitrary division of the rock.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; But then it's not conscious in/of our universe.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That's right: if it's conscious, then it's conscious in its own isolated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; virtual universe. It's another means to a many worlds theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; When you say there is no canonical syntax, which is what allows 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; anything to be a computation of anything else, I think that is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; overstates the case.  Suppose a particular pair of iron atoms in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; rock are magnetically aligned and the syntax counts that as &quot;0&quot; while 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; anti-aligned counts as &quot;1&quot;.  Then what computation is implemented by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;0000000...&quot;?  The arbitrariness of syntax supposedly allows this to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; be translated into &quot;27&quot; or some other number.  But then the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; translation has to have all possible words in it and the relational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; meanings of those words; including the words for all the numbers in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that world.  This places a pretty strong restriction on the size of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the rock-world - there are only some 10^25 atoms to do all this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; representing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The rock can make numbers and universes as big as you want through the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; method of parallel computing. Suppose the rock had only a few distinct 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physical states. If we place no restriction on what these states can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; represent, then they can represent multiple binary strings or finite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; numbers or sentences or whatever - all in parallel. Any serial 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computation can be made up of multiple parallel computations, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find that doubtful - do you have a reference?  Isn't it the definition of &quot;incompressible&quot; computation that there is no way faster than executing each step in sequence.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not referring to speed, just to doing it. For example, a serial stream of consciousness 
<br />
can be emulated by multiple shorter parallel streams; there is no way of knowing whether 
<br />
you're being run in serial, parallel, how fast the real world clock is running, etc. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;and vice 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; versa. You can't say, aha, we've used that string for &quot;dog&quot; so we can't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; now use it for &quot;cat&quot;, because who is going to patrol the universe to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; enforce this rule? This is what you are left with if you eliminate the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; constraint that the computation has to interact with an external observer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think my objection is different.  You are assuming there is a &quot;we&quot; too whom these strings represent something, but in the closed rock-world there is no &quot;we&quot;. The representation must be this conscious-part of the rock representing that other-part of the rock.  But how can one part represent the other - by having a dictionary that translates states of one into the other.  But how is the dictionary encoded?  It seems there's an infinite regress.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How is this infinite regress avoided in our world?  By consciousness not representing the rest of the world.  The world is what it is and representation is not essential.  I suppose this is somewhat like Peter's &quot;primitive substance&quot; whose only function is to distinguish things that exist from their representation.
</em><br />
<br />Then there must be a way to distinguish true reality from virtual reality. This 
<br />
is something like Colin Hale's idea that the environment participates in the 
<br />
brain process that produces consciousness (which he aims to prove by 
<br />
experiment, a staggering achievent if he succeeds), so that an isolated 
<br />
virtual reality is impossible. 
<br />
<br />Of course, in the evolution of brains and in the design of digital computers, 
<br />
the semantics is provided by the real world; similarly in human language, the 
<br />
semantics is provided by the language speakers. Without the provision of 
<br />
a semantic context it's gibberish. But there is a special quality that consciousness 
<br />
has which other systems lack: it is conscious in and of itself. Take the following 
<br />
steps:
<br />
<br />1. A conscious computer is built to interact with its environment, say digging holes.
<br />
<br />2. A co-processor is added (which need itself not be conscious) to provide the 
<br />
computer with a virtual environment in which to dig the holes, so that all the input 
<br />
that came from the real environment comes from this co-processor and all the 
<br />
motor output from the computer goes to the coprocessor. 
<br />
<br />3. The computer and coprocessor are connected together and sealed in a capsule 
<br />
with power input from a solar panel.
<br />
<br />4. Everybody dies and there is no record left which will give a clue as to what the 
<br />
original computer was meant to do or how it was designed. 
<br />
<br />I claim than at step 4 it is impossible to know that the computer was designed to dig 
<br />
holes, but that it will still be digging holes in its own mind (maybe the same holes 
<br />
after a while) until it breaks down. Do you think it stops being conscious at one of 
<br />
the steps 2 to 4?

<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am aware that this is a very strange idea, perhaps even an absurd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; idea, but I don't see any way out of it without ruining 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computationalism, as by saying that it's all bunk, or only computations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that can interact with the environment at the level of their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; implementation can be conscious. Because if you insist on the latter, it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; implies something like ESP: the computer will know the difference 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; between a false sensory stimulus and one emanating from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; environment... possible, but not very Turing-emulable.
