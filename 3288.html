<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Let me propose a conjecture and let us see how far we can go with it:

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;Morality is the creation, protection and preservation of information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Immorality is the destruction of information.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The Taliban operate within a very inflexible system. Bruno would call it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;G. Our system on the other hand is much more flexible and adaptable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Because our way of life allows a continuous adaptation we cannot be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;described as a G. -- WE ARE THE TRUE REVOLUTIONARIES! Clearly we present
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;a threat to the terrorists: OUR WAY OF LIFE SHOWS THAT THEIR G IS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;INCONSISTENT! In an evil attempt to restore their consistency, they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;attempt to eliminate our way of life. They won't succeed. We shall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;adapt. The world will end up better with more information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In term of G/G* the two enemies of the UTM I described were those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines which communicates they are consistent ([]&lt;&gt;t), the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines which communicates they are inconsistent ([][]t).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And then there are the traditional communicator of the false ([]t).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Among those are the &quot;mad machine&quot;, &quot;the wrong machine&quot; the &quot;dreaming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine&quot;, and the lier. 
</em><br />
<br />In common human parlance: 
<br />
the machines which communicates they are consistent ([]&lt;&gt;t) == Fanatics
<br />
the machines which communicates they are inconsistent ([][]t) == People
<br />
with terribly poor self esteem
<br />
the &quot;mad machine&quot; == Illogical people 
<br />
the &quot;the wrong machine&quot; = Misled people
<br />
the &quot;dreaming machine&quot; = Schizophrenics
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your expression &quot;their G&quot; is ambiguous.
</em><br />
<br />I guess I was talking mostly about the fanatics and the misled people.
<br />
One could also argue that these people do not have a rigorous scientific
<br />
upbringing and are very much driven by their emotions. Therefore, they
<br />
may be classified as illogical. They definitely are not schizos and do
<br />
not suffer from poor self esteem.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course any machine or entity feeling free to ask and talk is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; threat for totalitarian power.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;To go any further I must now define the concept of objective world in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;relative terms. Objective worlds are worlds which share frames of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;reference &quot;close enough&quot; to the first person world as to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;indistinguishable from it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is an interesting idea which could help us for defining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the first person plural. I interpret your &quot;worlds&quot; as histories though.
</em><br />
<br />Instantaneous states of minds (Observer-Moments) that include
<br />
PERCEPTIONS of histories.  
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;First and third person perceptions are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;identical when the third persons live in such objective worlds. First
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;and third person perceptions differ (as in Quantum Suicide QS or FIN)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;when the frames of reference are too far apart.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure there could be third person perception. May be I miss
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something. Perhaps you mean the first person plural which indeed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is localy third person and is linked to continua of very similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; histories (which interfere from the 1-plural point of view). OK then.
</em><br />
<br />I have been using &quot;first person and third person&quot; to accomodate the
<br />
vocabulary used in this list. However, there is definitely something
<br />
wrong with these concepts. All perceptions have to be first person. 
<br />
<br />When the frame of reference are very close to each other &quot;first person
<br />
and third person perceptions are identical. 
<br />
<br />When the frames of reference are too dissimilar as in QS, there is no
<br />
objective reality, and therefore, there is no &quot;third person.&quot; 
<br />
<br />In either case the concept of &quot;third person&quot; is useless. So why use
<br />
&quot;first person?&quot;
<br />
<br />This paradox can easily be solved by falling back on a relativistic
<br />
approach. Each observer has his/her own frame of reference. All
<br />
perceptions are relative to the observer. Period. After all, Einstein's
<br />
Relativity does not use &quot;first person&quot; and &quot;third person.&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I would like to make a distinction between absolute morality and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;objective morality. As I explained above absolute morality does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;exist - absolute information remains at zero no matter what. Objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;morality on the other hand does because objective worlds do exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Objective information can change.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK if you still interpret &quot;objective worlds&quot; as shared continua of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; near computational histories (with comp, sorry).
</em><br />
<br />OK. With comp. But as I mentionned above, we are dealing with
<br />
instantaneous mental (memory) states that include perceptions of
<br />
histories.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;QS or FIN however does not fall within the scope of objective morality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;because, in this case, the first and third person worlds are very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;significantly different. The only type of morality that applies is first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;person morality. It appears that the action of QTI or FIN actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;creates first person information! Since I believe that measure does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;change with QS it appears that QS or FIN is actually moral! This is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;disturbing but IMO an inescapable conclusion!!!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. And that explain why there is nothing wrong with suicide, a priori,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at least once your relative agrees and you are prudent not wounding or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; killing others in the process.
</em><br />
<br />hmmmmm. I would not be aware of dying and therefore not be aware
<br />
wounding or killing other people. My heart agrees with you but not my
<br />
mind. This is counterintuitive!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now as I said, comp is not normative and admit quite incompatible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical extensions, some bearing on moral questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main difference is between those who accept teleportation with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delayed *annihilation*, and those who doesn't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What do you think of the people of the planet Ixbul? They fear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the non success of the reconstitution so that they made themselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; annihilated only after a conversation with their own doppelganger.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is that a form of suicide?
</em><br />
<br />The problem is that, from their own point of view, their annihilation
<br />
will not succeed!!! The annihilation machine will break! They will
<br />
remain stuck with their doppelganger. Oh well! Their identity will begin
<br />
diverging from the moment of duplication and new information will be
<br />
created. This information will not be lost. The operation therefore is
<br />
moral.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some on Ixbul accepts to do the following: to duplicate themselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and then killing randomly, with a coin, one of them. They repeat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the trial 64 times. They do not impose the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tribulation to any other, and that test is available for adult only.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is that immoral? (I suppose they have found a way of killing themselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absolutely, which does not necessarily exists with comp!).
</em><br />
<br />Their perception is that the coin will come up in their favor 64 times
<br />
in a row! Assuming ideal operation of the duplicator, there is no loss
<br />
of information and therefore the operation is not immoral. In the
<br />
plenitude, of course, theysh all survive!
<br />
