<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Brian,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was wondering if you could connect (in the paper) the maths with our

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe? As an example. What set operations or structures correspond to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the standard particle model entities, what constitutes a chemical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reaction or energy, what space is made of... that kind of thing. Maybe

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is supposed to be obvious... if it is then sorry... but you've lost

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (as an audience) the entire world above mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics...especially biofolks.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

I think this is what usual theoretical physics is trying to do.  As an 
<br />
example, Torgny mentioned R^4 as being a relevant structure in General 
<br />
Relativity.  In string theory, the relevant structure is, as far as I've 
<br />
read in the lay literature, some 11 (give or take) dimensional 
<br />
manifold.  As such, connecting the ultimate context structure I am 
<br />
working towards to specific structures that represent things like 
<br />
particle interaction would constitute a complete theory of physics and, 
<br />
therefore, I myself am unable to see how this would be done.  It perhaps 
<br />
can be done but I lack the knowledge to do so.
<br />
<br />Perhaps one thing to keep in mind is that this is a step towards a 
<br />
mathematical representation of the so called -level 4- multiverse, by 
<br />
which I'm referencing material here:
<br />
<a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/multiverse.html">http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/multiverse.html</a>
<br />
<br />In Tegmark's &quot;ultimate ensemble&quot; paper, there is a diagram of physics 
<br />
and maths structures, part of which is here:
<br />
<a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/toe.gif">http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/toe.gif</a>
<br />
All structures, including those in the top row, which are the ones I 
<br />
think you're asking about Colin, would have the property of being 
<br />
elementarily embeddable within the ultimate structure I'm 
<br />
investigating.  (Keep in mind the deficency I mentioned in my previous 
<br />
post.)  Roughly speaking, to quote a wiki article, &quot;In model theory 
<br />
&lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory</a>&gt;, an *elementary embedding* 
<br />
is a special case of an embedding 
<br />
&lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding#Model_theory">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding#Model_theory</a>&gt; that preserves all 
<br />
first-order formulas.&quot;
<br />
<br />In short, the sub-structures, so to speak, of the ultimate structure I 
<br />
am working towards that are relevant to Quantum Field Theory or General 
<br />
Relativity (such as R^4) are covered in other texts.  This paper I am 
<br />
working on is to provide an answer to the question which is the subject 
<br />
of this thread, raised my Tegmark.  I'm afraid I don't know enough about 
<br />
mathematical physics to be more explicit.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am a quintessentially visual/spatial thinker.. math does not speak 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very well to me unless I can 'see' the operations happening. in my mind. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don;t manipulate symbols. I manipulate 'stuff' and then retrofit symbols.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would also like to see how an observer with qualia might be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructed of it. In other words...how a universe thus constructed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might create its own scientist describing it in the way you do....Having 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looked at the paper I hold some hope that it might contain a formalism I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can use to construct the set theoretic basis of my own model... it might 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be within yours....maybe... not sure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
This is an excellent line of questioning and one I have high hopes to 
<br />
one day seeing answered.  In Tegmark's first of two papers along the 
<br />
lines of a Mathematical Universe, he mentions what he calls Self Aware 
<br />
Structures (SAS's).  I have spent a lot of time wondering what type of 
<br />
mathematical structures would have self-awareness.  Two candidates that 
<br />
might be just fumbling in the dark are these:
<br />
David Wolpert of NASA has written some interesting articles on what he 
<br />
calls devices.  These devices are mathematical models of scientists plus 
<br />
investigative tools of scientists.  In this mathematical device (not 
<br />
completely unlike a Turing machine), it starts with a question and ends 
<br />
with an answer; his papers form a theory of how devices operate.  One of 
<br />
his papers is entitled &quot;the physical limits of inference.&quot;  Anyway, he 
<br />
talks at some point about self aware devices, and my understanding is 
<br />
that these devices X are ones who correctly answer the question &quot;is X a 
<br />
device?&quot;  That is at least some form of self awareness.  For a 
<br />
pseudo-second example of mathematical self awareness, I was thinking of 
<br />
self-referential first order logical formulas that, in essence, say &quot;I 
<br />
have property P,&quot; but let P be the property &quot;X is a 1st order formula&quot; 
<br />
so these special self-referential 1st order formulas would essentially 
<br />
be equivalent to &quot;I am this 1st order formula.&quot;  To simplify, that is 
<br />
like the sentence &quot;I am this sentence.&quot;  The open question is what is 
<br />
the nature of SAS's that corresponds to human self-awareness. I think 
<br />
constructing an observer with qualia mathematically would be a most 
<br />
excellent step and a necessary one to solve that open problem raised in 
<br />
Tegmark's first MUH paper.
