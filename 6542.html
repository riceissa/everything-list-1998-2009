<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with Lee's and Jonathan's comments, except that I think there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is something unusual about first person experience/ qualia/ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness in that there is an aspect that cannot be communicated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless you experience it (a blind man cannot know what it is like to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see, no matter how much he learns about the process of vision). Let me 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use the analogy of billiard balls and Newtonian mechanics. Everything 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that billiard balls do by themselves and with each other can be fully 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explained by the laws of physics. Moreover, it can all be modelled by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a computer program. But in addition, there is the state of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being-a-billiard-ball, which is something very strange and cannot be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicated to non-billiard balls, because it makes absolutely no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference to what is observed about them. It is not clear if this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aspect of billiard ball &quot;experience&quot; is duplicated by the computer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program, precisely because it makes no observable difference: you have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be the simulated billiard ball to know.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Before someone says that billiard balls are not complex enough to have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an internal life, I would point out that neither is there any way to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deduce a priori that humans have conscious experiences. You have to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually be a human to know this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You don't need to postulate a special mechanism whereby mind interacts 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with matter. The laws of physics explain the workings of the brain, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and conscious experience is just the strange, irreducible effect of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this as seen from the inside.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. Let me make a little try to explain briefly why I think that, 
<br />
although the first person cannot be reduced to any pure third person 
<br />
notion, yet, it is possible to explain in a third person way why the 
<br />
first person exists and why it cannot be reduced to any pure third 
<br />
person way.
<br />
<br />I will consider a machine M. The machine is supposed to be a sort of 
<br />
mathematician, or a theorem proving machine in arithmetic. I suppose 
<br />
the machine is sound: this means that if the machine proves some 
<br />
proposition p, then p is true. I will also suppose that the machine is 
<br />
programmed so as to assert all the propositions she can prove, in some 
<br />
order. So one day she proves 1+1=2. Another day she proves 17 is prime, 
<br />
and so on. So I will use &quot;M proves&quot; and &quot;M can prove&quot;  equivalently.
<br />
<br />As everyone knows or should know since Goedel 1931, it is possible to 
<br />
represent the *provability by the machine M* in the language of the 
<br />
machine (here the language is first order arithmetic, but the detail 
<br />
are irrelevant in this short explanation). I will write Bp for 
<br />
BEW(GN(p)), which is the representation of &quot;M proves p&quot; in the language 
<br />
of the machine. BEW(GN(p)), means really there is a number which codes 
<br />
a proof of the formula itself coded by GN(p). GN(p) is for the Godel 
<br />
number of p, which is the traditional encoding of p in arithmetic. BEW 
<br />
is for beweisbar: provable in German.
<br />
<br /><br />It has been proved by Hilbert, Bernays and Loeb that such a machine 
<br />
verifies the following condition, for any p representing an 
<br />
arithmetical proposition:
<br />
<br />1) If M proves p then M proves Bp   (sort of introspective ability: if 
<br />
the machine can prove p, the machine can prove that the machine can 
<br />
prove p)
<br />
<br />2) M proves (Bp &amp; B(p-&gt;q)) -&gt; Bq  (the machine can prove that if she 
<br />
proves p and if she proves p-&gt;q, then she will proves p). This means 
<br />
that the machine can prove that she follows the modus ponens inference 
<br />
rule (which is part of arithmetic). It is a second introspective 
<br />
ability.
<br />
<br />3) The machine M proves &quot;1)&quot;, i.e. M proves Bp -&gt; BBp. i.e. the machine 
<br />
proves that if she proves p, then she can prove that she can prove p.
<br />
<br /><br />If the machine is sound, the machine is necessarily consistent. That 
<br />
means the machine will not prove 1 + 1 = 3, or any false arithmetical 
<br />
statement. To make things easier, I suppose there is a constant false 
<br />
in the machine language, written f. I could have use the proposition 
<br />
1+1=3 instead, but &quot;f&quot; is shorter.
<br />
<br />So M is consistent is equivalent as saying that (NOT Bf) is true about 
<br />
M, i.e. when B is the provability of the machine (as I will no more 
<br />
repeat).
<br />
<br />Goedel second incompleteness theorem asserts that if M is consistent 
<br />
then M cannot prove M is consistent. This can be translate in the 
<br />
language of M:   (NOT Bf)  -&gt;  (NOT B (NOT Bf)).
<br />
We have two things: (NOT Bf)  -&gt;  (NOT B (NOT Bf)) is true *about* the 
<br />
machine, but we have also that the machine is able to prove it about 
<br />
itself: that (NOT Bf)  -&gt;  (NOT B (NOT Bf)) is can be proved by the 
<br />
machine.
<br />
Of course from this you know that (NOT Bf) is true about the machine, 
<br />
but that the machine cannot prove it.
<br />
<br />I hope you are able to verify if a proposition of classical 
<br />
propositional logic is a tautology or not. In particular  NOT A is has 
<br />
the same truth value that A -&gt; f. In particular consistency (NOT Bf) is 
<br />
equivalent to (Bf -&gt; f).
<br />
So if he machine is sound, and thus consistent, (Bf -&gt; f) is true about 
<br />
the machine, but cannot be proved by the machine.
<br />
<br />We see that in general, for any p, Bp -&gt; p is true about the machine 
<br />
(it is the soundness of the machine), but the machine cannot prove it 
<br />
for any p, in particular she cannot prove Bf -&gt; f, which is equivalent 
<br />
to its own consistency.
<br />
<br />This means that the sentences (Bp &amp; p) is equivalent to Bp, for any p,  
<br />
but the machine cannot prove this for any p.
<br />
<br />So if we define a new sort of proof of p by Cp = (Bp &amp; p), although 
<br />
exactly the same arithmetical p will be proved, the very logic of Cp 
<br />
will differ from the logic of Bp.   (Bp &lt;-&gt; Cp) is true about the 
<br />
machine but not provable by the machine. Actually  NOT B(Bp &lt;-&gt; Cp) and 
<br />
NOT C(Bp &lt;-&gt; Cp), are also true on the machine (and also not provable 
<br />
by the machine).
<br />
<br />There is thus a big gap between the truth on the machine, and what the 
<br />
machine can prove about itself.
<br />
<br />B can be used to modelise a form of scientist self-referential belief, 
<br />
or third person self-reference. It is a belief notion due to the fact 
<br />
that the machine cannot in general prove Bp -&gt; p, like it is asked for 
<br />
a knowledge notion. But the machine can prove Cp -&gt; p. (given that Cp 
<br />
is Bp &amp; p).
<br />
Actually it can be shown that Cp obeys the traditional axioms for 
<br />
knowledge. C can be used to modelise a form of machine first person 
<br />
knowledge. With comp, it is arguably not even a &quot;modelization&quot; (but I 
<br />
will not develop this point here).
<br />
<br />Important Remark: B can be translated in the language of the machine. 
<br />
It is a third person self-reference: the machine talk about itself 
<br />
through a third person description of itself (here = Goedel number): 
<br />
BEW(GN(p)). But C cannot be translated in the language of the machine. 
<br />
You will never find an equivalent of BEW for C. the simplest attempt 
<br />
would be Cp = BEW(GN(p)) &amp; TRUE(GN(p)), but by Tarski theorem TRUE 
<br />
itself cannot be translated in the language of the machine. So the C 
<br />
logic is self-referential as far as the machine does not attempt to 
<br />
give a name or a third person description to the owner of the 
<br />
knowledge. The definition Cp = Bp &amp; p is what I call the theatetus' 
<br />
definition of knowledge (given that it is the definition of knowledge.
<br />
<br />It can be shown that Cp gives rise to a logic of subjective 
<br />
antisymmetrical time equivalent to Brouwer's theory of consciousness. 
<br />
It is the modal logic S4Grz
<br />
<br />Axioms:
<br />
t:  Cp -&gt; p
<br />
k:  Cp &amp; C(p-&gt;q) -&gt; Cq
<br />
4:  Cp -&gt; CCp
<br />
Grz:  C(C(p-&gt;Cp)-&gt;p)-&gt;p   (Grz is respondible for the antisymmetry of 
<br />
the modal accessibility relation among worlds, for those who remember 
<br />
what I said on Kripke semantics).
<br />
<br />Rules:
<br />
Modus Ponens: if the machine knows p, and knows &quot;p-&gt;q&quot;, the machine 
<br />
knows q.
<br />
Necessitation: if the machine knows p, the machine knows that it knows 
<br />
p.
<br />
<br />I hope it gives an idea why we can &quot;meta-define&quot; the knower (by linking 
<br />
it to the truth like Theaetetus), and explain why it is equivalent with 
<br />
the sound believer, although neither the believer nor the knower can be 
<br />
aware (believe or know) of that equivalence.
<br />
<br />Cp is just one possible Theaetetical variant of the arithmetisable Bp.
<br />
<br />I sum up and anticipate:
<br />
<br />Bp = the scientist self-referential believer, (3-person)
<br />
Cp = the knower (the unnameable self-referential 1-person)
<br />
Dp = Bp &amp; NOT (B NOT p) = the conjectural believer                  
<br />
(Brian, this one is close to the &quot;observer&quot; I promise to explain)
<br />
Ep =  Bp &amp; NOT (B NOT p) &amp; p = the conjectural knower            (and 
<br />
this one too, it is almost the feeler or smeller ... :)
<br />
<br />We have Bp &lt;-&gt; Cp &lt;-&gt; Dp &lt;-&gt; Ep is true on the machine, but none of 
<br />
those equivalence are either Believable, or knowable, ...
<br />
<br />Now, if you restrict the arithmetical p on those p accessible by the 
<br />
Universal Dovetailer (= COMP!) : you get more:
<br />
<br />you get:     p &lt;-&gt; Bp &lt;-&gt; Cp &lt;-&gt; Dp &lt;-&gt; Ep, but again, by 
<br />
incompleteness,  none of those equivalence are believable or knowable 
<br />
... by the machine.
<br />
<br />Now, with G and G* (*), all those logics split into a communicable and 
<br />
non communicable parts, and I could use them to capture the true 
<br />
sentences concerning the conjectural knower and the conjectural 
<br />
believer on the states accessible by the UD, and following the UDA they 
<br />
should give the logic of *measure one* on the consistent extensions of 
<br />
the machine, as conjecturally believe or known by them, and it is here 
<br />
that I got quantum logics (but that was not the main point here).
<br />
<br />To sum up: Godel's theorems makes it possible to explain why any 
<br />
machine cannot know (1-person) that they are &quot;machine&quot; (obviously 
<br />
3-person describable). Machine can never know they are machine, but can 
<br />
bet on it.
<br />
<br />(*) G is the logic of Bp and NOT (B (NOT p)) as being provable by the 
<br />
machine.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G* is the logic of Bp and NOT (B (NOT p)) as being true about the 
<br />
machine.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the gap between G and G* which makes inescapable all those 
<br />
nuances between provability, knowability, probability 1, etc...
<br />
<br />I recall: Smullyan's FOREVER UNDECIDED = excellent introduction to the 
<br />
logic G (the logic of Bp)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boolos' THE LOGIC OF PROVABILITY = excellent treatise on 
<br />
the logic G and G* (called GL and GLS in that book).
