<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; similar to the entropic arrow of time, we can conceive of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an arrow of morality corresponding to the ratcheting

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; forward of an increasingly broad context of shared values
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (survivors of coevolutionary competition) promoted via
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; awareness of increasingly effective principles of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interaction (scientific knowledge of what works, extracted

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What if the ratcheting forward of shared values is at odds 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with evolutionary expediency, i.e. there is some unethical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; policy that improves the fitness of the species? To avoid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such a dilemna you would have define as ethical everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; improves the fitness of the species, and I'm not sure you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want to do that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; If your species doesn't define as unethical that which is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; contrary to continuation of the species, your species won't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; be around to long.  Our problem is that cultural evolution 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; has been so rapid compared to biological evolution that some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of our hardwired values are not so good for continuation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; our (and many other) species.  I don't think ethics is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; matter of definitions; that's like trying to fly by settling 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; on a definition of &quot;airplane&quot;.  But looking at the long run 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; survival of the species might produce some good ethical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; rules; particularly if we could predict the future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; consequences clearly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If slavery could be scientifically shown to promote the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; well-being of the species as a whole does that mean we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; should have slavery? Does it mean that slavery is good?
</em><br />
<br />Teaching that slavery is &quot;bad&quot; is similar to teaching that lying is
<br />
&quot;bad&quot;.  In each case it's a narrow over-simplification of a more general
<br />
principle of what works. Children are taught simplified modes of moral
<br />
reasoning to match their smaller context of understanding. At one end of
<br />
a moral scale are the moral instincts (experienced as pride, disgust,
<br />
etc.) that are an even more condensed form of &quot;knowledge&quot; of what worked
<br />
in the environment of evolutionary adaptation. Further up the scale are
<br />
cultural--including religious--laws and even the patterns of our
<br />
language that further codify and reinforce patterns of interaction that
<br />
worked well enough and broadly enough to be taken as principles of
<br />
&quot;right&quot; action. 
<br />
<br />Relatively few of us take the leap beyond the morality that was
<br />
inherited or given to us, to grasp the broader and more extensible
<br />
understanding of morality as patterns of behavior assessed as promoting
<br />
increasingly shared values over increasing scope. Society discourages
<br />
individual thinking about what is and what is not moral; indeed, it is a
<br />
defining characteristic that moral principles subsume both narrow self
<br />
interest and narrow situational awareness.  For this reason, one can not
<br />
assess the absolute morality of an action in isolation, but we can
<br />
legitimately speak of the relative morality of a class of behavior
<br />
within context.
<br />
<br />Just as lying can clearly be the right action within a specific context
<br />
(imagine having one's home invaded and being unable, on moral grounds,
<br />
to lie to the invaders about where the children are hiding!), the moral
<br />
issue of slavery can be effectively understood only within a larger
<br />
context. 
<br />
<br />The practice of slavery (within a specific context) can be beneficial to
<br />
society; numerous examples exist of slavery contributing to the economic
<br />
good of a locale, and on a grander scale, the development of western
<br />
philosophy (including democracy!) as a result of freeing some from the
<br />
drudgery of manual labor and creating an environment conducive to deeper
<br />
thought.  And as we seek to elucidate a general principle regarding
<br />
slavery, we come face-to-face with other instances of this class of
<br />
problem, including rights of women to vote, the moral standing of
<br />
sentient beings of various degrees of awareness (farm animals, the great
<br />
apes, artificial intelligences), and even the idea that all &quot;men&quot;, of
<br />
disparate mental or emotional capability, are &quot;created equal&quot;?  Could
<br />
there be a principle constituting a coherent positive-sum stance toward
<br />
issues of moral interaction between agents of inherently different
<br />
awareness and capabilities?
<br />
<br />Are we as a society yet ready to adopt a higher level of social
<br />
decision-making, &quot;moral&quot; to the extent that it effectively promotes
<br />
increasingly shared values over increasing scope, one that provides an
<br />
increasingly clear vision of effective interaction between agents of
<br />
diverse and varying capabilities, or are going to hold tightly to the
<br />
previous best model, one that comfortingly but childishly insists on the
<br />
fiction of some form of strict equality between agents?  Are we mature
<br />
enough to see that just at the point in human progress where
<br />
technological development (biotech, nanotech, AI) threatens to
<br />
drastically disrupt that which we value, we are gaining the necessary
<br />
tools to organize at a higher level--effectively a higher level of
<br />
wisdom?
