The first thing I'd like to add, is that I don't believe we're
<br />
philosophically opposed to each other. There must be some kind of
<br />
misunderstanding on one of our parts - either of what each other is
<br />
saying, or of the problem we're trying to solve. It'd be great for
<br />
someone else with an external perspective to butt in and tell us where
<br />
we might be going wrong.
<br />
<br />1) As you say yourself, a non-wff is just a meaningless string of
<br />
symbols, i.e. one of the bitstrings making up the Schmidhuber
<br />
plenitude. As pointed out, the Schmidhuber plenitude does seem to have
<br />
a natural measure defined on it through K-complexity and Turing
<br />
interpretability. The non-wff strings, as simple the K-incompressible,
<br />
or random ones, however, they are still formal entities, and so
<br />
contribute to the discussion of issues related to measure. I also
<br />
belief that they are interpretable as well, just as Rorschach plots
<br />
are interpretable, even when they have no information content at all.
<br />
The reason that they're interpretable, is that they are close to a wff
<br />
that has information.
<br />
<br />2) There is a curious duality here relating the Tegmark plenitude with
<br />
the Schmidhuber one, that I've not yet figured out. On one hand, all
<br />
consistent mathematical systems are based on a finite set of axioms,
<br />
and a finite set of transition rules for deriving theorems. These can
<br />
be encoded as a bitstring and a UTM, so all members of the Tegmark
<br />
ensemble must be contained within the Schmidhuber one. Contrariwise,
<br />
the UTM structure, interpreting bitstrings is but one such
<br />
self-consitent mathematical structure, so the Schmidhuber ensemble is
<br />
contained with the Tegmark one. So are the two plenitudes equivalent?
<br />
If not, then why not? Is it something to do with noncomputable
<br />
mathematical objects, such as noncomputable real numbers?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ----- Original Message -----
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From: Russell Standish &lt;R.Standish.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I agree, that if you restrict your attention to wffs only, then there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is no problem. It is also no surprise. However, I don't believe one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can solve the White Rabbit problem by defining it away.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is most certainly NOT just being 'defined away'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The whole point is that we are confining ourselves to *logically consistent*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes (and perhaps other entities), that is, universes with some kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical structure. The only assumption in my analysis is that these must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definable with some kind of formal system (I don't even assume that it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be contained within fig 1 of Tegmark's table). A non-wff is just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningless string of symbols - we can't even *consider* any logically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent universe without at least a wff-string. Once we have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wff-string, then we can start to build towards defining logically consistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes (via axiom sets, *consistent* theories, metric spaces (probably),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and so on). It is *then* that the analysis of axioms comes into play (see my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original post), and flying rabbits are banished to a very small minority of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no 'defining away' of the white rabbit problem. It sounds to me as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you are confusing white rabbit universes with logically inconsistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes (the latter should not be able to exist in anyone's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; book). 
</em><br />
<br />I guess this is the contentious point. Dreams appear to be examples of
<br />
logically inconsistent universes. I would explain them in terms of the
<br />
brain's capacity to interpret meaningless data streams generated in
<br />
the brain during sleep. I guess you would need to explain either that
<br />
dreams are in fact logically consistent, or that somehow this example
<br />
doesn't count.
<br />
<br />Perhaps
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if I add some comments to an earlier post of yours, it may help to clarify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the wider issue, but remember that what follows below is mainly based on our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; earlier scheme and not the same as one described at the start of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thread.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't think anyone said they don't exist. Its the measure of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; worlds that contain that is interesting. There are two possibilities:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a) The dragon universe is the outcome of a mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; description. In the sense we use dragon here of being non-lawlike, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; may suppose that they are the outcome of a very complex mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; description. As we well know, the measure of such universes is much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; smaller than the very lawlike universe we inhabit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We don't know this unless we can find a proof. In fact the analysis that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; developed earlier can provide a strong indication of the small measure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dragon universes. (See my web pages.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />This result follows directly from the universal measure or universal
<br />
prior employed in the Schmidhuber plenitude. It may be more
<br />
problematic if your ensemble of mathematical systems is not a proper
<br />
subset of the Schmidhuber plenitude.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; b) The dragon universe corresponds to one of the &quot;nonsense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bitstrings&quot;, which we know to vastly outnumber the lawlike ones. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this case, we must apply the argument I worked out with Alistair
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Malcolm to show that indeed these dragon universes are of small
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; measure compared with lawlike universes, and that the remaining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;nonsense&quot; universes are like noise - unobservable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the bits are interpretable as anything, they would normally be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretable mathematically (or at least as part of some formal system,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; otherwise we would be ranging beyond the formality of information theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself), in which case what they represent will be coherent, but not in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general visible to us (usually because what is represented will be in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another universe) - again the general argument we derived holds as required
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for their small measure. For totally nonsense bitstings, or for any parts of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bitstrings which are non-interpretable - these are ontologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problematical (as are non-wffs); I think that we have to remember that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are just trying to find generic schemes that can subsume all logically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible universes - the particular set of building blocks used to ground
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each scheme ought not to affect the relative measures of various types of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes. 
</em><br />
<br />No problems with the above.
<br />
<br />Neither non-wffs nor non-interpretable bits can represent
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything, and to include them in any analysis is giving them unwarranted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontological credibility. Fortunately neither are required to ascribe low
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure to dragon universes.
</em><br />
<br />However, they exist in the Schmidhuber &quot;all bitstrings&quot; version of the
<br />
plenitude.
