<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, all that I ask is that the *basics* be kept firmly in mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; while we gingerly probe forward.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The basics (basic epistemology, that is) include
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. the map is not the territory, and perception is not reality
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is ambiguous. A trivial example is that for someone who studies 
<br />
*maps*, maps are the territory. Also: &quot;perception of x&quot; is not &quot;reality 
<br />
of x&quot;. But perception itself is more probably real (unless we are all 
<br />
zombies), so perception is a reality (independently of the gap between 
<br />
perceiving and the things at the origin of perception).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. the words we have for things are not the things themselves,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    but only labels
</em><br />
<br /><br />NOT ALWAYS. I agree that *in general* we must not confuse the word and 
<br />
what they are intended for. But here too we can study the words 
<br />
themselves, and, with comp, we can even make some non trivial 
<br />
identification.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. we must *not* use basic language and terminology that conflicts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    with that used by twelve-year olds
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. It is an important point.
<br />
Actually I am willing to believe that we can go much further in that 
<br />
direction.  We should NOT use basic language and terminology that we 
<br />
are unable to translate in a language interpretable by any Lobian 
<br />
Machine.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Russell: For most of us in this list, the 3+1 dimensional spacetime 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we inhabit,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with its stars and galaxies etc is an appearance, phenomena emerging
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; out of constraints imposed by the process of observation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Right there is the problem. Let's focus on what you are *referring*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to in your first sentence: &quot;the 3+1 spacetime with its stars and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; galaxies&quot;.  We must keep clear the difference between what you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *referring* to and our observations of it, or our perceptions of it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They're not at all the same thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So when you use the dread &quot;is&quot; and write &quot;For most of us... the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spacetime *is* an appearance&quot;, we've already gone over the edge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No. The spacetime that you probably meant is *not* an appearance,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and we should not talk about it as if it is an appearance. *It*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is whatever is out there. Yes, our understanding of it may be poor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, it may not be at all as we *think*.  In fact, it cannot in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in any literal sense *be* what we *think*.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Come on. What Russell said was the fact that many in this list could 
<br />
imagine that the very idea of &quot;out there&quot; could be part of the 
<br />
perception, like in a simulation (real, virtual or even just 
<br />
arithmetical but I will not insist too much here).
<br />
<br />Besides, please take comp seriously (if only just for one week), but it 
<br />
makes almost &quot;literally&quot; the sky out there be what we think! Only *we* 
<br />
denotes something much larger than usual. We, the (hopefully) 
<br />
consistent Machine.
<br />
<br />Please correct me, but I have the feeling you take physicalism (the 
<br />
doctrine that physics is necessarily the fundamental science, or that 
<br />
physics cannot be reduced to another body of knowledge) as so obviously 
<br />
true that we should not even *doubt* about it.
<br />
<br />Thanks to your conversation with Stathis, and our last posts, I know 
<br />
you are ready to tackle the fourth step of the Universal Dovetailer 
<br />
Argument (UDA) ...
<br />
<br />My point is that if we take comp seriously enough then it is not a 
<br />
matter of choice: physics has to be reducible to computer science, and 
<br />
this in a verifiable way (already partially verified).
<br />
<br />I think it is up to you to find an error in the argument (of course you 
<br />
can wait someone else find it if you have not the time ;).
<br />
<br />The UDA is not technical, and *is* the proof.
<br />
Only the translation of UDA in the language of a (Lobian) Machine is 
<br />
obviously technical (like assembly language can be). The goal of that 
<br />
translation does not consist in making the UDA more rigorous, but only 
<br />
more constructive (and indeed it gives the shortest path to derive 
<br />
physics from computer science).
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
<br />
<br />PS And all what I say here is compatible with both the ASSA 
<br />
Schmidhuberian view (a-la Hal Finney) and the RSSA view (Levy, 
<br />
Standish, me, ...). Our discussion is internal on how we structure the 
<br />
OMs. I think (well, some like Schmidhuber explicitly invokes some 
<br />
physicalist predicate at some points, and I could argue the very notion 
<br />
of &quot;prior&quot; is basically physicalist, but we have already discussed this 
<br />
...).
