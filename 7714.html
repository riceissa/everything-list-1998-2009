BH: How do you decide whether two logically possible souls are the same if
<br />
neither exists in this world? Presumably you do it by comparing what we
<br />
(hypothetically) know about them -- i.e. their specifications or
<br />
descriptions.
<br />
<br />AP: I take it that we agree that there are facts about the identity or
<br />
non-identity of objects within this world that are independent of how we
<br />
describe the objects. 
<br />
<br />Yes, but only because we can find out more about this world's objects by
<br />
virtue of our causal relatedness to them.
<br />
<br />AP: Our difference is that you think that things are no longer so
<br />
straightforwards if the objects are not worldmates.  I say that not being
<br />
worldmates is no big deal, as long as we are dealing with a Lewisian
<br />
framework where the different worlds all exist concretely. 
<br />
<br />Where I think identity becomes less straightforward is not between entities
<br />
that aren't worldmates with each other, but rather between entities that
<br />
aren't worldmates with us. I don't see (or at least comprehend) here an
<br />
answer to my question above.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I still don't know what work is being done by your use of &quot;concretely&quot; here.
<br />
If you chase the meaning of the word &quot;concrete&quot; through any dictionary, all
<br />
the paths you follow will end up at some notion of at least a potential
<br />
causal relationship with some indexical base object. But if like me you
<br />
define a world as a causal closure, then it's a category mistake to speak of
<br />
a world as &quot;existing&quot; in this conventional sense of &quot;concrete&quot; existence,
<br />
because by definition no other world can have a causal relationship with
<br />
ours or anything in ours.
<br />
<br />AP: Any two deterministic, reversible automata with state space of the same
<br />
cardinality are isomorphic, no? 
<br />
<br />If so, wouldn't that involve an isomorphism whose information content is
<br />
potentially the same size as the state space itself?
<br />
<br />AP: So, are they all one world, or is every different automaton a different
<br />
world, even if isomorphic? 
<br />
<br />I don't assume that there is a fact about whether two merely-isomorphic
<br />
automata are the same world or not. (By &quot;merely isomorphic&quot; I mean they
<br />
don't have the trivial isomorphism of having the same transition rules and a
<br />
shared state somewhere in their state histories.) The point of my example
<br />
was to try to make this assumption unavailable, so that the straightforward
<br />
bitstring encoding of an automaton stands as a first-class instance of a
<br />
world, and cannot be waved away as just one of the many ways that the
<br />
&quot;concrete&quot; world in question can be described.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
My answer to your question would be that every different automaton is a
<br />
different world, except perhaps for the most trivial of isomorphisms. Note
<br />
that for a given purpose, such as in considering the phenomenology
<br />
experienced by the worlds' inhabitants, we might define equivalence classes
<br />
across strictly different automata and consider them the same world. But
<br />
such a perspective wouldn't necessarily be privileged, and wouldn't be the
<br />
right way to think about how many worlds there are of the relevant kinds
<br />
(which is the key to the problem of induction).
<br />
<br />BH:  but if our world turns out to be a simulation, then it's easy to see
<br />
how an information-theoretic perspective could suddenly be recognized to be
<br />
a better one.  
<br />
<br />AP: It depends how the simulation runs.  If the simulation runs inside a
<br />
computer that is itself a physical object, then a physicalistic ontology is
<br />
perfectly fine--it's just that it doesn't apply to the &quot;things&quot; we think it
<br />
applies to. 
<br />
<br />Who can vouch that the simulator is physical and not itself in a simulated
<br />
universe?  Surely not the inhabitants of the simulator's universe.  I repeat
<br />
what I said after the above quote: &quot;For any claim that an actual simulator
<br />
is in operation, then the simulator's world can itself be considered a
<br />
merely-possible simulation. I'm assuming for the moment that 'turtles all
<br />
the way down' is not a sensible claim.&quot;
<br />
<br />AP: And of course if one thinks that consciousness cannot be a simulation,
<br />
one will reject your example. 
<br />
<br />Yes, I noted earlier that my perspective &quot;depends on the thesis that
<br />
physicalism is right and that qualia and consciousness are epiphenomena&quot;.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;BH: My untutored intuition is still that apparently regular worlds should
<br />
predominate over apparently irregular worlds, even if apparently irregular
<br />
worlds predominate over worlds that in fact contain neither apparent nor
<br />
non-apparent irregularities. 
<br />
<br />AP: My intuitions come from analysis rather than information theory. :-)
<br />
Nice numbers (e.g., rationals, algebraics) are generally much fewer
<br />
(meagerness, measure, cardinality) than non-nice numbers (irrationals,
<br />
transcedentals).  Nice functions (e.g., continuous) are much fewer (e.g.,
<br />
cardinality, and in some contexts meagerness, and
<br />
infinite-dimensional-zero-measure, if memory serves me) than non-nice
<br />
functions.  Etc .
<br />
<br />But all that is required to resolve the induction objection is that not-nice
<br />
universes are usually not noticeable as such to their inhabitants. I guess I
<br />
need to learn some more transfinite mathematics before I'll be able to
<br />
understand how (whether?) you're responding to this point that irregularity
<br />
doesn't undermine induction if the irregularity is unnoticed. Let me know if
<br />
you can recommend any introductory texts in this area.
