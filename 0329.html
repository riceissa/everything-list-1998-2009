Hi Jacques,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;After having discussed with Bruno Marchal about our metaphysical ideas, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would like to summarize them and to note their similarities and their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;differences. (Bruno, please correct me if I said something wrong about your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ideas).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Both Bruno and me do not say we know the absolute truth. Bruno considers his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thesis as a logical consequence of the hypothesis of mechanism (even I feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that this hypothesis seems probable to him). I consider my ideas as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;speculations and I think that particularly in such transcentental questions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we cannot be sure to know the truth.
</em><br />
<br />I do think mechanism is plausible. I do also think that mechanism could 
<br />
be refuted.
<br />
(And I certainly think mechanism is fascinating ...).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno and me believe that there might be an infinity of description levels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or approximative theories of the world, ...
</em><br />
<br />OK. At least in a very large sense of &quot;world&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... but according to Bruno's hypothesis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of mechanism, there exist one level L at a finite depth which describes us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;completely,...
</em><br />
<br />&quot;completely&quot; not in the logical sense, but in a &quot;Shannon&quot; or 
<br />
code-theoretical sense, like a Xerox machine don't need an understanding 
<br />
of the bible to make a copy of it. 
<br />
I don't need a complete theory of &quot;me&quot;. I doubt there is any ... (with 
<br />
mechanism there are provably no such complete theory of &quot;me&quot; or &quot;you&quot;, or 
<br />
any universal computing machine).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;and according to my conception of the spirit, there is no such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;level.
</em><br />
<br />Don't forget that I showed (or at least intended to show) that if there 
<br />
is a level at which I can be duplicated, I can never prove or communicate 
<br />
correctly that I know that level. So with mechanism there is no (in any 
<br />
provable way) such level (although it exists, by definition with Mech in 
<br />
a highly non constructive sense of &quot;exist&quot;).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;See <a href="http://www.website2u.com/log/text/reflmph/english/naturesp.htm">http://www.website2u.com/log/text/reflmph/english/naturesp.htm</a> :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;whatever is the degree of precision reached by a theory, there would always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;remain a part of unknown, of undetermination, which would let a place for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;spirit&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand the link between indetermination and spirit. And also, 
<br />
if there is such a level, there will be, from the point of view of the 
<br />
observer, necessary indetermination too, for, if the observer is a 
<br />
machine, it will necessarily ignore which machine it is.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;According to Bruno, at this level L, our choices are determinated by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;laws of physics, but at this level, we do not exist : in fact I do not chose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but the laws of physics chose what my body does.
</em><br />
<br />I think that here you confuse context of the discussion. Remember that 
<br />
with mechanism, if I am correct, it is (our belief in) the law of physics 
<br />
which are supernening on the possible computationnal histories ...
<br />
But, there, we were discussing free will, and what I was saying, is that, 
<br />
at the local &quot;physical&quot; level (let us say), we are indeed &quot;obeying 
<br />
physical law&quot;, but we are not living at that level : just remember the 
<br />
poorness of the lawyer argument : &quot;my client is not guilty, he was just 
<br />
following the law of physics&quot;.
<br />
I don't think the free will question is related to the 
<br />
indeterminisme/determinisme problem. I guess free-will is related with a 
<br />
kind of self-perception of our relative ignorance, and with the question 
<br />
of making decision with incomplete information, + the personnal taste, 
<br />
history, etc. I guess it is also linked whit the recognition of our high 
<br />
&quot;degree of freedom&quot;.
<br />
With Mech there is also (of course) a level -the arithmetical level- 
<br />
where there is no free-will, but we are not living at that level.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here I have some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difficulties to accept the idea of Bruno which considers that we are free
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because we cannot know which machine we are. Is it a real freedom or an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;illusion of freedom ?
</em><br />
<br />It is real freedom because we are necessarily ignorant of which machine 
<br />
we are and we will be. It is even a constructive ignorance in the sense 
<br />
that if you pretend I am such or such machine, I can (at least in 
<br />
principle) contradict your statement.
<br />
<br />But sometimes, by introspection, I doubt I have free-will, or I doubt 
<br />
there is a genuine meaning for the word. Indeed, I never succeed doing 
<br />
something really for free. There is always a web of (conscious or less 
<br />
conscious) reason to act as we do. 
<br />
In Mind's I (edited bay Hofstdtate &amp; Dennett) there are very interesting 
<br />
paradoxical stuff on free will by Smullyan).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;According to my conception of spirit, at any level our choices are not fully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;determinated by the approximative laws corresponding to this level, so we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist, but the more the level is deep, the more we &quot;become small&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />So what ? If at any level we are not determined, then the only thing you 
<br />
will get is a kind of pure and objective randomness. But I think there is 
<br />
less room for free-will with randomness than with anything else. A random 
<br />
choice is not at all a free choice.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno says that if we look at a level deeper than L, we see a fuzzy reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(like in quantum physics, but it seems to me that it's fuzzy until we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observe it : when we make a measurement, we get a determinate value) : our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness supervenes on several parts of the Universal Doveteller (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;program which runs all programs) which are so near that we don't perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any difference. But if we look under the level L, there are some differences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between these parts of the U.D. Bruno compares this with lucid dreaming.
</em><br />
<br />Indeed. This is also nicely illustrated by the science-fiction novel by 
<br />
Galouye : SIMULACRON 3, where the hero begin do detect the virtual nature 
<br />
of his environment by looking at curious feature of his neighborhood.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This made Bruno say that paradoxically my conception is more determinist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than his conception, because in my conception we cannot find such a level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;below L in which the reality is not determinated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;According to Bruno, the world is less determinated than the spirit.
</em><br />
<br />If we interpret the word &quot;world&quot; as a relative machine dream (or 
<br />
history), and if we interpret spirit by arithmetical truth : then I agree 
<br />
with you.
<br />
I am not sure you are willing to accept these interpretations. Please 
<br />
tell me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;According to me, the spirit dives down to the deepest levels of the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and therefore has an absolute existence.
</em><br />
<br />I should (re)read your web pages. I am not quite sure what you mean here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;A problem raised by Bruno's idea according to which our consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;supervenes on an infinity of parts of the U.D. is to explain why the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seems coherent. Why for example the table in front of me does not fly in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;air in most of the parts of the U.D. on which my consciousness supervenes ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I suggested to Bruno that in these worlds, other strange things will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probably happen, for example my brain will explode, and I will not be able
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to perceive anything in these worlds. Bruno has another interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explanation : he thinks that the coherent worlds are infinitely more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;numerous because there is a continuous infinity of such worlds (Aleph 1) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there are only an enumerable infinity (Aleph 0) of incoherent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(&quot;pathological&quot;) worlds.
</em><br />
<br />I hope so. But this remains to be proved, ... or disproved. In which case 
<br />
Mechanism will be refuted.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Bruno.
