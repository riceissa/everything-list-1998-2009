<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I consider a goal reasonable only if it is not too different from my own

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; goals.  It is only this type of goal that I am interested in.
</em><br />
<br />That's fine, but when most people say &quot;reasonable&quot; the *reason* is not
<br />
just similarity to one's own beliefs.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Second, there is no way of knowing whether you are in a so called &quot;real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world&quot; or in a &quot;virtual world&quot;.  So if I don't care about &quot;virtual&quot; people, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't even know whether or not I care about myself.  That doesn't seem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasonable to me.
</em><br />
<br />That's right, you don't know which world you are in. The proposal I made
<br />
was to consider your actions to affect all worlds that you can be in. But
<br />
you may not care about some of those worlds, in which case you just don't
<br />
take the effects of your actions on them into account when making your
<br />
decisions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;Evolution&quot; is just the process that leads to the measure distribution.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Conversely, those who don't believe in an absolute measure distribution 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have no reason to expect Darwin to appear in their world to have been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct.)
</em><br />
<br />I do believe in an absolute measure distribution, but my point is that
<br />
evolution probably does not favor those whose utility function are
<br />
just functions on the measure distribution.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Also, I disagree that caring about others (regardless of who they are) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not likely to be &quot;popular&quot;.  In my speculation, it's likely to occur in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligent species that divide into groups, and then merge back into one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; group peacefully.
</em><br />
<br />Soon we may have AIs or uploaded human minds (i.e. human minds scanned and
<br />
then simulated in computers). It seems to me that those who don't care
<br />
about simulated thoughts would have an advantage in exploiting these
<br />
beings more effectively. I'm not saying that is a good thing, of course.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Anthropic reasoning can't exist apart from a decision theory, otherwise 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;there is no constraint on what reasoning process you can use. You might as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;well believe anything if it has no effect on your actions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I find that a very strange statement, especially coming from you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     First, I (and other people) value knowledge as an end in itself.  Even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if I were unable to take other actions, I would seek knowledge.  (You might 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argue that it's still an action, but clearly it's the *outcome* of this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; action that anthropic reasoning will affect, not the decision to take the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; action.)
</em><br />
<br />I also value knowledge as an end in itself, but the problems is how do you
<br />
know what is true knowledge? If you don't judge knowledge by how effective
<br />
it is in directing your actions, what do you judge it by, and how do you
<br />
defend those criteria against others who would use different criteria?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Further, I do not believe that even in practice my motivation for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; studying the AUH (or much science) is really so as to make decisions about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what actions to take; it is pretty much just out of curiousity.  One so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; motivated could well say &quot;you might as well do anything, if it has no effect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on your knowledge&quot;.  (But you can't believe just anything, since you want to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; avoid errors in your knowledge.)
</em><br />
<br />Even if you study science only out of curiousity, you can still choose
<br />
what to believe based on how theoretically effective it would be in making
<br />
decisions. But again if you have a better idea I'd certainly be interested
<br />
in hearing it. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Secondly, it well known that you believe a static string of bits could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be conscious.  Such a hypothetical observer would, by definition, be unable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to take any actions.  (Including thinking, but he would &quot;have one thought 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stuck in his head&quot;.)
</em><br />
<br />I'm not confident enough to say that I *believe* a static string of bits
<br />
could be conscious, but that is still my position until a better idea
<br />
comes along. I'd say that consciousness and decision making may not have
<br />
anything to do with each other, and that consciousness is essentially
<br />
passive in nature. A non-conscious being can use my proposed decision
<br />
procedure just as well as a conscious being. 
<br />
<br />To be completely consistent with what I wrote above, I have to say that if
<br />
a theory of consciousness does not play a role in decision theory (as my
<br />
proposal does not), accepting it is really an arbitrary choice. I guess
<br />
the only reason to do so is for the psychological comfort.
