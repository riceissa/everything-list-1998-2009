<br />BM:  OK. I would insist that the &quot;comp project&quot; (extract physics from comp)
<br />
is really just a comp obligation. This is what is supposed to be shown
<br />
by the UDA (+ MOVIE-GRAPH). Are you OK with this. It *is*
<br />
counterintuitive.
<br />
<br />DN:  I believe so - it's what the reductio ad absurdum of the 'physical'
<br />
computation in the 'grandma' post was meant to show.  My version of the
<br />
'comp obligation' would then run as follows.  Essentially, if comp and
<br />
number relations are held to be 'real in the sense that I am real', then to
<br />
use Plato's metaphor, it is numbers that represent the forms outside the
<br />
cave.  If that's so, then physics is represented by the shadows the
<br />
observers see on the wall of the cave.  This is what I mean by 'independent'
<br />
existence in my current dialogue with Torgny: i.e the 'arithmetical realism'
<br />
of numbers and their relations in the comp frame equates to their
<br />
'independence' or self-relativity.  And the existence of 'arithmetical
<br />
observers' then derives from subsequent processes of 'individuation'
<br />
intrinsic to such fundamental self-relation.  Actually, I find the equation
<br />
of existence with self-relativity highly intuitive.
<br />
<br />BM:  Then, the interview of the universal machine is &quot;just&quot; a way to do the
<br />
extraction of physics in a constructive way. It is really the
<br />
subtleties of the incompleteness phenomena which makes this interview
<br />
highly non trivial.
<br />
<br />DN:  This is the technical part.  But at this stage grandma has some feeling
<br />
for how both classical and QM narratives should be what we expect to emerge
<br />
from constructing physics in this way.
<br />
<br />BM:  There is no direct (still less one-one) correlation between the mental
<br />
and the physical,
<br />
that is the physical supervenience thesis is incompatible with the comp hyp.
<br />
[A quale of a pain] felt at time t in place x, is not a product of the
<br />
physical activity of a machine, at time t in place x. Rather, it is the
<br />
whole quale of [a pain felt at time t in place x] which is associated
<br />
with an (immaterial and necessarily unknown) computational state, itself
<br />
related to its normal consistent computational continuations.
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<br />Comp makes the &quot;yes doctor&quot; a gamble, necessarily. That is: assuming the
<br />
&quot;theory comp&quot; you have to understand that, by saying yes to the doctor, you
<br />
are gambling on a level of substitution. At the same time you make a
<br />
&quot;gamble&quot; on the theory comp itself. There is double gamble here. Now, the
<br />
first gamble, IF DONE AT THE RIGHT COMP SUBSTITUTION LEVEL, is
<br />
comp-equivalent with the natural gamble everybody do when going to sleep, or
<br />
just when waiting a nanosecond. In some sense &quot;nature&quot; do that gamble in our
<br />
place all the time ... But this is somethjng we cannot know, still less
<br />
assert in any scientific way, and that is why I insist so much on the
<br />
&quot;theological&quot; aspect of comp. This is important in practice. It really
<br />
justify that the truth of the &quot;yes doctor&quot; entails the absolute fundamental
<br />
right to say NO to the doctor. The doctor has to admit he is gambling on a
<br />
substitution level. If comp is
<br />
true we cannot be sure on the choice of the subst. level.
<br />
<br />DN:  ISTM that a consequence of the above is that the issue of 'substitution
<br />
level' can in principle be 'gambled' on by cloning, or by evolution (because
<br />
presumably it has been, even though we can't say how).  But by engineering
<br />
or design???  Would there ever be any justification, in your view, for
<br />
taking a gamble on being uploaded to an AI program - and if so, on the basis
<br />
of what theory?  Essentially, this is what I've been trying to get at.  That
<br />
is: assuming comp, HOW would we go about making a 'sound bet', founded on a
<br />
specific AI theory, that some AI program instantiated by a 'physical'
<br />
computer, will equate to the continuity of our own observation?
<br />
<br />The second question I have is summarised in my recent posts about 'sense and
<br />
'action'.  Essentially, I've been trying to postulate that the correlation
<br />
of consciousness and physics is such that the relations between both sets of
<br />
phenomena are a necessary entailment, not an additional assumption.  ISTM
<br />
that this is essential to avoid all the nonsense about zombies.  And not
<br />
only this, but to show that the reciprocity between experience - e.g.
<br />
suffering  - and behaviour (indeed the whole entailment of 'intentionality')
<br />
is a necessary consequence of fundamental self-relation (arithmetical
<br />
relations, in the comp frame).  Now, my attempt to do this has been to
<br />
postulate that 'sense' and 'action' are simply observer-related aspects of a
<br />
non-decomposable fundamental self-relation, which in the comp frame would
<br />
equate to a set of number-relations.  But ISTM that for this to be true, the
<br />
observer and physical narratives would somehow need to follow an 'identical'
<br />
or isomorphic trajectory for their invariant relation to emerge in the way
<br />
that it seems to.  Do you think that this idea has any specific sense or
<br />
relevance in the comp frame?
<br />
<br />BM:  Does this help? I assert some propositions without justifying them,
<br />
because the justification are both already on the list, or in my
<br />
papers. But, please, don't hesitate to ask for more if interested. From
<br />
what I understand about your intuition, you are quite close to the
<br />
&quot;natural first person discourse&quot; of the lobian machine. And the closer
<br />
you are, the more severe my comments will be on the details, so please
<br />
indulge my critical way of talking ...
<br />
<br />Yes, absolutely!  I feel I'm making progress in resolving some of the
<br />
ambiguity in my understanding, so be as severe as necessary, cher maitre.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As far as I understand, this is *the* problem. It seems insoluble

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of what emerges from interviewing (computationally) sound machines

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In other words, the maximal description of their mental and physical

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; worlds that is possible under such constraints.  What would still be

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be correlated with a physical description of the machine itself: i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the perennial 'mind-body problem'.  But do you believe that there can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be a way of closing this question theoretically? Is comp agnostic to

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this correlation being 'functional' or 'physical'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that the interview provides the best we can hope concerning the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind-body problem in the comp frame. This could still currently lead to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a refutation of comp in case empirical facts contradicts the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp-physics (the physics extracted from comp). There is no direct

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; picks your theory and you takes your choice&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
