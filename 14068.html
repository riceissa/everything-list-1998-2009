<em class="quotelev1">&gt;few decades old, rather than thousands of years old at the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ever-thinning tail end of the curve. But this is still consistent with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the expectation of an infinite subjective lifespan as per QI.
</em><br />
<br />Well, this view would imply that although I am likely to reach reasonable 
<br />
conclusions about measure if I assume my current OM is &quot;typical&quot;, I am 
<br />
inevitably going to find myself in lower and lower measure OMs in the 
<br />
future, where the assumption that the current one is typical will lead to 
<br />
more and more erroneous conclusions. I guess if you believe there is no real 
<br />
temporal relation between OMs, that any sense of an observer who is 
<br />
successively experiencing a series of different OMs is an illusion and that 
<br />
the only real connection between OMs is that memories one has may resemble 
<br />
the current experiences of another, then there isn't really a problem with 
<br />
this perspective (after all, I have no problem with the idea that the 
<br />
ordinary Doomsday Argument applied to civilizations implies that eventually 
<br />
the last remaining humans will have a position unusually close to the end, 
<br />
and they'll all reach erroneous conclusions if they attempt to apply the 
<br />
Doomsday Argument to their own birth order...the reason I have no problem 
<br />
with this is that I don't expect to inevitably 'become' them, they are 
<br />
separate individuals who happen to have an unusual place in the order of all 
<br />
human births). But I've always favored the idea that a theory of 
<br />
consciousness would determine some more &quot;objective&quot; notion of temporal flow 
<br />
than just qualitative similarities in memories, that if my current OM is X 
<br />
then there would be some definite ratio between the probability that my next 
<br />
OM would be Y vs. Z. This leads me to the analogy of pools of water with 
<br />
water flowing between them that I discussed in this post:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/msg/07cd5c7676f6f6a1">http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/msg/07cd5c7676f6f6a1</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consider the following analogy--we have a bunch of tanks of water, and each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tank is constantly pumping a certain amount of its own water to a bunch of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other tanks, and having water pumped into it from other tanks. The ratio 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between the rates that a given tank is pumping water into two other tanks 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;corresponds to the ratio between the probabilities that a given 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moment will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;succeeded by one of two other possible OMs--if you imagine individual water
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;molecules as observers, then the ratio between rates water is going to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;two tanks will be the same as the ratio between the probabilities that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;given molecule in the current tank will subsequently find itself in one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;those two tanks. Meanwhile, the total amount of water in a tank would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;correspond to the absolute probability of a given OM--at any given time, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you randomly select a single water molecule from the collection of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;molecules in all tanks, the amount of water in a tank is proportional to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability your randomly-selected molecule will be in that tank.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, for most ways of arranging this system, the total amount of water in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different tanks will be changing over time. In terms of the analogy, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be like imposing some sort of universal time-coordinate on the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multiverse and saying the absolute probability of finding yourself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiencing a given OM changes with time, which seems pretty implausible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to me. But if the system is balanced in such a way that, for each tank, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;total rate that water is being pumped out is equal to the total rate that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;water is being pumped in, then the system as a whole will be in a kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equilibrium, with no variation in the amount of water in any tank over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time. So in terms of OMs, this suggests a constraint on the relationship 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between the absolute probabilities and the conditional probabilities, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this constraint (together with some constraints imposed by a 'theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness' of some kind) might actually help us find a unique
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-consistent way to assign both sets of probabilities, an idea I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;elaborated on in the &quot;Request for a glossary of acronyms&quot; thread.
</em><br />
<br />(also see the followup post at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/38g8yt">http://tinyurl.com/38g8yt</a> ...and to see the 
<br />
context of the whole thread go to <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2wsowb">http://tinyurl.com/2wsowb</a> , and for the 
<br />
'Request for a glossary of acronyms' thread which I mentioned at the end of 
<br />
the quote go to <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2wah5v">http://tinyurl.com/2wah5v</a> )
<br />
<br />So, the requirement that the system be in &quot;equilibrium&quot;, with the total 
<br />
amount of water in each tanks not changing over time, means that if you 
<br />
randomly select one of all the water molecules in the system &quot;now&quot;, the 
<br />
probability it will be in any one of the various tanks (corresponding to 
<br />
different OMs with a measure assigned) will be the same as if you randomly 
<br />
select one of the water molecules, then wait a while so that molecule has 
<br />
time to travel through a number of successive tanks, and want to know what 
<br />
the probability is that it will be in the given tank &quot;then&quot;. This means that 
<br />
at any moment in a water molecule's history, it will always be likely to 
<br />
reach good conclusions if it considers itself to be randomly selected from 
<br />
the set of all tanks weighted by their &quot;absolute probability&quot; (corresponding 
<br />
to the absolute measure on each OM), you don't have a situation where 
<br />
there's a special moment where they'll be correct if they reason this way 
<br />
but their conclusions will grow more and more erroneous if they do so at 
<br />
later points in their history, or a situation where there is some global 
<br />
notion of &quot;time&quot; and the absolute probability associated with each tank is 
<br />
changing over time.
