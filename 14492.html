<br />
Russell,
<br />
<br />Thanks for your answers.  I think my description and understanding of
<br />
the Doomsday argument was overly simplified, but there is a very
<br />
similar anthropic reasoning problem I heard before.  The situation is
<br />
something like this:
<br />
<br />There are 5,000 females and 5 males that are created as part of some
<br />
experiment.  They are the only humans that exist at the time.  200
<br />
years later after all the humans in the study have died the alien
<br />
experimenter creates 5 females and 5,000 males.  Now if you are in
<br />
this experiment and find yourself to be male, you could reasonably
<br />
guess that you are part of the second batch of humans, since 99.9% of
<br />
males in the experiments belong to the second batch.
<br />
<br />The original 5 males short of being given extra information will also
<br />
conclude they are part of the second group.  What would they conclude,
<br />
however, if they were told they are part of the first batch?
<br />
Personally I would conclude, &quot;Well it had to be someone, there was
<br />
after all, an original group.  I just happen to be one of those few
<br />
rare ones.&quot;  ASSA looks for explanations elsewhere, such as concluding
<br />
that perhaps the aliens likely never go through with the second half
<br />
of the experiment in the future, or maybe the aliens mess up the
<br />
creation of the humans and create non-conscious zombie males.  The
<br />
danger I see in using SSAs to determine what animals can be conscious
<br />
is that inevitably there are human generated OMs, regardless of there
<br />
being ant OMs or not.  We may be extremely rare in the set of all OMs,
<br />
but I don't see the probability that my OM is experienced as some
<br />
value between 0 and 1, I see it as 1.  This I think is the root of the
<br />
difference in conclusions between you and I.
<br />
<br />Regarding the mirror test, I see two problems with it.  The first is
<br />
that there is some bias to it, it is biased towards animals that are
<br />
visually orientated.  Dogs for example, do not pass.  However can a
<br />
dog recognize its own scent?  I believe they can, they can follow
<br />
their own tracks.  If Dogs ruled the world and subjected humans to a
<br />
self-smell test would humans be capable of passing?  Would it be valid
<br />
for the dogs to conclude humans weren't conscious because they
<br />
couldn't identify themselves by their scent?
<br />
<br />My second objection is that I don't think self-awareness is a
<br />
necessary requirement for consciousness.  I equate awareness with
<br />
consciousness.  One could be aware of many things without being aware
<br />
of the self.  The phenomenon of &quot;ego death&quot; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death</a>
<br />
is a case when humans can lose the sense of self, yet they don't lose
<br />
consciousness in the process.  I think there is some process in the
<br />
brain that generates the sensation of the self being a distinct actor
<br />
within an environment but I think this is just a tool that evolution
<br />
developed.
<br />
<br />My view on consciousness is similar to Chalmer's, in that perhaps all
<br />
informational processes might be conscious in some manner:
<br />
<a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/254?in=00:22:04&amp;out=00:30:01">http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/254?in=00:22:04&amp;out=00:30:01</a>
<br />
Chalmers also mentions the more conservative view that only certain
<br />
types of informational processes are conscious.  Perhaps some type of
<br />
self-reference is required, but I am not yet convinced.  I have Godel,
<br />
Escher, Bach on my reading queue and may change my opinion after
<br />
reading it, as my understanding of it is that it says consciousness is
<br />
the result of &quot;strange loops&quot;.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Hello Russell,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Congratulations on your latest publication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Today on my way home I begin to question whether or not I still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; believe self-sampling assumptions are valid tools for drawing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conclusions.  I decided that though self-sampling assumptions may lead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to conclusions that are true for the greatest number of observers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; correct conclusions are entirely coincidental.  In the same way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; correlation is no indication of causation, likelihood of truth for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; majority of observers is not caused by something being true for one's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; self.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; By definition every OM with a non-zero measure has a 100% guaranteed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; chance of being experienced, even if its measure is 10^(-20) that of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; another more prolific OM.  The only thing that can be reasoned from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; current experience is that one's current OM has a non-zero measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Attempting to use properties of one's vantage point to draw
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conclusions about other OMs can be disastrously wrong, for example
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; take the Doomsday Argument:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The doomsday argument allows the largest number of observers to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; correctly predict the doom of their civilization, but it achieves this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; by having every observer who has ever lived believe that doom is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; around the corner.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not true. See the appendix &quot;How soon until doom&quot; in my book
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theory of Nothing. For most of humanity's history, doom is a long way off.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If a nuclear holocaust occurs tomorrow, the 6.66
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; billion alive today would have been correct, but the people alive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; today represent just 10% of the total number of humans who have ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; lived, leading 90% to be wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The DA just predicts that population will drop in the near future -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps catastrophically, but more gentle drops are also compatible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The main objection I have to anthropic reasoning in this case, is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it leads to the conclusion that life forms which are reactive to their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; environments and capable of thought / decision making are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; philosophical zombies.  Though it is easier to imagine that ants are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not conscious, what about other animals far more numerous than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; humans?  Are chickens, mice, and sheep zombies?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think these animals are that much more  numerous than humans,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it is also true that it is far from clear these animals are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious either. None of the species you mention pass the mirror test
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of self-awareness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I also do not see how the leap from &quot;Russell Standish&quot; is conscious,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to &quot;All other humans are conscious&quot; can be made yet stop short of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;Bonobos are conscious&quot;, &quot;Chimps are conscious&quot;, and perhaps even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't. I rather suspect these animals are conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; lemurs and squirrels are conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These ones possibly aren't. There is a test called the Gallup mirror
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; test, which is strongly indicative of self-awareness. Most apes pass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this test, bottlenose dolphins and also elephants have found to pass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the test. Virtually no other species does, although it wouldn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suprise me if some other species were found to pass it. It may also be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that certain species will pass a suitably modified version of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; test, that do not pass the current version of it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How does the ability to produce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; viable offspring with another relate to whether or not that other can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be conscious?  Drawing the line between species seems arbitrary to me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; especially considering how small of steps evolution takes.  If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conclude other humans are conscious because we have similar brains,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could you not likewise conclude all mammals are conscious because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mammals too have similar brains and share a common ancestor?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Human brains are far more similar to each other than to other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mammalian brains. In the absence of an adequate theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, we can't really draw the line anywhere, however there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bound to be some species that are conscious, and others that aren't,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just as there are some species pass the mirror self-awareness test and others
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that don't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Where in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the evolutionary tree did the first human ancestor's consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; appear?  The term consciousness was not clearly defined in your paper,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; do you consider it to be a binary property, or something that can have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; varying levels of sophistication?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is defined operationally as being a member of the reference class
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used in anthropic reasoning. It is therefore a binary property (you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are either in the reference class, or you aren't).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consciousness is sometimes used to refer to something that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; graduated: ie the term &quot;level of consciousness&quot; used in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anaethsiology. This is not how I would use the term, and would prefer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to use &quot;awareness&quot; or &quot;alertness&quot; to describe the differing states
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before and after having a strong cup of coffee (for instance).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I look forward to your response,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
