Nick Boström have been trying to calculate the probability that
<br />
we live in a computer simulation. His answer to how you go about
<br />
this (below) if we live in an infinite universe with infinite simulations
<br />
seems to fit how one could do probabilities in a multiverse with an
<br />
infinite number of universes as well.
<br />
<br />Lennart Nilsson
<br />
<br /><br />&quot;To deal with these infinite cases, we need to do something like thinking in
<br />
terms of densities rather than total populations. A suitable density-measure
<br />
can be finite even if the total population is infinite. It is important to
<br />
note that we to use some kind of density-measure of observation types quite
<br />
independently of the simulation argument. In a &#x201c;Big World&#x201d; cosmology, all
<br />
possible human observations are in fact made by somebody somewhere. (Our
<br />
world is may well be a big world, so this is not a farfetched possibility.).
<br />
To be able to derive any observational consequences from our scientific
<br />
theories in a Big World, we need to be able to say that certain types of
<br />
observations are more typical than others. (See my paper &#x201c;Self-Locating
<br />
Belief in Big Worlds&#x201d; for more details on this.)
<br />
<br />The most straightforward way of making this notion precise in an infinite
<br />
universe is via the idea of limit density. Start by picking an arbitrary
<br />
spacetime point. Then consider a hypersphere centered on that point with
<br />
radius R. Let f(A) be the fraction of all observations that are of kind A
<br />
that takes place within this hypersphere. Then expand the sphere. Let the
<br />
typicality of type-A observations be the limit of f(A) as R---&gt;infinity.&quot;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The other mechanism is quantum randomness, for example in the case of

<br />The mathematical basis for deterministic quantum mechanics
<br />
Authors: Gerard 't Hooft
<br />
Comments: 15 pages, 3 figures

Report-no: ITP-UU-06/14, SPIN-06/12
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there exists a classical, i.e. deterministic theory underlying
<br />
quantum 
<br />
mechanics, an explanation must be found of the fact that the Hamiltonian,
<br />
which 
<br />
is defined to be the operator that generates evolution in time, is bounded
<br />
from 
<br />
below. The mechanism that can produce exactly such a constraint is
<br />
identified in 
<br />
this paper. It is the fact that not all classical data are registered in the
<br />
<br />quantum description. Large sets of values of these data are assumed to be 
<br />
indistinguishable, forming equivalence classes. It is argued that this
<br />
should be 
<br />
attributed to information loss, such as what one might suspect to happen
<br />
during 
<br />
the formation and annihilation of virtual black holes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the equivalence classes is further elucidated, as it
<br />
follows 
<br />
from the positivity of the Hamiltonian. Our world is assumed to consist of a
<br />
<br />very large number of subsystems that may be regarded as approximately 
<br />
independent, or weakly interacting with one another. As long as two (or
<br />
more) 
<br />
sectors of our world are treated as being independent, they all must be
<br />
demanded 
<br />
to be restricted to positive energy states only. What follows from these 
<br />
considerations is a unique definition of energy in the quantum system in
<br />
terms 
<br />
of the periodicity of the limit cycles of the deterministic model.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In a no-collapse/ many worlds interpretation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is no true randomness because all outcomes occur deterministically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; according to the SWE. However, there is apparent randomness due to what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno calls the first person indeterminacy: the observer does not know
</em><br />
which 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world he will end up in from a first person viewpoint, even though he
</em><br />
knows 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that from a third person viewpoint he will end up in all of them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find the randomness resulting from first person indeterminacy in the MWI
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficult to get my mind around. In the case of the chaotic coin toss one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can imagine God being able to do the calculations and predict the outcome,
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but even God would not be able to tell me which world I will find myself
</em><br />
in 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when a quantum event induces splitting. And yet, I am stuck thinking of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum events in the MWI as fundamentally non-random.
</em><br />
<br />It's also unclear as to what &quot;probability&quot; means in the MWI.  Omnes' points
<br />
out 
<br />
that &quot;probability&quot; means some things happen and some don't.
