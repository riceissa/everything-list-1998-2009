Dear Kim,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Here I am putting on the hat of the sensei)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope you are wrong on this. Usually I hope you are right on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything, because you usually have the &quot;ring of truth&quot; about you.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here, unfortunately I feel in my adenoids you have the &quot;ring of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fear&quot; (like dear Johnny Mikes) - but I could be wrong. Why would  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teaching the joy, the love, the fascination of something make that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing less than what it is?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Be sure that I may be wrong indeed. Be sure it is possible that we are  
<br />
not talking about the same things. And be sure conversations are  
<br />
interesting only as far as it it is between people disagreeing :)
<br />
<br />But here is what I think.
<br />
<br />I can teach math, but I can't teach the joy of math. I can just let it  
<br />
happen and encourage it. I can teach math, but I cannot teach the  
<br />
fascination of math. I can share it with those who are sensible to  
<br />
similar questions.
<br />
<br />I cannot teach beauty, nor truth, nor imagination. Only by example,  
<br />
letting myself attract to truth, beauty, and making free my imagination.
<br />
<br />I can't teach courage either. Some can show it and provide lessons,  
<br />
again by exemples, but those who don't fear, will learn nothing. That  
<br />
is why bibles, movies and dreams can teach a lot, but much less than  
<br />
&quot;real&quot; life.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Teaching creativity leads straight to hell if you are Hitler, or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mengele or Madoff or Bush or Aristotle or ....... (sorry - not in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Alpha order)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hitler has not been creative. He was just not enough dumb  to kill all  
<br />
creativity in his neighborhood.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the VALUES of the creativity teacher are fine, then the outcome  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will merely depend on the VALUES of the STUDENTS. That probably  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depends on their parents, their socio-economic background, their  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; religion, their life-story their drug-use, their whatever.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />OK, I think that creativity is a value by itself, akin to  
<br />
intelligence, and love. You seem talking about some competence. This  
<br />
you can teach, but usually it has a negative feedback on intelligence  
<br />
and creativity.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some people may be better at creativity (lateral thinking) just as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some people may be better at mathematics
</em><br />
<br /><br />For most mathematicians, to be good at mathematics *is* to be creative  
<br />
in mathematics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but this does not mean that there is a process that cannot be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learned and used. As I said, Edward de Bono ALONE AMONGST ALL HUMANS  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worked out for himself (by '68) what creativity IS.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Edward de Bono is creative himself, and quite generous in his  
<br />
interesting ideas. I have used some of them when working in artificial  
<br />
intelligence, like I have used some inspiring abstract problem solving  
<br />
tips by Polya. But I would not count that as a teaching of creativity,  
<br />
more as a collection of creative ideas, including ideas pertaining on  
<br />
creativity. it is an interesting subject. But like many things in  
<br />
psychology, we can study those ideas, not use them normatively; and  
<br />
thus we cannot teach them as such.
<br />
We can give tips and clues.
<br />
<br />Perhaps I have a problem just with the expression &quot;teaching  
<br />
creativity&quot;. It seems to me this is a contradiction per se. To be  
<br />
creative is somehow to be able to make something new, and thus which  
<br />
escape the teaching. I think we all have this ability in us, but for  
<br />
social and life pressure we are not encourage to do so, except in  
<br />
singular situation.
<br />
<br />To sum up, my &quot;fear&quot; is that by teaching lateral thinking, you, and  
<br />
your students, will end up making it vertical.
<br />
<br />(I think creativity is something obeying the laws of the contrary  
<br />
effect: Bp -&gt; ~p. Like consistency for Lobian Machine.)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some people have 'the gift' of creativity to be sure - but  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creativity itself is NOT a gift. Gift from whom? From what? Come on   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - get real!!!!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lateral Thinking (=creativity) and vertical thinking are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMPLIMENTARY - not antagonistic.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />All universal machine are creative, and thinking exists for all  
<br />
angles, in many multidimensional directions.
<br />
<br />In mathematics alone many would agree that recursion and set theory  
<br />
are vertical, algebra and category theory are horizontal.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It can be shown that creativity can make people generate more ideas,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and by definition gifts cannot be taught.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />The gift is the neighborhood which let you develop the creativity.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my book, NOTHING is 'a gift' because I can never be sure what or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who is doing the giving (thank you for this enlightenment Dawkins,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dennet, Hitchens, Harris, de Monfroy, Vic Stenger et al).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Those damned Aristotelian theologians who are not even aware they are  
<br />
so!
<br />
<br />(Assuming comp I could argue that it is arithmetical truth which is  
<br />
doing the giving).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My only 'gifts' came from the genes of my parents - things I did not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to 'learn' - like musical ability (Fuck, how I wish I had  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum physicists for parents!!!!!!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is nothing mysterious or metaphysical about creativity!  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Creativity is a way of HANDLING INFORMATION. Please stop  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphysicalising creativity! If only Superman or Jesus can be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creative then we are all screwed!!!! When you do this, you become AN  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; INCONSISTENT MACHINE!!!!!!!
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />All universal machine are creative. All humans are universal machine.  
<br />
So all humans are creative. Some are more lucky than others in the way  
<br />
they can develop it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Many people are scared of creativity because they think (feel) that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it threatens the validity (=supremacy) of (academic) VERTICAL  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Academies, when sane and not rotten, are natural place where  
<br />
creativity can develop, together with intelligence and beauty and all  
<br />
that.
<br />
I think we are barbarian because theologies, in general, have been  
<br />
abandoned to authoritative arguments, which truly have no places in  
<br />
(again, sane) academies.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Vertical thinking = where you must be 'right' at every step of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way and therefore 'consistent'). This is not so at all. The two  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes are complimentary - not antagonistic. Remember, Socrates  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sold the car with only the front left wheel. I am selling the OTHER  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; THREE WHEELS!!!!! Creativity (=lateral thinking) is useful for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; GENERATING ideas and approaches, vertical thinking (= logical,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; academic, lawyer-style, &quot;I am right, you are wrong&quot;-style thinking  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is useful for DEVELOPING ideas. Lateral Thinking enhances the valuse  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Vertical Thinking by offering it MORE TO SELECT FROM. Vertical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking multiplies the effectiveness of Lateral Thinking by making  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good use of the ideas generated.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree with this. Just that creativity can be encouraged, tips can be  
<br />
given. But it is like in the Chess play, creativity develops by the  
<br />
acceptance of constraints. Creative thinking develops in science and  
<br />
it art, by the good teaching of the non creative parts, itself the  
<br />
result of the creativity of the predecessors, I think.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most of the time, one will be using vertical thinking, but when one  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needs to use lateral thinking (as in the present moment in history,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where we are desperate for a 'new idea') - no amount of excellence  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in vertical thinking will do instead.
</em><br />
<br />The ideas are here. It is the communication inflation which are  
<br />
problematic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To persist i n vertical thinking when one should (if one is a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent machine) be using lateral thinking is HIGHLY DANGEROUS.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In truth, one needs skill at both types of thinking.
</em><br />
<br />But we do it all the times, in many fields. And the results are always  
<br />
a bit frightening. So *new* ideas takes time, always.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Creativity is like the reverse gear in a car. One would be a crazy  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fool to attempt to drive everywhere in reverse gear. On the other  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hand, one cleary nbeeds to ahve it and to be educated to know when   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's use is necessary - for example, how to get out of a cul-de-sac.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The ideas are here, all along with us. But people are sleepy, and  
<br />
forget to think about them. They are a bit coward, too.
<br />
Well, this leads usually to catastrophes, and hopefully this reawaken  
<br />
creativity.
<br />
<br />I would already be so happy if people could understand how bad lies  
<br />
can be. But today some industries work mainly on lies, on the type  
<br />
&quot;you need that car&quot;, &quot;you need that medication&quot;, etc. This generates  
<br />
fake moneys, and castles on sands. You can't be creative in Chess  
<br />
without knowing the &quot;vertical&quot; rules, and today we lies on the rules.  
<br />
That's the problem. It is not the lack of ideas, it is the  
<br />
impossibility to listen to any ideas which *seems* to contradict our  
<br />
habits. It is normal, we are humans, in this case. In a sense I don'  
<br />
care too much, I am interested in the billions years to come, and  
<br />
beyond, yet I would like to encourage rigor in *all* directions of  
<br />
thinking, because I believe this gives the best conditions for  
<br />
creativity to develop itself, and to give chance to us for belonging  
<br />
to the most paradise-like type of billions of years, instead of  
<br />
destroying ourselves in some myriad hellish ways. The best I can do is  
<br />
to share my enthusiasm for some possibilities.
<br />
<br />We can fight for more freedom, but we can't fight for more freewill. I  
<br />
think you are fighting for the equivalent of &quot;freedom&quot; for creativity.  
<br />
That could be interesting, but I have no words for it, yet. Thanks for  
<br />
making me thinking,
<br />
<br />Very kind regards,
<br />
<br />Bruno
