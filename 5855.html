<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The specific kind of example goes like this.  Suppose you take a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;vertically polarized photon and pass it through a polarizer that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tilted slightly from the vertical.  Quantum mechanics predicts that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there is a high chance, say 99%, that the photon will pass through,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and a low chance, 1%, that it will not make it and be absorbed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, the many worlds interpretation can be read to say that the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;splits into two when this experiment occurs.  There are two possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;outcomes: either it passes through or it is absorbed.  So there are two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes corresponding to the two results.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, the universes are not of equal probability, according to QM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One should be observed 99% of the time and the other only 1% of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time.
</em><br />
<br />Does the &quot;splitting&quot; have to be a bifurcation? If the universe splits into 
<br />
many (perhaps infinitely many?) universes rather than just two when this 
<br />
experiment occurs, the probability distribution can be preserved if the 
<br />
photon passes through the polarizer in 99% of these post-split universes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (C) In a many worlds cosmology, I seek you out as in (A) and make the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; claim about bestowing on you the ability to pick the winning numbers in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; week's lottery. You buy a ticket, and win first prize. Should you thank 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for helping you win, as in (A)? In general, no; this situation is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; more closely analogous to (B) than to (A). For it is certain that at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one future version of you will win, just as it is very likely that at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one person will win in the single world example. I can only claim that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; helped you win if I somehow identified which version in which world is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to win before the lottery is drawn, and that is impossible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm afraid I don't agree with the conclusion in (C).  I definitely should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thank you.  To see this, let's make my thanks a little more sincere,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the form of a payment.  Suppose I agree in advance to pay you $1000
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if you succeed in helping me win the lottery.  I say that is a wise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;decision on my part.  It doesn't cost me anything if you don't help,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and if you do have some way of rigging the lottery then I can easily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;afford to pay you this modest sum out of my winnings.
</em><br />
<br />This example reminds me of a moneymaking scam which goes like this. I spam 
<br />
many thousands of people who are potential participants in a certain 
<br />
lottery, offering them a list of what I claim will be the winning numbers. I 
<br />
provide some pseudo-scientific explanation of how I came by these numbers, 
<br />
but in reality the numbers have been randomly generated by my computer. I 
<br />
ask for no money up front from the email recipients, but I suggest that if 
<br />
they do use my numbers in the lottery and win, they should give me 1% of the 
<br />
winnings. Now, you can see that if I send out enough emails, there are bound 
<br />
to be some winners; and these winners will probably be so pleased that they 
<br />
will happily hand over the 1%. It looks like a great deal - everything to 
<br />
gain, nothing to lose - but of course, it is not. I have not increased the 
<br />
spam scam victims' chance of winning at all, and in fact I have reduced 
<br />
their expected gains by 1%. The error comes from the tacit assumption on the 
<br />
part of the winners that I had singled them out to offer them the correct 
<br />
numbers. If I had really done that, then they certainly should have been 
<br />
impressed.
<br />
<br />Returning to the many worlds example, if I provide you with random numbers 
<br />
while claiming to be able to predict/rig this week's lottery result, then 
<br />
purely by chance one in one million (say) of your future selves will win 
<br />
using my numbers. To those fortunate future selves it will appear extremely 
<br />
unlikely that they won purely by chance, and they will happily pay me the 
<br />
promised $1000. As above, the error the winners make is to behave as if I 
<br />
had singled out their particular world as the one in which my numbers win. 
<br />
In this case, however, that would have been doubly impossible: the different 
<br />
worlds do not come individually labelled, and the only necessary distinction 
<br />
between them (leading to the splitting) need be the differences in lottery 
<br />
results, which is the process we are examining.
