Hi Everyone,   (is that a well-defined word?)
<br />
<br />First of all, I have not forgotten about an un-replied post from Bruno but I
<br />
didn't want to quip something away without thinking about it and crafting
<br />
something decent.
<br />
<br />But in terms of why should Everything be well defined, let me say a few
<br />
things.  Firstly, although my opinion should be irrelevant, I am not
<br />
convinced it should be well defined or even well definable perhaps by others
<br />
in some future.  However, if one attributes some form of all inclusivity in
<br />
their Physics definition of Universe then it is really easy to &quot;prove&quot; the
<br />
universe +does not exist+ using Russell-like arguments.  My basic intuition
<br />
on why I think Everything should be well definable, as rough and illogical
<br />
as this connection might seem to anyone outside my mind is this: the
<br />
universe (whatever its actual contents and laws and nature might be) exists
<br />
implies Everything is definable.
<br />
<br />I do not assume the universe exists but I think that is something we can
<br />
agree that its existence goes beyond reasonable doubt.  I loathe such
<br />
statements as &quot;it would be absurd to conjecture that the universe does not
<br />
exist&quot; as proof that it does.  I want something deeper and maybe someday
<br />
that deeper reason for the existence and perhaps proof of its existence will
<br />
come.  The former discussion (why it exists) +might+ have light shed on it
<br />
by an actual -proof- that it does exist.  My guess: that will be as
<br />
un/satisfying as the question 'why do groups exist.'
<br />
<br />Incidentally, a proof that the universe exists would prove unquestionably
<br />
that some forms of theism are correct such as pantheism and panentheism (I
<br />
am of the latter camp).  Assuming all these conjectures such as the MUH work
<br />
out, of course.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />In my analysis, and please provide us with -your- (your = Everyone, which is
<br />
also hopefully well defined!!) input, the conclusion I make from Russell's
<br />
argument is something like this:
<br />
<br /><br />[Thm 1 - Russell]
<br />
If one uses the context of classical (binary) logic, the axiom of foundation
<br />
implies that any 'set' theory with a universal set and subsets axiom is
<br />
inconsistent relative to classical logic.
<br />
<br />proof: slight modification of Russell's argument.
<br />
<br />{Thm 1, rephrased}
<br />
If one uses the context of classical logic, then the following three axioms
<br />
can't be simultaneously consistent whilst maintaining overall  consistency
<br />
relative to binary, classical logic:
<br />
1. The Foundation Axiom   --   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_axiom">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_axiom</a>
<br />
2. A universal set axiom  -  ie  -  there is an x such that for all y, y 'is
<br />
in' x
<br />
3. The subsets axiom   --   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehension_axiom">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehension_axiom</a>
<br />
<br />Intuitively, the foundation axiom is meant to disallow sets that can be
<br />
elements of themselves and what are known as 'vicious circles'.  The
<br />
Foundation axiom is what I think is similar to Euclid's parallel postulate
<br />
in its malleability.  Modifying the FA and dropping it altogether has been
<br />
investigated for a few decades now by others.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />The question then becomes why should this particular theorem, with its
<br />
assumptions, apply in cases for which the hypotheses are not assumable (such
<br />
as if they are known to be wrong)?
<br />
<br />To suggest that this theorem by Russell automatically applies in all more
<br />
general cases, that it can automatically be made any stronger at all,
<br />
-might- end up being correct but this is a fundamental error in the
<br />
investigation of mathematics in my opinion.  To suggest that de facto,
<br />
Russell's theorem applies in all cases when the hypotheses are relaxed is no
<br />
more valid than, for example, suggesting that the intermediate value theorem
<br />
is true for all non-continuous functions.  Sure, the conclusion can be true
<br />
for some non-continuous functions but when that continuity hypothesis is
<br />
relaxed (such as, in the analogy, if we departed classical logic and went to
<br />
a logic based on [0,1] for example, or perhaps something that is far more
<br />
abstract than that where the truth set is the underlying set of an
<br />
MV-algebra), the conclusion (that the universal set does not exist, in the
<br />
analogy), is not correct.  I am tentatively assuming that the three axioms
<br />
above are inconsistent relative to -the context of logic one is using- for
<br />
any finite logic but in the case with infinitely many truth values, my
<br />
intuition about classical logic begins to fail me completely and I have my
<br />
doubts as to whether this theorem is going to be true there, too.
<br />
<br />Hence, this is why I think it is possible that in some sense a universal set
<br />
can exist and Everything would just be defined to be it, thus providing a
<br />
good definition for Everything, thus proving Everything is definable...  Not
<br />
just some sense, but some interesting sense without seemingly needing to, at
<br />
random, sacrifice the axiom of choice as well (such as in some NF approaches
<br />
inspired by Quine (sp?)).
<br />
<br />Then assuming the MUH, this set in that logic could be, literally, the
<br />
universe.  That logic would be, in some sense, the +actual+ logic of the
<br />
universe.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />The thing about set theory is that it was not designed to talk about
<br />
Physics.  That's why it is too rich for Physics.  It was meant to be about
<br />
math.  This to me is like having non-Euclidean geometries that are wholly
<br />
irrelevant to GR.  There are a select few types of non-Euclidean Geometries
<br />
applicable to GR, and hence, the observed part of the universe.  There might
<br />
be that set theory out there analogous to that right non-Euclidean Geometry
<br />
that is applicable to Tegmark's MUH.  Personally, I'm a big fan of dropping
<br />
the FA altogether as that seems to have no Physical motivation.  When there
<br />
are things such as twin particles and spin oddities, I think may be a
<br />
&quot;particle&quot; that can be literally in itself like an unending self-similar
<br />
fractal particle of fractional dimension, or something as equally
<br />
counter-macro-intuitive.  (I do have my doubts about the dimension of the
<br />
universe being a natural number, of course, although that would fit Occam's
<br />
Razor well if the data all fit that...)

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Dear Nichomachus,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; decision. If she measures the particle's spin as positive, she will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; elect to switch cases, and if she measures it with a negative spin she
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; will keep the one she has. This is because she wants to be sure that,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; having gotten to this point in the game, there will be at least some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; branches of her existence where she experiences winning the grand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; prize. She is not convinced that, were she to decide what to do using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; only the processes available to her mind, she would guarantee that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; same result since it is just possible that all of the mutiple versions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; of herself confronted with the dilemma may make the same bad guess.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I have also thought along these lines some time ago (to use a qubit to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ensure that all outcomes are chosen, because one should not rely on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one's mind decohering into all possible decisions).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The essential question is this: what worlds exist? All possible worlds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But which worlds are possible? We have, on the one hand, physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possibility (this also includes other physical constants etc, but no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; totally unphysical scenarios).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I have long adhered to this &quot;everything physically possible&quot;, but this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; does break down under closer scrutiny: first of all, physical relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are, when things come down to it, mathematical relations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So we could conclude with Max Tegmark: all possible mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; structures exist; this is ill defined (but then, why should the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Everything be well defined?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Alastair argues in his paper that everything logically possible exists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (with his non arbitrariness principle) but, while initially appealing,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it leads to the question: what is logically possible? In what logic?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Classical/Intuitionist/Deviant logics etc etc...then we are back at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Max's all possible structures.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; For all this, I am beginning very much to appreciate Bruno's position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with the Sigma_1 sentences; but I still have to do more reading and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; catch up on some logic/recursion theory for a final verdict ;-))
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are on the right track :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; One objection comes to mind immediately (already written above): why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; should the Everything be well defined?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you should ask Brian Tenneson. Personally I follow Plotinus and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many Buddhist, Israelites, Muslims, and Christians, (and more) on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact that the Big Picture (Brian's Universal set, I think) is not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; member of what belongs to the Big Picture, so the everything cannot be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described, nor really belonging to the everything.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even restraining ourself to the mathematical universe (i.e. adopting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematicalism), they are good reasons to believe that the whole of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics cannot be considered as a mathematical object. One reason
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that all attempts to make the mathematical everything purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical have failed. Set theories (like ZF) miss some mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; object and also, in some sense, produce to much unwanted mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects. Lawvere made an attempt to get the Big Mathematical Picture as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a category, but he fails, although he (re)deiscovered the topos
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; catehories in the process, which captures more the mathematician's mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the mathematical reality (realities). The set theory NF does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capture Universal Sets, but then I have doubt that it does it in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; genuine sense, or if it is not in inconsistent theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another reason is a not yet clear generalization of Gödel's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incompleteness phenomenon along the line of Grim (ref in my thesis).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With comp, we have also a universal object (the universal machine), but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again, like the toposes, it is more on the side of the &quot;mathematician&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than of the &quot;mathematical reality&quot;. With comp (actually with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical comp, i.e. with the lobian interview) we have good reason
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to suspect that the notion of &quot;truth (about) us&quot;  *is* the big picture
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Plotinus' One), but we can prove, then, that IF comp is true, and IF
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are self-referentially correct (and thus lobian) then such a notion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of truth cannot be expressed by any means by us. So I do thing that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything, curiously enough, perhaps, does not belong to any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything thing we can defined (despite its name, probably because of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its name).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure about the motivation of Brian for his search of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal set. May be he could tell us a bit more?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PS I intended to comment some other posts but I have work to do, and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think this week I will be very buzy. I keep reading the list and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absence or delay in comments does not reflect lack of interest but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accumulation of time consuming jobs those days. Normally I will have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more time next week. Best regards to all of you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah ... A colleague of mine (the one who actually suggested me to look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at that movie)  told me that &quot;The Prestige&quot; is the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anti-computationalist movie ever conceivable, and he gave me a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good argument! Cannot say more now without trigging the &quot;spoiler alert&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; To go back to your original question: to consider if both variants are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; chosen by the player of the game by herself (without qubit) seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; depend on which kind of Everything you choose. And that, I think, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; crux of the matter.
