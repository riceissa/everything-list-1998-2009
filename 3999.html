</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, can lattices capture also those important
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; features?
</em><br />
<br />I haven't read the papers, just the abstracts. I could wait to comment 
<br />
for a few days or weeks until I've had a chance to absorb the papers, 
<br />
if ever, or comment now.
<br />
<br />First, it looks like these events are the usual &quot;entangled states,&quot; 
<br />
which can be spacelike (the usual example of particles separated by 
<br />
light years).
<br />
<br />Second, for such spacelike intervals, they are outside each others' 
<br />
light cones in the extreme cases, so it would not be expected for any 
<br />
partial ordering to exist.
<br />
<br />Third, my own idiosyncratic view is to look at entangled particles as a 
<br />
single system, regardless of separation.
<br />
<br />Fourth, as to the mechanics of lattices: the essence of a 
<br />
partially-ordered set (poset) is that it does not require trichotomy, 
<br />
where either a is less than b, a is greater than b, or a is equal to b. 
<br />
In a chain, a linear form of a lattice, trichotomy holds. So, the 
<br />
integers obey trichotomy, as one integer is either less than, greater 
<br />
than, or equal to any other integer. Orders which obey trichotomy are 
<br />
said to be well-ordered.
<br />
<br />But not all sets are well-ordered. If the ordering relation is set 
<br />
inclusion, then a series of sets need not obey trichotomy. Some sets 
<br />
may be disjoint, with one neither including the other, being included 
<br />
by the other, or equal.
<br />
<br />In terms of causality, not even getting involved with speed of light 
<br />
issues and light cones, it is quite possible to say &quot;event A neither 
<br />
caused event B nor was caused by event B nor is the same as event B.&quot; 
<br />
That is, the events A and B are incommensurate, or disjoint...they fail 
<br />
trichotomy. Clearly, most events all around us are such examples of 
<br />
incommensurate. They form posets.
<br />
<br />What a lattice does is to formalize the notions of order and to say 
<br />
there is only one edge between two events, and nothing in between (no 
<br />
other nodes in between). If two events are separated by many instants 
<br />
of time, many other events, then the lattice is made up of the smallest 
<br />
identifiable events. The events look like a lattice. (As I said, the 
<br />
Web has many nice pictures. No point in my spending 20 minutes drawing 
<br />
an ASCII lattice here, having it reproduced poorly, when entering 
<br />
&quot;lattice poset&quot; into Google will turn up nice pictures.)
<br />
<br />So, I would say from reading the abstracts that the Bell example just 
<br />
fits the ecample of a poset, where two events, which may or may not be 
<br />
entangled, are spacelike to each other. (This is the essence of the 
<br />
usual &quot;instantaneous action&quot; of EPR/delayed choice experiments.)
<br />
