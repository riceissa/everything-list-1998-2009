<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think it is one of the most profound things about consciousness &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
that observer moments don't *need* anything to connect them other than &gt; &gt;
<br />
their content. They are linked like the novels in a series, not like the &gt; &gt;
<br />
carriages of a train. It is not necessary that the individual novels be &gt; &gt;
<br />
lined up specially on a shelf: as long as they have each been written &gt; &gt;
<br />
and exist somewhere in the world, the series exists. &gt; &gt; But the series
<br />
exists, as a series, by virtue of the information in them.  They are like
<br />
Barbour's &gt; time-capsules; each contains enough references and characters
<br />
from the others to allow them to be &gt; put into order.  It's not clear to me
<br />
what duration &quot;obserever moments&quot; have - but I don't think &gt; they are novel
<br />
length.  I imagine them more like sentences (a complete thought as my
<br />
English teacher &gt; used to say), and sentences *don't* have enough
<br />
information to allow them to be reconstructed into &gt; the novel they came
<br />
from.
<br />
A book is the analogy that came to mind, but there is an important
<br />
difference between this and conscious experience. Books, sentences, words
<br />
may not need to be physically collected together to make a coherent larger
<br />
structure, but they do need to be somehow sorted in the mind of an observer;
<br />
otherwise, we could say that a dictionary contains every book ever written
<br />
or yet to be written. Moments of consciousness, on the other hand, by their
<br />
nature contain their own observer.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's why I suggest that OMs are not an adequate ontological basis for a
</em><br />
world model.  On the other &gt; hand, if we include brain processes, or more
<br />
abstractly, subconscious thoughts, then we would have &gt; enough information
<br />
to string them together.
<br />
I know some people on this list have attempted world-building with OMs, but
<br />
my starting point is the less ambitious idea that consciousness can in
<br />
principle extend across time and space without being specially linked. If a
<br />
person's stream of consciousness were chopped up into seconds, minutes, days
<br />
or whatever, using whatever vehicle it takes to run a human mind, and these
<br />
moments of consciousness randomly dispersed throughout the multiverse, they
<br />
would all connect up by virtue of their information content. Do you disagree
<br />
that it would in principle be possible?
<br />
<br /><br />You can take time evolution as an example. In both classical physics and
<br />
quantum mechanics, information is preserved. All the information about us
<br />
was already present in the early universe....
