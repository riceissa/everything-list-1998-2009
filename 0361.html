<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This would be both an explanation and a deduction.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but the premise of you being a random selection can't be used to draw
<br />
any new conclusions because it is superseded by the information of who you
<br />
actually are, therefore it can only serve as an explanation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do have a problem with the way explanations use probability.  In your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; card game example, what happens when you are dealt an unlikely hand?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What kind of explanation can the theory offer?  If you are playing many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times, you can say that the theory does give the frequency with which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such hands will appear.  But in life, it seems like we only play once.
</em><br />
<br />But this is a general problem for any kind of explanation, right? There is
<br />
always going to be someone who is atypical and for whom the explanation
<br />
will fail. Nothing you can do about it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I look around the world and see that the vast majority of people are poor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third-worlders struggling with difficult lives.  I am fortunate enough to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; live in a wealthy country, have a good education, and tremendous riches
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the standards of most people.  What kind of explanation is there for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this based on the assumption that I am a random selection from among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all people?  We can't run the universe again and let me be a different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; random selection next time.  This is the same conceptual problem I keep
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; encountering with this notion.
</em><br />
<br />I also wonder why I am so atypical. But on the other hand I am not as
<br />
atypical as I could possibly be (e.g., I am not temporarily formed out of
<br />
bouncing air molecules). On balance the explanation seems sufficient.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It gets worse if you consider not just me as a random sample from among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all observers, but if you consider me-now as a random sample from among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all observer-instants.  Now it seems that I have to adopt an atemporal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective where my consciousness dwells here in Hal Finney, 1999, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an instant, then jumps back to a slave in ancient Rome, then dwells for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a moment in our bug-eyed alien.  I can't make sense out of this.
</em><br />
<br />I can't make sense out of that either. Your consciousness dwells here in
<br />
Hal Finney, 1999, period. It doesn't jump around, and it doesn't flow
<br />
forward (that's an illusion). On second thought maybe it's better to
<br />
preserve the illusion of forward-flowing consciousness and give up the
<br />
explanation for why you are who/when you are. Having to say &quot;I have no 
<br />
explanation&quot; isn't *that* bad. On the other hand if you're willing to give
<br />
up the illusion that the universe is not completely deterministic, you may
<br />
be willing to give up this one too, at least intellectually.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This view is especially perplexing if my measure changes drastically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over time.  With some of our thought experiments, I could boost the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure of an instant of my consciousness by making copies of my brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state (say, a high-resolution X-ray).  But the next instant, my measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; drops again.  Would I somehow expect to notice myself spending more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time in that amplified instant?  Suppose I spent half my days with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; big brain and half my days with a small brain.  Am I to be puzzled on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those days I am in the small brain, faced with the mystery of why I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not experiencing the measure-enhanced big-brain days?
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps, but you should also be comforted by the thought that you're not
<br />
having the experiences of someone formed out of bouncing air molecules. 
<br />
You have to keep in mind that you can't directly experience your measure.
<br />
It's kind of like you can't tell if I were to gradually replace your
<br />
neurons with neuron-simulator chips.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is related to the quantum immortality question.  As time goes on,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my measure becomes less.  But it is hard to understand what I should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expect to experience as a result of this.
</em><br />
<br />It depends on whether you want to preserve the illusion of forward-flowing
<br />
consciousness. If you don't, then you should expect to (I)  experience
<br />
exactly what you are experiencing right now. If you do, then you have to
<br />
figure out how this flow actually works. There are two possibilities:
<br />
either (IIa) some (most) threads terminate or converge into null
<br />
experiences (corresponding to unconsciousness), or (IIb) that doesn't
<br />
happen (maybe the threads merge somehow). In the first case you should
<br />
expect to experience nothing. In the second case you should expect to
<br />
experience immortality. 
<br />
<br />(IIb) is probably most appealing to most people, but I prefer (on an
<br />
intellectual level) (I) because it is simplest.
