Eric's first law of abstraction: (known variously as the trivially 
<br />
profound law or the profoundly trivial law:)
<br />
<br />&quot;Every two things are both the same and different.&quot;
<br />
<br />Bowel movements and mental processes. They are both physical processes 
<br />
in the body, it's true.
<br />
The difference is that a mental process is
<br />
in its essence a process of representation (&quot;re presentation&quot;) of 
<br />
reality and similarly
<br />
structured potential realities. That is, it is a process of using some 
<br />
aspect in the brain as a stand-in
<br />
for some aspect of the external world. And it is a process of doing so 
<br />
in a way that is flexible and
<br />
general enough to allow the generation of representations (mental 
<br />
stand-ins) of new hypothetical
<br />
or counterfactual states of the external reality, as well as of actual 
<br />
states. Thus we can think of how
<br />
things we have not directly apprehended might be, and how things that 
<br />
haven't yet taken place could be,
<br />
if only this would happen, or, sadly but instructively, of how things 
<br />
might have been.
<br />
<br />Models of the mind:
<br />
--------------------
<br />
Back when 90% of the world and its behaviour was unknown and attributed 
<br />
to God, the mind and soul
<br />
was thought to be an earthbound, temporarily trapped part of the greater 
<br />
mind of God.
<br />
<br />During the early industrial age, the mind was thought by some to be the 
<br />
process of operation of
<br />
a machine comprised of cogs and gears and things like steam power.
<br />
<br />And today, we believe that the brain is a computer and the mind is 
<br />
software.
<br />
The conventional wisdom is that this theory is as naive as the earlier 
<br />
theories; that we are similarly
<br />
deluded by our present-day fetish with computers. But I think this 
<br />
dismissal of brain-as-computer, mind-as-software
<br />
is facile. I think our theories of mind have been improving over time. 
<br />
The brain IS a form of machine, as the 19th century
<br />
people thought. And much more specifically, the brain IS a form of 
<br />
universal computing machine, as we think today.
<br />
<br />Let me ask this. What category of machine do we have that can hold in it 
<br />
symbolic representations
<br />
that have correspondences with aspects of the external world? What 
<br />
category of machine do we have whose
<br />
representations of the world are manipulable and malleable in ways that 
<br />
can correspond to changes in the
<br />
state of the external world? The computer of course. What part of the 
<br />
computer stores the representations
<br />
of the world? Well I guess we could say its disk and memory. But what 
<br />
part of the computer performs the
<br />
manipulations on the symbols which sometimes correspond to the formation 
<br />
of hypotheses about the state of the
<br />
external world? It's not really part of the computer at all. It is the 
<br />
software.
<br />
<br />The historical thinker who came closest to understanding the nature of 
<br />
the mind was undoubtedly Plato,
<br />
who first understood a world of abstract concepts, his world of ideals. 
<br />
The only thing he didn't know is that
<br />
you could build a machine (the computer) capable of holding inside 
<br />
itself and manipulating those ideals, and that
<br />
in fact we already had a particularly sophisticated form of that type of 
<br />
machine on top of our shoulders.
<br />
Our brains. Where is Plato's world of ideals? He didn't know. We do. It 
<br />
is the representative and asbstracted
<br />
representative information about the world stored symbolically in our 
<br />
brains,
<br />
manipulated by the cognitive software running on our brains.
<br />
<br />The brain-mind duality is solved (and now officially boring). If you can 
<br />
say that you truly understand:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) the distinction between computing software and computing hardware,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) issues such as what makes one piece of software different from or 
<br />
the same as another
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;versus what makes one piece of hardware different from versus the 
<br />
same as another,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) What the relationship of computing software to computing hardware
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) How the essential particulars of high-level software gain 
<br />
independence from particulars of computing hardware through
<br />
the construction of hierarchies of  levels or layers of software process 
<br />
with emergent behaviours at each level,
<br />
<br />and yet you claim not to know what a mind is with respect to a brain, 
<br />
then I would say you're just not thinking
<br />
hard enough about the issue.
