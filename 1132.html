nothing to make them less absurd than true zombies.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;         The two experiments are actually rather different and I should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have made the distiction clearer in my post.  I assume you refer below to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the case with two copying events.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, I thought I was very clear.  All of my six &quot;options&quot; are alternative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ways of interpreting the original experiment, with a coin toss, and one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copying event if the toss lands heads.  There may be a problem with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terminology here, because if you assume the MWI, then the coin toss is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a copy event.  I do usually assume MWI, so I may have confused things.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A coin toss is not the same as a copy event in the MWI.  In a copy
<br />
event, my view is that measure is doubled.  In an MWI coin toss, measure
<br />
is conserved, as was explained in my other posts.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;       The copy of Jane who sees the blue card is a new person, who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;       was just &quot;born&quot; at the instant the copy was made, even though
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;       she has all the same memories as the original.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;         That is NOT my position, though of course I think 'consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; flowing to and being distributed among continuations' is nonsense.  I make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; no distinction between a copy and the original; 'identity' is not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fundamental concept.  Each has the same amount of measure.  For practical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; purposes the distinction is useful, however.  It's just a matter of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; terminology in the practical use.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then I wish you would describe what you do believe.  I am stymied in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attempts to make sense of it, and I have tried.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consciousness &quot;flowing&quot; is perhaps a bad image.  I mean nothing more than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that certain observer moments are related by some sort of identity function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to other observer moments.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have described my view.  I see no random identity functions.
<br />
The only thing that even resembles an identity function in my view is that
<br />
an extended computation may occur which gives rise to several observer
<br />
moments, but in that case all copies are equally related to the original.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your so called identity function sounds like hidden variables, 
<br />
related to the many-minds type.
<br />
<br />[re: Tegmark's formula]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's very simple, although I guess I haven't written it out in gory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; detail before.  Tegmark's formula &quot;for any mutually exclusive and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collectively exhaustive set of possibilities Bi, the probability of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an event A is given by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     P(A) = Sum over i [  P(A|Bi) P(Bi)  ]
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the meaning of this formula?  If P(Bi) is the effective
<br />
probability that an observer would see Bi, then Bi is a label for all the
<br />
things an observer could see.  'A' is then a particular characteristic
<br />
that an observer-moment can have.  But then P(A|Bi) is either zero or one,
<br />
which is not what I think you meant.  Explain.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I want to computer P(H, t3).  Let B1 be (H, t1) and B2 be (T, t1), then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     P(H, t3) = P(H,t3 | H,t1) P(H,t1) + P(H,t3 | T,t1) P(T,t1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We assume in this option (4) that P(H,t1) = P(T,t1) = 1/2.  
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess your 'identity function' is coming into play.  Otherwise
<br />
the above makes no sense ... unless you are not using an MWI coin flip.
<br />
Without the MWI, either the H branch exists or the T branch but not both. 
<br />
In any case you have changed the game when bringing time into the picture.
<br />
Am I now to understand that what Tegmark meant to say is that 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(A,t2) = Sum over i [  P(A,t2|Bi,t1) P(Bi,t1)  ]
<br />
which not the same at all as what you quoted him as saying.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maintain, and I really don't see how it could be otherwise, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     P(H,t3 | H,t1) = 1  and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     P(H,t3 | T,t1) = 0.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some people have claimed that these relations do not hold, but I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see what they could possibly be talking about.  These statements say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing more than that my memories are consistent -- that I can expect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them to remain constant.  If we abandon that, then all hope is lost!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wish those who claim this (Hal?, Wei?) would explain themselves better.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I claim that P(H,t3|H,t1) does not mean anything useful.  Neither
<br />
does P(H,t3 and H,t1).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remark again that an extended computation can, and often
<br />
does, give rise to two such observer moments.  In the sense that &quot;you&quot; 
<br />
are an extended computation over time, your memories are consistent 
<br />
over time.  You can then say that &quot;'P(H3,t3|H,t1)' = 1&quot; *in the sense of*
<br />
the effective probability of an extended computation giving rise to (H3,t3)
<br />
at time t3 being 1 if it gave rise to (H1,t1) at time t1.   But be
<br />
careful!!!  This is a very weak sense of the word &quot;you&quot;.  If copying
<br />
occurs, the measure of the first moment does not equal the measure of the
<br />
second moment, so this quantity can NOT be inserted into the Tegmark-like
<br />
formula.  Instead one must multiply each observation by its measure, then
<br />
divide by the total measure - the absolute SSA.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also say that English has an advantage over French in that
<br />
the same word 'you' must be used for both singular and plural in English.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [JM said]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; remember something non-random, that shouldn't cut your measure.  If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; remember a random bit, it cuts the total measure of each type of you in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; half but now there are twice as many types.  By total measure I mean, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; always, the number, so this is consistent with the SSA and leads to no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; zombies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But you said it yourself, if I remember a random bit, &quot;it cuts the total
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure of each type of [me] in half.&quot;  I don't know what you mean by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;type&quot;.  I'd say it cuts the measure of me in half.  That's exactly my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bit is either 0 or 1.  If you don't know the value, let your
<br />
measure be M_d.  If you know it's 0, you have measure M_0; if you know
<br />
it's 1, M_1.  So M_d = M_0 + M_1.  Suppose there are two guys, Dummy and
<br />
Ben.  Dummy is ignorant and has M_d.  Ben knows the bit and the versions
<br />
of him that saw 1 have M_1, the versions that saw 0 have M_0.  A randomly
<br />
chosen observer is equally likely to be Dummy or to be one of the Bens.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cute!  But I thing the jury is still out.  I probably shouldn't use the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; term &quot;Omega-Point&quot;, since that refers to a specific theory of the infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future evolution of the universe.  I sometimes use it to refer in general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the infinite future in which life continues.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life will continue but with decreasing measure.  Still it seems
<br />
that you can make a refutable prediction: namely, that the universe we are
<br />
in is not optimised for us to be here, but is optimised to give you a long
<br />
lifetime.  Basically you are saying that what the measure ratio (say,
<br />
between two universes) will be in the future affects the measure ratio in
<br />
the present.  For example a universe in which lives decay polynomially
<br />
would be favored over one in which they decay exponentially.
