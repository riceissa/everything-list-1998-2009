<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nothing will actually change either subjectively or objectively.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true nature (the Dao, if you like, roughly the ONE in Plotinus).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say the Universal Soul.  To be the ONE? The difficulty is that  
<br />
Plotinus is not always clear. Obvioulsy he did not dispose of an  
<br />
arithmetical interpretation. Formidably enough he is aware that  
<br />
numbers can play a big role there, like most neoplatonists.
<br />
The &quot;universal soul&quot; hypostase *is* a first person (or a theory about  
<br />
a first person). Some would say it is just an &quot;abstract person&quot;. That  
<br />
it is just the least common part of all souls, or in the arithmetical  
<br />
&quot;toy&quot; theology, that is the common part of all first persons  
<br />
corresponding to the ideally correct machines. But (with comp) we can  
<br />
make the point that such a person *is* conscious.
<br />
A sort of confirmation is given by the thought of some mystic  
<br />
(Plotinus, Ibn Arabi, ...), but also from experience reports of those  
<br />
who experiments with Salvia Divinorum, which makes possible to have a  
<br />
total amnesia (forgetting not just who you are, but that you are, +  
<br />
forgetting everything up to the idea of time and space), yet remaining  
<br />
conscious, if not being even much more conscious with the feeling that  
<br />
memories are making you less conscious, and that a memory-brain is a  
<br />
filter on histories. Stable memories differentiate consciousness.
<br />
<br />A problem for comp is that, well at least I have thought that comp  
<br />
makes the soul (the first person, the third hypostase) conscious only  
<br />
through its building or generating time. But the salvia reports and my  
<br />
own experiences make me think I could be wrong there.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; .domain.name.hidden:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I have come to wonder: you take the Löbian Machine to be the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a person - say, a human. But what if the Löbian Machine is actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and only) the ultimate person - the universal soul, in Plotinus'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terminology.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. It is the ultimate person, but also the initial person.It is a  
<br />
baby god. The one who has to fall from truth to be able to go back to  
<br />
truth, but then the impossible marriage between just addition and  
<br />
multiplication explains (assuming we are digital) why we can lost our  
<br />
selves in an infinitely complex labyrinth of realities.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This would account for the infinite (continuum!) histories (lived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through the lives of all beings in the multiverse), the &quot;universal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; soul&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forgetting itself in a cosmic play, sort of -  but also for COMP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immortality - immortal would be the _universal soul_, but not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily &quot;concrete&quot; persons (as we conceive them, which requires at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least some continuity of memory etc)
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think you are quite correct. Except I would say &quot;all&quot; first persons  
<br />
feel themselves always as being concrete (in all situations, OMs,  
<br />
worlds, ...). Even an amnesic person can feel herself concrete, even  
<br />
if she forgets the meaning of the word concrete. And see what I said  
<br />
to Stathis, the point where I don't follow Parfit: we are never 100%  
<br />
concrete. Concreteness is always relative to a probable history. We  
<br />
are always &quot;abstract, immaterial&quot; types relatively embedded in  
<br />
infinitely many types of histories (computations seen from inside).  
<br />
So, like in Hinduism it seems comp gives the two main form of  
<br />
immortality: the one when you remember you are the universal soul, and  
<br />
the one which makes you live again, and again, and again, from  
<br />
mornings to mornings, from lives to lives, exploring the many  
<br />
realities. I think this happens when you don't remember you are the  
<br />
universal soul. That remembering is somewhat paradoxical, and, to be  
<br />
sure hard to extract from the interview of the universal machine.
<br />
It is really an amnesia of an amnesia. Perhaps a forgetful functor in  
<br />
the category of the models of Lobian machines. I don't *know*!
<br />
The incompleteness prevents the consistent machines to ever come back  
<br />
on earth with the &quot;last&quot; step of that remembering. It does not prevent  
<br />
the machine to commit that last step, only to come back with the  
<br />
memory of that step.
<br />
<br />Hmmm ... This could look a bit mystical, so I should recall AUDA, for  
<br />
the benefit of some others.
<br />
<br />====================
<br />
AUDA in short.
<br />
<br />For the correct machine, the incompleteness makes obligatory to have a  
<br />
&quot;theology&quot;, in the sense that she can proves her own incompleteness  
<br />
theorem and distinguish truth from provability, especially about about  
<br />
what is true about her, and what is provable about her.
<br />
<br />I associate to each (ideally correct ) machine a theology, consisting  
<br />
in 8 hypostases. The simplest way is provided by the arithmetical  
<br />
interpretation of Plotinus ( a beautiful sum of 1500 years of rational  
<br />
mysticism). The richness comes from the machine discovering its own  
<br />
incompleteness, as far as she is honest or correct about herself.  
<br />
(meaning &quot;machine says p entails p is true).
<br />
<br />Like many Greeks (and non Greeks) there are three gods, or one god  
<br />
with three aspects (whatever). Plotinus called them &quot;primary  
<br />
Hypostases&quot;.  Like Günther reminds you, there are
<br />
<br />1)The ONE (the first god)
<br />
2)The INTELLIGIBLE (or intellect, the second God)
<br />
3)The UNIVERSAL SOUL (the third God)
<br />
<br />To call this &quot;primary&quot; hypostases made me called &quot;secondary  
<br />
hypostases&quot;, the two notion of MATTER that Plotinus derives from the  
<br />
primary hypostases.
<br />
<br />4)INTELLIGIBLE MATTER
<br />
5)SENSIBLE MATTER
<br />
<br />And this makes, when translated into arithmetic or into any universal  
<br />
machine language eight hypostases. Not five. Indeed, the ONE (of the  
<br />
machine M) is interpreted by the TRUTH. With comp, or with PA (as  
<br />
lobian machine), we can take TRUTH as being ARITHMETICAL TRUTH, and  
<br />
figure it as the set of Gödel numbers of all true arithmetical  
<br />
propositions.
<br />
<br />1) ONE = TRUTH
<br />
<br />The INTELLIGIBLE is interpreted by Gödel Beweisbar predicate. It is  
<br />
the beliefs of that ideally correct machine (or PA, ZF, ...). By  
<br />
incompleteness, it splits into two parts. What is true about the  
<br />
provability, and what is provable (by the machine (PA, ZF, ..) about  
<br />
that provability. Solovay theorems, in a nutshell, is that the  
<br />
provable part of the INTELLIGIBLE obeys the modal logic G, and the  
<br />
true, but not necessarily provable obeys G*. So
<br />
<br />2) INTELLIGIBLE (by the machine on earth) = G   and
<br />
2bis) INTELLIGIBLE (true, or divine, or in heaven) = G*
<br />
<br />3) THE UNIVERSAL SOUL, I define it by the knower, and I define the  
<br />
knower by the &quot;well known and debated&quot; Theaetetical trick: to know p  
<br />
is defiend by to believe p when p is true. This has already been done  
<br />
for the Lobian machine (or PA, ...), independently by many people, and  
<br />
it gives an already studied logic known as S4Grz, it can be sen as  
<br />
both a temporal logic of an agent building its mind in time, or  
<br />
directly as a logic of subjective time. So S4Grz is the logic of the  
<br />
new box [•] with  [•]p defined by []p &amp; p.
<br />
<br />A normal and sane objection could rise here. Given that the machine is  
<br />
correct, is it not obviously true that []p and []p &amp; p are equivalent?
<br />
Fundamental answer: if the machine is PA, or any sufficietly simple  
<br />
Lobian machine, so that *you* can believe the machine is correct, then  
<br />
yes []p and []p &amp; p are &quot;obviously&quot; equivalent. But, by  
<br />
incompleteness, such equivalence is not obviously true for the  
<br />
machine, indeed such equivalence is true but not provable by the  
<br />
machine. For each p (arithmetical proposition) it is true that &quot;PA  
<br />
proves p&quot; is equivalent with &quot;(PA proves p) and p&quot;, but PA cannot  
<br />
prove, for any arithmetical proposition that (PA proves p) &lt;-&gt; ((PA  
<br />
proves p) &amp; p). Indeed if PA could prove that PA would prove (PA  
<br />
proves false) being equivalent with (PA proves false) and false), that  
<br />
PA would prove (not provable false), and PA would prove its own  
<br />
consistency (which is impossible by Gödel's theorem). Put it  
<br />
differently G* proves []p &lt;-&gt; ([]p &amp; p), but G does not prove it. This  
<br />
makes the &quot;soul&quot;, obeying a different logic from the intelligible.  
<br />
Indeed the intelligible obeys G (and G*), the soul of the ideally  
<br />
correct machines obeys S4Grz.
<br />
Two remarkable facts: Like truth, by a Tarski (Scott-Montague)  
<br />
phenomenon; the box [•] cannot be define in the language of the  
<br />
machine. Even for the machine its &quot;first person&quot; is already not a  
<br />
machine (not a third person describable reality actually). The second  
<br />
remarkable fact is that S4Grz = S4GRz*. The soul does not split into a  
<br />
earth part and a heaven part.
<br />
<br />4) INTELLIGIBLE MATTER  []p &amp; &lt;&gt;p  (or []p &amp; &lt;&gt;t).
<br />
<br />5) SENSIBLE MATTER  []p &amp; &lt;&gt;p &amp; p  (or(( []p &amp; p) &amp; &lt;&gt;t).
<br />
<br />I have to go. I will say more on the 4 and 5 tomorrow. You could try  
<br />
to see why we need them to have a measure of credibility or  
<br />
probability on the consistent extensions (of the ideal machine). Both  
<br />
will split into an earth part and a heaven part, so we get the eight  
<br />
hypostases. More in the Plotinus paper, see my url.
<br />
Of course the main contribution of Gödel was in showing how we can  
<br />
translate (PA proves p) into the language of PA. That works for all  
<br />
Lobian machines (quasi by definition).
