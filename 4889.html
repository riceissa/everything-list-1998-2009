<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same probability as being the smooth continuation of yourself on Earth.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that makes sense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But in the multiverse, there are certainly infinite other perfect copies of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yourself which are not smooth continuations. We can imagine thousands of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ways how these copies could be made. In computer simulations, in a distant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Earth&quot; in the Tegmark plenitude, or elsewhere.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but keep in mind that there are also infinitely other copies which
<br />
*are* smooth continuations.  And these probably outnumber the ones which
<br />
are discontinuous (assuming that terms like &quot;outnumber&quot; can be generalized
<br />
to infinite sets, or else that the sets involved are merely large and not
<br />
infinite).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But suppose you just stepped outside the Paris duplicator. Unaware of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment that is being made, your last memory is sitting in front of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer, reading this email. Suddenly, you see the Eiffel Tower. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would surely be a psychological experience that we don't have too often.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And since there are infinite copies of yourself at any given moment, if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should expect to be any of them at the next moment, you shouldn't expect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to ever feel the continuous experience you do.
</em><br />
<br />Rather, you should expect to feel both, with some probability.  And I
<br />
think that the multiverse holds a greater proportion of continuations
<br />
that are continuous than that are discontinuous.  Fundamentally this
<br />
is because the conditions that promote consciousness and therefore the
<br />
formation of brains like mine will tend to involve continuous chains
<br />
of experience.  Only in a relatively few universes will I be subject to
<br />
unknowing duplications.  Therefore I think it is highly unlikely but not
<br />
impossible that I will suddenly experience a discontinuity.
<br />
<br />Let us suppose, though, that our society evolves to a state where such
<br />
duplications are routine.  Anyone may have their brain scanned at any
<br />
time, without their knowledge, and new copies of them created.  Suppose I
<br />
am such a copy, in fact, I am a 10th generation copy; that is, 10 times
<br />
in my life I have found myself having an experience similar to what you
<br />
described, a discontinuity where I was just walking along or sitting
<br />
there, and suddenly found myself stepping out of a duplicating machine
<br />
because someone copied me.
<br />
<br />I think you will agree that my memories are reasonable; that is, that
<br />
anyone who has gone through such an experierence as I describe will in
<br />
fact remember these discontinuities.
<br />
<br />Given my history, wouldn't it be reasonable for me to expect, at any
<br />
future moment, to possibly face another such discontinuity?  It has
<br />
happened many times before, both to me and to other people that I know;
<br />
it is an often-discussed phenomenon of the world, in this scenario.
<br />
Just like anything else that happens occasionally to everyone, it would
<br />
be perfectly reasonable and rational to have an expectation that it
<br />
might happen to you.
