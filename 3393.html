<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Free will is also relativistic. A consciousness gives the impression of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; having free will if its behavior is unpredicatble (ineffable -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; unprovable) BY THE OBSERVER. The self gives the impression to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; OBSERVING SELF of having free will because the self cannot predict what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; its own behavior will be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are two ways of observing free will: free will in others and free
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will in self.
</em><br />
<br />Is this view issued from an already established context? These ideas of free
<br />
will
<br />
seem to rely on the assumption of cause, effect, and time.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's first discuss free will in others. It is obvious that if someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else's behavior is so clear and so totally predictable that it appears
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the observer to be following a &quot;program&quot; then the person has no free
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will. In the limit, consider the case of a programmer (the observer)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observing the behavior of a program he has just written. Assuming that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the observer is an intelligent programmer and knows what is is doing,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then the program is an &quot;open book&quot; to him. The program obiously has no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; free will.
</em><br />
<br />Or the program is the one with free will, and the observer is the one without
<br />
it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may be the case however, that the programmer is programming a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complex program or even a neural net and that there is no simple logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; links between the program steps (a neural nets has no program steps).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The program may then do things which are unexpected to the programmer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At that point the programmer may think that the program has free will.
</em><br />
<br />Again I assert that one could view animation in this (physical) observation
<br />
frame as an illusion. One could assume all possible states of the neural net
<br />
already exist. What might be called consciousness, is simply an entity that
<br />
walks this possibility or expression space to find expression in the physical
<br />
frame.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Free will stems from perceived indeterminacy in the behavior of a person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or a program. This indeterminacy could either be physical in nature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (quantics) or mathematical (Godelian). I believe that both physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeterminacy and mathematical indeterminacy will eventually be proven
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be identical. Bruno Marchal may be on his way to doing this. I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that Godel ndeterminacy could be made relativistic: it could depend on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the axiomatic system used, with an arbitrary number of systems rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the only two systems suggested by Bruno: G and G*. Unfortunately I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am not a good enough mathematician to carry out this task.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now let's look at observing free will in the self. Do we perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ourselves to be indeterminate in our behavior? Absolutely sometimes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When the decision is clear then free will is really not an issue. Free
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will becomes important when the decision factors are close to being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evenly split. In those cases, before a decision is made, there is no way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to know what this decision will be unless one makes the decision. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone asked you why did you choose this, you wouldn't be able to say.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is free will.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; George
</em><br />
<br />One could say that all apparent threads of expression already happened,
<br />
and that it is our limited observation powers that make it appear as though
<br />
sequential decision making is the true expression of awareness.
<br />
It might be that the expression of will for an individual took place as one
<br />
thought in a timeless realm such that the decision or assertion of free
<br />
will encompassed the entire apparent sequential thread in the physical
<br />
context.
<br />
<br />One way to look at this would be to imagine a dna strand wrapped up
<br />
in a gene. The strand is first coiled, then that coil is coiled, and so on. I
<br />
don't recall how many times coils are made to form coils in a gene.
<br />
Now imagine that our physical expression looks like a straight line. Take
<br />
that line or thread and coil it. Now, from one observer's viewpoint, he's
<br />
going in a straight line through time. If one was to modify his consciousness,
<br />
<br />he could step outside the line and see what he had been perceiving as a coil.
<br />
He can now traverse the coil itself like a straight line. Now imagine the
<br />
process
<br />
repeated again, the coil is used to form another coil. The observer could step
<br />
<br />back still further and see this new composite coil as his linear expression.
<br />
<br />Another analogy might be one were you have characters in a movie, people
<br />
watching the  movie, and people making a movie. The characters in the movie
<br />
have no idea that their course has been set outside their observation space.
<br />
The people in the theater watching the movie realize that the course of
<br />
expression
<br />
for the characters in the movie is set, but have no control over the course
<br />
either.
<br />
The people making the movie have full control and observation powers. They
<br />
are the characters, they are the observers, and they are the creators of the
<br />
course of expression or movie.
<br />
<br />I assert that free will has more to do with navigating this space of
<br />
perception
<br />
and picking which movie you'll watch rather than what is expressed by any
<br />
character in the movie.
