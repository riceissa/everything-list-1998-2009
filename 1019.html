<br />
I have read Hans Moravec's thoughts on the &quot;Humongous Look Up Table&quot;
<br />
in the past and so I thought I would step in and offer my interpretation
<br />
in the hopes of forestalling misunderstandings.
<br />
<br />The HLUT is a way of passing the Turing test which many people consider
<br />
unlikely to be conscious.  Hans disagrees that the HLUT is any less
<br />
conscious than an ordinary Turing test passing program.
<br />
<br />The HLUT consists of a table which has a response to all possible
<br />
conversations.  In database terms it is indexed by a conversation-so-far,
<br />
and its value is the response which would be given at that point in the
<br />
conversation.
<br />
<br />For example, one entry in the table consists of:
<br />
<br />Index:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hello, my name is Martha.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hello, Martha, I am wondering if you are conscious.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I wonder that myself sometimes!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, are you?&quot;
<br />
<br />Response:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As far as I can tell, I am!&quot;
<br />
<br />Every possible conversation is included in the HLUT, which is what makes
<br />
it &quot;humongous&quot; (slang for very large).  Once the HLUT is constructed, it
<br />
can pass the Turing test.  Every time you ask it a question, it gets
<br />
added to the record of the conversation-so-far.  For its response, it
<br />
simply looks through the table to find a matching index value for the
<br />
current conversation-so-far, then issues the corresponding response.
<br />
Since all possible conversations-so-far are included in the table,
<br />
it can always come up with a response.
<br />
<br />One way to construct the HLUT is by constructing a conscious program and
<br />
then querying it with all possible conversations.  This would take a
<br />
&quot;humongous&quot; amount of time, but that's OK.  In practice you can restrict
<br />
yourself to conversations which last no more than 100 years, so the size
<br />
of the table is finite.
<br />
<br />It seems clear that you need a conscious program (or perhaps person) to
<br />
construct the HLUT, but the question arises as to whether the HLUT is
<br />
conscious after it has been created, at the time it is used to pass the
<br />
Turing test.  The workings of the HLUT program are incredibly simple,
<br />
just appending questions and comments to a memory buffer, and looking
<br />
through the table to find a match.  It is hard to understand how such a
<br />
simple program could be conscious.
<br />
<br />Hans Moravec argues that the HLUT program is as conscious as the original
<br />
computer program which was used to create it.  In fact, he suggests that
<br />
the two programs are isomorphic, in the sense that there is a mapping
<br />
from one to the other.  Obviously there is a mapping from the original
<br />
program to the HLUT, since that is how I proposed to create the HLUT.
<br />
Hans suggests that there is a mapping in the other direction as well,
<br />
that is that given the HLUT, you could reconstruct the original program
<br />
which created it.  There is so much information in the HLUT, it is so
<br />
humongous, that it should be possible to deduce all the details of the
<br />
conscious program which could have created it.  Hence there are mappings
<br />
in both directions, what is called in mathematics an isomorphism.
<br />
<br />Despite the fact that both programs look very different, Hans suggests
<br />
that they are, in essence, the same.  One has a complex program and
<br />
simple data structures, the other has a complex data structure and a
<br />
simple program.  But the essence of the calculation done by each is the
<br />
same, as demonstrated by the existence of the isomorphism.
<br />
<br />My view is that it is possible that the isomorphism exists, but I am
<br />
not convinced that it is guaranteed to exist.  Much information is not
<br />
recorded in the HLUT - emotional states, alternate answers which were
<br />
considered and then rejected, etc.  People have been known to keep
<br />
secrets their entire lives.  Is it guaranteed that every private thought
<br />
of the original conscious program can be deduced by looking at its
<br />
responses to all possible conversations?  Maybe there are some programs
<br />
so closemouthed that no conversation could cause them to reveal their
<br />
secrets.  In that case I don't see how any amount of study of the HLUT
<br />
could reveal the full structure of the original program.
<br />
