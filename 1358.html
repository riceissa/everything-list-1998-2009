----- Original Message -----

From: Russell Standish &lt;R.Standish.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree, that if you restrict your attention to wffs only, then there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no problem. It is also no surprise. However, I don't believe one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can solve the White Rabbit problem by defining it away.
</em><br />
<br />It is most certainly NOT just being 'defined away'.
<br />
<br />The whole point is that we are confining ourselves to *logically consistent*
<br />
universes (and perhaps other entities), that is, universes with some kind of
<br />
logical structure. The only assumption in my analysis is that these must be
<br />
definable with some kind of formal system (I don't even assume that it would
<br />
be contained within fig 1 of Tegmark's table). A non-wff is just a
<br />
meaningless string of symbols - we can't even *consider* any logically
<br />
consistent universe without at least a wff-string. Once we have the
<br />
wff-string, then we can start to build towards defining logically consistent
<br />
universes (via axiom sets, *consistent* theories, metric spaces (probably),
<br />
and so on). It is *then* that the analysis of axioms comes into play (see my
<br />
original post), and flying rabbits are banished to a very small minority of
<br />
universes.
<br />
<br />There is no 'defining away' of the white rabbit problem. It sounds to me as
<br />
if you are confusing white rabbit universes with logically inconsistent
<br />
universes (the latter should not be able to exist in anyone's book). Perhaps
<br />
if I add some comments to an earlier post of yours, it may help to clarify
<br />
the wider issue, but remember that what follows below is mainly based on our
<br />
earlier scheme and not the same as one described at the start of this
<br />
thread.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think anyone said they don't exist. Its the measure of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds that contain that is interesting. There are two possibilities:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a) The dragon universe is the outcome of a mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description. In the sense we use dragon here of being non-lawlike, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may suppose that they are the outcome of a very complex mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description. As we well know, the measure of such universes is much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; smaller than the very lawlike universe we inhabit.
</em><br />
<br />We don't know this unless we can find a proof. In fact the analysis that we
<br />
developed earlier can provide a strong indication of the small measure of
<br />
dragon universes. (See my web pages.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; b) The dragon universe corresponds to one of the &quot;nonsense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bitstrings&quot;, which we know to vastly outnumber the lawlike ones. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this case, we must apply the argument I worked out with Alistair
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Malcolm to show that indeed these dragon universes are of small
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure compared with lawlike universes, and that the remaining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;nonsense&quot; universes are like noise - unobservable.
</em><br />
<br />If the bits are interpretable as anything, they would normally be
<br />
interpretable mathematically (or at least as part of some formal system,
<br />
otherwise we would be ranging beyond the formality of information theory
<br />
itself), in which case what they represent will be coherent, but not in
<br />
general visible to us (usually because what is represented will be in
<br />
another universe) - again the general argument we derived holds as required
<br />
for their small measure. For totally nonsense bitstings, or for any parts of
<br />
bitstrings which are non-interpretable - these are ontologically
<br />
problematical (as are non-wffs); I think that we have to remember that we
<br />
are just trying to find generic schemes that can subsume all logically
<br />
possible universes - the particular set of building blocks used to ground
<br />
each scheme ought not to affect the relative measures of various types of
<br />
universes. Neither non-wffs nor non-interpretable bits can represent
<br />
anything, and to include them in any analysis is giving them unwarranted
<br />
ontological credibility. Fortunately neither are required to ascribe low
<br />
measure to dragon universes.
<br />
