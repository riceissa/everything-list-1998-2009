<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Le 31-déc.-06, à 04:59, Stathis Papaioannou a écrit (to Tom Caylor):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course: questions of personal meaning are not scientific 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; questions. &gt; Physics may show you how to build a nuclear bomb, but it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; won't tell &gt; you whether you should use it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But Physics, per se,  is not supposed to answer this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Socio-economics could give light, as could &quot;computer simulation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nuclear explosion in cities ...&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And some (still putative) theory of ethics could perhaps put light on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that question too. Well, the ultimate decision is a problem for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;president&quot; .... But the president and its advisers could consult 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some decision theory ... perhaps.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, those theories won't answer the question of whether you should use 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the bomb either. Suppose your theory says something like, &quot;if you wish 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to save a lives by taking b lives, where a&gt;b, then you should use the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bomb&quot;. The scientific part of this theory involves demonstrating that, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in fact, use of the bomb would save a lives by taking b lives. But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this does not tell you whether you should actually use the bomb. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Neither would an ethical theory like utilitarianism tell you what to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do: it might confirm that according to the theory it is the right 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing to do, but utilitarianism cannot tell you that utilitarianism is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;right&quot;. In the end, what is &quot;right&quot; is an irreducible personal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief, which you can try to change by appeal to emotions or by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, but not by appeal to logic or empirical facts. And in fact I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feel much safer that way: if someone honestly believed that he knew 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what was &quot;right&quot; as surely as he knew 2+2=4, he would be a very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dangerous person. Religious fanatics are not dangerous because they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want to do evil, but because they want to do good. The number of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people killed in the name of God vastly outnumbers the number killed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the name of Satan.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I completely agree with you. I have just interpret your &quot;should&quot; not as 
<br />
a ethical &quot;should&quot; but as one relative to an ethical decision already 
<br />
done (by the human, mister president or whatever).
<br />
I think you knew we do agree on this. It is what I sum up saying that 
<br />
there is no normative theory of ethics. A theory of ethics have to be a 
<br />
sort of meta-theory.
<br />
I guess I was unclear.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Where I think I disagree with you [Tom] is that you seem to want to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; reduce the irreducible and make values and personal meaning real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; world &gt; objects, albeit not of the kind that can be detected by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scientific &gt; instruments, perhaps issued by God. But in proposing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this you are &gt; swapping one irreducible entity extremely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; well-grounded in empirical &gt; evidence (I know I'm conscious, and I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; know that when my brain stops so &gt; does my consciousness) for another 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; irreducible entity with no &gt; grounding in empirical evidence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whatsoever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree that you know you are conscious. Well, I don't know that but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I have good evidences and hope. But I don't see any evidence that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; when your brain stops so does your consciousness. I can understand 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the belief (not even knowledge) that when your brain stops relatively 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to mine (in case we share an history), then so does the possibility 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of your consciousness to manifest itself relatively to me; but no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Actually what does mean the expression &quot;my brain stops&quot;. In all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe? all multiverses, all computational histories ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You have to be precise which theory you are using when relating some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 3-me (like &quot;my brain&quot;) and some 1-me (like the knower, the conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;I&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree with some critics you make with respect to Tom Caylor notion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of personal God, but sometimes, it seems to me, you have a conception 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of reality which could as criticable as Caylor's one.  Err... i see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your particular point is valid though, but you are using misleading 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; images with respect to the consequence of mechanism (I guess you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; aware but that you want to remain short perhaps).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It gets cumbersome to qualify everything with &quot;given the appearance of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a physical world&quot;. As I have said before, I am not entirely convinced 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that comp is true,
</em><br />
<br />Nor am I. (Remind that no machine can, from its first person point of 
<br />
view, be &quot;entirely convinced&quot; that comp is true. Comp is an axiom for a 
<br />
theory, and the beauty of it is that comp can explain why it has to be 
<br />
a guess. The &quot;yes doctor&quot; has to be an act of faith. It is 
<br />
(meta?)-theological.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; precisely because because such ideas as a conscious computation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervening on any physical process
</em><br />
<br /><br />This does not follow at all. We have already have some discussion about 
<br />
this and since then I have a more clear-cut argument. Unfortunately the 
<br />
argument is based on some result in mathematical logic concerning the 
<br />
distinction between real numbers and integers. We can come back on this 
<br />
in another thread. For a logician there is a case that  &quot;real number&quot; 
<br />
are a simplification of the notion of natural number. An identical 
<br />
polynomial equation can be turing universal when the variables are 
<br />
conceived to belong to the integers, but is never turing universal when 
<br />
the variables belong to the reals. Well, a case can be made that the 
<br />
vacuum
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or on no physical process may be considered absurd.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This would be fair enough in case the idea that consciousness 
<br />
supervenes on physical processes was not absurd in the first place. In 
<br />
all your post you do assume comp. For comp to be false you have to 
<br />
assume actual physical infinities and give a reason why consciousness 
<br />
supervenes on that. But in some reasoning it seems clear to me you talk 
<br />
life if comp is true, when referring to the functional role of 
<br />
neurotransmitters, the fact that slight change in the brain are 
<br />
permitted, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is quite possible, for example, that there is something special 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the structure of the brain which leads to consciousness, and a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digital computer will not be able to copy this, even if it copies 3rd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person observable behaviour. Against that idea is the question of why 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we didn't evolve to be zombies, but maybe we would have if nature had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electronic circuits to play with.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are saying that zombie are possible if comp is false. I can agree. 
<br />
Actually I believe that comp entails the existence of a notion of local 
<br />
zombie (which can make you believe that they are conscious during a 
<br />
time).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I had to guess between comp and not-comp I don't think I could do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better than flipping a coin.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Comp is my working hypothesis, and I tend to consider that arguing for 
<br />
or against comp is a bit of a waste of time (especially given that comp 
<br />
is undecidable for machines).
<br />
Still I am astonished that you would flip a coin on that matter. Comp 
<br />
is just the statement that &quot;I&quot; am turing emulable at some level. Even 
<br />
if we have to emulate the quantum state of the entire galaxy (some 
<br />
&quot;generalized brain&quot;) comp remain true unless we have both:
<br />
- my brain = the &quot;complete physical&quot; description of the galaxy
<br />
- the &quot;object&quot; galaxy is not turing emulable
<br />
Now comp predicts the existence of &quot;appearance of physical things which 
<br />
are not turing emulable&quot; (confirmed by the existence of quantum 
<br />
flipping). But attaching consciousness to that non turing emulable part 
<br />
leads nowhere. That is why Penrose is forced to put quantum mechanics 
<br />
and relativity in doubt when he wants to keep both materialism and a 
<br />
physicalist theory of mind.
<br />
<br />Personally I don't think more incredible to believe that consciousness 
<br />
supervenes on a physical brain, a block universe, or on collections of 
<br />
relations between numbers. Actually I think consciousness is 
<br />
immaterial, so that I find harder to attach it to something physical 
<br />
(dualisme). And then physics just provides relation between numbers. 
<br />
&quot;matter&quot; is a useful fiction for animals survival, an oversimplified 
<br />
view of an average on the set of our most accessible neighborhoods.
<br />
<br />Matter is like the wave packet reduction in QM, except that &quot;nature&quot; 
<br />
has programmed us with such a &quot;simplified theory&quot; since a long time, 
<br />
but we must, as scientist digging on fundamental questions, remind us 
<br />
that there is no evidence (at all) that Matter (primary matter) exist. 
<br />
On the contrary, we do have (even if first personal) strong clues that 
<br />
consciousness, persons, machines, and numbers exist, even in some 
<br />
sharable sense.
<br />
<br />Modern &quot;pure science&quot; (as opposed to engineering) has begun with the 
<br />
idea that what we see and measure could be the shadow of the shadow of 
<br />
the shadow of something which *perhaps* is. And to be short (and 
<br />
provocative) I would say that &quot;pure science&quot; has stopped when Aristotle 
<br />
successfully (thanks to the Christians mainly) did come back with the 
<br />
&quot;demagogical&quot; idea that, after all, what exist is what we see ...
<br />
<br />(All this is not related to ethics, but belong to some &quot;ontic&quot; thread).
