Le 05-déc.-07, à 23:08, Mirek Dobsicek a écrit :
<br />
<br /><br />&quot;But thanks to that crashing, *Church thesis remains consistent*. I
<br />
would just say &quot;An existence of a universal language is not ruled out&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I am ok with you. Consistent (in math) means basically &quot;not rule out&quot;. 
<br />
&quot;Formally consistent&quot; means &quot;not formally ruled out&quot;, or &quot;not 
<br />
refutable&quot;.
<br />
<br />That is:
<br />
<br />&quot;Consistent(p&quot;) is the same as &quot;~ Provable(~ p)&quot;    &quot; ~&quot; = negation
<br />
<br />like &quot;Provable(p)&quot; is equivalent with &quot;~ Consistent( ~ p)&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Some thoughts:
<br />
Thanks to Godel &quot;completeness&quot; theorem for the first order theory 
<br />
(1930) you can also read consistent(p) by there is a world satisfying p 
<br />
(a world &quot;where&quot; p is true).
<br />
<br />This relates a syntactical notion (the non existence of a chain of 
<br />
formula derived from the axioms by the use of the inference rules and 
<br />
ending with f) with a semantical: the existence of a mathematical 
<br />
structure satisfying the formula.
<br />
<br />At least in the frame of many formal classical theories, it is related 
<br />
to the recurrent modal duality:
<br />
<br /><br />Permitted p &lt;====&gt; ~ Obligatory ~p
<br />
Obligatory p &lt;====&gt; ~ Permitted ~p
<br />
<br />Somewhere p &lt;====&gt; ~ Everywhere ~p
<br />
Everywhere p &lt;====&gt; ~ Somewhere ~p
<br />
<br />Sometimes p &lt;====&gt; ~ Always ~p
<br />
Always p &lt;====&gt; ~ Sometimes ~p
<br />
<br />Like the usual first order quantifiers: (Ax = for all x; Ex = it exists 
<br />
a x)
<br />
<br />Ex F(x) &lt;====&gt; ~ Ax ~ F(x)
<br />
Ax F(x) &lt;====&gt; ~ Ex ~F(x)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(all cats are ferocious  &lt;====&gt; it does not exist a non ferocious cat)
<br />
<br />And with formal provability we have also:
<br />
<br />Consistent p &lt;====&gt; ~ provable ~p
<br />
Provable p &lt;====&gt; ~ consistent ~p
<br />
<br /><br />But yes, it is by allowing the machine to crash, and actually by 
<br />
allowing it to crash in a *necessarily* not always predictible way, 
<br />
which makes it possible to be universal.
<br />
<br />In a nutshell: Universality ==&gt; insecurity ====&gt; kicking back reality
<br />
<br />and then
<br />
(knowledge of your universality) ==&gt; (knowledge of your relative 
<br />
insecurity) ====&gt; (knowledge of a kicking back reality) ===&gt; 
<br />
anticipating an independent &quot;reality&quot;
<br />
<br />(knowledge of your universality)  = lobianity (this I intend to explain 
<br />
later)
<br />
<br /><br />Mirek asked also in trhe same post:
<br />
<br /><br />&lt;&lt;And my last question, consider the profound function
<br />
f such that f(n) = 1 if there is a sequence of n consecutive fives in
<br />
the decimal expansion of PI, and f(n) = 0 otherwise
<br />
Is this an example of a partial computable function?&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;Or is this function
<br />
as such already considered as un-computable function?&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br /><br />It could be uncomputable on some value, that is, everywhere the 
<br />
function has value 1, you can in principle compute it (just search the 
<br />
sequence: if it exists you will find it because PI is constructive). If 
<br />
the value is zero, it could be that you will be able to know it, but it 
<br />
could be that you will never know it ...
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />Something else:
<br />
<br />Mirek, Brent, Barry, Tom (and all those inclined to do a bit of math): 
<br />
don't read what is following unless you don't want to find the crashing 
<br />
combinators by yourself.
<br />
<br />I give the solution for the crashing combinators: it is enough to ... 
<br />
mock a mockingbird.
<br />
<br />Raymond Smullyan calls &quot;mocking bird&quot;  a combinator M such that Mx = xx.
<br />
It is a sort of diagonalisor or duplicator. Now if you apply M on 
<br />
itself, M, that is if you evaluate MM, this matches the left of 
<br />
equation Mx = xx, so MM gives MM gives MM gives MM gives MM ... 
<br />
(crashing!).
<br />
<br />But does M exists? If you recall well,  we know only the existence of K 
<br />
and S, and their descendants: like KK, KS, S(KS), SK(KS)(S(KK)), ...
<br />
<br />(Recall we don't write any left parenthesis, but something like 
<br />
SK(KS)(S(KK)) really abbreviate the result of applying (SK) to (KS) 
<br />
i.e. ((SK)(KS)) on (S(KK)), i.e.
<br />
(((SK)(KS))(S(KK))). each combinator can be thought as a function of 
<br />
one variable (itself varying on the combinators).
<br />
<br />We search a combinator playing the role of M (defined by its behavior 
<br />
Mx = xx).
<br />
<br />We have only K, S, and their combinations. And we have the two axioms 
<br />
giving the behavior of K and S.
<br />
<br />Kxy = x   K axiom
<br />
<br />and
<br />
<br />Sxyz = xz(yz)   S axiom
<br />
<br />Explanation. You can see K as a projector sending (xy) on x, for any y. 
<br />
(imo it is the *subjective* entity per excellence, in particular K 
<br />
discards or eliminate informations like projection does. Church will 
<br />
not allow K or any eliminators in its main systems).
<br />
Functionally K is Lx Ly . x The variable y is abstracted in some 
<br />
irrelevant way.
<br />
<br />We want Mx = xx.
<br />
But xx does not match either x or xz(yz), so that we could use the 
<br />
axioms above directly.
<br />
But imagine we dispose of the subroutine combinators I such that Ix = 
<br />
x. The identity combinators. Then Mx = xx = Ix(Ix), and this does match 
<br />
xz(yz), so that Ix(Ix) is really SIIx (in Sxyz = xz(yz), so SIIx = 
<br />
Ix(Ix) = xx. So SII can play the role of M, it behaves like M. We could 
<br />
define M by SII.
<br />
Let us verify MM = SII(SII) does crash the system:
<br />
<br />SII(SII) = I(SII)(I(SII)) = SII(SII) = I(SII)(I(SII)) = SII(SII) = 
<br />
I(SII)(I(SII)) = SII(SII) = I(SII)(I(SII)) = SII(SII) = ... (crashing).
<br />
<br />Now we have to still find an identity combinator I such that Ix = x.
<br />
<br />Now x does match the right of the first axiom Kxy = x. Except that K on 
<br />
x wait for a second argument. So let us give to it a second argument 
<br />
such that we get something matching the second (S) axiom:
<br />
<br />x = Kx(Kx) = SKKx
<br />
<br />So SKK does the job. So we can take I = SKK.
<br />
So M = SII = S(SKK)(SKK)
<br />
<br />and a crashing expression, sometimes called INFINITY is given by
<br />
<br />MM = SII(SII) = S(SKK)(SKK)(S(SKK)(SKK))
<br />
<br />So, a solution was
<br />
<br />S(SKK)(SKK)(S(SKK)(SKK))
<br />
<br />Remark:
<br />
Note that an existential quantification &quot;ExP(x)&quot; is a sort of 
<br />
projection too. Eventually, the lobian machine observation-act-decision 
<br />
is just that: projection by elimination of worlds (elimination of 
<br />
accessibility of possibilities, a bit like when you get married, of get 
<br />
a job, etc ....).
