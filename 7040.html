<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was working on an essay on the nature of thought experiments about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copying, but it got bogged down, so I will make this short.  I am trying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to analyze it based on evolutionary considerations.  Copying is much like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biological reproduction and we can expect many of the same effects in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a society in which copying is a long-standing and widely used technology.
</em><br />
<br />Given the technology required for copying, it's a wash between Darwin and
<br />
Lamarck.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The most important effect is that making copies will be desirable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just as genes try to reproduce themselves, so will people once that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; becomes possible, and for the same reason: successful reproducers occupy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more of the universe's resources (i.e. have higher measure) and so these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; habits tend to become more widespread.
</em><br />
<br />Definitely. Given the nature of propagation across spacetime, there will be a
<br />
selection for fastest replicators/travellers in the propagation wavefront.
<br />
Convergent evolution there, big time.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When we consider thought experiments involving copies, it is important to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand these effects.  It is truly different to make a set of copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than to experience a probabilistic event.  Making copies increases your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure in the world; flipping a coin does not.  The decisions you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make in the two cases are different as a result.
</em><br />
<br />I am not my copy, after subjective chronon has passed after bifurcation.
<br />
I can only observe my own branch, so does the other copy.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One thought experiment was to consider two choices: flipping a coin and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being tortured if it came up a certain way; versus making several copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and having one of them be tortured.  Assuming the copies are all going to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; survive, clearly the latter would be the one selected by evolution.
</em><br />
<br />I have not fully understood the thinking behind torture/non torture 
<br />
gedanken. If a randomly selected branch gets tortured, I very much do not
<br />
want to become that branch. If there are two scenarios, one with lots of
<br />
branches, and one with far less, and still only one gets tortured, clearly
<br />
the former is preferrable, if a choice has to be made. The probability of me
<br />
being tortured next is lower that way. If all copies but the tortured one are
<br />
synchronized then there are still only two outcomes, and I will be tortured
<br />
with a 0.5 probability.
<br />
<br />So far, everything is obvious. What am I missing?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Copying is such a bonus that it swamps consideration of quality of life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a world where people have adapted to copying, they would work as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hard to make a copy as they would in our world to avoid dying (each one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changes measure by plus or minus 100%).
</em><br />
<br />As copying takes a cost, it's the same old rat race. Furthermore, the same
<br />
technology allows you to keep remote backups, with incremental syncronisation
<br />
and dead-man-switch instantiation. These are not copies, being static images,
<br />
until instantiated.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It might be objected that this approach does not shed much light on what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our expectations would be or should be about what we will experience when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we go through these transformations.  I agree with the perspective that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is truly no &quot;fact of the matter&quot; about what it is like to have one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of these things happen.  All we can really do is look at the experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and memory of each person, at each moment.  No one will disagree about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what each person at each moment remembers and how many of them there are.
</em><br />
<br />Clones are people with the same memory, until bifurcation. Synchronized
<br />
clones are just one person, and can't differentiate in thinking/perception by
<br />
the sync boundary condition.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is really all there is, factually.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our attempt to make these novel situations fit our conventional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expectations don't work because we currently have an implicit assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of mental continuity which is violated by copying experiments.  There
</em><br />
<br />Subjectively, mental continuity is preserved (notice that this is necessarily
<br />
true for meat people, yet we still do not consider them zombies, glossing
<br />
over lacunes). Continuity really doesn't mean much, given Korsakoff patients,
<br />
or confabulated memories.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; really is no meaningful and non-arbitrary way to map our current ways
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of thinking about the future to a world where copying is possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But what we can do is really just as good: we can predict how people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would and should behave.  Which preferences will they have in these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought experiments?  How hard will they work to achieve one option versus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another?  Evolutionary theory provides guidelines and examples we can use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to understand how people will behave if and when copying becomes possible.
</em><br />
<br />If you have to copy, you have to split your possessions. Computational
<br />
substrate isn't free, and it will be a scarce resource, given that copying a
<br />
pattern is far quicker to build the substrate to contain it, even with
<br />
molecular fabrication.
