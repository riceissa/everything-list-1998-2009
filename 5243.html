<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed, you might be able to show that 'the purpose of the ethical

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principles can be shown to be &quot;group success&quot;', although I'm sure that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone will be able to think of exceptions. This is an explanation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why societies have certain ethical principles, and perhaps a method 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for arriving at new ethical principles. However, why should &quot;group 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; success&quot; be a desirable goal? 
</em><br />
<br />I think each form of emergent complex order which is capable of becoming 
<br />
intelligent and forming goals in general contexts
<br />
problably would have by default an ethical principle promoting the 
<br />
continued existence of the most complex (high-level)
<br />
emergent system in its vicinity of which it perceives itself to be a 
<br />
part, and which it perceives to be beneficial to its own survival.
<br />
<br />I can say this because forms of emergent complex order that included 
<br />
SAS's that didn't have this ethic would not survive long
<br />
compared to other emergent complex orders whose SAS's did have this 
<br />
ethic. So we would certainly expect, by natural
<br />
selection, to see more ETHICAL-SAS-containing emergent complex ordered 
<br />
systems than UNETHICAL-SAS-containing
<br />
emergent complex ordered systems, over time or over different trials of 
<br />
life in different places in the universe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What if I said that I took sadistic pleasure in the suffering of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others, and that I wanted to see the group fail rather than succeed, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because I did not like the idea of people being more successful than I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was? In your scientific study of ethics, you would have to add a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; footnote to the effect that some deviant elements in society do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follow the usual principles. You may go on to explore why this is, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what could be done to avoid it, etc. But you would not be able to say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that my deviant views were &quot;wrong&quot; and claim this as scientific 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement. &quot;Deviant&quot; is a description of fact, but &quot;wrong&quot; is a value. 
</em><br />
<br />See above natural-selection explanation. Groups that have &quot;correct&quot; 
<br />
definitions of &quot;wrong&quot; will survive at the expense of those
<br />
groups that do not, given enough time or examples for the statistics to 
<br />
sort out.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is like saying &quot;I like chocolate&quot;: you could explain this in terms 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the physiological effects of glucose, caffeine, theobromine etc., 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but the truth or falsehood of the statement &quot;I like chocolate&quot; is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independent of such considerations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
No it's not independent of that, at least not by causality.
<br />
<br />I would put it:
<br />
1. Chocolate has fat, sugar, salt, all objects of human physiological 
<br />
craving due to our bodies' need  for these substances,
<br />
specially in early stages of our evolution where we were poorer hunters 
<br />
and farmers than now.
<br />
<br />2. Our brains and minds typically compute that we &quot;like&quot; those things 
<br />
that our body craves. &quot;Like&quot; is the concept
<br />
in the minds conceptual space that, with the way we work, maps to, among 
<br />
other things &quot;have physical bodily craving for.&quot;
<br />
<br />3. Therefore the truth of &quot;I like Chocolate&quot; is extremely likely to be 
<br />
caused directly by the truth of
<br />
&quot;my body craves fat,sugar, and salt, for evolutionary self-preservation 
<br />
against starvation reasons.&quot; and the
<br />
conjunction of all three of those &quot;craveables&quot; in one substance seems to 
<br />
drive an almost universal and strong &quot;liking&quot;
<br />
of chocolate by almost every human.
