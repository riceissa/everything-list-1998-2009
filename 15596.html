<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I enjoyed your bilingual blurb 'around' music, as I guess.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is mathematique (numbers?) something like music? a gift one either  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has or not?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Every gene helps, I suppose. I have musicians on both sides of my  
<br />
family, one of whom is a distinguished composer (Alfred Hill 1869-1960)
<br />
<br />I don't believe that talent is the sine qua non of musical fortitude  
<br />
though. Creativity CAN be taught - we don't have to wait for geniuses  
<br />
to come along
<br />
<br />Imagine if the science world actually depended solely on the the  
<br />
Newtons, the Einsteins, the Schroedingers etc. to do the day to day  
<br />
scientific stuff.
<br />
<br />I would say that everybody should have at least a modest degree of  
<br />
scientific understanding or appreciation; the job of education, the  
<br />
business I am in - this would be far more valuable in the long run  
<br />
than pouring billions into funding an academy to find and nurture  
<br />
geniuses (the &quot;Gifted and Talented Syndrome&quot; - if you aren't G &amp; T you  
<br />
can just go rot; so says today's education world)
<br />
<br />Same point holds for music - not every kid who learns to play the  
<br />
violin becomes an Andre Rieu, but anybody with a modest ability on the  
<br />
fiddle will appreciate a certain aspect of music a whole lot better  
<br />
than somebody who never picked up a musical instrument in his life
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; David Bohm said (and I have great esteem for the man) that numbers  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are human creations.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yeah - that would appear to be the 64 cent question. If he's right,  
<br />
some of us here may have been barking up the wrong tree for quite a  
<br />
while
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If Bruno - and his cohorts - state that everything is just numbers -  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integers in long series - (I still don't know if WITH functions  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between them, or just the balnk series?) - I figure it after Bohm  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they found a 'tool' in this human invention to use as the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; otherwise inaccessible 'materialization' of the feeling 'reality' or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call it 'essence of the world' etc., - (materialization meant in a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'higher' sense than the figment (misconcept) of the physicists'  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world of matter/energy(?) in their explanations of accessed and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misunderstood phenomena).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I believe the mathematicalisation of Everything to be one of the most  
<br />
profoundly interesting developments in post-modern thinking. I do not  
<br />
NEED a material universe, except in the sense that without this  
<br />
perfect illusion(?) I might not be in a conscious state at all and  
<br />
therefore incapable of any qualia It excites the intellect and the  
<br />
intuition. It FEELS correct, but then so does going to church and  
<br />
burning incense and reciting catechism for some people.
<br />
<br />Let's just say it's a bit like a headache - you've got one if you  
<br />
think you've got one
<br />
<br />If it turns out that some Brain The Size Of A Planet (BTSOAP) can  
<br />
prove we are the dream of numbers then I am perfectly happy with that  
<br />
thought. Now all we need to work out is what the numbers in fact ARE
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your (and maybe mine) 'materialization' is &quot;music&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thank you for that supremely useful insight John
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do not realize it into tunes but it in a vague sense of &quot;IT&quot; -  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; musical experience is closest, - I figure: as Bruno's 'numbers' -  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and your 'ever existed' Eroica Symphony is just a notion of 'a'  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realization...
</em><br />
<br /><br />True, BUT
<br />
<br />I still hold that the Eroica existed BEFORE Ludwig van gave birth to  
<br />
it!! He merely DISCOVERED it sitting there and wrote it down. It's  
<br />
kind of like Dark Matter. Composing music is often like that; you have  
<br />
the feeling that you are not so much inventing something as  
<br />
discovering something. Suddenly you are being swept into the  
<br />
gravitational field of something you cannot see or touch - only feel.  
<br />
It gains shape only as an aural experience for some bizarre reason  
<br />
that nobody has yet understood
<br />
<br />Note - this is no argument for the existence of a God as some would  
<br />
say (Michaelangelo &quot;seeing&quot; the sculpture in the virgin block of  
<br />
marble etc)
<br />
<br />In the same breath I would say that the Everett no-collapse wave-state  
<br />
was clearly a discovery, not a construct. On the other hand, Niels  
<br />
Bohr and the Copenhagenists confabulated a dodgy, politically correct  
<br />
notion of the observer collapsing the wave function; no explanation,  
<br />
just a &quot;happy ending&quot; to the movie so people wouldn't ask for their  
<br />
twenty bucks back as they left the cinema...
<br />
<br />In music there are lots and lots of dodgy, ad-hoc, derivative,  
<br />
nonsensical essays that are clearly designed to generate market value  
<br />
- NOT communicate something fundamental about reality. Most Rock music  
<br />
(In My Extremely Humble View) is designed to hoodwink the brain in  
<br />
this way. It's all &quot;as if&quot; it were real music but lacks dimensional  
<br />
depth
<br />
<br />Any music designed to be listened to only at MEGA VOLUME is clearly  
<br />
trying to be better than it is. Volume of delivery gives a false  
<br />
importance to crappy musical design.
<br />
<br />Try listening to ACDC or Led Zeppelin at moderate or soft volume.  
<br />
Suddenly it's all smoke and mirrors
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I may use the pronoun: &quot;WE&quot; have a hard time in our 'musical'  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predisposition to switch to numbers, even more so to express what we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feel/think in the 'words' created for a baseless communication in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the superficial average mental activity of humans.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />We do, yes; but the strength of the musician is that music is a  
<br />
language itself. Beyond words, possibly beyond numbers. One enormous  
<br />
advantage that music appears to possess over Math is that you don't  
<br />
need to know how to &quot;read&quot; music to appreciate it. Innumerates like me  
<br />
are forever locked out of the mathematical shovel dance
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When I play I am absorbed, no numbers, no politix
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even no personal malaises - only the music. If my fingers goof a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; passage what I (innerly) heard right, I am desperate.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But - your goofs are just an ALTERNATIVE to what is written on the  
<br />
page in front of you (assuming that is what you were doing)
<br />
<br />Don't imagine the composer got it 100% right!! You may have  
<br />
accidentally discovered a very interesting alternative!
<br />
<br />Respect your goofs, John - the multiverse applies to everything and  
<br />
music is part of the Everything
<br />
<br />In another universe you sat down and played a Mozart piano concerto  
<br />
with the music upside-down and found that it actually works well!!!!!!!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This 'musical comp' IS our reality, not 'understood' or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'explainable' because these terms work only &quot;in words&quot;. Another  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'plane'(religion?) in the human - (sub?)conscious existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are many such 'planes' and it is hard to switch.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is all a bunch of BRAIN STATES ultimately. Brain chemistry. I  
<br />
firmly believe that the people who will finally settle the dust in a  
<br />
lot of this discussion will be the NEUROPLASTICIANS - the brain  
<br />
analysts using their fMRI scanners and understanding of neuro- 
<br />
transmitters and the way in which the (physical?) brain can wire  
<br />
itself and unwire itself in a myriad ways - all the way into advanced  
<br />
old age, if we keep on the learning curve and don't merely try to be  
<br />
&quot;right&quot; about everything all the time.
<br />
<br />&quot;Neurons that fire together wire together&quot;
<br />
<br />If music gives you your emotional thrills then that is because it  
<br />
always did
<br />
<br />If Maths gives you your emotional thrills then that is because it  
<br />
always did
<br />
<br />If Logic gives you your emotional thrills then that is because it  
<br />
always did
<br />
<br />If Science gives you your emotional thrills then that is because it  
<br />
always did
<br />
<br />If Philosophy gives you your emotional thrills then that is because it  
<br />
always did
<br />
<br /><br />etc.
<br />
<br />To supplement all of this, try learning JAPANESE or CHINESE when you  
<br />
hit your 70s and then you will open up a whole new wing of your mind  
<br />
that you never even knew existed
<br />
<br /><br />keep wondering - it's the best tonic of all. There are no mysteries -  
<br />
only perceptual shortcomings

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That nobody can explain reality without using mathematics? But reality

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I could bloodywell understand it I might start to like it! Ain't my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem. It's YOURS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I didn't ask to be born with a desire to understand the fabric of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality. It afflicts me like a DISEASE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The rationalists like the hypotheses and the reasoning,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but few appreciate the conclusion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's because everybody only wants to see his own ideas confirmed by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the reasoning. As Colin Hales says, scientists predict everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; except a scientist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even scientists want to be loved and appreciated, I guess
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Are you really serious?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As serious as any fool ever gets, I suppose. I imagine the attempt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be fun. New advances in neuroplasticity suggest that as we age,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we should attempt to do the SAME things differently, because that way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the neurons stay healthy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some older people haven't learnt a new skill in 50 years. These are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ones who are merely confirming constantly their own conclusions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; under the guise of &quot;doing science&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I could send a post per month, taking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; everything at zero.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's fine. This is perhaps your BIGGEST challenge dear Bruno. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need to take it slowly and ENJOY the challenge my dear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Have you an intuition that consciousness is not material?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course! If we take every score of Beethoven's 3rd symphony and burn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them - if we trash every orchestral recording ever made of it - if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get every conductor and player who could remember parts of it or all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of it and ERASED their memories of it or just murdered them outright
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still believe Beethoven's 3rd symphony STILL exists. You will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doubtless say &quot;in Platonia&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Music IS a bunch of mathematical objects spinning in their own space.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why I cry for some reason when I see Garrett Lisi's E8 thingy. It's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MUSIC goddam it!!!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In case you were not serious, it is ok also.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am UNSERIOUSLY SERIOUS. I am not so &quot;serious&quot; that I have any pre-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceived notions about what I want. When I look in the mirror in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; morning I always say to the guy looking back &quot;Who the fuck are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you????&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I exist in an INFINITUDE OF INSTANTIATIONS IN THE MULTIVERSE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe they are all talking at you now!!!!

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But I like to share, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; others could benefit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is the hallmark of a true teacher, somebody I have only the
