The Day The Earth Stood Still - remake version in cinemas now
<br />
<br /><br />Just saw it - at the very first session at 9.30 AM.
<br />
<br />This film is a whole lot better than the reviews make out and a whole  
<br />
lot better than I expected.
<br />
<br />Keanu Reeves is Keanu as usual and only acts with his left eyebrow,  
<br />
but this works for once, given the part  (I had suspected this would  
<br />
be the case)
<br />
<br />Gort (the fearsome robot) is great but I reckon they didn't make  
<br />
enough of him.
<br />
<br />The ending is a bit trite and perfunctory but its a film that has such  
<br />
a powerful message that it needs to be plonked straight in the  
<br />
audience's lap quickly.
<br />
<br />The music has no chance to add anything to the noisy soundtrack, so  
<br />
Bernard Hermann's reputation is safe. I cannot remember anything about  
<br />
the music and I listened hard
<br />
<br />Some great script moments:
<br />
<br />Keanu Klaatu: &quot;Nothing ever dies. The universe wastes nothing. Things  
<br />
are only ever......transformed.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I tried to reason with you. You treat the Earth the way you treat  
<br />
each other.&quot;
<br />
<br />John Cleese to Klaatu (cameo role as a physicist): &quot;Help us to change!  
<br />
We are at the precipice. At the precipice we can change.&quot;
<br />
<br />Perhaps faced with the ironclad guarantee of our extinction as a  
<br />
species we COULD do it? But we have to be forced to confront it by an  
<br />
intelligence far greater than our own. That's the movie's message.  
<br />
It's a little unfortunate in my view that the process of our  
<br />
extinction - in typical Hollywood fashion - is halted before it has  
<br />
completely run its course, so we get let off the hook and the sun  
<br />
rises again tomorrow on the human race, so it remains a mere  
<br />
conjecture that we can change.
<br />
<br />In the original, the Earth's energy economy is halted for 24 hours as  
<br />
a demonstration of superior force which convinces us we have no other  
<br />
option. Weak.
<br />
<br />In this version, the extinction process is commenced (using matter- 
<br />
eating quantum nano-bugs that self-replicate at an impossibly fast  
<br />
rate, becoming a tornado that whips around the world) and this process  
<br />
looks set to wipe out humans and their structures in a couple of hours  
<br />
at most. Keanu Klaatu - for some unbelievably treacly, sentimental  
<br />
Hollywood non-reason becomes convinced at the last moment that humans  
<br />
may be capable of change after all and calls a halt to the process and  
<br />
goes home in his beaut glowing orb.
<br />
<br />THEN all the power goes off. So we are left with a three-quarters- 
<br />
destroyed civilisation and no energy economy. We are hunter-gatherers  
<br />
once again. Even though it comes across as a bit unconvincing in the  
<br />
movie, the concept is stronger than in the original because rather  
<br />
than leave Gort behind to keep an eye on things after the lights come  
<br />
back on, the lights NEVER come back on, so we don't HAVE the option to  
<br />
misbehave any longer. Strong.
<br />
<br />Take a break from your computer keyboards and get into the fresh air -  
<br />
of a dark cinema!
<br />
<br />cheers,
<br />
