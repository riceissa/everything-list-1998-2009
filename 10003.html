Apologies for being out of touch with the list, I can only dip a toe

in occasionally these days.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a way that can interact with the world containing the substrate of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its implementation. But I think that this idea leads to almost the same

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusion that you reach: it really seems that if any computation can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be mapped to any physical substrate, then that substrate is superfluous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; except in that tiny subset of cases involving well-behaved computers that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can handle counterfactuals and thus interact with their environment,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and we may as well say that every computation exists by virtue of its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; status as a platonic object. I say &quot;almost&quot; because I can't quite see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how to prove it, even though I suspect that it is so.
</em><br />
<br />If we take the next step, though, the real question changes somewhat.
<br />
Let's imagine that what we see as physical objects are actually the
<br />
result of some kind of computational process.  We are living in a virtual
<br />
universe.  Even if you don't believe it, try following the logic for
<br />
a minute.
<br />
<br />In that case, this physical object, this block of marble, is actually
<br />
a computational process.  But if we continue to believe that the
<br />
complex &quot;physical&quot; system implements every computation, then what we
<br />
are really saying is that a complex &quot;computational&quot; system implements
<br />
every computation - because the complex physical system is actually
<br />
(or at least, hypothetically could be) a manifestation of a computation.
<br />
<br />So we should really reword Stathis claim.  Instead of &quot;any sufficiently
<br />
complex physical system implements any finite computation&quot;, it must be,
<br />
&quot;any sufficiently complex computation implements any finite computation&quot;.
<br />
And IMO that is a rather more interesting claim, and perhaps more amenable
<br />
to analysis since it stays within the realm of mathematics and logic,
<br />
rather than crossing boundaries between the physical and the ideal.
<br />
<br /><br />Indeed, it is not inherently surprising or implausible that a computation
<br />
can be said to implement more than one computation.  If we think of
<br />
a computation as a sequence of logical steps A, B, C, ... Z, then it
<br />
automatically can be said to also implement every subsequence of those
<br />
steps: for example, &quot;J, K, L&quot; is implemented by that sequence, as is
<br />
&quot;O, P, Q, R, S, T&quot;.
<br />
<br />It might also be that computation A could be embedded in computation B in
<br />
a more subtle way.  We could, for example, interleave the computations
<br />
of A and B, doing A's operations on the odd-numbered steps and doing
<br />
B's operations on the even-numbered ones.
<br />
<br />With Stathis' &quot;sufficiently complex&quot; computations, we could imagine that
<br />
the computation is so long and so messy and confusing that, with enough
<br />
work, we could indeed hope to find virtually any smaller computation
<br />
embedded within this complexity.
<br />
<br />On the other hand it clearly won't do to say that every computation
<br />
implements every other.  The identity computation F(x) = x does not
<br />
implement a master-level chess playing program.  So there must be a
<br />
threshold of complexity before we could start making this kind of claim.
<br />
<br />This raises the question of whether there is an objective fact about
<br />
whether computation A implements computation B.  And should it count if
<br />
A merely comes &quot;close&quot; to implementing B?
<br />
<br />There is a paradox due to Putman which argues that even a counting program
<br />
&quot;loop: x = x + 1; goto loop;&quot; will implement every program.  Going back
<br />
to my first example of some program that goes through 26 steps or states
<br />
A through Z, we can identify the initial state of the counting program
<br />
x=1 with state A; we identify x=2 with state B, and so on up through
<br />
x=26 which is state Z.  So our counting program can be said, in a sense,
<br />
to implement our A-Z program, if we interpret it the right way.
<br />
<br />Then there are various responses to this, and counter-arguments as well,
<br />
which I won't get into.  IMO there is a gray area where it is hard to
<br />
say whether A truly implements B or if the correspondence is in the mind
<br />
of the beholder.
<br />
<br /><br />The relevance to our issues is when we start talking about measures over
<br />
computer programs and computations, and relating them to first-person
<br />
experiences, it's necessary to consider whether it is meaningful to
<br />
say what a given computation is doing.  If every sufficiently complex
<br />
computation implements every other, then that contradicts any reasoning
<br />
based on the differences between different computations.  So I think it
<br />
is an important issue to get right and to be clear about.
