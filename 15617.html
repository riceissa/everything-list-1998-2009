</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you mean randomness, not chaos.  Chaos theory deals with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deterministic systems that vary widely in result based on small
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; changes in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; initial starting conditions; these systems are 100% predictable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't believe in randomness. &quot;Random&quot; means we don't understand what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; determines it. Like &quot;Junk DNA&quot;; it's only junk up until we work out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; what it's really for.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; You can predict with 100% accuracy that systems with varying initial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; conditions will bifurcate and become chaotic once driven beyond a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; certain point. What you cannot say is what is determining the order  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the chaos once it arrives. That's closer to what I mean.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 men start to dig a hole. They are instructed to make it reach a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; depth of 5 feet. One of them murders the other with his shovel.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Nobody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; predicted that would happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;       
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; How do you know that?  Maybe it was quite predictable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Except nobody did predict it. That's my point. It was perfectly  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obvious why only after the event. Police checks, medical checks etc.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; revealed the pattern that pointed to the causation. Before the event,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this information was available too. Nobody saw anything tending or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pending in the information beforehand.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<br />Some people saw it.  For example W saw a report titled &quot;Bin Laden to 
<br />
strike in U.S.&quot;  An FBI agent was told that some middle eastern guy was 
<br />
taking lessons in flying an airliner but wasn't interested in learning 
<br />
to land it.  I'd say that in this case the difficulty is that while the 
<br />
relevant information was available, so was irrelevant information and 
<br />
the irrelevant information was so much greater it swamped the relevant.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schoolteachers have to do &quot;Risk assessments&quot; to evaluate the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility of harm to students on excursion. Studies have shown that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; risk assessments do nothing to reduce the incidence of accidents or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misadventure. 
</em><br />
Of course predictions an analyses, however accurate, are useless if no 
<br />
one acts on them.  If the schoolteacher notes that sunburn is a likely 
<br />
hazard but she doesn't bring any sunblock is it an accident?  I'm very 
<br />
familiar with risk assessments and how worthless they are. I work at a 
<br />
major missile test range where risk assessments are required for every 
<br />
test.  The main reason they are worthless is that they *necessarily* 
<br />
include only risks we've thought of.  Any risk we've thought of has 
<br />
already been the object of efforts to reduce it's probability to a very 
<br />
low level, typically 0.001.  Of course the probability there is some 
<br />
risk we haven't thought of is greater than 0.001 - so it's almost always 
<br />
the risk we hadn't thought of that bites us.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Accidents simply happen. Accidents are still determined  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by something. We call it an accident only because we have no way  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before it happens of knowing that the cotter pin in the driving arm  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was about to shear off leaving the train without an effective brake  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system. Once the plane crashes, the black box reveals most of what we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wish we had known beforehand.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is TIME - the sequence of the arrival of information  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determines how we look at it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<br />The problem is also TIME as in the man hours it takes to know about 
<br />
things.  We have a way to knowing whether that cotter pin was about to 
<br />
shear off - but it's expensive and time consuming to implement; so we 
<br />
don't go around x-raying cotter pins for micro-cracks.  We may require 
<br />
replacing the periodically, but that can be expensive to.  So a some 
<br />
level we decide things are *good enough*.  For example, do you know how 
<br />
many people were killed in accidents, hijackings, and terrorist events 
<br />
on U.S. airlines and airliners flying in U.S. airspace between Nov 2001 
<br />
and Oct 2005?   The answer is zero.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; We can 'determine' the reasons for this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; event only AFTER it happens, even though it was determined by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; something that we might have noticed prior to the event if only we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; been able to. All action can be seen as logically determined in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have. I am clearly speaking about the macro world where time travels  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (apparently) in one direction only and there is this tendency for an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; action to be followed by an effect or another action. 'Action' in this  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context refers mainly to the activity of conscious agents, humans. It  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may yet be shown that protons and quarks have 'agency' but that is not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really at issue here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<br />It may also be that random atomic events may be amplified by chaotic 
<br />
dynamics, in the weather or in brains, to have macro consequences.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  And how can you know the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; causes seen in hindsight are correct.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not causes - merely that there existed a logical pattern of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connections that led from A through to D that we were blind to at the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time. If, in hindsight we do not spot the logical connections then we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have no way of understanding the event at all. I guess there may well  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be examples of that, too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
The &quot;logical pattern&quot; may just be our rationalization of what happened.  
<br />
Humans are good a seeing patterns in activities and also in clouds.  
<br />
Hitler, in his bunker a few days before he killed himself, complained to 
<br />
Speer, &quot;You know, Albert. This is all the Jews' fault. They deliberately 
<br />
started this war just so they could destroy the German people.&quot;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In what sense do we know why the terrorists flew planes in the WTC?

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because everything we already knew about them before the event was  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still available to us after the event. After the event, everyone could  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see the powerful pattern in the data that they were blind to before  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the event. In a sense we knew this COULD happen. We simply could not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predict that they would make the decision to act on what everybody  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (intelligence agancies, CIA etc.) already were aware of.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
None of that answers the &quot;why&quot; question.  What motivated them?  Did they 
<br />
&quot;hate our freedom&quot;?  Or did they act out of revenge for something we did 
<br />
or the imagined we did? 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Before something happens is where we would like to be more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; on top of things. Intelligence exists on terrorism but usually this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; usually fails to determine our actions to prevent terrorist acts,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; interestingly enough. If you look closely at what I am saying, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the rather messy human consciousness part of the equation that SPOILS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the mathematical modelling in most cases.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;       
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Sure.  Humans and even most animals are extremely complicated.  Even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; things like weather and viscous flow over an aircraft are to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; complicated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to model except approximately over a limited range.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I am saying that a full
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; perceptual scan of the situation often takes us way beyond what the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; data suggests. Just like the Mumbai massacre - intelligence WAS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; available that suggested it could happen. Yet the massacre was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;allowed&quot; to happen, because nobody could see the looming pattern in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the data until after it happened by which time it was bleeding  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to one and all. It seems that in many situations the sheer volume of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; information available is as much a part of the problem as the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; decision-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; making process. 
</em><br />
Right.  The &quot;obvious&quot; pattern is picked out in hindsight and some 
<br />
&quot;obvious&quot; pattern would have been picked out in hindsight no matter what 
<br />
had happened.  I don't see how lateral thinking is going to do anything 
<br />
to solve the problem of too much data.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; How do we decide? Data alone are incapable of making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; decisions. You still need a wet, messy human brain with a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; perceptually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; skilled mind to do that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;       
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And apparently that doesn't work all that well either.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No it doesn't, if we only feed information and data into computers and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expect the computer to do our thinking for us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
That's a strawman.  Nobody was feeding data to a computer and expecting 
<br />
it to anticipate the 9/11 or Mumbai attacks. Those oversights were made 
<br />
by wet, messy human brains.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;       
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Isn't this kind of like an act of  faith?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;           
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No.  Faith isn't based on evidence.  When we use math to model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; things in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reality, we do so empirically.  If a distribution doesn't fit after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; testing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it, we don't use it to model that set of data, for example.  How we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use math
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; functionally is different from math itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, but correlations occur between sets of data and there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; tendency for them to look like causations. Most scientists and data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; collectors are trained to say &quot;correlations do not necessarily imply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; causations&quot; which is great advice up until the correlation turns out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to BE a causation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;       
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You just seem to on a rant against everyone who thinks, calculates,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; predicts, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No - I am arguing for a different style of thinking, calculating,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predicting. I am arguing for more of what I have called &quot;Creative  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking&quot; (Lateral thinking). Please go back and read my original post  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Creativity is not a matter of whether a particular idea is right or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong. Creativity is not a matter of finding the best way of putting  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain things together. Creativity is a matter of trying to get at  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what has been left out of the original way of looking at the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situation. 
</em><br />
But you don't know that anything significant has been left out until you 
<br />
are surprised by events.  There's nothing creative in just pointing to 
<br />
things that have been left out - there are always an infinite number of 
<br />
things that are left out.  In calculating flow over an aircraft I can 
<br />
leave out ionization of the air because it's not going to fly Mach 7.  I 
<br />
can leave out the gravitational pull of the Moon because it's too weak.  
<br />
Are there other things I've left out?  Sure.  The question is are they 
<br />
significant.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One can never get at this simply by judging the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effectiveness of a particular way of looking at the situation. All of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our mathematical formalities of calculating and predicting things are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; marvellous, wonderful and highly effective methods. I would be a fool  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to suggest otherwise. I in no sense advocate that we get rid of them.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suggest though, that we supplement them with creative thinking  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because this allows us to avoid or at best sidestep the traps of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purely logical, vertical thinking. It is not a question of stopping  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doing something we are already doing. It is not a question of changing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something we are already doing. It is a question of starting to do  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something we are not yet doing - or doing at best, only half-heartedly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<br />Maybe you do it half-heartedly, the test engineers I know make a career 
<br />
of it.  Nothing makes them happier than to discover a potential problem 
<br />
nobody else thought of.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;       
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If we could perfectly model where things are heading then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; please tell me why all the BTSOAPs of the dismal science of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; economics world could not arrange a more stable financial future  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; us than the one we are currently moving into?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;           
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem with (for example) economic forecasts is not that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mathematics is flawed; the math is fine.  It's the data collection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; flawed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I would say that it is the premises - the starting assumptions that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; are probably flawed, not the collection method, unless by collection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; method we include the starting assumptions which are unavoidably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; guiding the triage of the data.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;       
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It depends on the problem.  Calculating the flow over an aircraft  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hard because of data collection, it's hard because there are no closed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; form solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations and because the airplane
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; has a complex shape. Calculations about what humans will do is hard  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because knowing what's in their brains is hard and because there are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; good models
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So it appears then that we are in perfect agreement. Don't try and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MINIMISE the problem, Brent! The &quot;wet, messy, human brain/mind  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem&quot; is THE problem!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<br />A few paragraphs above, it was the solution: &quot;You still need a wet, 
<br />
messy human brain with a perceptually skilled mind to do that.&quot; and 
<br />
computers and calculation was the problem.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; The biggest flawed assumption of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; is the belief that data collection of itself will give rise to ideas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and concepts. Data do not do that. We choose our starting points and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; assumptions in all cases. Often we aren't even aware of these because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; - well, they are assumptions and nobody really questions assumptions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; much.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;       
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; On what planet?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am saying that on the whole (not always) people skate past their  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptions - in business, in politics, in religion, in education, in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a hundred thousand human endeavours. Maybe not so much in science and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; math and philosophy - which is why I think this list is one of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better audiences for what I am saying.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<br />Sure.  That's why anything an engineer designs is checked and tested by 
<br />
other engineers.  That's why scientists review other scientists papers 
<br />
and try to replicate their experiments.  People generally have trouble 
<br />
seeing their own mistakes - ever proof read something you've written and 
<br />
then thinking you've caught all the errors give it to somebody else to 
<br />
proofread?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our way of looking at the data is not itself present in any way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; in the data. I'm saying that if reality conforms to our model of it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; then the danger is we are looking at only a part of the situation.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; issue in question is the WHOLE situation, not just that part we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; CHOOSE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to look at. How can we ever be ccertain that we are in fact looking  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the whole situation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;       
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Of course we are never looking at *the whole situation* (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe?).  We know we are looking at enough of the situation when  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; models make successful approximate predictions and when we understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; where the errors come from.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it not interesting though, that &quot;where the errors came from&quot; is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; usually available to our minds only after the experiment has run,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after the train has gone off the rails, after the planes have flown  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into the buildings etc.??
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
When doing calculations and predictions I'm generally aware of many 
<br />
sources of error - but those are the ones I have under control so that I 
<br />
know they won't make my result to far off the mark - they'll make it an 
<br />
approximation, but a good approximation.  It is blindingly obvious that 
<br />
if I thought of a source of error I'd take it into account. That 
<br />
problems are caused by the unforseen is close to a tautology.  Since 
<br />
anything (short of quantum randomness) that can happen is in principle 
<br />
forseeable, it is also almost a tautology that whatever happened was 
<br />
&quot;available to our minds&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not saying that we should be trying to invent some kind of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;crystal Ball&quot; technology - only that techniques, formal techniques  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which enable a better perceptual understanding of future possibilities  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is already available to us and that it is high time we started to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value these techniques more - indeed, to teach them starting with pre- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; schoolers. Education for one, NEVER teaches &quot;how to choose concepts&quot;.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
That's a good point.  When my son was in the 8th grade I became 
<br />
concerned because after three weeks, according to his reports, they had 
<br />
done essentially nothing in his science class.  So I had a meeting with 
<br />
the teacher.  She explained that they hadn't gotten to any of the things 
<br />
I expected because they first had to learn how to plan experiments.  I 
<br />
said, &quot;You mean techniques like brain-storming, symmetry, considering 
<br />
extreme values?&quot;  She said, &quot;No. I mean looking up terms in the 
<br />
dictionary, discussing it within a group, and asking me questions.&quot;
<br />
<br />I had my son removed from her class.
<br />

<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet, the concepts we use to view information are absolutely 100%  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behind the choices we make when we act on information. If we choose,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for example the concept of &quot;ALLAHU AKHBAR&quot; as our starting premise for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what we do, that then enables an enormous set of activities predicated  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on this idea. It is perfectly logical.
