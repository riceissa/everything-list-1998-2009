<br />I think a lot of confusion comes from the use of pronounds such as
<br />
&quot;you&quot;.  In the realm of multiverses, block time, and many-worlds, the
<br />
word &quot;you&quot; becomes much harder to define.  Consider time: since your
<br />
brain is in a different state from one moment to the next how can you
<br />
be said to be the same person?  As you examine your branched selves in
<br />
more and more distantly branched universes, you will find a greater and
<br />
greater discrepancy.  You could even imagine at the moment of your
<br />
conception a different sperm may have fertalized you, would a copy of
<br />
&quot;you&quot; with only one gene's difference still be enough like you to be
<br />
you?  Where can the line be drawn as to who you are and who you are
<br />
not?
<br />
<br />I believe that if one accepts that he or she will be conscious of their
<br />
perspective five minutes from now, they must accept that they will
<br />
perceive conscious perspectives of their selves in other branched
<br />
universes.  If one accepts they will be conscious of and perceive these
<br />
other perspecties, they must also therefore be conscious of everyone
<br />
else's perspective.  And if you accept that, then you must be conscious
<br />
of every conscious creatures perspective, in every point of time, in
<br />
every branched history, in every universe.
<br />
<br />To illustrate problems with personal identity, consider these thought
<br />
experiments:
<br />
<br />1. Imagine a technologically advanced race that created simulations of
<br />
their brains that run on computers. If two brains were being simulated
<br />
on the same computer by sharing time on the CPU, both individuals would
<br />
be conscious within the computer at the same time, but neither
<br />
simulated individual remembers being the other because the programs are
<br />
restricted from accessing each other's memory space. In the same way
<br />
those brains were simulated on the same computer, our brains are
<br />
computed by the physics of this universe. The universe experiences all
<br />
conscious perspectives simultaneously, yet we as individuals do not
<br />
remember being conscious of these other perspectives since our memory
<br />
is not shared.
<br />
<br />2. For a second example, consider that with each successive point in
<br />
time, a new copy of you is created in a slightly modified state.
<br />
However, if that state is constantly changing, you are essentially a
<br />
different person from one point in time to the next. If time is indeed
<br />
discrete, it should be even more apparent that we have no continuous
<br />
identity. If we have no continuous identity, by what means could
<br />
consciousness be tied to one creature's perspective? There could be no
<br />
simple rule to define whose brain state you will perceive from one
<br />
point in time to the next. All that could be said is that all conscious
<br />
perspectives will be perceived, but no one could say who will perceive
<br />
them.
<br />
<br />3. Imagine that using advanced technology, the current state of your
<br />
body was recorded and then an exact duplicate of you was constructed.
<br />
Would you perceive the world from the viewpoint of your double? Common
<br />
sense says no, but then consider this slightly different example: A
<br />
recording of your state is recorded, and then you are completely
<br />
destroyed. Every atom in your body is taken apart. Then the recording
<br />
of your state is used to reconstruct you. Would you not have been
<br />
brought back to life by this procedure? Would you not perceive the
<br />
viewpoint of this recreation? In the first scenario we are less likely
<br />
to claim we would perceive the duplicate's perspective, but it is no
<br />
different from the second scenario where you are destroyed and
<br />
recreated. Now consider this even more bizarre scenario: Your state is
<br />
recorded, you are destroyed, and then 5 duplicates of yourself in the
<br />
recorded state are created. Which one's perspective do you take? There
<br />
can be only one answer: You take all of them.  The above scenario seems
<br />
unlikely and you probably have doubts as to whether or not is
<br />
technically feasible. Nevertheless, duplicates of you are being created
<br />
all the time as the universe branches. In each case you end up in a
<br />
slightly different universe, in some you end up slightly changed
<br />
yourself.
<br />
<br /><br />To me this leaves two equally valid definitions for the term &quot;you&quot;.
<br />
Either it refers to one conscious observer's perspective, at one point
<br />
of time, in one universe, in one branched history line OR it could
<br />
refer to reality's single first-person perspective of itself.
<br />
<br />For this reason I don't believe there can be a simple definition of
<br />
&quot;observers&quot;, there are only observer moments, but all are perceived.
<br />
There is no distinction between the consciousness that experiences any
<br />
particular observer moment.  This is why I disagree with Bruno's
<br />
version of comp which says quantum immortality is eternal agony;
<br />
considering all observer moments, reality's first-person experience
<br />
becomes more likely to perceive observer-moments of other individuals
<br />
than to continue along a branched history where one lives abnormally
<br />
long in a state of agony.
<br />
<br />This is why I see quantum mechancs as uncessesary anthropically, but
<br />
highly proabable given the disribution of observer moments among
<br />
universes.  I think many-worlds is analagous to a mathematical function
<br />
(or program) where each state mathematically defines many other states.
<br />
&nbsp;Such a program is only marginally more complex than a program that has
<br />
a 1-to-1 mapping of states, but many more observers will find
<br />
themselves in a universe defined by such a program, as it defines so
<br />
many more states.  This is where I ran into the apparent conflict that
<br />
we are conscious of perspectives that occur apprently early in the
<br />
universe's history, but I do like Stathis's point that any state we
<br />
perceive has a probably very close to 0, and we should consider
<br />
ourselves fortunate to be perceiving the states we currently find
<br />
ourselves in.
