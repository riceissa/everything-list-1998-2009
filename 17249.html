<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A good summary, David.  However, there are some other possibilities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Physics as now conceived is based on real and complex numbers. It can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; only be approximated digitally.  QM supposes true randomness, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Turing machines can't produce.  Again it may just be a matter of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;sufficient approximation&quot;, but the idea of a multiverse and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;everything-happens&quot; assumes real numbers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the possibility of 'mathematical ontology' would remain a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility for physics, even if it turned out that we needed an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternative to the digital TM as the 'computational substrate'?
</em><br />
<br />Not at all. With comp, the basic &quot;level&quot; has to be any universal  
<br />
system. (N,+,*) of combinators or JAVA, whatever. Quantum like stuffy  
<br />
bricks have to emerge from the inside first person indeterminacy. The  
<br />
proble of comp is that such a stuff is a priori not digitally  
<br />
emulable. The quantum computer is a threat to comp! That is why I have  
<br />
developed AUDA, it shows that universal machine have a highly non  
<br />
trivial epistemology and physics, so that hope remains to save comp by  
<br />
providing the comp explanation of the origin of the apparent quantum  
<br />
waves.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A sufficiently detailed, accurate and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; predictive numerical model is as good as the stuff it models
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And in terms of stuffy ontology, it would be a successful model - but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you wouldn't expect to be able to build a house out of emulated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bricks.
</em><br />
<br />You are right, with comp. Stuffy bricks cannot be emulated by turing  
<br />
machine, except perhaps by quantum one, but that has to be justified  
<br />
from number and logic alone.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; By contrast, in terms of numerical ontology, a sufficiently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complete 'model' would actually *constitute* the stuff it emulated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (i.e. indicating the quite different force of 'emulation' in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case).  Yes?
</em><br />
<br />Only for the mind. Matter escapes computation, once we assume that  
<br />
&quot;we&quot; are machine.
<br />
<br />I think that you fail to take into account simultaneously UDA1-6,  
<br />
UDA-7, and UDA-8. I know it is not easy.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But also a sufficiently accurate, detailed and predictive stuffy  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; model is as good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as the consciousness it models.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we take 'sufficiently' to the limit I suppose I must agree.  But as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before, in terms of stuffy ontology, any digital emulation - if that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what we're still discussing - is a model, not the stuff modelled, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hence wouldn't meet any such criterion of sufficiency.  If we accept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the sake of argument a stuffy TM as equivalent to a stuffy brain,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then what we're asked to accept here is that - although emulated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bricks are no good for stuffy house building - stuffy neurons are just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; great for stuffy brain building.  But why isn't a stuffy TM running a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation just a stuffy TM running a computation: WYSIWYG isn't it?
</em><br />
<br />You are dismissing the first person indeterminacy. A stuffy TM can run  
<br />
a computation. But if a consciousness is attached to that computation,  
<br />
it is automatically attached to an infinity of immaterial and relative  
<br />
computations as well, and from the perspective of that consciousness,  
<br />
it entails that if the person (with consciousness) decide to look at  
<br />
his stuffy neighborhood, below its comp-substitution, he will discover  
<br />
the trace of that, a priori non turing emulable, infinities of  
<br />
computations.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And if that is so, then a stuffy brain running a computation is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likewise just a stuffy brain running a computation: equally WYSIWYG.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only way you invoke consciousness in either case is by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; straight a priori assumption: stuffy computation =&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But according to lazy Olympia, going about computation in such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stuffy way reduces this assumption to an absurdity.
</em><br />
<br />OK. And then UDA1-7 shows that any possible observable &quot;stuffy&quot; thing  
<br />
is given by a probability/credibility measure on an infinity of  
<br />
computations.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, in terms of numerical ontology, the assumption that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation =&gt; consciousness is equally a priori, but at least it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not absurd.  In this case, brains, TMs - and bricks - share a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational ontology, so we can get building.
</em><br />
<br />Hmm... Not really. The bricks become a priori beyond the computable.  
<br />
Immaterial, like number relation, but non computable, like a  
<br />
probability on a infinite, even continuous, realities made of infinite  
<br />
computations.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Reconsidering my recent statements in the light of this, I suspect I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to eat my cake and have it (an old tendency) - but this might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be OK.  It still seems to me that the a priori ontological assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of choice is some fundamental conjunction of self-access +
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-relativisation: i.e.the One, I guess.
</em><br />
<br />Here we are back on our little theological divergence. I may insist  
<br />
you take a look on the Plotinus paper. The ONE is really arithmetical  
<br />
truth before any notion of self is yet defined. Once a notion of self  
<br />
appears, truth degenerate into provable provability and true  
<br />
provability (G and G*, the eterrestrial intellect and the divine  
<br />
intellect), which will degenerate into the universal self/soul (the  
<br />
God of the eastern). And this one, due to tension with the intellect,  
<br />
will fall, and that fall generate the non Turing emulable stuffy  
<br />
matter. Then the soul will try to go back to the ONE. Except that this  
<br />
temporal image is a bit a simplification. In a sense the fall and the  
<br />
coming back are the same arithmetical process. &quot;The ONE see the  
<br />
falling souls, and the souls see their rise to the ONE. Same  
<br />
arithmetical truth, but from different points of view.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stuff and consciousness -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which I suspect to be a spurious dichotomy - get collapsed into this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But given self-relativisation in the context of self-access, you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follow the math in either 'stuffy' or 'computational' directions till
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you get where you need to be, and like others I suspect this will play
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out according as we discover the relative derivation of persons &lt;=&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things.  As before, perhaps this is a no-more-neutral-than-necessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; monism, and I guess it leaves the question of emulation as model or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality to be settled empirically.
</em><br />
<br />With comp, reality is definitely not Turing emulable. If we discover a  
<br />
computable theory of reality, then we will know that we cannot say yes  
<br />
to the doctor, we will have to abandon the comp hyp.
