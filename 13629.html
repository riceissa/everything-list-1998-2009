<br />Terminology is about describing communicable notions. As such, the
<br />
only things words can ever describe are 1st person plural
<br />
things. Since you are familiar with my book, you can look up the
<br />
distinction between 1st person (singular), 1st person plural and 3rd
<br />
person, but these concepts have often been discussed on this list. I
<br />
can use the term &quot;Green&quot; for instance, in a sentence to you, and we
<br />
can be sure of its meaning when referring to shared experience of
<br />
phenomena, however I can never communicate to you how green appears to
<br />
me, so that you can compare it with your green qualia.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DN:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But where there is no generally accepted meaning, or a disputed one, how can

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which you find to be gibberish.  Is there a way out of this?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />This sometimes happens. We can point to examples of what the word
<br />
means, and see if we agree on those. There are bound to be borderline
<br />
cases where we disagree, but these are often unimportant unless we are
<br />
searching for a definition.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW, when I read 'Theory of Nothing', which I find very cogent, ISTM that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; virtually its entire focus is on aspects of a 'participatory' approach.  So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm more puzzled than ever why we're in disagreement.  
</em><br />
<br />You are correct that it is 'particpatory', at least in the sense John
<br />
Wheeler uses it. I don't think I ever really found myself in
<br />
disagreement with you. Rather, what is happening is symptomatic of us
<br />
trying to reach across the divide of JP Snow's two cultures. You are
<br />
obviously comfortable with the world of literary criticism, and your
<br />
style of writing reflects this. The trouble is that to someone brought
<br />
up on a diet of scientific and technical writing, the literary paper
<br />
may as well be written in ancient greek. Gibberish doesn't mean
<br />
rubbish or nonsense, just unintelligible.
<br />
<br />I had my first experience of the modern academic humanities just two
<br />
years ago, and it was quite a shock. I attended a conference entitled
<br />
&quot;The two cultures: Reconsidering the division between the Sciences and
<br />
Humanities&quot;. I was invited to speak as one of the scientific
<br />
representatives, and basically spoke about the core thesis of my book,
<br />
which seemed appropriate. I kept the language simple and
<br />
interdisciplinary, used lots of pictures to illustrate the concepts,
<br />
and I'm sure had a reasonable connect with the audience. All of the
<br />
other scientists did the same. They all knew better than to fall back
<br />
into jargon and dense forests of mathematical formulae (I have suffered
<br />
enough of those types of seminars, to be sure).
<br />
<br />By contrast, the speakers from the humanities all read their papers
<br />
word-for-word. There were no illustrations to help one follow the gist
<br />
of the arguments. The sentences were long-winded, and attempted to
<br />
cover every nuance possible. A style I'm sure you're very familiar
<br />
with. I tried to ask a few questions of the speakers at the end, not
<br />
so as to appear smart or anything, but just to try to clarify some of
<br />
the few points I thought I might have understood. The responses from
<br />
the speakers, however, was in the same long-winded, heavily nuanced
<br />
sentences.
<br />
<br />The one thing I drew from this conference was that the divide between
<br />
Snow's two cultures is alive and well, and vaster than I ever imagined.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've really been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to say that points-of-view (or 'worlds') emerge from *structure*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined somehow, and that (tautologically, surely) the 'primitives' of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure (in whatever theoretical terms we choose) must be capable of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'animating' such povs or worlds.  IOW povs are always 'takes' on the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situation, not inherent in individuated 'things'.
</em><br />
<br />To say that a &quot;point of view&quot; (which I would translate as &quot;observer&quot;)
<br />
emerges from the worlds structure, is another way of saying that the
<br />
observer must supervene on observed physical structures. And I agree
<br />
with you, basically because of the &quot;Occam catastrophe&quot;
<br />
problem. However, how or why this emergence happens is rather
<br />
mysterious. 
<br />
<br />I think is has something to do with self-awareness, without a self
<br />
existing with the observed physical world, one cannot be
<br />
self-aware. The corrolary of this is that self-awareness must be
<br />
necessary for consciousness. Note this doesn't mean that you have to
<br />
be self-aware every second you are awake, but you have to be capable
<br />
of introspection.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Oxygen and hydrogen atoms as counterexamples of a chemical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    potential that is not an electric field
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DN:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I certainly didn't mean to imply this!  I just meant that we seemed to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterposing 'abstracted' and 'participative' accounts, in the sense I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indicate above.  Something would really help me at this point: could I ask
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how would you relate 'physical' levels of description you've used (e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'oxygen and hydrogen atoms')  to the 'participative' approach of 'TON'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IOW, how do these narratives converge on the range of phenomena to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explained?

<br />I don't see a problem with this. Some sentences are necessarily
<br />
reflective &quot;Joan gave the ball to me&quot;, and other aren't &quot;Joan gave the
<br />
ball to Russell&quot;. A lot of phenomena can be adequately described
<br />
without reference to any observer. Others require the presence of the
<br />
observer to be explicitly acknowledged.
