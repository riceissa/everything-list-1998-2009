I don't think Bruno's conclusion is weird. I come to essentially the
<br />
same conclusion in &quot;Occam&quot;, without the need for formalising
<br />
&quot;Knowledge&quot;, nor the need to use Modal logic. Of course I do use logic
<br />
of the ordinary kind - I would be surprised if anyone could do away
<br />
with it altogether.
<br />
<br />I would like to think that my exposition is easier to follow than
<br />
Bruno's, but this could simply be a biased viewpoint on my part. I
<br />
welcome comment and criticism on that paper.
<br />
<br />Incidently, I didn't mean to imply that this sort of modeling of
<br />
Knowlegde was inappropriate, only that there was no discussion as to
<br />
why one would want to model it in this particular way. Its really the
<br />
same as when Hal Ruhl (and I admit I'm putting words in his mouth
<br />
here, although its consistent with my understanding of his position)
<br />
models the universe by cellular automata. Yes I can agree its a
<br />
consistent model, and possibly one that's testable. However, I fail to
<br />
see why one would want to do that. Good physical models ought to have
<br />
some understandable basis (explanatory power perhaps).
<br />
<br />I notice Bruno has posted a more detailed discourse on this issue,
<br />
which I will digest in due course. Perhaps all he was doing was
<br />
assuming a cultural background of philosophy I have not been exposed
<br />
to. Just as an example, he says most philosophers would agree that
<br />
[]A-&gt;A, where []A is interpreted as knowing A. This is clearly a
<br />
different meaning of the word &quot;to know&quot; that we use here in
<br />
Australia. I know of plenty of people who know that God exists. And I
<br />
know of a number of other people who know that God doesn't exist. So,
<br />
by this application of Modal logic, we can conclude that God both
<br />
exists and doesn't exist at the same time, which seems kind of illogical.
<br />
<br />Perhaps the way out of this mess is to say that I'me really talking
<br />
about belief, rather than knowledge, however that would imply that
<br />
knowledge is devoid of meaning, since it is impossible to establish
<br />
with certainty whether any particular fact is true. Even Mathematical
<br />
proof is contingent upon belief of the efficacy of the formal proof,
<br />
something that has been called into doubt, particularly for more
<br />
complex proofs like Fermat's last theorem, or the 4 colour theorem.
<br />
<br />I don't mean to be picky, but its just these sorts of considerations
<br />
and misunderstandings that throw me off the track every time.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Russell,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess the discussion is moving to the meta level. The question is not what the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model is, but what format the model should be. Using logic as a vehicle seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me to be a meritorious approach, especially if he can derive physical effects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form pure logic.... He won't be the first. Boltzmann and Darwin have done it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before him. Bruno's suggestion that &quot;physics is a branch of machine psychology&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is unfamiliar and surprising... arguably as wierd as some of the stuff I came up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If logic (or some form of logical model) is not the vehicle for describing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality, then what is?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
