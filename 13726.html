<br />I still disagree, but I have a slightly different formulation of my
<br />
previous replies which might be more consistent with my remarks to
<br />
Bruno re the 1-personal discrimination of self-relation as 'action' or
<br />
'behaviour'.  Essentially, if we conceive of the plenitude of all
<br />
possible universes as existing 'statically', then the recovery of
<br />
'dynamic' or temporal existence must be seen as characteristic of
<br />
1-personal self-relation: that is, 1-persons are active participants,
<br />
not merely 'observers'.  What I said to Bruno was that my
<br />
justification was simply that such a brute claim seems to be required
<br />
if dynamism is to be recovered at all from stasis.  I'm less sure
<br />
however that such a claim is strictly 'necessary' in the logical
<br />
sense.
<br />
<br />Given this, I suppose it is possible to conceive of a B-Universe in
<br />
which this brute claim is not granted.  IOW no aspect of the
<br />
self-relation of the B-Universe is characteristically dynamic or
<br />
1-personal.  Such a universe would be static in all aspects - 'inside'
<br />
and 'outside' - and consequently it would contain no active
<br />
participants and consequently none of the &quot;stuff&quot; characteristic of
<br />
such participative behaviour.  However, such a static universe could
<br />
not, by the same token, be claimed to be &quot;exactly the same&quot; as the
<br />
A-Universe, precisely because nothing whatsoever could be said to
<br />
'happen' to any object it instantiates.  The points I made earlier
<br />
about the mutual inaccessibility of A and B-Universes still stand.
<br />
Consequently we can't 'interview' B-Universe objects.
<br />
<br />In some sense 'interviews' between B-Universe structures could be said
<br />
to exist, but not to 'occur'.  The content of the statements of
<br />
B-Universe objects about their internal states would be similarly
<br />
'justified' in terms of static self-relation as those in the
<br />
A-Universe, but it wouldn't indeed be 'like anything to be' a
<br />
B-Universe object.  What is really interesting about this is it
<br />
suggests that the notion of consciousness as equating to 'what it's
<br />
like to be' something is incoherent.  Rather, consciousness seems more
<br />
'what it's like to enact' something.  Consequently, the 'absolute'
<br />
quality of consciousness is just what its like for the One (per
<br />
Plotinus) to enact particular kinds of self-relation.  And such
<br />
quality indeed seems 'absolute' as opposed to 'relative', because it
<br />
doesn't seem logically necessary for such enaction to emerge
<br />
1-personally from static self-relation.  It's just that our own case
<br />
demonstrates its 'absolute' contingency in the A-Universe.  So zombies
<br />
may be possible, but not in the A-Universe, and consequently we
<br />
needn't fear ever being fooled by one in any accessible encounter.
<br />
<br />What this amounts to is understanding 'consciousness' essentially as
<br />
the recovery of dynamism from stasis, or active participation from
<br />
instantiation, or time from eternity, or the A-series from the
<br />
B-series.  It's also treating 'dynamism' as 'experientiaI' rather than
<br />
'physical', which of course is moot.  But I've never seen any really
<br />
satisfactory direct treatment of dynamism with respect to static
<br />
formulations of existence except as a brute assertion, or mere
<br />
implication, of its being characteristic of 1-personal self-relation
<br />
to appropriate structure.  Perhaps Bruno could comment whether this
<br />
way of looking at things is consistent with comp?  For example, it
<br />
might seem that 'dovetailing' carries some implication of dynamism, or
<br />
at least sequentiality, with it from the outset.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, if a static background is not granted, then in such a
<br />
view dynamism is already at the heart of self-relation, and with it,
<br />
the necessary return of 1-personal participation.  However, a
<br />
fundamentally 'tensed' view of reality presents its own (particularly
<br />
structural) problems, which are kettle of fish for a different
<br />
discussion.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You have however drawn our attention to something very interesting and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; important IMO.  This concerns the necessary entailment of 'existence'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.  The relation 1+1=2 is always true.  It is true in all universes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even if a universe does not contain any humans or any observers.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth of 1+1=2 is independent of all observers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2.  If you have a set of rules and an initial condition, then there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist a universe with this set of rules and this initial condition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because it is possible to compute a new situation from a situation, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from this new situation it is possible to compute another new situation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and this can be done for ever.  This unlimited set of situations will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a universe that exists independent of all humans and all observers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Noone needs to make these computations, the results of the computations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will exist anyhow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3.  All mathmatically possible universes exists, and they all exist in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same way.  Our universe is one of those possible universes.  Our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe exists independant of any humans or any observers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4.  For us humans are the universes that contain observers more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting.  But there is no qualitaive difference between universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with observers and universes without observers.  They all exist in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same way.  The GoL-universes (every initial condition will span a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separate universe) exist in the same way as our universe.  But because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are humans, we are more intrested in universes with observers, and we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are specially interested in our own universe.  But otherwise there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; noting special with our universe.
