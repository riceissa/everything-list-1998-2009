<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -----Original Message-----
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From: Jacques Mallah [mailto:jackmallah.domain.name.hidden]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Charles Goodwin&quot; &lt;cgoodwin.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Hi, I have just joined this list after seeing it mentioned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the Fabric of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Reality list....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Hi.  BTW, what's up on the FOR list?  Ever see anything interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there?  I thought the book sucked except for chapter 2 (I think; the one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explaining the MWI), but at least there are some MWIers on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that list I would think.
</em><br />
<br />I find it interesting. I don't necessarily believe the MWI myself but it is the main topic of conversation. Presently the main
<br />
thread seems to be concerned with the computational theory of reality.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I must ask, though, what makes you think that a typical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer ISN'T much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;older than the lifetime of his species would allow?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I'm not so old, but if FIN were true, the effective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chance of me being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; old would be 100%.  So by Bayesian reasoning, it must be false.
</em><br />
<br />Hm, but there is a selection principle involved - you have to live through the first 100, the first million years, etc. If you
<br />
haven't yet done so then you can't apply any sort of statistical argument to your own experience unless you assume that you're a
<br />
typical observer. But if you do that you're just assuming the result you want. My argument is that for all we know there may be far
<br />
more typical observers with ages between say 100 and the origin of the human race in existence, but the chances of any of them
<br />
existing in our branch of the multiverse is &quot;thermodynamically low&quot; - i.e. probably less than 1 in a googol or so. Since (1) you
<br />
can't observe a typical observer who isn't yourself (according to the QTI) and (2) you are in a special state yourself, of not
<br />
having yet reached the age where you start to suspect the QTI is correct, it's impossible for you to make any reasonable assumptions
<br />
about the QTI (i.e. whether it's true or false). Like the MWI, the QTI can only be deduced fairly indirectly.
<br />
<br />My objections to the QTI are more along the lines of how the mechanism is supposed to work - why can't you experience your own
<br />
death, or just stop having experiences altogether, in 99.99999(etc)% of the universes that contain you?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     On the contrary, you do use a SSA.  After all, you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never (for any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question) have more than the one data point for use in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SSA.  But with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability of 0% or 100%, that's plenty!
</em><br />
<br />The problem is that the probability isn't 0% that you'd find yourself at your current age (according to the QTI - assume I put that
<br />
after every sentence!). Because you HAVE to pass through your current age to reach QTI-type ages, the probability of finding
<br />
yourself at your current age at some point is 100%. Using your argument (assuming QTI...) then your chances of finding yourself at
<br />
ANY age would be 0%. This imples to me that the SSA can't be used in this case, rather than that QTI *must* be wrong. After all
<br />
whether QTI is correct or not, you can imagine that it is and see what the results would be; and one result is that you will find
<br />
yourself (at some point) having any age from 0 to infinity, which is consistent with your current observations. In fact, the fact
<br />
that you are still alive is an argument for QTI (not a very strong one, though!)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;     It means - and I admit it does take a little thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here - _I want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;to follow a guessing procedure that, in general, maximizes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fraction of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;those people (who use that procedure) who get the right
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guess_.  (Why would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I want a more error-prone method?)  So I use Bayesian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasoning with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;best prior available, the uniform one on observer-moments,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which maximizes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the fraction of observer-moments who guess right.  No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; soul-hopping in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;reasoning, I assure you.
</em><br />
<br />That's OK so far. And it turns out correctly for most cases (i.e. 99.99999999(etc)% of observers WILL turn out to have ages of
<br />
infinity (if QTI etc)). But an infinitesimal fraction won't - including everyone you observe around you (the multiverse is very very
<br />
very (keep typing &quot;very&quot; til doomsday) big! (assuming MWI)).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I'm sorry, I still don't see how that applies to me. If I know which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;observer moments I'm in (e.g. I know how old I am) why should I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;reason as though I don't?
</em><br />
<br />(snip)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the same way, the SSA helps you guess things.  It's just a procedure to follow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which usually helps the people that use it to make correct guesses.
</em><br />
<br />It doesn't seem to help in this case though. I don't need to guess my age, it's a given. All I can deduce from it is that at some
<br />
point in my life I will experience this particular age. This deduction is compatible with the QTI. It is also compatible with
<br />
non-QTI (QTM, perhaps?)
<br />
