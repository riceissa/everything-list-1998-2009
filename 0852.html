Christopher Maloney:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was a little turned off, if I remember correctly, by some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the book flap, where they described some of your predictions.
</em><br />
<br />They're my best shot at extrapolating the developments I see.  One
<br />
branch of machine development seems to be roughly recapitulating the
<br />
evolution of our own minds, but at about ten-million speed.  It has
<br />
progressed from the equivalent of no nervous system 100 years ago to
<br />
the very bottom of the vertebrate scale (roughly insect nervous
<br />
complexity) now.  Computer power is growing fast enough to zoom
<br />
machines through reptile-, mammal- and human-like complexity over the
<br />
next 50 years.  I do my best to figure the consequences of that
<br />
development, and make a few suggestions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It also notes that, no matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what happens to us, among all universes there are some in which our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness continues, and we will always find ourselves in those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (and never in ones where our consciousness does not continue!).  
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So do you believe in immortality?  Where do you stand on the FAP the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Final Anthropic Principle, ala Tipler and Barrow)?
</em><br />
<br />In all possible universes there are always some where your subjectivity
<br />
continues, no matter what, and those are where you'll find yourself! 
<br />
That much I find convincing.  But I never found the logic for an Omega
<br />
point compelling. I don't see why you can't just keep on going and
<br />
going on your own unique subjective paths through the space of possible
<br />
universes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; For some things that happen (like our brain rotting) the simplest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; continuation of our consciousness may no longer involve the exact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; continuation of the old physical laws.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Huh?
</em><br />
<br />The evolution of the universe, earth, life and yourself from the
<br />
working of a very simple (maybe null) TOE and its consequent steady
<br />
physical laws must be the simplest way to produce your subjective
<br />
existence.  Now that your mind-implementing brain exists, exquisitely
<br />
evolved to certain physical laws, the simplest continuation of your
<br />
subjectivity is surely for those laws to continue to operate as
<br />
always.  But in normal operation your body has a finite lifespan: you
<br />
see other people die all the time.  So eventually the continued
<br />
operation of your brain, the mechanism of your subjectivity, becomes
<br />
less and less likely.  To continue one day, maybe you need a lucky
<br />
escape from an accident.  Later it may take medical luck to keep you
<br />
alive: a cancer cell happens to die, some thymus mutation rejuvinates
<br />
you a bit, an infection happens to clear some arteries ...  But as
<br />
more and more coincidences are needed, your subjective continuation
<br />
through the continued operation of physical law may become less
<br />
probable than other continuations among the possible worlds, most of
<br />
which don't have our physics.  For instance, you may suddenly discover
<br />
that the physical universe is just a simulation in some other world
<br />
with different laws altogether, and as your brain falls apart, your
<br />
abstract subjective processes, without the underlying physics, are
<br />
&quot;uploaded&quot; into some strange new substrate.
