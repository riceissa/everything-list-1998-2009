Hello Bruno,
<br />
<br />I did follow a course on Hopf algebras, but that's already some time 
<br />
ago. I will read the articles you mentioned, should be interesting! 
<br />
B.t.w. Kreimer has also written some papers with David Broadhurst. He 
<br />
has done some quite amazing work, see his homepage:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://physics.open.ac.uk/~dbroadhu/">http://physics.open.ac.uk/~dbroadhu/</a>
<br />
<br />To answer your question about the nonexistence of ghosts, I would first 
<br />
have to define what ghosts are. Simply put, a field theory is defined 
<br />
by some path integral. You have to integrate over all field 
<br />
configurations. By taking functional derivatives you can then compute 
<br />
(in principle) all possible correlations. In some theories there are 
<br />
complications because instead of the field, potentials are used. Fields 
<br />
are certain derivatives of the potentials. Now, for a given field 
<br />
configuration, there are many different potentials (they are related by 
<br />
so-called gauge transformations). So, you can't just integrate over all 
<br />
possible potential configurations. You must make sure that all field 
<br />
configurations only appear once in the path integral. However, it is 
<br />
very inconvenient to deal with such restrictions. Now, there exists a 
<br />
certain trick to deal with this problem. One introduces certain (ghost) 
<br />
fields in the path integral (that also have to be integrated over), 
<br />
such that the integral over the potentials is unrestricted. The 
<br />
integration over the ghosts takes care of the ''overcounting''.
<br />
<br />If you now perform perturbative computations, you find the usual 
<br />
Feynman rules plus some extra rules for the ghosts. They can appear 
<br />
only in internal loops. The fields are anti-commutative, and yet have  
<br />
spin zero. That seems impossible. Maybe you know the famous spin 
<br />
statics theorem: half-integer spin particles are described by anti-
<br />
commuting fields, integer spin fields by commuting fields. This can be 
<br />
derived by showing that if this were not the case you would violate 
<br />
locality. So, the appearence of the ghosts seems to indicate that the 
<br />
field theory is non-local, but that's false. The field theory can be 
<br />
shown to be local. The ghosts are just a mathematical abstraction to 
<br />
facilitate computations. This is reflected by the fact that they only 
<br />
appear in internal loops. Thus, ghosts don't exist.
<br />
<br />Maybe this analogy helps. First year students often get this problem: 
<br />
Suppose you have a spherical planet of uniform density, with a cavity. 
<br />
Suppose the cavity is also spherical. The radii of the planet and the 
<br />
cavity are given, also the position of the center of the cavity w.r.t. 
<br />
the center of the planet is given.
<br />
<br />The problem is to compute the acceleration due to gravity (g) on the 
<br />
surface of the planet. This will depend on the position on the surface, 
<br />
of course.
<br />
<br />Now, the following trick can be used: Thye planet with cavity is just a 
<br />
superposition of the planet without cavity and a small planet with 
<br />
negative density in the place of the cavity. Since the two objects are 
<br />
spherical, you can immediately write down the result!
<br />
<br />I think that everyone will agree that the appearance of negative 
<br />
density, and thus of negative mass, in a formulae describing a real 
<br />
physical situation as above, doesn't mean that negative mass objects 
<br />
actually exist.
<br />
<br />'t Hooft's theory is one in which quantum mechanics also appears in an 
<br />
analogous way as the ghosts in field theory. So, to answer Charles' 
<br />
question, the Copenhagen interpretation means in this case that 
<br />
although there is an underlying theory, this underlying theory says 
<br />
nothing about elementary particles, because they don't exist. Just like 
<br />
ghosts can do strange things in Feynman diagrams so can an electron go 
<br />
through two slits at once. Ghosts don't exists. How do you know that an 
<br />
electron does exist?

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Saibal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your thesis is very interesting, as far as I understand it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am sure you are right about the fact that renormalisation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory can put light ... on the question &quot;what is a physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system and what is a physical simulation of a physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system?&quot;. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I see more and more my own Z1* as a sort of renormalisation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the computationalist indeterminacy (*Too* many worlds with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp). The quantum would be the result of renormalising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classical comp indeterminacy!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you know the Hopf algebra of renormalisation? (cf
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Connes and Kreimer &quot;Lessons from Quantum Field Theory&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (hep-th/9904044).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My interest for Hopf algebra grew from the reading of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Kitaev &quot;fault-tolerant quantum computation by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyons&quot; (quant-ph/9707021) (what crazy paper!), but your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remark + your thesis + Connes and Kreimer adds still deeper 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; motivations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW you said (to the FOR list):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;In quantum field theory Feynman diagrams are used to perform 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perturbative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;computations. Now, here it is clear from the start that virtual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particles 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;and ghosts, as they appear in these diagrams, don't exist. Only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;external lines represent real physical particles. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What makes you so sure? I guess it's my incompetence in Quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Field Theory, but this is not clear for me. I would appreciate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a short comment on the MWI view of QFT, perturbation and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; renormalisation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;All this is very clear 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;because the Feynman rules are derived from a well defined theory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;well understood.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
