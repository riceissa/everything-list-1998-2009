Russell,
<br />
<br />To be fair, I should elaborate on my earlier post about amnesics and 
<br />
psychotics. If I consider the actual cases I have seen, arguably they do 
<br />
have *some* sense of the passage of time. Taking the first example, people 
<br />
with severe Korsakoff Syndrome (due to chronic alcohol abuse) appear to be 
<br />
completely incapable of laying down new memories. If you enter their room to 
<br />
perform some uncomfortable medical procedure and they become annoyed with 
<br />
you, all you have to do is step outside for a moment, then step back inside, 
<br />
and they are all smiles again, so you can have another go at the procedure, 
<br />
and repeat this as many times as you want. While you are actually in their 
<br />
sight, however, they do recognise that you are the same person from moment 
<br />
to moment, and they do make the connection between the needle you are 
<br />
sticking into them and the subsequent pain, causing them to become annoyed 
<br />
at you. So they do have a sense of time, even if only for a few seconds.
<br />
<br />The second example, the disorganised schizophrenic, is somewhat more 
<br />
complex. There is a continuum from mild to extreme disorganisation, and at 
<br />
the extreme end, it can be very difficult to get any sense of what the 
<br />
person is thinking, although it is quite easy to get a sense of what they 
<br />
are feeling and it would be very difficult to maintain a belief that they 
<br />
are not actually conscious (you really have to see this for yourself to 
<br />
understand it). Usually, even the most unwell of these patients give some 
<br />
indirect indication that they maintain some sense of time. For example, if 
<br />
you hold out a glass of water, they will reach for it and drink from it, 
<br />
which suggests that they may have a theory about the future, and how they 
<br />
might influence it to their advantage. Occasionally, however - and I have to 
<br />
confess I have not actually tried the experiment - there are patients who 
<br />
seem incapable of even as simple (one could say near-reflexive) a task as 
<br />
grabbing a glass of water. With treatment, almost all these people improve, 
<br />
and it is interesting to ask them what was happening during these periods. 
<br />
Firstly, it is interesting that they actually have any recollection. It is 
<br />
as if the CPU was defective, but the data was still written to the hard 
<br />
drive, to be analysed later. They might explain that everything seemed 
<br />
fragmented, so that although they could see and hear things, the visual 
<br />
stimuli did not form recognisable objects and the auditory stimuli did not 
<br />
form recognisable words or other sounds. Furthermore, the various perceptual 
<br />
data seemed to run into each other spatially, so that it was not possible to 
<br />
distinguish background from foreground, significant from insignificant. 
<br />
Catatonic patients, on the other hand, may (later, when better) describe a 
<br />
state of total inertia, being stuck in the present moment, unable to move 
<br />
either physically or mentally, unable to even imagine a possibility of 
<br />
change from the present state, aware of everything going on around them as a 
<br />
kind of extended simultaneity.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think you missed my point about the amnesic and psychotic patients,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is not that they are clear thinkers, but that they are conscious despite

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; disability which impairs their perception of time. Your post raises an

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As I said before, I think this is a valuable contribution, but not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something I know how to deal with at this point in time. Presently,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these psychotic patients account for only a fraction of conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers (assuming they are conscious as you say they are). Quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mechanics only requires that most observers have their own time like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;domain, not that all of them do. I'm still not convinced that TIME
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;isn't a necessary property of observerhood, as opposed to a likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contingent one, but there the debate stagnates, as I'm not an expert
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in psychiatry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I did want to throw one more po thought. Even though standard QM is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;based on continuous time, nowhere does TIME require time to be experienced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continuously. It could just as easily be the Cantor set, say. Might not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the time experienced by these psychotic people be a fractal set like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that, or are you saying they have absolutely no sense of time at all?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Cheers
