<br />
Kelly,
<br />
<br />Since you told me that you accept comp, after all, and do no more  
<br />
oppose it to your view, I think we agree, at least on many things.
<br />
Indeed you agree with the hypothesis, and your philosophy appears to  
<br />
be a consequence of the hypothesis. That is all my work is about.  
<br />
Indeed I show you are right in a constructive way, which leads to the  
<br />
testability of the computationalist hypothesis.
<br />
<br />It remains possible that we have a disagreement concerning the  
<br />
probability, and this has some importance, because it is the use of  
<br />
probability (or credibility) which makes the consequences of comp  
<br />
testable. More in the comment below.
<br />
<br />Also, I will from now on, abandon the term machine for the term  
<br />
number. Relatively to a fixed chosen universal &quot;machine&quot;, like  
<br />
Robinson arithmetic, such an identification can be done precisely. I  
<br />
will come back on this to my explanation to Kim, if he is still  
<br />
interested, and patient enough ...

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I don't think I can say it much better than I did before:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my view, there are ungrounded abstract symbols that acquire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning via constraints placed on them by their relationships to other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbols.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Exactly. And those constraints makes sense once we make explicit the  
<br />
many universal numbers involved. I will have opportunities to say more  
<br />
on this later.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only &quot;grounding&quot; comes from the conscious experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is intrinsic to a particular set of relationships.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree, but only because I have succeeded to make such a statement  
<br />
utterly precise, and even testable.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To repeat my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; earlier Chalmers quote, &quot;Experience is information from the inside;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics is information from the outside.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Again this is fuzzy, and I think Chalmers is just quoting me with  
<br />
different terms (btw). I prefer to avoid the word information because  
<br />
it has different meaning in science and in everyday talk. Either you  
<br />
use it in the sense of Shannon, or Kolmogorov, or Solomonov, or  
<br />
Solovay or even Landauer (which one precisely?), in which case  
<br />
&quot;information = consciousness&quot; is as much non sensical than saying  
<br />
&quot;consciousness is neuron's firing&quot;, or you use it, as I think you do,  
<br />
in the everyday sense of information like when we ask &quot;do you know the  
<br />
last information on TV?&quot;. In that case information corresponds to what  
<br />
I am used to call &quot;first person view&quot;, and your identity  
<br />
&quot;consciousness = information&quot; is correct, and even a theorem with  
<br />
reasonnably fine grained definitions. So we are OK here.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It is this subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience of information that provides meaning to the otherwise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely abstract &quot;platonic&quot; symbols.
</em><br />
<br />As I said.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Going a little further:  I would say that the relationships between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the symbols that make up a particular mental state have some sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistency, some regularity, some syntax - so that when these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; syntactical relationships are combined with the symbols it does make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up some sort of descriptive language.  A language that is used to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describe a state of mind.  Here we're well into the realm of semiotics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think.
</em><br />
<br />Here you are even closer to what I say in both UDA and AUDA. No  
<br />
problem. It takes me 30 years of work to explain this succesfully to a  
<br />
part of the experts in those fields, so as to make a PhD thesis from  
<br />
that. Sorry to let you know that this has been already developed in  
<br />
details. My originality is to take computer science seriously when  
<br />
studying computationalism.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To come back to our disagreement, what is it that a Turing machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does that results in consciousness?
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;From the third point of view, one universal number relates the 3- 
<br />
informations.
<br />
&nbsp;From the first person point of view, all universal and particular  
<br />
numbers at once imposes a probability measure on the histories going  
<br />
through the corresponding 1-information.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would seem to me that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ultimately what a Turing machine does is manipulate symbols according
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to specific rules.
</em><br />
<br />In the platonic sense, yes. And it concerns 3-information or relative  
<br />
computational states.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But is it the process of manipulating the symbols
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that produces consciousness?
</em><br />
<br /><br />No. Nothing, strictly speaking, ever produce consciousness. It will  
<br />
appear to be the unavoidable inside view aspect of numbers in  
<br />
arithmetical platonia. AUDA explains this thanks to the fact that self- 
<br />
consistency belongs to the G* minus G theory. It is the kind of things  
<br />
which a number (machine) can &quot;produce as true&quot; without being able to  
<br />
communicate it scientifically (prove) to another machine, including  
<br />
itself.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OR is it the state of the symbols and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their relationships with each other AFTER the manipulation which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really accounts for consciousness?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Preferably indeed. The &quot;manipulations&quot; are all existing in the static  
<br />
Platonia.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I say the latter.  You seem to be saying the former...or maybe you're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying it's both?
</em><br />
<br />No, I say the later. We agree on this, I think.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I've mentioned, I think that the symbols which combine to create a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental state can be manipulated in MANY ways.
</em><br />
<br />Exactly. This is the key point which, when made precise, will show  
<br />
that we can deduce the laws of the observables (physics) from computer  
<br />
science/number theory, making comp a scientific theory, that is an  
<br />
empirically refutable theory in the sense of Popper.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And algorithms just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; serve as descriptions of these ways.  But subjective consciousness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the states, not in how the states are manipulated.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You can say that, although I could explain that you could run into  
<br />
some subtle but unimportant language difficulties related to the MGA,  
<br />
but it is OK. The key point if that the stability of the &quot;subjective  
<br />
consciousness&quot; &quot;or first person views&quot; is determined by some relative  
<br />
measure on the relatively consistent histories, which are related to  
<br />
the universal (or particular) numbers generating those histories in  
<br />
the universal deployment. This makes sense mathematically thanks to  
<br />
Church thesis and its incompleteness consequences. CF UDA-7 and AUDA.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; With different probabilities. That is why we are partially  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; responsible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of our future. This motivates education and learning, and commenting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; posts ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my view, life is just something that we experience.  That's it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There's nothing more to life than subjective experience.  The feeling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of being an active participant, of making decisions, of planning, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choosing, is only that:  a feeling.  A type of qualia.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here we differ. Frankly, you say above that &quot;I would say that the  
<br />
relationships between the symbols that make up a particular mental  
<br />
state have some sort of consistency, some regularity, some syntax - so  
<br />
that when these syntactical relationships are combined. It does make  
<br />
up some sort of descriptive language.  A language that is used to  
<br />
describe a state of mind.  Here we're well into the realm of semiotics  
<br />
I think&quot;. Why not taking yourself seriously on this point. Life is not  
<br />
&quot;just&quot; something we experience. Consciousness is &quot;just&quot; something we  
<br />
experience, but life and histories related those experience in such a  
<br />
way that our planning makes sense relatively to realities and reality.  
<br />
Now, if you take computer science seriously enough, then you can  
<br />
replace the fuzzy semiotics by the mathematical theory of meaning  
<br />
(model theory) and work on the conclusion of your assumption. It is as  
<br />
fun as a (first person) salvia experience, and 100% third person  
<br />
sharable (unlike salvia!). It is much more informative and leads to  
<br />
precise way to test comp, and up to no, crazily enough, the quantum  
<br />
theory (without collapse) confirms comp, even its most startling  
<br />
aspect (like the fact that we are multiplied into continuum of version  
<br />
&quot;all the time&quot;).
<br />
You also mention the role of the relationship between the states  
<br />
above. Again: why not taking them into account to explain why I see  
<br />
red things in front of stable subjective and relative object supported  
<br />
by computational histories?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay, it's past my bedtime, I'll do probability tomorrow!
</em><br />
<br />Don't tell me you have a problem with the first person indeterminacy,  
<br />
because we would be back to the beginning of the talk on this list,  
<br />
and usually, people who refuses the 1-indeterminacy are those  
<br />
materialist who understand very well all the UDA steps, but are  
<br />
allergic to idealism, so they try to stop the reasoning at its root.  
<br />
It would be a pity that you just disagree with the point which make  
<br />
your own philosophy a scientific theory.
<br />
<br />But of course if you have a *real* trouble with the notion of first  
<br />
person indeterminacy, it is a pleasure for me to explain, give more  
<br />
examples,  or discuss it in details. First person indeterminacy is my  
<br />
oldest &quot;discovery&quot;, and I am used to people taking some time to  
<br />
swallow it, but after it is like they found it by themselves ... It is  
<br />
the Columbus Egg of indeterminism. It is simple, and with the abandon  
<br />
of the physical supervenience thesis, it is what can transform your  
<br />
comp-correct intuition into a real workable and refutable theory. Of  
<br />
course, you can also just enjoy your cute philosophy and take pleasure  
<br />
in just knowing it has already been working out. But comp makes the  
<br />
use of computer science, including mathematical logic, unavoidable,  
<br />
when we look at the details. Is that not obvious?
