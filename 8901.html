Hi Russell and the list:
<br />
<br />I have been very distracted and am trying to catch up on the discussions.
<br />
<br />At 01:35 AM 2/1/2006, you wrote:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't agree with equating the vacuum with &quot;Nothing&quot;, although I know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a few people do. The vacuum still has a wealth of information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;associated with it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the ensemble of all descriptions (sometimes known as Schmidhuber
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ensemble), all describable things correspond to subsets of cardinality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;c=2^\aleph_0. For example every finite bitstring is represented by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subset of descriptions having that bitstring as a prefix. The only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;describable thing having vaguely the properties of &quot;Nothing&quot; is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;empty finite string, which is, in other words, the set of all possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;descriptions. But this is just the Everything. The Everything and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Nothing are equivalent, just as a finite bitstring is equivalent with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subset of bitstrings sharing the finite string as a prefix.
</em><br />
<br />The number of descriptions - divisions of my list of properties - in 
<br />
my model [in the All part]  is also c so long as my list of 
<br />
properties is countably infinite which seems uncontroversial.   My 
<br />
Nothing being absent any bit strings [containing the empty finite bit 
<br />
string?] has at least this property so is in the All.  The All also 
<br />
has properties and so is a member of itself.  I do not see my Nothing 
<br />
and my All as equivalent since my Nothing is incomplete and my All - 
<br />
being complete - is therefore inconsistent.
<br />
<br />In a recent post [23 Feb] Bruno said:
<br />
<br />&quot;You can see G*, the &quot;divine intellect&quot; as an exhaustive catalog of true
<br />
propositions, which, if added without caution to the entity's
<br />
collection of beliefs, would make the entity inconsistent.&quot;
<br />
<br />At the moment I take this as a support for my position that my All is 
<br />
inconsistent since it could be considered an exhaustive catalog of 
<br />
divisions of my list each of which would have the same level of 
<br />
truthfulness as the list itself and each such division would 
<br />
establish a pair of &quot;propositions&quot;.
<br />
<br />Further I see my descriptions in my All as describing possible 
<br />
individual states of universes and not of being descriptions of a 
<br />
group of such states - sub string after sub string - that are somehow 
<br />
[by a computer?] given a brief and sequential distinction such as a 
<br />
degree of &quot;reality&quot;.  In my system the isolated descriptions of 
<br />
states are given such a brief distinction by a dynamic resulting from 
<br />
the incompleteness of my Nothing and the inconsistency of my All.
<br />
<br />Avoiding any selection [information] requires this distinction to 
<br />
have any degree of overlapping duration during the progression of 
<br />
states which is my proposal for a &quot;flow of consciousness&quot;.  The 
<br />
inconsistency of the All makes this dynamic random.  This randomness 
<br />
is a noise in the succession of states which in some such sequences 
<br />
can look like an ever increasing information content of that series 
<br />
of states which if the informational density of the associated 
<br />
universe is fixed to me looks like dark energy.
<br />
<br />Some of the above is of course contained in my earlier posts.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I note that Hal Ruhl was going around saying the Nothing was unstable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;before Wilczek, but using a rather different argument.
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure that I said the Nothing is unstable prior to Wilczek - 
<br />
I will have to check this - but my argument indeed appears to be 
<br />
different in that it is based on an apparent logical incompleteness 
<br />
of the Nothing that the Nothing must attempt to resolve and not on 
<br />
what I consider to be a &quot;local&quot; - i.e. relevant for our particular 
<br />
universe - mathematical description of the Nothing such as its being 
<br />
a &quot;vacuum&quot; or having some identical [or not] particular simultaneous 
<br />
value [such as zero] for all &quot;fields&quot; which themselves may be just a 
<br />
currently useful but ultimately incorrect representation of the 
<br />
physics of our particular universe.
