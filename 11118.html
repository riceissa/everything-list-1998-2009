<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; like numbers and arithmetic. The number 5 exists as a Platonic ideal, and it can also be implemented

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; so we can interact with it, as when there is a collection of 5 oranges, or 3 oranges and 2 apples,

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or 3 pairs of oranges and 2 triplets of apples, and so on, in infinite variety. The difficulty is that if we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; say that &quot;3+2=5&quot; as exemplified by 3 oranges and 2 apples is conscious, then should we also say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that the pairs+triplets of fruit are also conscious? If so, where do we draw the line? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure I understand your example.  Are you saying that by simply existing, two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apples and 3 oranges compute 2+3=5?  If so I would disagree.  I would say it is our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comprehending them as individual objects and also as a set that is the computation. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just hanging there on the trees they may be &quot;computing&quot; apple hanging on a tree, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apple hanging on a tree,... but they're not computing 2+3=5.
</em><br />
<br />What about my example in an earlier post of beads on an abacus? You can slide 2 beads to the left, then another 
<br />
3 beads to the left, and count a total of 5 beads; or 2 pairs of beads and 3 pairs of beads and count a total of 5 
<br />
pairs of beads, or any other variation. Perhaps it seems a silly example when discussing consciousness, but the most 
<br />
elaborate (and putatively conscious) computation can be reduced to a complex bead-sliding exercise. And if sliding 
<br />
beads computes 2+3=5, why not if 2 birds and then 3 birds happen to land on a tree, or a flock of birds of which 2 
<br />
are red lands on one tree and another flock of birds of which 3 are red lands on an adjacent tree? It is true that these 
<br />
birds and beads are not of much consequence computationally unless someone is there to observe them and interpret 
<br />
them, but what about the computer that is conscious chug-chugging away all on its own? 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;That is what I mean 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; when I say that any computation can map onto any physical system. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But as you've noted before the computation is almost all in the mapping.  And not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just in the map, but in the application of the map - which is something we do.  That 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; action can't be abstracted away.  You can't just say there's a physical system and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's a manual that would map it into some computation and stop there as though the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation has been done.  The mapping, an action, still needs to be performed.
</em><br />
<br />What if the computer is built according to some ridiculously complex plan, plugged in, then all the engineers, manuals, 
<br />
etc. disappear. If it was conscious to begin with, does it suddenly cease being conscious because no-one is able to 
<br />
understand it? It could have been designed according to the radioactive decay patterns of a sacred stone, in which 
<br />
case without the documentation, its internal states might appear completely random. With the documentation, it may be 
<br />
possible to understand what it is doing or even interact with it, and you have said previously that it is the potential for 
<br />
interaction that allows it to be conscious, but does that mean it gradually becomes less conscious as pages of the manual 
<br />
are ripped out one by one and destroyed, even though the computer itself does not change its activity as a result?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The physical structure and activity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of computer A implementing program a may be completely different to that of computer B implementing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; program b, but program b may be an emulation of program a, which should make the two machines 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; functionally equivalent and, under computationalism, equivalently conscious. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see any problem with supposing that A and B are equally conscious (or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unconscious).
</em><br />
<br />But there is a mapping under which any machine B is emulating a machine A. Figuring out this mapping does not change the 
<br />
physical activity of either A or B. You can argue that therefore the physical activity of A or B is irrelevant and consciousness 
<br />
is implemented non-corporeally by virtue of its existence as a Platonic object; or you can argue that this is clearly nonsense and 
<br />
consciousness is implemented as a result of some special physical property of a particular machine.
