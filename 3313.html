<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computer.

<br /><br />You can only bet on a level of description.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is by definition, finitely realizable, which isn't really true

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for things that really exist in the objective world. In reality, I am not

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;like an emulation of a computer running on a 'real' computer; code running

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computer makes no more sense to the 'cosmos' than does any other arbitrary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;arrangement of objects.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But the same can be said about the brain or the body. I don't understand
<br />
the nature of the difference you are supposing.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So is a physical computer an immaterial machine, or is it just an example of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an immaterial machine, that does actually exist in somewhere in Plationia,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or is it neither?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is neither. The physical aspect of the computer comes from
<br />
the covering of all immaterial description of that computer made
<br />
at all possible correct level of description existing in Platonia.
<br />
(look at the UDA; links at 
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Seeing that there is no rigerous way to define what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actually constitues a physical computer, and what does not, does it make any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sense to say &quot;my desktop computer&quot; has become conscious?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Your desktop computer cannot be conscious, nor can my brain.
<br />
If you succeed putting my mind (software) in your desktop
<br />
computer, your desktop computer will still not be conscious, but
<br />
it will make possible for me to talk with you (as my brain does
<br />
now). Only a person can be said conscious. And person, like
<br />
nation, or game are immaterial (with comp), and not absolutely
<br />
&quot;singularisable&quot; (only relatively).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As the entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe is eventually connected, I could prob. show and almost infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number of such machines, just by choosing arbitary points in space to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;represent the various units of my computer.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Which &quot;entire universe&quot; (quite undefined term for me). Which 
<br />
various units of your computer ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;OK, so memory may be a first person experience to us, but would it be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first person experience to an actual physical computer? All the parts of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical computer are mutually exclusive and rely on a specific physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;organisation, existing in the third-person in relation to each other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Therefore, there is no real sense in which the physical computer is in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first-person with regards to anything.
</em><br />
<br />All right, we agree on that. But this reasoning works for brains, bodies,
<br />
universes, etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It [the computer] is always going to perceive its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;memory in a third-person sense.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Why?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It perhaps is justified to say that that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;although this computer specifically is not conscious/1st-person, it is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;example of an equivalent that does exist somewhere in the platonic world or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the multiverse, and so in a certain sense, is conscious, but this seems a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bit dubious.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't see why. Would you agree to define axiomatise partially
<br />
consciousness as something we anticipate (partially instinctively)  
<br />
altough
<br />
we cannot communicate to others that we &quot;feel&quot; ourselves as conscious.
<br />
<br /><br />Neil Lion said in another post:
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [...] I have tried to draw a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distiniction between a computer (a concept) and a brain (a 'thing'). If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you like, a physical computer is meaningless to the fundamental process 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(sorry I lack a better term), whereas a brain is meaningful. I do believe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the brain has a large part to play in the question of consciousness.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This would entail that a brain is not emulable by a computer.
<br />
And this would entail the existence of a part of brain non emulable
<br />
by a computer. This would entail something like the use of an actual
<br />
infinite somewhere in the brain or the use or some substancial soul.
<br />
<br />What do you mean a brain is meaningful. An hard disk is also
<br />
meaningful. Are you a naturalist?
