<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I have been reading your paper &quot;Computation, Consciousness and the

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Why this puzzles me is that it seems obvious that if we &quot;loose $all$ the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have even 1-indeterminancy without the existence of at least one universe,

<br /><br />Hi Stephen,
<br />
<br />(You could have choose a passage with less orthographical errors :(
<br />
by &quot;loose&quot; I was meaning &quot;lose&quot;, of course ....)
<br />
<br />Coming back to your question.
<br />
It all depends what we really mean by &quot;universe&quot;.
<br />
Technically the loss of necessitation rule just forbid the use of the
<br />
possible world semantics. We loose the Kripke worlds, but we still
<br />
have notions of neighborhoods, deformed Kripke frames, etc.
<br />
It just means that the traditional Kripke tools are no more available.
<br />
But I am not sure those remarks will help because you are probably
<br />
using the word &quot;universe&quot; in the more ontological sense I was alluding
<br />
too.
<br />
<br />When I say it could be that there is no universe, I mean that it could
<br />
be that there is no stuffy, or substancial or primitive universe.
<br />
I will not try to be rigorous here, just convey the idea.
<br />
<br />Comp is the principle that you, me, people, persons, is (are)
<br />
sort of &quot;relative numbers&quot;. For example in a high techno-comp society
<br />
people understands this equivalence in a concrete way because they can
<br />
change their bodies like they can change their car, etc.
<br />
They remain &quot;invariant&quot; for
<br />
any change of stuff which conserve some amount of (classical, 
<br />
duplicable)information. Your number is *relative* to the choice
<br />
of your local implementation relatively to the story you are betting
<br />
the consistency.
<br />
Now a series of thought experiments
<br />
shows that once you accept such a possibility, then your relative
<br />
immateriality will automatically extend to all your possible environment.
<br />
<br />With comp you cannot know if you are implemented in a &quot;real stuffy&quot;
<br />
computer, or if you are implemented in a purely immaterial one 
<br />
&quot;living&quot; in Arithmetic. Actually comp force you to bet that your 
<br />
experience now
<br />
is an average off all the coherent stories compatible with what you take
<br />
as your memories. What is needed is a weak-logical sort of connectness.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Stephen:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How is it possible for me to even justify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my belief that I am actually sitting in front of my keyboard and computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;monitor and writting these words if &quot;we loose $all$ the universes&quot;?
</em><br />
<br /><br />We lose only the stuffy universes. We don't (necessary) lose the
<br />
coherent stories. We don't even lose the result of the observation
<br />
made by others (where observation = interaction) because there are evidences
<br />
that those stories are entangled in one way or in another ways.
<br />
(The hard thing is to derive the precise &quot;entangling rules&quot; from comp ...).
<br />
<br />All computations exist in Platonia if you want, so all dreams exists in
<br />
Platonia, (dreams, with comp, are just sheaf of computations seen 
<br />
from inside), so that you can only bet on some degree of consistency 
<br />
of the dream
<br />
you feel from inside (1-person experience).
<br />
<br />Computer science makes notion of consistency and
<br />
coherence mathematically manageable, although counterintuitive) and 
<br />
first results confirm that comp is still plausible (at least).
<br />
<br />Now you can (re)define &quot;universe&quot; as the average product of your
<br />
consistent computations making up your memories. Just remember it is
<br />
not made of smaller parts, it is just a (hopefully but most probably at
<br />
least partially sharable) dream which results ultimately from the many
<br />
many coherent relations between numbers. A stuffy universe does neither
<br />
explain what is the stuff it is made from, nor where does that stuff
<br />
comes from, nor how that stuff could be related to the experience we live
<br />
and, most probably, share.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     It could be that I do not understand how you reconstruct an appearence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of a 1-person expereince with only arithmetical realism and the church
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thesis.
</em><br />
<br />I do to things:
<br />
1) I listen to what you can say once you accept comp, if only for the
<br />
sake of the argument. (Through the universal dovetailler argument (UDA) for
<br />
example).
<br />
2) I listen to what the consistent machine can prove about herself
<br />
and about its probable (consistent and coherent) histories (Arithmetical
<br />
form of the UDA, make possible thanks to Godel, Lob, Solovay, and many
<br />
others.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your thesis (and that of Schmidhuber and others) explicitly excludes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any reality to the &quot;hardware&quot; required to &quot;implement&quot; the &quot;objects&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;represented by UTM's or equivalents and merely assumes the existence of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Platonia&quot; that exists a priori.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     This is mere hypostatiation and since we can prove, via your our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reasoning, the non-existence of the Necessitation rule for Z logics, what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difference does it make if we can merely point at pixels on our Monitors or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;spots of ink on our hardcopies and claim: &quot;See &quot;S4Grz = S4Grz*&quot;, that thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;... &quot;truth is provability, provability is truth&quot;&quot;. We can make any claim we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;like but if our theories themselves forbid the very exixtence of a universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such as the one containing 1-person experiences and some 3-indeterminant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;version of space-time-momentumenergy, this is all academic sophistry!
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is just intended as an (hopefully flawless) proof that AS FAR AS we
<br />
are willing to accept a digital brain substitution (betting on some
<br />
unknowable level) then, epistemologically, physics must be derivable from
<br />
machine psychology. (and &quot;ontologically&quot; what remains is proposition like
<br />
2+4=6, Fermat theorem, twin conjecture, computer science, etc...
<br />
essentially number theory + all the sciences you can get from number
<br />
theory seen from inside from some angle, and averaging on those angle, etc.).
<br />
<br />It makes comp eventually testable. Just compare the &quot;machine psycho&quot; physics
<br />
with the apparently empirical facts (well described by QM today). Of course
<br />
I tend to argue that QM really looks comp is true, cf the many 
<br />
world/histories, subtle averaging, + the technical results, ...
<br />
<br />I do not explicitly exclude the &quot;reality of the hardware&quot;. I show only that
<br />
such a reality cannot be used to explain why we believe in that reality.
<br />
So, indeed, as far as comp can be true, why to postulate it?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Please help me understand what I am missing!
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Then help me to understand what you are missing: let me know at which step
<br />
of the Universal Dovetailer Argument (links to UDA in my URL) you say no?
<br />
It would help to know where you find the argument unclear, or weak, 
<br />
or vague, etc.
<br />
Don't tell me you don't swallow the conclusion, no consistent 
<br />
machines really can!   (And remember comp can be false but we keep 
<br />
using it
<br />
as far as no clear contradiction (not just a sense of weirdness appears).
<br />
<br />Bruno
