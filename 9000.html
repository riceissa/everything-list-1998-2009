<br />
The idea that mathematical reality is fundamentally the same as physical
<br />
reality is not obviously true, but I don't believe it can be rejected
<br />
either as obviously false.  The goal in exploring that hypothesis is to
<br />
see if we can explain features of physical reality that are otherwise
<br />
inexplicable; and also, of course, to see whether the idea is even
<br />
coherent or is fundamentally contradictory.
<br />
<br />On its face, it is hard to see how numbers, which we think of as rather
<br />
simple and static entities, could be anything like the richness and
<br />
dynamism of the reality that we see around us.  But I can suggest two
<br />
reasons to think that this instinct is wrong.
<br />
<br />The first is that numbers are really far more complex than they seem.
<br />
When we think of numbers, we tend to think of simple ones, like 2, or 7.
<br />
But they are not really typical of numbers.  Even restricting ourselves to
<br />
the integers, the information content of the &quot;average&quot; number is enormous;
<br />
by some reasoning, infinite.  Most numbers are a lot bigger than 2 or 7!
<br />
They are big enough to hold all of the information in our whole universe;
<br />
indeed, all of the information in virtually every possible variant of our
<br />
universe.  A single number can (in some sense) hold this much information.
<br />
<br />So our instincts about numbers and their simplicity is not really correct.
<br />
Numbers in general are far from simple.  They are enormously more
<br />
complicated than we could ever comprehend.  This should give us reason
<br />
to doubt whether our other instincts about numbers are really as obvious
<br />
as they seem.  For example, nothing could seem more true than that a
<br />
number is a static value.  But perhaps, in the infinite complexity of
<br />
a typical number, there is room for a form of dynamism.
<br />
<br />It's useful to consider what is sometimes called the &quot;block universe&quot;
<br />
model.  This is a way to see that static and dynamic entities are not
<br />
really so different.  It is a typical way of analyzing things in special
<br />
relativity.  In this view, time is a fourth dimension.  We can map out
<br />
the whole universe as a four-dimensional object.  A slice through this
<br />
object at a given instant of time is the three-dimensional world at
<br />
a particular instant.
<br />
<br />On the one hand, we know that the universe is dynamic and ever-changing.
<br />
On the other, the four-dimensional block universe is a static object.
<br />
The apparent dynamism is seen as something of an illusion.  There is
<br />
no actual passage of time, rather all moments coexist.  The future and
<br />
the past are merely relative directions like north or south, relative
<br />
to some observer.
<br />
<br />The block universe (or spacetime) is not the only way to look at things,
<br />
but it is one valid way, and it illustrates that even within a static
<br />
object (the block universe) there may be the perception of dynamism from
<br />
the inside.  The point is, then, that conceivably a seemingly &quot;static&quot;
<br />
number of sufficient complexity could have similar internal dynamism.
<br />
<br />I'll mention one other way of looking at mathematics that can help to
<br />
see how physical reality could be thought of as a mathematical object.
<br />
There is more to math than numbers.  Much more.  Another elementary branch
<br />
of mathematics is geometry.  If it may seem strange to imagine living
<br />
in a number, it is perhaps much easier to imagine living in a geometry.
<br />
And yet, Descartes showed how to map geometric relations into numerical
<br />
ones, via his analytical geometry.
<br />
<br />Other types of mathematical objects include the many kinds of logic
<br />
that Bruno uses in his analyses.  There are also things like theorems
<br />
and other highly structured forms of information.  In fact, although
<br />
we speak of mathematical reality, a better term might be the reality
<br />
of logic, or even the reality of information.  Mathematics, logic and
<br />
similar fields all have to do with information.  Each field focuses on
<br />
particular kinds of information and the structures that lie within.
<br />
<br />Another kind of information is computer programs.  We can define an
<br />
abstract computer and analyze its effects as it runs abstract computer
<br />
programs.  This is fundamentally no different a process than analyzing
<br />
numbers, logic, geometry or other mathematical objects.  But with
<br />
computers we tend to make the time dimension explicit, again within
<br />
our abstract model.  The computer passes through a sequence of states.
<br />
And this makes it easier to imagine that our existence might somehow
<br />
correspond to the execution of even an abstract computer program.
<br />
<br />Again, this is not meant as a proof that physical reality is part of
<br />
mathematical or informational reality.  Rather, it is meant to dispell the
<br />
initial notion that it is a completely absurd proposition.  Evidence to
<br />
go beyond that, to allow arguing that it really is (or at least might be)
<br />
true, has to come from a different direction.
<br />
<br />The evidence in favor of the proposition would come from the kind of
<br />
reasoning used by physicists to advance multiverse and anthropic models.
<br />
Some physicists argue that they can best explain certain observations if
<br />
they assume that our universe is just one of many; in some cases, one of
<br />
an infinite number.  If we end up accepting that an infinite number of
<br />
universes &quot;really&quot; exist, having real physical reality, we are much closer
<br />
to accepting that all informational objects exist.  At least, it's much
<br />
harder to argue that the notion that they are one and the same is absurd.
<br />
<br />Ideally, we could then start to make predictions based on this
<br />
all-inclusive model which could be confirmed by experimental testing.
<br />
Obviously we are a long way from being able to do that.  I did make some
<br />
predictions a few months ago when I was describing my own ideas along
<br />
these lines, but they were pretty weak, and I had to make some strong
<br />
assumptions, beyond just the basic multiverse model, to get them.
<br />
<br />Still, with further work I believe that it will be possible to come up
<br />
with improved models and predictions that will allow various multiverse
<br />
models to be tested.  And it may yet turn out that the most inclusive
<br />
multiverse, Tegmark's Level 4 where all mathematical objects exist and
<br />
physical existence is just a subset of the mathematical, could be the
<br />
model that provides the simplest explanation for our observations.
