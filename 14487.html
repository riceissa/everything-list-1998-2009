<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think my main improvement, while not really coming close to really

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answering my question, was changing the goal from prove Russell's

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theorem is not always true to asking the question &quot;Is Russell's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theorem true in all logics?&quot;  A bonus seems that now there is a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretical physics, by way of the MUH, motivation for answering this

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />This is an important task.  As I mentioned, the direction of
<br />
concepts-progress is:  'towards maximum generalization' -- even 
<br />
absolute generalization, if you will.   An encompassing single
<br />
notion, or limited group of notions, that imply 'all else'.
<br />
Simplest principle(s).  Matching the sensibility connected
<br />
with a 'theory of everything'.  Simplest qualia.  
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. On that note, Physics/Philosophy actually what inspired me to go in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this direction.  I was mainly, back then when this idea of trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find a consistent universal set theory occurred to me, trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer a intended-to-be serious argument against the existence of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was stunned at the notion that someone was trying to prove the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe does not exist.  I think they were asserting some form of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solipsism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a nutshell, here was their argument.  My opinion is that it is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at all formal but very clever and probably persuasive but, ultimately,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like the many clever &quot;proofs&quot; that 1=2 and such.  It's just going to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be convincing to those who aren't vigorously attacking the argument,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which I soon did.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;begin their argument for the non-existence for the universe&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Definition: To contain means &lt;insert something most people would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accept here&gt;.  The notation and word for 'is contained in' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is&lt;in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thing and exists are undefined or ... acceptably defined only be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; common intuitive sense of what a thing is, but neither formally (in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her argument)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Definition: the universe (call it U) is a thing that has the property
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it contains all things, notated by (x) (x is&lt;in U), where x is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This in itself is a problematic conjecture (presumption).  So fundamental
<br />
in fact that no past or current analysis has enunciated the criteria-error.
<br />
(The reason for this is illuminated by Benj Whorf's linguistics analysis
<br />
circa 1936 ... which paraphrasedly states that, absent experiential recognition,
<br />
systemic information self-insulates on itself.)   In this case, the presumption
<br />
is that perfect quantification is possible; and in -that- basis, that probability 
<br />
valuations are designatable (fixed), for all situations and scenarios possible.
<br />
<br />That is -not- the 'generalized case'. Those presumptions, which classical non-FL
<br />
math is built on, is closely-defined and therefore godelianly incomplete.
<br />
<br />Specificly - there are at least two non-considered factors in conventional
<br />
computation: all possible simpletemporal-conditions, and, gross-set and
<br />
sub-setS of relations that 'exist' when the entire spectrum of simpletemporal
<br />
conditions are included.
<br />
<br />This situation stems from the mathematical principle: &quot;Simplfy&quot;.  Yes, it
<br />
helps remove extranous information-noise and makes some certain relationship
<br />
clear and identifiable.  But it also -removes- from thoughtful consideration
<br />
the information resident in and analytically important about - the total
<br />
mathematical environment.
<br />
<br />Let me give you a pragmatic example with at least two ramification
<br />
implications that conventional analysis/presumptions -totally miss-.
<br />
<br />Consider the gaussian-mean curve.  It has been classically analyzed 
<br />
to death; all things about it considered: complete/known.
<br />
<br />That is a major deficiency/error.
<br />
<br />Consider the equation form that produces the standard-deviation
<br />
curve.  It is known; isolated, independent.
<br />
<br />Now consider any 'real events' that produce and mimic/map the curve.
<br />
I like to use two, each which highlight two missing-consideration
<br />
factors.   First, is random test results from some 'standardized'
<br />
exam.  If you set up a criteria for accurate/innacurate answers,
<br />
the resulting spectrum is typically the standard deviation curve.
<br />
The time sequence of the answers registered is open, just the net 
<br />
patterned result.  In otherwords, the distribution curve misses
<br />
two essential input-factors: the reason the testing event happened,
<br />
and, the time frame of measurement.  The testing event is 'factored
<br />
out' -causal impetus/energy- brought to zero/one, the time frame of 
<br />
testing is 'factored out' (brought to zero/one).
<br />
<br /><br />Second is a pachinco apparatus, with balls falling though a
<br />
matrix of pegs.  Run enough sample events and you reproduce
<br />
gaussian mean-distributiuon curve.  But there are at least 
<br />
two missed factors/presumptions.  One is the presumption of 
<br />
component ordered-relations.  And relatedly, the presumption
<br />
of a stable universal impetus-field being present; it is
<br />
assumed, taken for granted, and ... 'factored out'.  The 
<br />
gravity/gradient field the apparatus resides in.
<br />
<br />Take the pachinco apparatus made of wooden pegs. Placed the 
<br />
board non-orthogonal to the gravity gradient field.  Run 
<br />
samples with matched-to-pegsize ball bearings and you get
<br />
the traditional result. 
<br />
<br />Run the sampling again, but use bowling balls.  The 'standard 
<br />
mean' curve is now and every time - a straight line.  This is 
<br />
an extreme, but ALSO IMPORTANT limit potential of the 
<br />
standard deviation.  Run the sampling again, using perfectly 
<br />
elastic/reflective particles and some runs produce the 
<br />
refraction patterns seen during the early atom-nucleus 
<br />
investigations - particles curved or shadowed by their
<br />
reaction to encounters with the form or fields of the 
<br />
atomic nuclei.  Run the sampling again with the balls and 
<br />
pegs matched as originally, but place the board flat on the 
<br />
ground orthogonal to the 'motivation' field of earths gravity;
<br />
or place the apparatus in far outerspace in the appropriate
<br />
'initial configuration for starting a test run'.  In both these
<br />
environmental situations/orientations -- nothing happens. No
<br />
'curve' or results get done.  In otherwords, absent an
<br />
impetus/gradient, no 'standard deviation' profile is produced.
<br />
<br />This means that there is a MISSING FACTOR which we discount
<br />
in computation work, because we presume SOME gradient or impetus
<br />
is 'always present' and need not be considered for existing ot
<br />
not.  It means that for general statement accuracy a 'g' gradient 
<br />
factor should be always written and stated ahead of the standard
<br />
equation form, to prevent its presence and potential impact on
<br />
evaluation be missed, dissed, and left out for those critical
<br />
conditions where the 'rate of event' or 'production of event
<br />
conditions' is ignored and remissly overlooked.
<br />
<br />So right off the bat, the analysis of statistical potential
<br />
IN ALL THINGS is deficient by not correctly including one or 
<br />
more time parameters (which coincides with: simultaneous
<br />
consideration of all-states, both when an entity or relation
<br />
is identifiably present, AND, when it/they are NOT.)  This means,
<br />
that standard traditional statistical analysis is a SUBSET,
<br />
a limit set, of QM statistics which considers both existential
<br />
and neg-existential factors (potentia) .. SIMULTANEOUSLY.
<br />
<br />Calculations are already deficient by not counting null-state
<br />
as a unit factor possibility. and null-state for each and
<br />
every non-null option.  
<br />
<br />When this is done, factorial enumeration counts become
<br />
insignificant.  When null states are -included- in states 
<br />
count, by the time you get to three existential non-null
<br />
count, the statistical alternatives of combinatoric options 
<br />
is OVER 100 alternative distinct 'relations states with
<br />
considered potentials'.  
<br />
<br />And this is just with re-analysis of -standard- non Fuzzy Logic
<br />
(which I prefer to call Zadeh Logic in respect and honor of
<br />
its delineator/designer).
<br />
<br />When you open the option parameters beyond 0,1 (which is no
<br />
less important than Complexity which now explores and uses
<br />
non-wholenumber 'dimensions' in exponents .. 'fractal dimensions')
<br />
you explore the fuller Stochastic space that logic must obligatorally
<br />
address and speak to as well.
<br />
<br />. 
<br />
.
<br />
.
<br />
. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
Consistency and completeness then require re-review in a fuller
<br />
and larger context. that the previous bounded-logics were, and are not, 
<br />
capable of dealing with.
<br />
<br />There is no longer: A and not-A.  There is conditional-A,  probable-A, 
<br />
never-A, partial-A, and ... each of these if/when/ever in union with
<br />
time parameter(s).  I.e., non-Abelian sequencing alternatives of all
<br />
factors needs to be included as well.  (got a headache yet?  :-) )
<br />
<br />For example, consider the 'options space' and 'options-potentials space' 
<br />
of the universe at any given moment (this generally ties in with 
<br />
multi-verse concepts, but puts a bit more meat on its bones ; and with 
<br />
critically present errors in entropy analysis as its currently performed). 
<br />
<br />At any given moment, scenario events and causal results-states, not only
<br />
open up and future enable potentials that did not exist moments before,
<br />
there is the SIMULTANEOUS extinction, preclusion, closure and PREVENTION
<br />
of equally or larger domains of states-options can can no longer possibly 
<br />
exist.
<br />
<br />Current analytical methods totally ignore considering such plural unbounded
<br />
potentials subsets; especially on a scale that includes cybernetic relations 
<br />
and transfinite spaces for existence, and alternative-existences, states,
<br />
and for relations/performance spaces concurrent with 'extancy'.
<br />
<br />Re-worded:  at any given moment and depending on which parameters and
<br />
extancy/potential set one uses as criteria for analysis .. some relational
<br />
entropies are increasing, while others are proportionally DEcreasing.
<br />
<br />Entropy is not monolithic, there are categorical sub-domains, AND, there 
<br />
are local regional proportionally changing domains.  AND entroepy is not
<br />
exclusively 'thermodynamic'.  Probability states differentials are evaluable 
<br />
and patternable .. there is gradientable sensibility assignable to all
<br />
sorts of parameters.  Each and every one has its own, and comparable to others,
<br />
entroepy aspect/gradient. 
<br />
<br /><br />These and more are absolutely Zadeh Logic options, that standard logic, 
<br />
computation, physics, conventional analysis is not built to evaluate;
<br />
and are deficient because of that.
<br />
<br />Godelian incompleteness theorems - when generalized - wholly miss
<br />
important information, ignore relational constants, that are 
<br />
superior and universal.
<br />
<br />.
<br />
.
<br />
.
<br />
<br />I know I didn't address your 'universe doesn't exist' logic review.
<br />
You were exampling a viable logic/analysis that is problematic and
<br />
illuminates for you the possibility that logic as currently practiced
<br />
harbors inconsistencies and errors, and you want to explore other
<br />
possibilities.  I understand that.  I agree with the anomaly you
<br />
identify and gave you reason to explore 'something else' and question
<br />
the 'what is'.
<br />
<br />My above remarks showcased a few of the anomalies -I- recognized and 
<br />
the conclusions I reached on re-review of ideas/understandings.
<br />
<br />I -know- you are on a correct path of thinking/exploring.
<br />
Lots of great possibilities are ahead of you.
<br />
<br />I found some wonderful things, like how to determine the
<br />
ratio of any-dimensioned sphere, volume::surface area,
<br />
without having to do any exotic calculus calculations.
<br />
I discovered that the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle
<br />
is a direct statement of spacetime geometry, a particular
<br />
limit equation of relativity options.  In otherwords,
<br />
QM has a direct connection with Relativity. (!)
<br />
<br />All sorts of new-realities are in the math. The uncourageous
<br />
and overly habituated practitioners could never discover them.
<br />
<br />Good luck on -your- journey of discovery.
