<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; points of view of number ... ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Insofar as we accept that the foundation of 'comp reality' is the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number realm, comp physics must indeed be a branch of this (e.g. as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; per my previous example of 'digital digestion').
</em><br />
<br /><br />That the 'comp reality' is founded on the number realm, is almost 
<br />
trivial. What is not trivial at all, and this is what the UDA shows, is 
<br />
that, once you say &quot;yes&quot; to the digital doctor, for some level of 
<br />
substitution, then your immateriality (somehow like the quantum 
<br />
superpositions) is contagious on your most probable neighborhoods. So 
<br />
that physics has to be shown to emerge statistically from the &quot;measure&quot; 
<br />
on the UD accessible relative states. Withouth this, the arithmetical 
<br />
interview would not lead to making comp testable.
<br />
This reasoning shows really the incompleteness of Everett's work: once 
<br />
you accept the observer can be locally described by its digital memory 
<br />
states, the laws of physics have to emerge from all comp histories.
<br />
We can discuss that too, although it is not entirely needed for 
<br />
grasping how to derive physics from comp. To be sure, it is needed, 
<br />
however, for the understanding that with comp, we *have to* derive the 
<br />
physics from &quot;intensional numbers prevailing discourses&quot;. With comp, 
<br />
postulating a physical world cannot be used as an explanation relating 
<br />
mind and appearance of matter (memory-stable observations).
<br />
It is not that (aristotelian primary )substance does not exist, but 
<br />
that such primary substance is provably (with the comp hyp) void of 
<br />
explanation power.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK. Don't buy it if you decide to buy only one book on Godel, and let
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; me think which is the best one. But if you are willing to buy/read two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; books, then get it asap.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'In for a penny, in for a pound' (old English saying) - I've ordered a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cheap(ish) copy of Franzen on Godel.  But let me know which you think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the best one.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, I should perhaps take the opportunity of your book open mindness 
<br />
to suggest some books I have already advertized on the list.
<br />
Comp is related to computations, computing, and computability. 
<br />
Fortunately we will need mainly the computability theory, which in some 
<br />
sense is more easy than computing theory. The best book is without 
<br />
doubt the one by Cutland:
<br />
<br />CUTLAND N. J., 1980, Computability An introduction to recursive 
<br />
function theory,
<br />
Cambridge University Press.
<br />
<br /><br />Then, you have a &quot;recreative&quot; introduction to the modal logic of 
<br />
self-reference, the system known as G (but also GL, Prl, K4W, etc.). 
<br />
Unfortuantely the most important chapter &quot;the heart of the matter&quot; need 
<br />
a good understanding of Cutland (say) to make the link.
<br />
<br />SMULLYAN R., 1987, Forever Undecided, Alfred A. Knopf, New York.
<br />
<br />Then, the best textbook on mathematical self-reference is the book by 
<br />
Boolos 1993. But this one is probably a bit heavy to begin with. So 
<br />
wait to see if your curiosity will be enough high. It does contain a 
<br />
full chapter on the &quot;third hypostase&quot;; alias the first person, alias 
<br />
the knower, alias the modal logic S4Grz, or its purely arithmetical 
<br />
interpretation.
<br />
<br />BOOLOS, G. 1993, The Logic of Provability. Cambridge University Press, 
<br />
Cambridge.
<br />
<br />Or perhaps better (lighter) is its predecessor book on the subject, in 
<br />
the lucky case you find it (in a library?). I would be Dover Edition, I 
<br />
would print a paperback of that book;
<br />
<br /><br />BOOLOS, G. 1979,  The unprovability of consistency. Cambridge 
<br />
University Press, London.
<br />
<br /><br />Actually, if you have good eyes, the textbook by Smorynski is also 
<br />
quite valuable (and complementary to Boolos on many aspects):
<br />
<br />SMORYNSKI, C., 1985,  Smoryński, P. (1985). Self-Reference and Modal 
<br />
Logic. Springer Verlag, New York.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think we may have to come back later to this question of subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; time.  But for now I rely on you to set the agenda of our more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; structured modus operandi.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Ok thanks.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then for the rest, I'll wait for your next post.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />OK. I will begin by saying two words on the language we will use when 
<br />
discussing with the machine. I can already explain the difference 
<br />
between the layman (or grandmother) and the logician. This is not just 
<br />
for you (I guess you know what I will say) but for those who just 
<br />
abandon logic for reason of notation.
<br />
<br />The main difference is that where a layman says &quot;Alfred is serious&quot;, 
<br />
the logician says serious(Alfred).
<br />
<br />Where the layman will say there is a ferocious dog, a logician will say 
<br />
that it exists something such that that something is a dog and is 
<br />
ferocious. Because of laziness he will write Ex(dog(x) &amp; ferocious(x)). 
<br />
For saying that all dogs are ferocious, he will say that for all dogs 
<br />
(i.e. choose any thing that is a dog) that things will be ferocious: 
<br />
and he will write Ax (dog(x) -&gt; ferocious(x)).
<br />
<br />Of course, there is perhaps no effective test to see if a dog is 
<br />
ferocious or not, perhaps the notion is not well defined, but we have 
<br />
to live with things like that: even in the pure realm of numbers we 
<br />
will encounter some unexpected (I guess) complexity.
<br />
<br />By the way, David, do you know what is called &quot;classical propositional 
<br />
calculus&quot;, the truth table method? Do you need some refreshing?
<br />
Some refreshing is in Smullyan's FU, but I can do it, or focus on some 
<br />
difficulty (classical propositional calculus is not so simple indeed, 
<br />
even if simpler than most other logics).
<br />
