Hi Stathis,
<br />
<br />I think that your example below was helpful to clarify the disagreement.
<br />
You say that randomly sampling from all the files is not 'how real life
<br />
works'.  However, if you did randomly sample from all the files the result
<br />
would not be different from the selective time ordered sampling you suggest,
<br />
as long as the effect of dying (reducing the absolute measure) can be
<br />
ignored.
<br />
<br /><br />If I'm sampled by the computer, I'll have the recollection of having been a
<br />
continuum of previous states, even though these states may not have been
<br />
sampled for quite some while. I'll subjectively experience a linear time
<br />
evolution. The order in which the computer chooses to generate me at various
<br />
instances doesn't matter.
<br />
<br /><br />There are a few reasons why I believe in the ''random sampling''. First of
<br />
all, random sampling seems to be necessary to avoid the Doomsday Paradox.
<br />
See this article written by Ken Olum:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0009081">http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0009081</a>
<br />
<br /><br />He explains here why you need the Self Indicating Assumption. The self
<br />
indicating assumption amounts to adopting an absolute measure that is
<br />
proportional to the number of observers.
<br />
<br /><br />Another reason has to do with the notion of time. I don't believe that
<br />
events that have happened or will happen are not real while events that are
<br />
happening now are real. They have to be treated in the same way. The fact
<br />
that I experience time evolution is a first person phenomena.
<br />
<br /><br />Finally, QTI (which more or less follows if you adopt the time ordered
<br />
picture), implies that for the most part of your life you should find
<br />
yourself in an a-typical state (e.g. very old while almost everyone else is
<br />
very young).
<br />

Onderwerp: objections to QTI
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I thought the following analogy might clarify the point I was trying to
</em><br />
make
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in recent posts to the &quot;Many Pasts? Not according to QM&quot; thread,
</em><br />
addressing
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one objection to QTI.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are a player in the computer game called the Files of Life. In this
</em><br />
game
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computer  generates consecutively numbered folders which each contain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiple text files, representing  the multiple potential histories of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; player at that time point. Each folder F_i contains N_i files. The first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; folder, F_0,  contains N_0 files each describing possible events soon
</em><br />
after
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your birth. You choose one of the  files in this folder at random, and
</em><br />
from
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this the computer generates the next folder, F_1, and places in it N
</em><br />
files
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representing N possible continuations of the story. If you die going from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; F_0 to F_1, that  file in F_1 corresponding to this event is blank, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; blank files are deleted; so for the first  folder N_0=N, but for the next
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one N_1&lt;=N, allowing for deaths. The game then continues: you  choose a
</em><br />
file
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at random from F_1, from this file the computer generates the next folder
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; F_2  containing N_2 files, then you choose a file at random from F_2, and
</em><br />
so
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It should be obvious that if the game is realistic, N_i should decrease
</em><br />
with
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increasing i, due  to death from accidents (fairly constant) + death from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; age related disease. The earlier folders  will therefore on average
</em><br />
contain
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many more files than the later folders. Now, it is argued that  QTI is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible because a randomly sampled observer moment from your life is
</em><br />
very
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unlikely to  be from a version of you who is 1000 years old, which has
</em><br />
very
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; low measure compared with a  younger version. The equivalent argument for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Files of Life would be that since the earlier  files are much more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numerous than the later files, a randomly sampled file from your life (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; created by playing the game) is very unlikely to represent a 1000 year old
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; version of you, as  compared with a younger version. This reasoning would
</em><br />
be
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sound if the &quot;random sampling&quot; were  done by mixing up all the files, or
</em><br />
all
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the OM's, and pulling one out at random. But this is not  how the game
</em><br />
works
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it is not how real life works. From the first person viewpoint, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't matter how many files are in the folder because you only choose
</em><br />
one
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at each step, spend  the same time at each step, and are no more likely to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find yourself at one step rather than  another. As long as there is at
</em><br />
least
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *one* file in the next folder, it is guaranteed that you  will continue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; living. Similarly, as long as there is at least *one* OM in your future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which  represents a continuation from your present OM, you will continue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; living.
