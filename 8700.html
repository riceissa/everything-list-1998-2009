I haven't participated in the list in a while, but I try to keep up with 
<br />
the discussion here and there as time permits.  I personally was raised 
<br />
a fundamentalist Baptist, but lost most of my interest in that religion 
<br />
when I was taught at 9 years old that all the little kids in Africa that 
<br />
are never told about Jesus Christ go to Hell.  Even at 9, I knew that 
<br />
wasn't something I was going to be buying.  Who wants to believe in a 
<br />
God that cruel?  Even without the problematic cruel creator, I have 
<br />
always been to oriented toward logic and proof to just accept stuff on 
<br />
faith.
<br />
<br />I started redeveloping religious belief, ironically, when I picked up a 
<br />
book on quantum physics 6 or so years ago.  I was at a legal seminar and 
<br />
needed something to read during the boring  sessions, and the author ran 
<br />
through a number of experiments of QM and concluded that the MWI was the 
<br />
most logical interpretation of these experiments.  I had read all the 
<br />
Sci Fi strories of alternate realities and whatnot, but this was my 
<br />
first exposure to the concept that reality is created in such a way to 
<br />
allow all things to exist (that also actually appeared to be supported 
<br />
by some real science).  I still remember my excitement in  contemplating 
<br />
this explanation, in that it seems to explain so many questions. 
<br />
<br />I guess I could go into a long explanation as to why I now believe 
<br />
intelligence plays a key role in understanding the nature of our reality 
<br />
and how it came to be, but I probably wouldn't be able to say much that 
<br />
almost anyone on this board has not already heard.  For me it boils down 
<br />
to this: I see absolutely no reason to believe our experiences are not 
<br />
emulable.  I strongly suspect it is possible to create a quantum 
<br />
computer.  I strongly suspect technology will continue to evolve and 
<br />
computer processing will get more and more powerful.  Finally, even if 
<br />
we are somehow precluded from creating new universes in the future (i.e. 
<br />
universes implented on the same level of reality as our universe, 
<br />
virtual universes are obviously possible), the one we are in will last 
<br />
for trillions of years.  Final conclusion?  Well, I'll let you do the 
<br />
math...

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; We can argue about the precise definition of words, but I think a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; fundamental point is missed if religion and atheism are put on a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; par. It is like the Christian fundamentalists' demand that &quot;creation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; science&quot; be taught in schools alongside evolutionary biology, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; because nobody can reasonably claim that evolutionary biology is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; *certainly* true and &quot;creation science&quot; *certainly* false.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a clear difference between, on the one hand, believing x 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; despite the lack of any supporting evidence and, on the other hand, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; not believing x because of the lack of any supporting evidence - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; especially if x is something inherently bizarre or incredible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Here you make a point. But this is because &quot;creation science&quot; is just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not a science. Those who pretend it is a science are just doing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rhetorical tricks.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Perhaps one day &quot;creation science&quot; will appear. This would be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; case if &quot;creation science&quot; (the doctrine that the best explanation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for the existence of the universe is that God has made it recently in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; less than 7 days) is made enough precise to not only be tested but to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; provide a best overview of reality, etc. But of course today this is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not the case, and &quot;creation science&quot;, *as* a science is much more a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; like a fuzzy speculation predicting and actually explaining nothing. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Their proponents just are no playing the game.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but this is the problem with belief in a personal God versus 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-belief. Theism would be an empirical, or equivalently scientific, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief if its proponents were consistent: if God intervenes in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world, then by definition he must leave some evidence of this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intervention. (The alternative believers' position is deism, the idea 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that God made the world but then refrained from any further 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interventions in its affairs. Deism has never really inspired 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; religious devotion like theism has.) The reality is, however, that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is less evidence for religious beliefs than there is for most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bizarre secular beliefs, such as the belief that Elvis is alive, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that aliens regularly abduct humans to experiment on them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is worth stressing that what normally counts for religious belief 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (in the Western tradition) is *not* a vague deism, but very specific 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beliefs about a Personal God: for example, that he caused one third of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; himself to be born of a virgin so that he could live as a human and, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though immortal and destined to rise again, die a horrible death in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order to save  humans from being punished for Adam and Eve's original 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transgression against God in the Garden of Eden at the instigation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a snake which told Eve she and Adam would lose their ignorance if they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ate the fruit of a certain forbidden (by God) tree; and that anyone 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who believes this and admits he is a miserable sinner will go to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Heaven, while non-believers will suffer eternal torment in Hell. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean, give me Elvis and aliens with anal probes any time...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now, most people who says &quot;I don't believe in God&quot;, in general 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; believe in a &quot;physical or material&quot; universe; and that is still a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sort of religious belief. Atheist are not just believer because they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; believe in 0 God, as George put it, but also because they replace God 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; by something else, without really explaining what it is and how it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; helps us to figure what exist, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In my state of ignorance I would even say that for me GOD and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; UNIVERSE are both enough fuzzy that distinguishing them at the start 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could be a 1004 fallacy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But, perhaps unlike some of you, I did not get any religious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; education, and all what I know in &quot;theology&quot; comes from study and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experience, and all what I do appreciate in the Monism of the Jewish, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Muslim and Christian theologies (but present also in some Chinese and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Indian philosophical systems) seems to be the parts they have kept 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from the pre-Christian and pre-Muslim neo-Platonician theology. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Today's catholic theologians who insist too much on the quality in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rigour of that type of theology get trouble with the Roman Authority.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If GOD and UNIVERSE are fuzzy and difficult to distinguish, you're 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very far from talking about the God of people who are religious.
