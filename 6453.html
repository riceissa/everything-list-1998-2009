<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life as a million year old?
</em><br />
<br />I don't think there are any guarantees in life!
<br />
<br />I don't see a well defined meaning about anything I am guaranteed to
<br />
experience.
<br />
<br />I am influenced by Wei Dai's approach to the fundamental problem of what
<br />
our expectations should be in the multiverse.  He focused not on knowledge
<br />
and belief, but on action.  That is, he did not ask what we expect, he asked
<br />
what we should do.
<br />
<br />How should we behave?  What are the optimal and rational actions to take
<br />
in any given circumstances?  These questions are the domain of a field
<br />
which, like game theory, is a cross between mathematics, philosophy and
<br />
economics: decision theory.
<br />
<br />Classical decision theory is uninformed by the AUP, but it does include
<br />
similar concepts.  You consider that you inhabit one of a virtually
<br />
infinite number of possible worlds, which in this theory are not real but
<br />
rather represent your uncertainty about your situtation.  For example,
<br />
in one possible world Bigfoot has sneaked up behind you but you don't
<br />
know it, and in other worlds he's not there.  You then use this world
<br />
concept to set up a probability distribution, and make your decision
<br />
based on optimal expected outcome over all possible worlds.
<br />
<br />Incorporating the multiverse can be done in a couple of ways.  I think Wei
<br />
proposed just to add the entire multiverse as among the possible worlds.
<br />
Maybe we live in a multiverse, maybe we don't.  The hard part is then,
<br />
supposing that we do, how do we rank the expected outcomes of our actions?
<br />
Each action affects the multiverse in a complex way, being beneficial
<br />
in some branches and harmful in others.  How do we weight the different
<br />
branches?  Wei proposed to treat that weighting as an arbitrary part of
<br />
the user's utility function; in effect, making it a matter of taste and
<br />
personal preference how to weight the multiverse branches.
<br />
<br />I would aim to get a little more guidance from the theory than that.
<br />
I would first try to incorporate the measure of the various branches
<br />
which my actions influence, and pay more attention to the branches with
<br />
higher measure.  Then, I think I would pay more attention to the effects
<br />
in those branches on observers (or observer-moments) which are relatively
<br />
similar to me.  However, that does not mean I would ignore the effects
<br />
of my actions on high-measure branches where there are no observers
<br />
similar to me (i.e. branches where I have died).  I might still take
<br />
measures such as buying life insurance for my children, because I care
<br />
about their welfare even in branches where I don't exist.  Similarly,
<br />
if I were a philanthropist, I might take care to donate my estate to
<br />
good causes if I die.
<br />
<br />These considerations suggest to me an optimal course of action in a
<br />
multiverse, or even in a world where we are not sure if we live in a
<br />
single universe or a multiverse, which is arguably the situation we
<br />
all face.  It rejects the simplicity of the RSSA and QTI by recognizing
<br />
that our actions influence even multiverse branches where we die, and
<br />
taking into consideration the effects of what we do on such worlds.
<br />
There is still an element of personal preference in terms of how much we
<br />
care about observers who are very similar to ourselves vs those who are
<br />
more different, which gives room for various philosphical views along
<br />
these lines.
<br />
<br />And in terms of your question, I would not act as though I expected to
<br />
be guaranteed a very long life span, because the measure of that universe
<br />
is so low compared to others where I don't survive.
<br />
