<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its standard semantics).

<br /><br />UDA still works with very big weakening of comp, which I don't mention  
<br />
usually for pedagogical purpose. The fact that the first person cannot  
<br />
be aware of delays, together with the fact that the UD generates the  
<br />
reals extend the comp consequences to machine with all kind of oracles.
<br />
The AUDA is even less demanding, and works for highly non effective  
<br />
notion of &quot;belief&quot;. Instead of using the Gödel provability predicate  
<br />
we can use non effective notion like &quot;truth in all model of ZF&quot;, or  
<br />
even &quot;truth in all transitive models of ZF&quot;. In that last case G and  
<br />
G* can be effectively extended.
<br />
<br />To my knowledge the only scientist being explicitly non mechanist is  
<br />
Penrose. Even Searle who pretends to be a non mechanist appears to  
<br />
refer to machine, for the brain, which are Turing emulable. Then  
<br />
Searles make error in its conception of &quot;mind implementation&quot; and  
<br />
&quot;simulation&quot;  like Hofstadter and Dennett have already very well  
<br />
criticized. The comp reasoning begins to be in trouble with machines  
<br />
using discrete set of actual infinities. Analog machine based on  
<br />
notion of interval are mostly Turing emulable. You have to diagonalize  
<br />
or use other logical tools in some sophisticate way to build  
<br />
analytical machine which are non turing emulable. Nothing in physics  
<br />
or in nature points on the existence of those &quot;mathematical  
<br />
weirdness&quot;, with the notable &quot;collapse of the wave packet&quot; (exploited  
<br />
by Penrose, but also by many dualists).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The narrower type of machine is restricted to be computable.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is logically narrower. But no weakening of comp based on nature is  
<br />
known to escape the replicability. Even the non cloning theorem in QM  
<br />
cannot be used to escape the UDA conclusion. You have to introduce  
<br />
explicit use of actual infinities. This is very akin to a  
<br />
&quot;substantialisation&quot; of soul. I respect that move, but I have to  
<br />
criticize unconvincing motivations for it.
<br />
Comp entails the existence of uncomputable observable phenomena. It is  
<br />
normal to be attracted to the idea that non computability could play a  
<br />
role in the mind. But this consists to build a machine based on the  
<br />
many sharable computations going through the turing state of the  
<br />
machine and this gives &quot;quantum machine&quot;, which are turing emulable  
<br />
although not in real time, but then they play their role in the  
<br />
Universal Deployment.
<br />
<br />Of course you can just say &quot;NO&quot; to the doctor. But by invoking a non  
<br />
turing emulable &quot;machine&quot;, you take the risk of being asked which one.  
<br />
Up to now, as far as I know, this exists in mathematics, but there are  
<br />
no evidence it exists in nature, except those using the kind of  
<br />
indeterminacy which can be explain with the comp hypothesis.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; All known physical causal system are Turing emulable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am no physicist, but I've been trying to look up stuff on that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issue... Schmidhuber asserts in multiple places that the fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differential equations are used to describe physics does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contradict its computability, but he does not explain.
</em><br />
<br />The SWE is linear. It makes the quantum object directly turing  
<br />
emulable (mostly by dovetailing if you are using a sequential  
<br />
processor). The solution are linear combination of complex  
<br />
exponential. Obviously e, PI and i are computable reals.
<br />
It is far more difficult, and perhaps false, to say that Newtonian  
<br />
Physics is Turing emulable. Newton himself was aware of action at a  
<br />
distance for its gravitational law. But anything so weird has been  
<br />
usually considered as an evidence that Newtonian Physics could not be  
<br />
taken literaly.
<br />
To reintroduce such bizarre feature in nature just to contradict the  
<br />
comp hyp is a bit ironical. It is like Bohmian reformulation of  
<br />
Quantum Mechanics: to make a theory more complex to avoid  
<br />
interpretation judged as unpleasant.
<br />
<br />This subject is made difficult because there are no standard notion of  
<br />
computability with the real numbers (despite many attempts to find one).
<br />
If someone know better ... Non comp theories have to be rather exotic.  
<br />
Of course this is not an argument for the truth of comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know that,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for example, Wolfram is attempting a computable foundation for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics, but I don't know about any real progress... so any info would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be appreciated.
</em><br />
<br />Wolfram like Schmidhuber believes there could be a computable  
<br />
universe. The &quot;whole&quot; could be computable. But in that case the UDA  
<br />
shows that the universe is a mathematical one, and indeed can be  
<br />
described by any universal dovetailer. But the *physical* universe  
<br />
emerging from inside will have some uncomputable feature. This comes  
<br />
from the fact that we are necessarily ignorant about which  
<br />
computations support us, and that, below our substitution level, we  
<br />
have to take into account of a a non enumerable set of computations.  
<br />
(More in the UDA).
<br />
<br />An interesting book on the computability with the reals containing   
<br />
some of the construction mentioned above, is:
<br />
<br />POUR-EL M. B., RICHARD J. I., 1989, Computability in Analysis and  
<br />
Physics, Springer-Verlag, Berlin.
<br />
<br />If I remember well you can find in this book a computable function  
<br />
having a non computable derivative!
<br />
<br />See also this link, and related links for the analog/digital problem,  
<br />
or search on &quot;universal analog machine&quot; or &quot;turing analog machine&quot;.
