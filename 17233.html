2009/8/13 Rex Allen &lt;rexallen314.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Causality.  Causality.  Causalty.  Hmmm.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So really I am arguing against causal explanations.  I think this the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; core of my current argument.  The feeling that something is happening
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *NOW* is just another example of qualia I think.  The certainty of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feeling that *that* caused *this*...more qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Causality doesn't get you anywhere, because it doesn't start cleanly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is why I keep bringing up &quot;uncaused&quot; beginnings.  If *this*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happened because of *that*, then why did *that* happen?  You can't get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the start of it in a way that makes sense.
</em><br />
<br />I think there's the all-too-present risk of getting hung up on
<br />
vocabulary here.  Perhaps the sense of 'causal' you're having a
<br />
problem with is summed up in Wittgenstein's (other ) well-known
<br />
dictum: &quot;Not how the world is, but that it is, is the mystery&quot;.  The
<br />
sense in which I've been using it focuses on 'how', not 'that', which
<br />
at least leaves us something to say.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1)  Realizing that deterministic classical physics meant no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; libertarian free will when I was 21 years old or so, about 02 minutes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before a professor wrote on the chalk board in big letters &quot;NO FREE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; WILL&quot;.  For those 2 minutes though, I was really thunderstruck.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought &quot;Holy crap, this is incredible!  Am I the first person to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realize this???&quot;   So I spent the next 09 years or so trying to come to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grips with the implications of that, which was hard, because I really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wanted to take full credit for all the great things I'd done.  But,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then as my 30th birthday came and went, I decided maybe I didn't have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that many great things to take credit for after all, so screw free
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will.  Who needs it anyway.
</em><br />
<br />Indeed.  It doesn't get that much better after thirty either.  But as
<br />
we've said, the real insight only comes when we see *whose* will we're
<br />
talking about.  What we choose is ours; that part we can be sure of -
<br />
the freedom bit is more of an exploration.  But as they say, the sign
<br />
of maturity is taking ownership.  And exploring can be fun.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2)  My introduction to functionalism and computationalism and some of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the related issues like the strange implications of multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realizeability via Hans Moravec's book &quot;Robot: Mere Machine to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Transcendent Mind&quot; in the late 1990s.  This gave me something to think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about in my spare time for several years.
</em><br />
<br />Fascinating stuff.  You've no doubt perused the ongoing and recent
<br />
discussion of this stuff here and elsewhere.  Bruno's work sheds real
<br />
light on this, I believe.  Again, if the 'ownership' issues aren't
<br />
faced head-on: confusion and paradox.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3)  AND, most recently, about 18 months ago, when I finally got around
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to reading David Chalmers' paper &quot;Facing Up to the Problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consciousness&quot;.  I'd heard a little about the &quot;hard problem&quot; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness prior to that, and I was familiar with the basic issues,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I didn't fully understand until that moment.  It wasn't quite the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shock that my free will &quot;discovery&quot; had been, but it was still a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment of revelation, where one second I didn't see the problem at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all, and the next second I couldn't believe that I had failed to see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it for so long.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, Chalmers' work has been a great stimulus, although in the end I
<br />
think he finks out.  He doesn't seem to get that the whole zombie
<br />
thing is caused by his dogmatic assumption of the 'causal closure' of
<br />
physics.  He's still mesmerised by an epistemology he takes to have
<br />
been incontrovertibly established as the unique ontological substrate
<br />
(&quot;Theory of Everything&quot; - what a great slogan!)  Or rather he seems to
<br />
glimpse the problem - and what the fix is - but in the end he backs
<br />
away into yet another version of epiphenomenal psycho-physical
<br />
parallelism.  This is what I mean by paradox and confusion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since then I've put a lot more time into trying to understand what it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all means.  And I'm leaning towards concluding that it doesn't &quot;mean&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything.  It just is.  Which is a strange conclusion to come to after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 18 months of pretty intense thought...
</em><br />
<br />Yes, it can seem that it doesn't mean anything.  But *you* mean
<br />
something, don't you?  Hang on though - just who is this 'you' anyway?
<br />
&nbsp;Didn't we conclude earlier on that 'you'  - your point of view, your
<br />
experience, your intentions, your very 'self' - are just on loan from
<br />
'it'?   Mightn't that suggest that 'it' has rights of possession on
<br />
anything of  'yours'?  Hmm...
<br />
<br />Still sure it doesn't mean anything?
<br />
