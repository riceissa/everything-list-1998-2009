<br />
I have been on vacation so I have a large backlog of messages to read!
<br />
But they are very interesting and full of challenging ideas.  I find this
<br />
list to be one of the best I have ever been on in terms both of fearlessly
<br />
exploring difficult areas and also remaining cordial and polite.
<br />
<br />I am trying to understand Lee Corbin's idea about duplicates as selves
<br />
better.  I can understand seeing exact, synchronized duplicates as
<br />
selves (such as two computers running the same simulated individual
<br />
in lock-step).  But when they begin to diverge I understand that Lee
<br />
still sees them as (in some sense) &quot;himself&quot; and one copy would in fact
<br />
sacrifice to benefit a diverged copy just as much(?) as to benefit its
<br />
own body.  Is this right?
<br />
<br />What I would ask is, is there a limit to this?  Is this common-self-ness
<br />
a matter of degree, or is it all-or-none?  Is there some degree of
<br />
divergence after which a copy might be somewhat reluctant to continue
<br />
to view its brother copy as being exactly equivalent to itself?
<br />
<br />For example, what if someone were an identical twin?  In some sense they
<br />
are duplicates at the moment of conception who then begin to diverge.
<br />
This seems to be different from the copies we discuss merely in degree
<br />
of divergence, not in kind.  Would it be reasonable to argue that an
<br />
identical twin &quot;should&quot; view his brother as himself?
<br />
<br />And what about the possibility of creating non-identical copies?
<br />
Perhaps our copying machine is imperfect and the products are not quite
<br />
the same as the original.  They are very close, perhaps so close that
<br />
only extremely detailed inspection can detect the differences.  Or perhaps
<br />
they are not really so close at all and the copies in fact bear little
<br />
resemblance to their originals.  How does the potential existence of such
<br />
imperfect copying machines affect the notion that one should view copies
<br />
as selves?
<br />
<br />If imperfect or diverged copies are to be considered as lesser-degree
<br />
selves, is there an absolute rule which applies, an objective reality
<br />
which governs the extent to which two different individuals are the
<br />
same &quot;self&quot;, or is it ultimately a matter of taste and opinion for the
<br />
individuals involved to make the determination?  Is this something that
<br />
reasonable people can disagree on, or is there an objective truth about
<br />
it that they should ultimately come to agreement on if they work at it
<br />
long enough?
<br />
