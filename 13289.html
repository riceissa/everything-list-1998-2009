<br />
Very interesting Max.  Filled with erudite ideas and a depth of
<br />
knowledge far greater than mine!
<br />
<br />Can't comment much on the technical stuff, but can talk about the
<br />
ontological assumptions.  The trouble with Platonism is that it's far
<br />
too simplistic.  *all* mathematical concepts are lumped into the same
<br />
category, which are then defined to exist objectively.  Of course,
<br />
those who think mathematics is only a human invention (nominalists)
<br />
make exactly the same mistake as the Platonists.  They lump *all*
<br />
mathematical concepts together, then define the lump to be a social
<br />
construct.
<br />
<br />But before one starts talking about mathematical concepts, one must be
<br />
careful to distinguish between *kinds* of mathematical concepts.  I
<br />
think that *some* mathematical concepts exist objectively, some
<br />
don't.  I think we need to be careful to distinguish between
<br />
*Cognitive Models* (which make references to *mathematical objects*
<br />
which really do objectively) and *Cognitive Tools* (which include
<br />
*mathematical procedures* for reasoning about reality).  So the
<br />
distinction here is between *mathematical objects* and *mathematical
<br />
cognitive tools*.
<br />
<br />We need to remember that if all the universe is math, intelligent
<br />
observers have to *use* math to learn about math.  The way observers
<br />
use math *internally* to reason about mathematical things *externally*
<br />
leads to the division between *mathematical cognitive tools*
<br />
(subjective) and *mathematical objects* (objective).  Thus if all the
<br />
universe is math then I think we need to give up the idea of complete
<br />
objectivity.    The *mathematical objects* are objectively real, the
<br />
*mathematical cognitive tools* aren't.  However there is close
<br />
relationship between the mathematical objects and the *mathematical
<br />
cognitive tools*
<br />
<br />Let me give you an example of what I mean, because I think you were
<br />
definitely on the right track when you were talking about the
<br />
relationship between formal systems and computational models.
<br />
<br />Using my terminology, I think the formal systems are the objectively
<br />
existing *mathematical objects*, the computational models are
<br />
subjective *mathematical cognitive tools*.   The computational model
<br />
is not a mathematical *thing* , it's a mathematical *procedure* that
<br />
observers use internally.  Therefore, the computational model is not
<br />
something objectively real.  However, there is a close mapping between
<br />
computational models and formal systems.  This is hard to explain, but
<br />
let me say that I think that the *formal system* is the more general
<br />
concept.  The computational model is a sort of *a subjective snap-
<br />
shot* of the formal system.  An apt analogy here might be the taking
<br />
of photos - you can photograph a physical object from many different
<br />
angles.  In my analogy, the formal system is the externally real
<br />
object being photographed, the computational model is the subjective
<br />
'photo' of the formal system.
<br />
<br />Another example might be the relationship between Algebra and Category
<br />
Theory.  Here I think standard Algebra is a tool-kit of (non-
<br />
objective) mathematical *procedures* and therefore not objectively
<br />
real.  However, there is a mapping between standard Algebra and a more
<br />
general theory: Category Theory.  The concepts in Category Theory
<br />
*are* I think objectively real (they are mathematical *objects*).
<br />
<br />For instance, the algebraic *operation* '2+2' does not correspond to
<br />
anything objectively real.  However the *category* - the number 4 -
<br />
*is* objectively real - because it's not a procedure, it's a
<br />
mathematical object.  You see what I'm getting at?
<br />
<br />In general, each *mathematical object* maps to a corresponding
<br />
*mathematical procedure*.  The mathematical objects are objectively
<br />
real general concepts, the mathematical procedures are the subjective
<br />
internal snap-shots.  What we need to remember, according to my
<br />
suppositions, is that mathematical concepts which represent *objects*
<br />
are objectively real, but mathematical concepts which represent
<br />
*procedures* aren't.
<br />
<br />What all this is leading to is this punch-line: I
<br />
<br />f we believe your 2nd postulate that all the universe is math(which I
<br />
do) I think we need to give up your first postulate.  I do not see
<br />
what is so bad about giving up the idea ofa completely objective
<br />
description of reality.  I do not believe that giving up the
<br />
objectivity postulate would spell the end of the quest for a TOE.  It
<br />
would just mean that a TOE would have to *include* direct conscious
<br />
experience (subjective elements) in order to be fully comprehended.
<br />
This sounds highly strange, but it's not impossible.
<br />
<br />Onward! Cheers!
