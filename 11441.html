Indeed I would hold that our subjective experience (subjectivity)is our
<br />
one and only intimate and complete connection to the underlying reality
<br />
and it is the existence of it (subjectivity) 'at all' which is most
<br />
telling/instructive  of the true nature/structure of the underlying
<br />
reality, not the appearances thus delivered by subjectivity.
<br />
<br />[DAVID]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, and as I've said, I was trying to convey the essence of this
</em><br />
thought with what became (unfortunately) confused with 1-person primacy on
<br />
this list. I'd be grateful for help on reformulating this more
<br />
coherently if possible. The heart of it is the primary intension of
<br />
'exists', whose fons et origo I take to be: 'exists in the sense that I
<br />
exist subjectively'.
<br />
<br />[COLIN]
<br />
Yes. The subtlety is extreme. My way of unpacking it is to  think of the
<br />
concept of 'perspective view':
<br />
<br />a) assume that there is an 'objective reality in the Bruno sense: a
<br />
reality exists. _any_ sort of reality will do.
<br />
b) draw a purely notional boundary around any portion  of it at any
<br />
spatiotemporal scale.
<br />
<br />Now realise that innate to the situation is that 'being' the notionally
<br />
segregated portion of the reality innately, automatically
<br />
prescribes/defines a perspective view of the rest of the universe.
<br />
<br />This is not automatically anything that has 'visibility'!
<br />
<br />All it means is that if the reality expresses X (ontological identity of
<br />
some sort) then the rest of the universe must be an absolutely perfect
<br />
un-X.
<br />
No matter how weird the reality is, in the un-X is a form of latent
<br />
perspective 'view' from the position of being X. For example , an atom
<br />
exists, ergo the 'un-atom' exists (everything in the universe that isn't
<br />
the atom). There is no reality that doesn't do this. It can't be helped -
<br />
it's intrinsic to the act of any existence at all.
<br />
<br />_This does not mean it is actually 'like anything' to 'be' the notionally
<br />
segregated portion_.
<br />
<br />Back to the example of an X. To 'be' X is to inherit a latent un-X
<br />
perspective. Nothing has to do anything. This idea applies to all
<br />
spatiotemporal scales. From quark/un-quark to planet/un-planet. Also note
<br />
that the word 'spatiotemporal' is a loaded word. Any level of
<br />
multi-dimensional weirdness can still be part of the reality. The same
<br />
concept applies no matter how fleeting an X may be.
<br />
<br />This is the idea of 'existence' or 'being' which I think has to be adopted
<br />
to make sense of perception. Once you realise it the whole job of
<br />
perception changes to one merely of 'visibility' that makes use of this
<br />
latent potential. To see this:
<br />
<br />Consider your own left kneecap. From the perspective of being your left
<br />
kneecap the rest of the universe is expressing a perfect un-kneecap. This
<br />
is what the universe's innate perspective looks like. Yet we do not see
<br />
the universe from that perspective. Or from the perspective of any cell in
<br />
the kneecap. Or any molecule or any atom and so on. Also, from the
<br />
perspective of being the 'space' inhabited by the atoms in your kneecap
<br />
(call it knee_gap) the rest of the universe is expressing a perfect
<br />
un-knee_gap. Space is just as ontologically real in this. It's all the
<br />
same. Whatever space is, it only has to be something we can pass through
<br />
and it'll look like space. It's just as much 'stuff' as anything in the
<br />
periodic table - just that the atoms/particles in it (expressed by it) can
<br />
move around easily when in it.
<br />
<br />All the visibility we humans have is centred on our brain material.
<br />
Something about brain material actually makes use of the intrinsic latent
<br />
potential perspective view to implement an actual view from that location.
<br />
That view is called phenomenal consciousness (discussed in all manner of
<br />
ways previously). Notions of 'self' and indexicality flow but are merely
<br />
secondary to the actual 1-person view and the innate circumstance that
<br />
delivers the view.
<br />
<br />The whole problem changes to one of visibility.
<br />
<br />I think this concept covers what you call 1-person.
<br />
<br />When 'YOU' (your brain material) makes use of the latent perspective view
<br />
to implement an ACTUAL perspective view of everything call this the APV.
<br />
The appearance of reality thus acquired can be used to make
<br />
generalisations (the holy grain of the empirical scientist is the
<br />
exceptionless generalisation). The depiction of the universe in the form
<br />
of these generalisations is NOT the APV. This is an 'as-if' view. That is
<br />
- the universe is behaving 'as-if' the ontology in the generalisations
<br />
actually existed. That universe does not exist. It is methodologically
<br />
'deemed' for the purposes of predicting how the universe will appear
<br />
_within_ the APV. Call this 'as-if' view AIV.
<br />
<br />Here is where I get confused:
<br />
<br />some people here think the APV is '3-person'
<br />
some people here think the AIV is '3-person'
<br />
<br />I'm pretty sure each of us has their own label for the concepts. What I am
<br />
sure of is that we confuse each other a lot by not fully
<br />
realising/describing the distinction in a discussion context.
<br />
<br />The final note:
<br />
in terms of the definition of 'being' explained above I must point out
<br />
that the same underlying reality that 'is you' is generating the
<br />
perspective view (making use of the innate latent potential for it). To
<br />
illustrate - Imagine you are looking at (have an APV of) thing X where X =
<br />
an atom. In our APV something is behaving atom-ly. We can formulate a
<br />
generalisation that defines how an atom behaves within our APV. That
<br />
generalisation is an AIV. That AIV does NOT define what it is that is
<br />
behaving atom-ly. It merely describes expected appearances to be found if
<br />
you happen to get an atom presented to you in an APV.
<br />
<br />The easiest way to think of it is to regard X as a finger puppet. The
<br />
'fingers' are behaving atomly in that the fingers are painted (appear -
<br />
APV) to deliver the appearance of 'atom-ly (AIV) behaviour'. The AIV says
<br />
nothing about FINGERS. Then note that whatever the fingers are - you, the
<br />
observer - are made of the SAME FINGERS and those fingers are painting the
<br />
APV in your head. The reason no-one ever gets a physics of qualia is that
<br />
nobody EVER gets scientific about _fingers_ - the underling physics -
<br />
Everyone thinks the AIV generalisations ARE the fingers. Totally wrong.
<br />
There are 2 set of equally valid scientific descriptions - descriptions:
<br />
<br />(a) The underlying reality that generates the APV
<br />
(b) the generalisations acquired using the APV (= the AIV)
<br />
<br />In the reality of provision of the APV 'observation' of BOTH descriptions
<br />
happens. One is explicit (b) = &quot;that which is seen&quot; and one is implicit =
<br />
&quot;seeing&quot; (at all). That is the distinction I wanted to make in the
<br />
previous post. I think somewhere in the above you may find an answer to
<br />
your questions. Or maybe just ideas that lead to one. I'd be interested in
<br />
seeing how your ideas relate to it. Note that all underlying realities of
<br />
any type can have the same logic applied - not just the one that is ours.
<br />
This does not mean that sorting out our underlying reality is impossible!
<br />
<br />[DAVID]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is that as soon as one formulates it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this way, all sorts of unlooked for windmills spring up for the Don
</em><br />
Quixotes of the logical mind to struggle with. Somehow one must avoid
<br />
being distracted into grappling with pseudo-problems of pansychism,
<br />
idealism, solipsism etc. - in their timeworn academic clothing - and focus
<br />
on the embeddedness, or 'here-ness' that is central to this
<br />
primary sense of 'exists', and see that everything else is somehow
<br />
derivative of, or emergent from, this primary intension. And, as you say,
<br />
by this token we are of course ourselves directly rooted in this reality,
<br />
whatever it is.
<br />
<br />[COLIN]
<br />
Yep. The demands of our language as assumed generator of truth rather then
<br />
depictor of it... I can see the words as having something to say about the
<br />
reality, but not the other way around....eg...
<br />
<br />PANPSYCHISM. I can sort of (if I squint) equate a form of panpsychism
<br />
within the innate_but_unrealised_latent_potential perspective view idea at
<br />
all scales. I think Alfred North Whitehead might like it. But this is NOT
<br />
some sort of magical universal consciousness!  EEEK! to that.
<br />
<br />IDEALISM. I can see the APV using the properties of ideal objects. I
<br />
cannot see that the production of the APV 'creates' the underling reality.
<br />
That's just silly. Magical intervention again. Much more parsimony in
<br />
accepting a reality as existent (as a hypothesis currently scientifically
<br />
unrefuted).
<br />
<br />SOLIPSISM. I can see that the APV, being private, could be used to justify
<br />
the entire reality as being only yours... &quot;there can be only one&quot; :-) But
<br />
to me the existence of an APV is literal proof there is an underlying
<br />
reality - if there wasn;t one then there couldn't be any APV. It all boils
<br />
down to a chicken/egg argument. I vote we delete the word to eliminate the
<br />
problem.
<br />
<br />You can go through a whole library of terms and do the same thing. The
<br />
words paint a picture an aspect of the actuality. None of the actuality
<br />
directly corresponds with (in the sense of is demanded by) the words. The
<br />
delusion that just because the terminology arguments are possible that
<br />
reality shall therefore play along - NUTS to that!
<br />
<br />[COLIN]&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The belief that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'underlying reality is actually made of quantum mechanics (as opposed
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; being merely described by it) to me looks like a mass delusion of the
</em><br />
most
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bizarre kind.
</em><br />
<br />[DAVID]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One implication of this (which I think is also implied by comp) is that
</em><br />
1-person experience derives from a more complex instantiation than the
<br />
3-person narrative that emerges from it. That is, there is a global
<br />
instantiation level of sufficient complexity to express 1-person
<br />
existence 'qualitatively'. At this level, qualitative modalities -
<br />
'qualia' - also function as stripped-down 'relata', encoding '3-person
<br />
worlds' of structure, relation, transaction, and locality. We may
<br />
speculate, for example, that our experientially dynamic discrimination
<br />
(A-series) of relation and structure (B-series) emerges from the
<br />
'unmediated intuitive grasp' of such relational locality within
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualitative globality. All this strongly entails that we will never find
</em><br />
the 1-person within the 3-person. The evidence of course is perhaps
<br />
already staring us in the face, were we to accept it as such. There is
<br />
nothing at all in the 3-person that looks like, or that we have any notion
<br />
could possibly look like, the 1-person. Maybe this is why.
<br />

[COLIN]
<br />
Yes. Yes. Yes. This is all the Humean view of causality. &quot;correlation is
<br />
not causation&quot;. Hume was dead right in being an absolute sceptic. As are
<br />
POPPER and his student MILLER (recent book 'out of error' is a MUST read).
<br />
The Popper/Miller pragmatics on science map the reality of perception and
<br />
cognition into the act of scientific behaviour perfectly. We get perfectly
<br />
good 'as-if' causality from within 1-person appearances. But none of is is
<br />
actually driving the universe. Associative memory is literally an 'as-if'
<br />
'apparent causality' generation machine. Traditional empirical scientific
<br />
laws are just metaphors.
<br />
<br />What is actually driving the universe is the 'underlying reality' - and it
<br />
is that underlying reality which is generating the 1-person appearances.
<br />
It's just that the clinching evidence which gives us permission to play
<br />
with possible underlying realities is not within 1-person appearances, but
<br />
the very existence of any 1-person view at all. The sort of underlying
<br />
reality that makes what we see as brain material deliver a 1-person view
<br />
is the sort of universe we inhabit. No 3-person AIV/generalisation
<br />
delivered by the 1-person will ever do that! Which is where my comment
<br />
about (QM DOES NOT EQUAL underlying reality) came from.
<br />
<br />Yet another metaphor:
<br />
If an alien studied city traffic from orbit (using some sort of wiz_bang
<br />
long distance speed-radar) you'd pretty quickly come up with a rule about
<br />
the probablity distribution T(V) of finding 'traffic', T running at a
<br />
certain speed V (enforced by signs on the side of the road). Call this
<br />
TRAFFIC_MECHANICS.
<br />
<br />Saying that QM literally IS the underlying reality is like saying
<br />
TRAFFIC is made of P(V)! Meaningless drivel. To talk about the underlying
<br />
reality is to talk about CARS that behave TRAFFIC_MECHANICALLY.
<br />
<br />Physics seems to be completely mesmerised by the 'unreasonable
<br />
effectiveness' of mathematics to the point of thinking that the
<br />
mathematics somehow 'is' the underlying reality - instead of more
<br />
reasonably concluding that the underlying reality is merely behaving
<br />
'as-if' it were being driven mathematically. The latter proposition would
<br />
win any critical argument in a model of reality simply through empirical
<br />
parsimony. The mathematics-bliss state of cosmologists is a kind of
<br />
religion - a belief in the magical intervention of a mathematics god -
<br />
that can only be maintained if you structurally/culturally eschew 1-person
<br />
as evidence of anything whilst at the same time demanding it deliver all
<br />
the 3-person evidence you use to maintain your belief in the mathematics
<br />
god!
<br />
<br />E) The descriptive mathematics of appearance is NOT the underlying reality.
<br />
<br />F) The descriptive mathematics of an underlying reality is NOT the
<br />
underlying reality.
<br />
<br />E &amp; F are merely ABOUT the underlying reality and joined at the hip
<br />
by(mutually constrained to be compatible with) demands of provision
<br />
phenomenal consciousness to humans.
<br />
<br />Which leads me to another implication:  E &amp; F are not even unique!
<br />
<br />Zork the alph-centaurian smake-trouf scientist who looks like a hologram
<br />
of orange smoke-rings has a completely different set of phenomenal fields
<br />
(say perceiving gravitons and neutrinos directly) and would have a
<br />
completely different E' and F' say, respectively. But both E, E', F and F'
<br />
would be equally predictive of the natural world (and produce identical
<br />
technology). When mapped through the respective physics of phenomenality
<br />
the practical effect is identical prediction and identical
<br />
understanding/knowledge. Uniqueness in laws of nature is gone.
<br />
<br />We humans seriously need to 'get over ourselves' as scientists.
<br />
<br />Do you see how screwed up the system is?
