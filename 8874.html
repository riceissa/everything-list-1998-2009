Hi Ben,
<br />
<br />Le 13-févr.-06, à 21:18, Benjamin Udell a écrit :
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi, Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You're tending -- too selectively, arbitrarily -- to try to go by what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was meant by words many hundreds and even some thousands of years ago.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Plotinus appears to be a rationalist. I don't care what he means by the 
<br />
terms he used. I look only at the validity of its arguments, and I 
<br />
discover some interpretation of its theory in term of self-reference 
<br />
(arithmetical, or analytical, with our without some angelical 
<br />
(infinite) inference rules).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Original or early meanings can be very illuminating, but a lot has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happened since then, and there is some degree of _stare decisis_ in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these matters.
</em><br />
<br /><br />In the long term progress could be monotonic (growing), but in front of 
<br />
unsolved problems we must be open to the possibility of the need to 
<br />
backtrack. What do you mean by _stare decisis_ ?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Words like &quot;property&quot; (originally, a non-essential differentia, i.e., 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an idiosyncrasy) and &quot;physics&quot; (which meant &quot;pertaining to growth, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; especially to plants as growths,&quot; as in _phyton_, &quot;plant&quot;) could not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; withstand the standard which you apply. And it's best if you seem to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prioritize your theory much, much higher than you prioritize the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correcting of wrongs which you believe to have been done in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theologically related politics over a thousand years ago. And you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can't simultaneously do that and justify the use of the word 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;theology&quot; as the correction of an ancient wrong and restoration of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the original, legitimate meaning. People just don't care _that_ much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about pedigree or ancient politic!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  s. And if you don't really care that much either, but are basically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just seeking a justification, it's good to pick one which will bear up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; under the weight which you place on it, so that you don't give the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance of over-prioritizing such ancient occurrences. And if you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do actually care that much, then you should consider whether you care 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about your machine theory even more. It's good to give your intended 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; audience the sense that you share &amp; understand their concerns and are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; familiar with the same intellectual world as they are.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have already try to hide the theological aspect (in the lille thesis) 
<br />
but apparently it makes things only less understandable.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your best arguments on terminology all seem founded in the present, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; e.g., the vagueness of the word &quot;metaphysics,&quot; plus its causing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opprobrium among scientists.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Another annoying feature of the term &quot;metaphysics&quot; is that it has made 
<br />
quasi impossible for the physicians to do metaphysics with &quot;meta&quot; 
<br />
having the corresponding sense of the &quot;meta&quot; in metamathematics (the 
<br />
&quot;old&quot; name of recursion theory). Now, most physician would say (at 
<br />
least before the rise of the quantum) that such a &quot;meta-physics&quot; is 
<br />
just physics. That is: physician, together with their laboratories and 
<br />
their libraries just obeys to ... the laws of physics. OK, but when you 
<br />
say that with quantum mechanics, you are going toward Everett and the 
<br />
many-worlds. Everett is the first serious &quot;meta-physician&quot; in that 
<br />
sense. Well Galieo and Einstein (and others) did pave this 
<br />
'desanthropomorphization' process. Embedding the subject into the 
<br />
object of study. Embedding the spectator in the spectacles, said the 
<br />
Indians.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, if its causing opprobrium among scientists is a sufficient 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objection, then the opprobrium which the word &quot;theology&quot; will cause 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; among scientists is a sufficient objection too.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am trying to formulate a, admittedly fundamental, problem and to 
<br />
suggest a way to tackle it. Only pseudo-scientist can yell. Others 
<br />
could try to refer to some publications if they believe that the 
<br />
problem has been already solved. Remember; scientist are modest; they 
<br />
never refer to truth, and when they do, they are no more scientist. It 
<br />
happens after pension, sometimes; or during the coffee pause (important 
<br />
for the brainstorming and research, but avoided in the publication.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The opprobrium would likely be even greater, and the objection, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore, that much stronger. Add to that, the opprobrium which would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be caused by your use of the word &quot;theology&quot; among religious people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generally in proportion as your theory were to gain fame or notoriety. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What will they say?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Normally, anyone having faith, should welcome any rationalist, that is 
<br />
modest, approaches. What could they fear? Ghazali makes already the 
<br />
point in his critics of Aristotle, Plato and the philosopher. See:
<br />
<a href="http://www.ghazali.org/">http://www.ghazali.org/</a>
<br />
or its work &quot;the incoherence of the philosophers&quot; (Tahafut 
<br />
Al-Falasifah).
<br />
<a href="http://www.ghazali.org/works/taf-eng.pdf">http://www.ghazali.org/works/taf-eng.pdf</a>
<br />
(About the word Falasifah, I think Ghazali's work makes the word 
<br />
Falsifiable from it, but falasifah ment &quot;philosopher&quot;. The greek word 
<br />
&quot;philosophy&quot; (love of sageness) apparently gives rise to falsifiable 
<br />
through Gazhali!)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Worst-case scenario: They'll say and believe that you're founding a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; religion of worship of some Big Machine in the Sky.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not really because I say the contrary. Machines and Angels got the 
<br />
truth by looking deep inside themselves.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Imagine having myriad academic people and highly religious people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; united, as strange bedfellows, against you, and declaring against that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which they call the nightmarish bastard offspring of a shotgun wedding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between religion and science.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Given that the essence of science is modesty, only bad faith needs 
<br />
authoritative dogma, and yes, can fear research, both outside-emiricist 
<br />
research, and a fortiori any form of mystical rationalism, like the 
<br />
(neo)platonist one.
<br />
The Athenian Platonist Academy of Athen has *already* be closed, you 
<br />
know.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even Romeo's &amp; Juliet's circumstances were less forbidding.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course lots of people have startling and evocative theories, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deriving physics from various abstract considerations. The odds of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your particular theory's becoming famous seem small to a comparatively 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ignorant outsider like me. Yet, if you have confidence in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persuasiveness of yourself &amp; your theory,
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is not my theory. It is a theory which exists since a very long 
<br />
time, and I have just made a progress, may be.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; then you should think very carefully before actually naming your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory as a new and scientifically based competitor in the religious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; field,
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Science just cannot be in competition with theology. Science can be, 
<br />
and has been and apparently still is, in competition with dogma. Be it 
<br />
&quot;dogma&quot; of pseudo-scientist, tyran, or any entity believing she can 
<br />
make the thinking in your place.
<br />
I respect all religion which respects my freedom of enquiry and 
<br />
questioning.
<br />
<br /><br />&lt;snip&gt; : I agree somehow, but the nuances I would like to add would be 
<br />
too much anticipation at this stage. OK, I will try to take into 
<br />
account your feeling and I will NOT use the term theology in my next 
<br />
paper. I will probably transform &quot;Elementary testable Machine theology&quot; 
<br />
, by &quot;self-referential interpretation of Plotinus&quot;. Reserving 
<br />
&quot;theology&quot; for a book later as uv suggests, thanks.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since you're talking not only about metaphysics but also about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines as metaphysicians, maybe there's some way to coin a word 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Metaphysicianology&quot; sounds &amp; looks awful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Metaphysicistics.&quot; Better, but not much better.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Machine metaphysicisms.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Metaphysicology.&quot; &quot;Metaphysicalistics.&quot; Those are, at least, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pronounceable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not doing too well. It's definitely easier to criticize your word 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choice than to supply you with a better word choice. Still, if plain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; old &quot;metaphysics&quot; is out of the question because of the reception 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which it gets, then &quot;theology&quot; would seem even more out of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Nooo..... please: no &quot;meta&quot; and no &quot;physics&quot;. Since Aristotle we are 
<br />
too much &quot;physics&quot; centred, if you want more on my opinion.
<br />
Thanks any way for the comments which I will take into consideration.
<br />
<br />Bruno
