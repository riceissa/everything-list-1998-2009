<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi David,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a nice post, but you are still putting the horse before the cart.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I can see that you have not yet grasp the main UDA point. Hope you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no problem with being frank, and a bit undiplomatical, OK?
</em><br />
<br />Don't worry Bruno, nothing pleases me more than discovering precisely
<br />
in what ways I am wrong!  Having said this, I think you sometimes get
<br />
into a bit of trouble following me because of the way I structure my
<br />
arguments (my fault I'm sure).  When I say something like &quot;if we
<br />
assume x, then y follows&quot; it doesn't mean that I'm saying that I
<br />
*believe* x or y; I'm just attempting to establish a position in order
<br />
to compare it with what I'm going to say next.  Sorry if this is
<br />
already obvious to you, but I'll try to point to examples where
<br />
relevant.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) A Turing machine is an idealised digital computer,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, Turing tried to capture the notion of a human computer, working with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pencil and paper.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He tried to define mathematically what is human computable, and he is, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Post, and some other are the discoverer of a purely mathematical notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation, and this before the appearance of concrete computers. Computers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have appeared after. Turing has played a role in that later appearance.  A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonist could say those concrete beings are just pale approximation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real thing. Later this statement will be made precise, but with the step 8,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we just cannot invoke any physical things or physical reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be sure, the fact that computer have been discovered in math, before &quot;in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nature&quot; is not an argument, yet it helps a lot to see that, especially for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the grasp of the comp supervenience thesis. And that is the reason why I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain that absolutely fundamental mathematical discovery. Computation has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing to do with physics at the start.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that I abstract myself from the pioneer building of a computer by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Babbage.
</em><br />
<br />Thanks for this amplification.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This has not been shown. But this follows from Church Thesis.
</em><br />
<br />Thanks, I wasn't sure about this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and hence any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other TM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What Turing has shown, is that there is a universal Turing machine, capable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of simulating all Turing machines. Then that Universal machine can be shown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to emulate all existing universal machine, and by Church Thesis: all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal (and particular) machines.
</em><br />
<br />OK
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The meaning of 'emulation' here entails transforming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precisely the same inputs into the precisely same outputs, given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sufficient time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. But there is an intensional Church thesis, which can be deduced from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Church thesis, saying that not only two universal systems can compute the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same functions, but they can compute them in the same way (same algorithm).
</em><br />
<br />OK
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Insofar as the causal processes of physics are specifiable in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form of decidable (i.e. definitely stopping) functions, they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capable of finite computation on a TM - i.e. they are TM emulable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What this amounts to is that we can in principle use a TM to compute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the evolution of any physical process given the appropriate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transformation algorithm.  Since we're dealing with QM this must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entail various probabilistic aspects and I don't know what else: help
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here please.  But the general sense is that the mathematics of physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could in principle be fully Turing-emulable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Step 08 forbids us to introduce anything physical. The reversal is done at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that step. I guess you are right that it could be a better idea to do the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step 8 before, but it is more difficult for most. Any way, computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenience is defined after step 8.
</em><br />
<br />Now when you say &quot;Step 8 forbids us to introduce anything physical&quot; we
<br />
might have an example of 'taking things out of sequence'.  In this
<br />
section I hadn't yet made the assumption of UDA-8.  I was just setting
<br />
out what I understand with respect to the ordinary sense of the
<br />
physical as being mathematically describable in some way.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then we will discover that &quot;Colin is right&quot; no piece of matter should be Turing emulable     &gt; The mathematics of physics will have to escape the turing emulable. The apparent turing  &gt; emulability of the world around us, is a threat to indexical comp (the idea that &quot;I am         &gt; machine&quot;). Of course I disagree with Colin's reasoning where he deduce the non Turing    &gt; emulability of nature from the non emulability of mind. UDA deduces the non Turing-         &gt; emulability of matter from the non Turing-emulability of the mind. And the proof is             &gt; constructive. It redefines precisely what &quot;matter&quot; consists in.
</em><br />
<br />Ah!  So by 'the non Turing-emulability of matter' I take you to refer
<br />
to the example of Olympia: i.e. the argument that shows that
<br />
computation can't depend on the physicality of a TM.  So it follows
<br />
that neither mind nor matter are 'emulable' by - in the strong sense
<br />
of being constituted by - a *physical* TM.  Rather, the reverse is
<br />
true - both (including the now 'apparently physical TM') are
<br />
constituted by infinities of computations in a highly-specific
<br />
relation: i.e. the UD.
<br />
<br />On the basis of the above, I can perhaps see why you say &quot;The apparent
<br />
turing emulability of the world around us, is a threat to indexical
<br />
comp (the idea that &quot;I am machine&quot;)&quot;, if one were to take
<br />
'emulability' in the strong sense above, since we would now seem to
<br />
have a contradiction of some sort.  But - and I stress I mean outside
<br />
of the UDA framework - I have been accustomed to understand
<br />
'emulation' in the sense of a mathematical model of the evolution of
<br />
physical systems, not an ontological reversal with what-is-emulated -
<br />
hence this post.  Why would the 'Turing emulability' of nature in this
<br />
weaker sense constitute a threat to comp?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3)  Now we get into more controversial territory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Really? I don't think so. Difficult, not yet very well known, and rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subtle, no doubt.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I don't think there is anything controversial. Nobody told me that.
</em><br />
<br />I think the ordinary English usage of 'controversial' is that there is
<br />
considerable disagreement - of which this list demonstrates ample
<br />
proof!  It doesn't imply that it is wrong.  But I didn't mean to
<br />
offend.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno has shown (at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least I agree with him on this) that for the mind to be regarded as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The wording is a bit dangerous. All I know after UDA is that my state of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind at time and place (x,t) has to be linked to an infinity of computations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going through that state, and that my next state, from my first person point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of view is indeterminate on the set of all those computations.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I'll avoid saying &quot;a computation&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; essentially everything else must also be regarded in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same light: IOW our ontology is to be understood entirely from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective of numbers and their relations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; True, but this excludes quickly that it can be conceived a priori as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations. Immaterial relation between numbers, sure, but not necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable relation. Cf the first person indeterminacy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not universally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accepted, but more on this in the next section.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not universally understood, nor really studied. But it is understood
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quickly or slowly when studied. To my knowledge.
</em><br />
<br />When I make a gesture to one side of the argument (i.e. the simple
<br />
fact that they don't - in fact - accept it) the other side objects!
<br />
But I understand your frustration.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suffice it to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that on this basis we would appear to have a situation where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate set of computations could be regarded not as mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'emulation', but in fact *as real as it gets*.  But this of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also renders 'stuffy matter' irrelevant to the case: it's got to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers all the way down.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No. With the first person indeterminacy it would be more correct to say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's got to be number all the way up.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I nearly said 'all the way up'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It makes the comp immaterial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance of &quot;stuffy matter&quot; infinitely complex and non turing emulable, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; priori. I suspect you have not yet really see the role of UDA1-6 in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step-7.
</em><br />
<br />Ah, this is a key point, I suspect.  Now, in my pre-UDA (&quot;beam me up
<br />
Scotty&quot;) way of thinking about it, I saw that teleportation could be
<br />
coherent only if consciousness was seen in terms of a movable
<br />
viewpoint within some larger context, not as consisting in a
<br />
'thing-in-itself' - hence the a priori 1-person indeterminacy.
<br />
Consequently this also implied that the brain - matter itself - must
<br />
be seen somehow in this way too, but I was unable to say how.  Anyway,
<br />
now I see the Star Trek part as UDA1-6.  UDA-7 introduces the UD
<br />
itself, and from this, that &quot;comp &quot;stuffy&quot; matter has to be made by a
<br />
infinite sum of infinite computations including infinities of white
<br />
rabbits-computations&quot;.
<br />
<br />UDA-8 crucially shows - finally - that the computations cannot
<br />
themselves supervene on stuffy matter - i.e. the 'stuffy TM' one
<br />
previously assumed they were running on.  So the overall picture
<br />
derived from this is that both the first person and the appearance of
<br />
matter are complex - and, in any specific instance, a priori
<br />
indeterminate - emergents from this infinite blizzard of computation;
<br />
hence 'individual instances' of minds and bodies can't be regarded as
<br />
'isolated computations'.  Is this is what you mean when you say that
<br />
matter is &quot;non turing emulable, a priori&quot;?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) If we don't accept 3) then we can keep stuffy matter,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can't by step 8;
</em><br />
<br />Surely we can if we're willing to drop the computational theory of
<br />
mind?  Note that I say this later on (another sequencing problem).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  but by the whole UDA 'stuffy matter&quot; does no more make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense at all.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but my point was that one isn't forced to accept the UDA, as long
<br />
as one is equally willing to give up the computational theory of mind.
<br />
&nbsp;Faced with the UDA, I suspect many non-specialists might well see
<br />
that as preferable to relinquishing their grasp on stuffy matter.  I'm
<br />
not making claims about the correctness of positions here, I'm just
<br />
contrasting them.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;The comp &quot;stuffy&quot; matter has to be made by a infinite sum of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite computations including infinities of white rabbits-computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The apparent computability of the physical laws *is* a problem for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indexical computationalist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cost of losing the digital computational model of both mind and body.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most want introduce a stuffy matter because they believe they can save
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation for both mind and body.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but I agree with you that this doesn't work.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not everyone agrees with that radical assessment, I know;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Who disagree? It is not a question to agree or not. It is a question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding or not (or to find a mistake).
</em><br />
<br />Whoa!  It's a fact that not everyone agrees.  This is obviously true,
<br />
because when I don't say this, the ones that don't, start disagreeing!
<br />
&nbsp;Your point is that disagreement isn't refutation (or even
<br />
understanding).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those who don't concur presumably do hold that everything that happens
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finally supervenes on something stuffy as its ontological and causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis, and that numbers and their relations serve merely to model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is comp, before UDA, before the necessary reversal.
</em><br />
<br />The reversal is necessary only to save the computational theory of mind, surely?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The stuffiness doesn't of course mean that the evolution of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical systems can't in principle be specified algorithmically,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Comp-stuffiness *is* a priori not algorithmic.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but I was referring here to matter in the stuffy sense, precisely
<br />
to *contrast* it with the comp sense.  IOW mathematics is still
<br />
&quot;unreasonably effective&quot; even if it turns out that comp doesn't go
<br />
through as a TOE.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'emulated' on a TM if that is possible; we still have mathematics as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model of stuff and its relations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA entails there is no stuff at all. No stuff capable of justifying in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way the observation of stuff.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, of course, I know this!  This is what makes me think you have a
<br />
problem with the way I present the argument in stages.  I was trying
<br />
to characterise the stuffy model in its own terms (with the caveat
<br />
that IMO this entails abandoning the comp theory of mind), as well as
<br />
comp (however inadequately) also in its own terms.  I just get
<br />
confused when you interpolate comp objections when I'm not saying
<br />
anything about comp.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it does entail that no digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emulation of a physical system can - as a mere structure of numbers -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be considered the 'real thing': it's got to be stuffy all the way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, with comp+physicalism. But this is inconsistent, at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemological level.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but there's no reason to claim that comp is necessarily the
<br />
*only* theory of mind. Physicalism itself isn't necessarily
<br />
inconsistent at the epistemological level, but it does need a
<br />
different theory of mind - IMO.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rather, it seems to me that in our various discussions on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emulability or otherwise of physics, we may sometimes lose sight of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether we are interpreting in terms of numerical or stuffy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontologies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But &quot;stuffy&quot; or just primitively physical, after UDA has no more any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning.
</em><br />
<br />Again, surely only on the basis that a stuffy theory still hangs on to
<br />
comp as a theory of mind?  Can't we escape the UDA in this way, even
<br />
in principle?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Be that as it may, the punchline is: do we find this analysis of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction between numerical 3) and stuffy 4) to be cogent with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *specific* respect to the significance and possible application of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of 'emulation' in each case?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You don't yet have grasped the UDA yet. It makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the stuffy things not just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; useless for having computations and relative emulation, but it makes, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the big hard point, any notion of stuffiness, irrelevant for physical
</em><br />

<br />Well, I'm always willing to stand corrected, but I had hoped in my
<br />
post on Olympia to show you finally that I had indeed grasped
<br />
*exactly* this point. My questions in this post about emulation were
<br />
really directed to clarifying the stuffy-ontology position, as a
<br />
result of the debate with Colin: i.e. what does emulation mean in a
<br />
stuffy context?  The common sense view is that - if stuff is primitive
<br />
- emulation can only be a 3-description.  However, if numbers are
<br />
primitive, then in principle mathematical structures - in very special
<br />
relation, as you argue - actually *constitute* reality, not just
<br />
describe it.
<br />
<br />I think what muddies the waters all the time is the physicalist
<br />
assumption that 'immaterial computation' can still be claimed account
<br />
for the mind on the basis of a stuffy ontology.  Without this, we
<br />
would have more or less the simple dichotomy I propose: i.e.
<br />
stuffy-ontology =&gt; stuffy stuff + stuffy mind; or comp-ontology =&gt;
<br />
comp stuff + comp mind.  Each side could then argue against the
<br />
other's position, but at least without laying claim to each other's
<br />
'stuff'!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is just no stuff available. Even if we introduce it, it makes no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change in consciousness, and can't have any relation with what we observe in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nature
</em><br />
<br />On the basis of the comp theory of mind-body: yes, definitely, no question.
