We all admit that it's easy to become confused. I myself
<br />
regularly do so every day. In fact, you can't even learn
<br />
anything until you first become confused.
<br />
<br />But there is *no* reason to become more confused than is
<br />
necessary.
<br />
<br />The KEY DISTINCTION is between reality and perception of
<br />
reality. This must be borne in mind at all times.
<br />
<br />There are two things.  One is reality.  Two is perception
<br />
of reality.  They are not at all the same thing.
<br />
<br />If you let even for a second the key distinction between the
<br />
two slip, even by the tiniest, tiniest amount, then you are
<br />
doomed.  It's all over.  You've bought the farm.  There is
<br />
no recovery.  You've had it.
<br />
<br />Let us for the sake of God *not* define anything. That turns
<br />
out, experience teaches us, to be the worst possible response.
<br />
It is a horrible mistake.  First, it gives rise to many
<br />
different interpretations, and the curse of Babel is upon 
<br />
us.  Second, we *ourselves* in almost all instances that I
<br />
have seen, are not able to remember and strictly observe
<br />
our own definitions.  So preserve us from them.
<br />
<br />We need to look up to and admire all the people who are *not*
<br />
philosophers, people who actually go about their business in
<br />
the world and achieve admirable ends.  Let us pray use *their*
<br />
language.
<br />
<br />For one thing, it will be a cold day in hell before they ever
<br />
change the way they use words because some half-assed philosophers
<br />
have suggested they do. Second---unlike us---they are not confused.
<br />
When George Bush, for example, worries about the perception
<br />
of the Russian ambassador, he is being very realistic. He
<br />
does not have his head up his ass.  He understands the situation
<br />
perfectly:
<br />
<br />The world is out there, and the Russian ambassador sees things
<br />
in it.  The Russian ambassador is not insane, and so he knows
<br />
that what he sees and the representations in his head are not
<br />
the same thing.  Yet the Russian ambassador may *perceive*, for
<br />
example, that such-and-such is a threat, where we happen to know
<br />
(since we are the possibly threatening party) that it is not.
<br />
Therefore, George Bush wisely knows that he must try to afford
<br />
the Russian ambassador an *accurate* representation of reality.
<br />
<br />We can do no better than they: we *must* continue to *never*
<br />
confuse reality, on the one hand, with our perceptions OF it
<br />
on the other.
<br />
<br />Lee
