</em><br />
<br />Tegmark's idea of multiple time dimensions was more general than this.
<br />
As with multiple space dimensions, you could travel about in the
<br />
time dimensions.
<br />
<br />In relativity theory, there is a &quot;light cone&quot; that restricts which
<br />
direction is &quot;forward&quot; in time.  You can change your direction but are
<br />
constrained to always be going forward relative to your light cone.
<br />
This keeps you from turning around and going backwards in time, because
<br />
you can't exceed the speed of light.  However with 2 dimensional time the
<br />
geometry is different and you actually go backwards in time.  Your own
<br />
personal clock goes forward but you can end up back before you started.
<br />
<br />I'll give you a mental visualization you might find useful and
<br />
interesting.  There is a conventional way to think of a light cone which
<br />
is what gives it its name.  Imagine a 2+1 dimensional universe, 2 spatial
<br />
dimensions and 1 of time.  To think of it, start with an x-y plane with
<br />
the x and y axes.  We'll call the y axis time, positive being upward.
<br />
This is a 1+1 dimensional universe. Now imagine the lines x=y and x=-y,
<br />
in other words the two lines running at 45 degrees and crossing at the
<br />
origin.  These can be thought of as the paths of light rays emitted by or
<br />
received at the origin.  Now imagine spinning the whole thing around the y
<br />
axis, where the new z axis will be another spatial dimension.  The crossed
<br />
lines become a pair of cones that represent possible light beams being
<br />
emitted from or received at the origin.  These are called light cones.
<br />
At each point in space we could imagine a pair of such cones existing,
<br />
future and past.  Objects are constrained in their movements to only be
<br />
going upward, they have to stay within their light cones.
<br />
<br />Now for the variant, with a 1+2 dimensional universe: 1 spatial dimension
<br />
and 2 time dimensions.  Again we will start with the x-y plane, y is time,
<br />
and we draw the crossed 45 degree lines.  This time we spin around the
<br />
x axis, to again produce two cones, but they are pointed right and left
<br />
rather than up and down.  In this model z is a time dimension like y,
<br />
so we have 2 time dimensions.  Now, objects again are constrained in
<br />
their movements not to cross the cones, but the cones are pointed to
<br />
the side rather than upward.  This means that objects are not stuck
<br />
inside the cones but are in effect outside of them and are able to move
<br />
much more freely.  You can see perhaps how an object could start at
<br />
the origin, move in a loop in the y-z plane and return to the origin,
<br />
all without ever passing through the cones.
<br />
<br />This is the nature of the 2-dimensional time explored by Tegmark.
<br />
It is pretty different from the MWI.  I would not say that the MWI
<br />
has multidimensional time any more than it has &gt;3 dimensional space.
<br />
Technically the MWI all happens in one spacetime area, it is all
<br />
superimposed and squashed together.  There is merely a mathematical
<br />
separation which occurs when states become decoherent, such that their
<br />
future histories are causally independent.  But technically they are still
<br />
using the same space and time, they are just invisible to each other.
