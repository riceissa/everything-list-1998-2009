<br /><br /><br />I haven't kept up with this thread or that idea, but there is no logical 
<br />
reason that a particular attribute such as &quot;conservation&quot; should be 
<br />
universal across a many-world manifold.  First of all, &quot;conservation&quot; is 
<br />
ill-defined, but if precisely defined assumes a standard, which implies a 
<br />
teleological approach.  And that is one step away from 
<br />
scholasticism.  Before you know it, you're quoting Plato.  Mathematically, 
<br />
conservation could be defined in terms of least-distance between points, 
<br />
but if the individual worlds are constructed with their own unique 
<br />
space-time topology (sort of by definition--otherwise each world would be 
<br />
the same as the next one) then the term &quot;conservation&quot; would apply only 
<br />
locally.  So, strike two.  In fact, one could describe each world as a 
<br />
unique slice intersecting and *forming* the surface of the many-world 
<br />
manifold---and each slice could be characterized by its own unique 
<br />
matrix.  Postulating the individual world matrix as a set of elements and 
<br />
interactions between elements, one could arrive at an &quot;ideal&quot; (Plato 
<br />
again!) in which each individual world is confined to a minimum number of 
<br />
elements/interactions.  Fine.  But it would result in each world being 
<br />
congruent (homologous) to every other world.  The result would be no 
<br />
difference between worlds, but there is not a shred of evidence that the 
<br />
configuration works that way at all levels.  For example, you coffee may 
<br />
have cooled according to the observations setting forth the laws of 
<br />
thermodynamics---and thus predictable, but you sir, probably drove your 
<br />
automobile in a very inefficient manner today, going places that you 
<br />
shouldn't have gone (you didn't know the queue would be so long, or the 
<br />
store would be closed, etc).  Now, if you had known that the store would be 
<br />
closed, etc, you would have been a little more efficient, but that would 
<br />
require a prescience that you presumably don't have.   Maybe that's why, we 
<br />
can never precisely predict where the electron will &quot;be&quot;, because to do so 
<br />
would identify it's &quot;proper&quot; place---and from there we could then define 
<br />
it's ideal position.  That we cannot (as yet) do that suggests that this 
<br />
inability to do so is an inherent part of a dynamic system---and is present 
<br />
within all intersects of the many world manifold.
<br />
<br />Short answer: Conservatism is a procedure that produces mental constructs 
<br />
of what we thing the world is trying to become.  It allows us to fit our 
<br />
observations against the image in our minds, but it has its 
<br />
limitations.  There is no perfect river.  Or snowstorm.  Or 
<br />
politician.   It's all in our minds.
