<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: hal.domain.name.hidden
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The issue of what constitutes an implementation is complex and difficult to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understand unless you have read the relevant papers as background.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hopefully your audience is familiar with the issue otherwise your paper is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hard to understand.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully the people familiar with it will read my paper.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;All these physically-oriented proposals have an ad hoc flavor, an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;attempt to &quot;cook the books&quot; to get the answers we want.  They do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;flow naturally from first principles.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it's too soon to judge that.  Most new ideas take several 
<br />
iterations before they start to look simple enough to have been discovered 
<br />
with just a little thought.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The overall program you are proposing is defined here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Suppose, hypothetically, that the problems in defining a unique and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proper implementation criterion can be overcome. The next step in applying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computationalism to quantum mechanics would then be to see if the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appearance of the standard rules for probability could be derived using the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wavefunction without collapse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Such probabilities would only be effective probabilities, because there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is nothing non-deterministic in the model to be considered. An effective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability in this context is defined as the ratio of the number of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observations of a given type to the total number of observations. In this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;case, this will be a ratio of the number of implementations of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computation of a given conscious type to the number of implementations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;summed over all conscious types.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As a practical matter, this plan has so many obstacles to overcome that it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;looks hopeless.  Not only do you have to resolve the issue of when an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implementation has occured (which is of doubtful success),
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the proposals in the paper about that?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;you then need to define what class of computations constitute conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers suitable to your needs. This second problem is equally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contentious and far from resolution today.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think that would need to be solved just to derive the 
<br />
probabilities.  It should be possible to show that, for a large class of 
<br />
computations (which should include the brain-type ones), the ratio of (of 
<br />
|+&gt; type to |-&gt; type, for example) comes out right with the appropriate 
<br />
quantum system.  Or, it could be shown for a toy model and an argument made 
<br />
that the model has enough of the right features to imply that a realistic 
<br />
model would be similar.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This struck me as funny:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A disturbing possibility is that the measure of a brain (the # of ways in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which it could be said to implement its regular computation) could depend 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on the size or structure of the brain. It is conceivable, for example, that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a creature could be constructed which thinks like a human, but whose brain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does not implement its computation, as mathematically defined, in nearly as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;many ways. Such a creature would be at great risk of enslavement by regular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;humans. The opposite scenario would also be possible. It is to be hoped 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that measure is not sensitive to the details of the construction of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Presumably your concern is that if people come to believe that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;particular creature's brain has less measure than others, we should care 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;less about the welfare of that creature, and so would feel comfortable in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;enslaving it, since its suffering wouldn't matter.  It seems absurd to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;imagine that the majority of people would allow these untestable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophical musings to drive their ethical judgement on such an important 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;issue.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess you never heard of religion, communism, or other ideologies.   
<br />
Ideas can matter.  I think it is quite possible that it could happen.  
<br />
Remember, Christianity didn't amount to much at first.  If androids were 
<br />
commonplace, so would be computationalist philosophy.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Anyway, even if it happened, by your own arguments, mistreatment would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;justified, hence there is no reason to hope for the contrary.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly don't think it would be a good thing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, what could happen is that it will be shown that measure *is* 
<br />
sensitive to construction - but, it will be too hard (or controversial) to 
<br />
actually determine which type of creature is the one with much greater 
<br />
measure.  Fine, you say, we'll just treat everyone equally?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, no.  If I believe the measure ratio is huge, Bayesian reasoning 
<br />
tells me my type of brain probably is the one with more measure.  The other 
<br />
side, will reach the mirror image conclusion.  A perfect justification for 
<br />
racial war or power-based slavery.  (The slaves, of course, being perfectly 
<br />
justified in wanting to revolt; the system could be unstable.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why we need to worry about this stuff now - before the other side 
<br />
has been built.  And this century might be when that starts.  (The doomsday 
<br />
argument, anyone?  Replacement by near-zombies would be almost the same as 
<br />
regular doom.)  These ideas will be understood one day; even if people don't 
<br />
pursue this line of reasoning, robots might.  Now, I like robots and I hope 
<br />
the problem of size will be shown not to be a problem.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if measure is sensitive, then most likely some humans would 
<br />
have more than others ... not good.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Overall I think there are interesting ideas here, but the problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that it is working towards is so difficult that I don't think it can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;succeed as a practical matter.  Some QM approaches such as &quot;many minds&quot; try 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to accomplish much the same task without hoping to solve all these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;insurmountable philosophical problems.  They look for wavefunction splits 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that provide basic properties that would allow for causality, consistency, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;memory, etc.  These are simpler principles and more likely to put practical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and meaningful constraints on wave function decomposition.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not quite sure what you're taliking about here.  The CWI is a 
<br />
many-minds interpretation of sorts, but without the cheesy &quot;minds as hidden 
<br />
variables&quot;.
