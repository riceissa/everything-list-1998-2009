<br />
Greetings, 
<br />
<br />Here's my Rupee 1 on the connection between &quot;abstract models&quot; and &quot;reality&quot;;
<br />
<br />Although it is ofcourse debatable, I hold that what we call reality is
<br />
our minds' &quot;understanding&quot; of our sensory perceptions. Thus the notion
<br />
of (our) reality depends on:
<br />
<br />1.  The nature of mind
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's assume that the mind is simply the brain + the processes the
<br />
brain is capable of + the information it stores/processes. Then the
<br />
nature of the mind is the (sub)set of data-structures and computations
<br />
that the brain is capable of.
<br />
<br />2.  The process of &quot;understanding&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the above informal definition of the mind, understanding is
<br />
simply the following process:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.  organize incoming data into data-structures that the brain is
<br />
capable of storing and processing (itself a brain-process),
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.  process these data structures (computation) to make
<br />
&quot;predictions&quot; (just more data),
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.  compare these predictions with more incoming feeds from our
<br />
senses (experiment/testing),
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.  and finally re-adjust the organization of data in our brain
<br />
(data-structures) to accommodate the differences in prediction data
<br />
and sensory data.
<br />
The above process continues iteratively, thus the iterative
<br />
refinements in our theories of reality, aka physics.
<br />
<br />3.  Our sensory perceptions
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data that comes in to the brain. This clearly depends on the
<br />
instruments of perception (senses) themselves. For example a person
<br />
born with a microscope attached to his eyes will transfer very
<br />
different data to the brain than most of us, and thus may have a very
<br />
different &quot;understanding of reality&quot;.
<br />
<br />In other words, our understanding of reality depends on brains and our
<br />
senses. It can never be any more &quot;real&quot; or &quot;imaginary&quot;.
<br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we have to come up with an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation of how it is that our individual experiences of a world seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be confined to sharp valuations and the appearance of property definiteness.
</em><br />
response:
<br />
This is simply because of the similar constitution of our sensory
<br />
organs and brains (closeness in genotype and therefore phenotype if
<br />
you may). A fly's understanding of reality is probably very very
<br />
different (may or may not be sharp)
<br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     What does this have to do with mathematics and models? If we are going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to create/discover models of what we can all agree is sharp and definite-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our physical world, we must be sure that our models agree with each other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This, of course, assumes that there is some connection between abstract and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concrete aspect of *reality*.
</em><br />
response:
<br />
If we presume to take my above description of the nature of mental
<br />
models (mathematical/physical/etc.) as physical reality, then physical
<br />
reality itself guarantees that our models will always depend on not
<br />
only &quot;objective reality&quot; but also the &quot;nature of our mind&quot; and our
<br />
&quot;sensory perceptions&quot;, which themselves form a subset of reality.
<br />
<br />It is much easier to make other humans &quot;understand&quot; (have their brains
<br />
recalibrated to) a new model or theory than to attempt the same with a
<br />
fly (unless the fly is given a human brain and human sensory organs).
<br />
<br />Thus this &quot;agreement&quot; is NOT a certificate of validity for our models.
<br />
But this does NOT imply that there is no connection between abstract
<br />
and physical &quot;reality&quot;.
<br />
<br />Abstract reality is a &quot;parallel universe&quot; created by extrapolation on
<br />
a very limited (finite?) subset of &quot;concrete reality&quot;, namely our
<br />
brain, sensory perceptions and the computations therein. The purpose
<br />
of creating and refining this &quot;abstract reality&quot; (aka
<br />
mathematical/physical models) is to recalibrate the brain and senses
<br />
so that the abstract models it can hold predict incoming data
<br />
(concrete reality) with increasing accuracy.
<br />
<br />Yet this accuracy itself is limited by laws like those given by QM
<br />
(that limits the power of our senses). This suggests that we are close
<br />
to the best we can do, although we may continue coming monotonically
<br />
closer to the asymptotic optimum that we are limited to.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Ok, I would agree completely with you if we are using Kant's definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of *reality*- Dasein: existence in itself, but I was trying to be point out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we must have some kind of connection between the abstract and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concrete.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     One thing that I hope we all can agree upon about *reality* is that what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ever it is, its properties are invariant with respect to transformations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from one point of view to any other. It is this trait that makes it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;independent&quot;, but the problems with realism seem to arise when we consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether or not this *reality* has some set of properties to the exclusion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any others independent of some observational context.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     QM demands that we not treat objects as having some sharp set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties independent of context and thus the main source of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterintuitive aspects that make QM so difficult to deal with when we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach the subject of Realism. OTOH, we have to come up with an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation of how it is that our individual experiences of a world seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be confined to sharp valuations and the appearance of property definiteness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everett and others gave us the solution to this conundrum with the MWI. Any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given object has eigenstates (?) that have eigenvalues (?) that are sharp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and definite relative to some other set of eigenstates, but as a whole a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state/wave function is a superposition of all possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     So, what does this mean? We are to take the a priori and context
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independent aspect of *reality* as not having any one set of sharp and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definite properties, it has a superposition of all possible. The trick is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; figure out a reason why we have one basis and not some other, one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; partitioning of the eigenstates and not some other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     What does this have to do with mathematics and models? If we are going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to create/discover models of what we can all agree is sharp and definite-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our physical world, we must be sure that our models agree with each other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This, of course, assumes that there is some connection between abstract and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concrete aspect of *reality*.
