<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two additional things:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) The specification of boundary conditions (or any other equivalent

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) The selection of a set of global parameters.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My suggestion is that for 1), instead of specifying initial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conditions (what might be problematic for a number of reasons),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one could use another form of additional high level constraint
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which would be that the solution universe should be &quot;as much as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible more ordered on one side than on the other&quot;. Of course,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this rely on the possibility to give a sound sense to this, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implies to be able to find a canonical way to tell whether one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solution of the set of equations in more &quot;more ordered on one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; side than on the other&quot; than another solution.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think this is a valid approach, but I would put it into a larger
<br />
perspective.  The program you describe, if we were to actually implement
<br />
it, would have these parts: It has a certain set of laws of physics; it
<br />
has a certain order-measuring function (perhaps equivalent to what we know
<br />
as entropy); and it has a goal of finding conditions which maximize the
<br />
difference in this function's values from one side to the other of some
<br />
data structure that it is modifying or creating, and which represents
<br />
the universe.  It would not be particularly difficult to implement a
<br />
&quot;toy&quot; version of such a program based on some simple laws of physics, and
<br />
perhaps as you suggest our own universe might be the result of an instance
<br />
of such a program which is not all that much more large or complex.
<br />
<br />In the context of the All Universe Principle as interpreted by
<br />
Schmidhuber, all programs exist, and all the universes that they generate
<br />
exist.  This program that you describe is one of them, and the universe
<br />
that is thus generated is therefore part of the multiverse.
<br />
<br />So to first order, there is nothing particularly surprising or
<br />
problematical in envisioning programs like this as contributing to the
<br />
multiverse, along with the perhaps more naively obvious programs which
<br />
perform sequential simulation from some initial conditions.  All programs
<br />
exist, including ones which create universes in even more strange or
<br />
surprising ways than these.
<br />
<br />By the way, Wolfram's book (wolframscience.com) does consider some
<br />
non-sequential simulations as models for simple 1- and 2-dimensional
<br />
universes.  These are what he calls &quot;Systems Based on Constraints&quot;
<br />
discussed in his chapter 5.
<br />
<br />Where I think your idea is especially interesting is the possibility that
<br />
the program which creates our universe via this kind of optimization
<br />
technique (maximizing the difference in complexity) might be much
<br />
shorter than a more conventional program which creates our universe
<br />
via specifying initial conditions.  Shorter programs are considered
<br />
to have larger measure in the Schmidhuber model, hence it is of great
<br />
importance to discover the shortest program which generates our universe,
<br />
and if optimization rather than sequential simulation does lead to a
<br />
much shorter program, that means our universe has much higher measure
<br />
than we might have thought.
<br />
<br />However, I don't think we can evaluate this possibility in a meaningful
<br />
way until we have a better understanding of the physics of our own
<br />
universe.  I am somewhat skeptical that this particular optimization
<br />
principle is going to work, because our universe's disorder gradient is
<br />
dominated by the Big Bang's decay to heat death, and these cosmological
<br />
phenomena don't necessarily seem to require the kinds of atomic and
<br />
temporal structures that lead to observers.  If you look at Tegmark's
<br />
paper <a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html">http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html</a> which lists a number of the
<br />
physical-constant coincidences necessary for life, not all of them would
<br />
have cosmological importance and change the order-to-disorder gradient
<br />
of the universe.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It might well be that this additional constraint can also be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used for selecting the appropriate set of global parameter for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the set of equations considered in 2). It does not seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counter-intuitive that the sets of global parameters that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allows for the maximization of the gradient of order among all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible solutions considering all possible values for global
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parameters be precisely those for which SASs emerges and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore those we see in our universe: universes not able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generate complex enough substructures to be self aware would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably equally fail to exhibit large gradients of order and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vice versa.
</em><br />
<br />Certainly an interesting suggestion.  Again, when we look at the larger
<br />
view of all possible programs, we have optimization programs which
<br />
have some parameters fixed; and optimization programs which allow the
<br />
parameters to vary as part of the optimization process.  The latter
<br />
programs would tend to be smaller since they don't have to store the
<br />
value of the fixed parameters; but on the other hand the need to allow
<br />
for varying the parameters may add some complexity, so it might be that
<br />
particularly simple values of parameters can be accommodated without
<br />
increasing program size.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The hypothesis of the maximization the gradient of order seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even Popper-falsfiable. At least one prediction can be made:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given the set of equation that describe our universe and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding set of global parameters, if we can find a canonical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way to compare the relative global gradient of order within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes that satisfy this set of equations:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) It could be possible to determine the subset of universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    that maximize the gradient for each set of global parameters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    (comparing all possible universes for a given set of global
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    parameters), these being called &quot;optimal&quot; for this set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    global parameters.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) It could be possible to determine the sets of global parameters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    that maximize the gradient in an absolute way (comparing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    optimal universes for all possible sets of global parameters).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The prediction is that the set of global parameter that we observe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is one of those that maximizes the gradient of order within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding optimal universes.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that's a good prediction, and you may be right that we could already
<br />
take some steps towards testing it.  Tegmark's paper can be interpreted
<br />
as providing some such tests.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe also the constraint could be used at a third level if it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can remain consistent as a mean to select the appropriate set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equations.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, or at least for part of the equations.  As with the case of
<br />
parameters, all different versions of such programs would exist, and
<br />
the real question is which one is shortest.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From Wolfram's book, though, I can't escape the suspicion that no such
</em><br />
programs will turn out to be the shortest ones; but that there will be
<br />
some much smaller program that lacks the logic and clean division of
<br />
function that I describe above (the three parts, etc) but which still
<br />
manages to create our universe.  Once we move away from sequential
<br />
simulation and start considering optimization and other more exotic
<br />
techniques, it is difficult to avoid taking the next step and considering
<br />
random programs.  Wolfram's first few chapters amount to a taxonomy
<br />
of how random programs behave, and his tentative conclusion is that
<br />
a substantial fraction of them generate complex-looking structure.
<br />
<br />It may be a leap of faith to suppose that our highly intricate and ordered
<br />
universe could be generated by some incomprehensible mess of a program,
<br />
something much smaller and tighter than any human programmer could
<br />
create or perhaps even understand.  But there is some historical basis
<br />
for the idea that random programs can be more efficient in size than
<br />
human-designed ones; I recall that in one of the early Artificial Life
<br />
experiments, the original replicator carefully designed as the initial
<br />
seed soon self-improved to be even smaller than the human designer had
<br />
thought possible.
