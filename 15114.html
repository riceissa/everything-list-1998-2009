<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Le 04-nov.-08, à 23:21, Jason Resch a écrit :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; although I agree with Brent, if the simulated world in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; entirely cut off from causal effects of the physical world where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computer is running, then you have also created an entirely new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; world/reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with this too. The only thing necessary to understand step 6,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that you do survive there  like if it was teleportation. And in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context, the calculus of probability remains the same as in the five
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preceding steps. For example, if you understand step 5, you know that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if a instantenous of you is done, and is not detsroyed, and if that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copy is reinstantiated in the virtual Moscow tomorrow, and in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; virtual Washington in one billion of years, the probability that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will &quot;stay here&quot; (and not find yourself in the virtual realities) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1/3 (assuming 1/2 for perfect duplication). It means that Nozick's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; closer continuer identity theory fails with comp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My only reservation with the above is I am not sure probabilities in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expecting your next observer moment work this way.  From a third  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person perspective I have a 100% chance of experiencing all 3  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extensions, and as you say, this is interesting because from a first  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person POV you do not experience all 3 locations at once.  I think  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is where I disagree, you _do_ experience all 3 locations at  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once, but due to the isolated locations and lack of communication  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the 3 different brains, they are unable to merge the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience into a memory of being in all 3 locations.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I do agree with you. But in that sense I am already Jason Resch. We  
<br />
come from the same splitting amoeba. This is true, at some level, but  
<br />
it does not seem to me relevant for the understanding that physics  
<br />
*has to* be extracted from probability/credibility measure on  
<br />
computations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the same reason that though Einstein says we exist in a 4- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimensional block where time is only subjective, we never experience  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being in all times at once, due to the limited, low-bandwidth,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication from past memories to the present, and complete lack  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of communication from future states to the present.  The vast  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; majority of information within our brain state at any one time is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chiefly information of the present and very recent past, giving us  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the feeling of living in the present, when of course our true nature  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that of a 4-dimensional snake stretching from the time of birth  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to death.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This lack of communication between individual brains is what fools  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us into believing we are each a unique conscious entity, when truly  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is nothing to differentiate one observer from any other,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; except for the current content of their experience.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are right. But when you look for the true reason why apples appear  
<br />
to fall on the ground. UDA(+AGF, that is 1...8) explains why the comp  
<br />
correct way to predict the behavior of the apple consists in looking  
<br />
in the universal deployment, and then looking at all computations  
<br />
going through your actual states (the one you have (by comp) once you  
<br />
observet the apple before dropping it), and, looking at the normal  
<br />
most probable stories/computations going through that state.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm... perhaps you have a problem with the UD? It does not just  
<br />
generate OM (Observer Moment). The DU generates all third person  
<br />
&quot;observer moments&quot;  (as instantaneous state of universal self- 
<br />
observing machine) by generating all the stories (singular  
<br />
computations) going through that state. There is a continuum (from a  
<br />
first person pov) of such stories. The first person moment are  
<br />
different modalities.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I think it is a mistake to use the memories one has access to as a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means to delineate observers, for the vast majority of ones memories  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are not in the content of ones OM at any one time.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are right, but not at the level needed to understand why and how,  
<br />
assuming comp, we *have* to explain why apples falls from &quot;pure  
<br />
(mathematical) computer science&quot;.  (or perhaps you are and there is a  
<br />
misunderstanding, to be sure). The reasoning should show comp  
<br />
testable.  So we have to take into account all computations going  
<br />
through each observer moment to have normal relative &quot;expected  
<br />
values&quot;. A bit like already with QM and Everett.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I think the importance of a particular computational history in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defining an &quot;observer moment&quot; is not as important as memory/ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication isolation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are right if your goal is to discover who you really are. But not  
<br />
if your goal is to understand why we have to derive Schoedinger  
<br />
Equation from computer science and number theory. It makes comp  
<br />
testable, and it provide a fundamental theory which does not eliminate  
<br />
the person. On the contrary it explains how person creates reality by  
<br />
history sharing.
<br />
Somehow the memory/communication is a key, to delineate sharable  
<br />
stories, to extract eventually the right notion of arithmetical  
<br />
entanglement. But this is not easy matter.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Universal Dovetailer shares a single computational history as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one well-defined short program, and it implements all possible  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moments.
</em><br />
<br />Careful. For an infinitely deep reason related to Church Thesis and  
<br />
the closure of the set of computable functions for the diagonal  
<br />
procedure (the real difficulty of the seventh step),  the Universal  
<br />
Dovetailer does not generate just all observer moments, it generate  
<br />
all the computational histories going through or accessing those  
<br />
observer moments. Those computations obeys the laws of, well ..., of  
<br />
computations, meaning we have to take at computer science. Eventually  
<br />
we have to interview the relatively most probable machine).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet would not all OM's it generates be considered the same since  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they share a single computational history?
</em><br />
<br />Gosh! I was suspecting you have a problem with the UD work. The UD  
<br />
does not generate the third person OMs. The UD generate the many  
<br />
stories (computations).  It generates all programs AND their many  
<br />
relative implementations. Well this includes it generates also his own  
<br />
history many times, but also all other stories (Universal!).
<br />
Most stories are infinite, that is what it has to zig-zag recurrently  
<br />
on the stories it generates. Those stories themselves generate the 3-  
<br />
OM,( or not (depending on the story and also of the precise definition  
<br />
of OM). Third person OMs are &quot;causally related&quot; through their singular  
<br />
computations.
<br />
First person OMs are related to their probable histories which depend  
<br />
on the infinitely many stories going through them.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think it is better to track the flow of information that goes
</em><br />
<br />Yes. (Well your sentence is interrupted) but I agree we have to track  
<br />
the information going through the stories of those OMs. I am just  
<br />
saying that with UDA(1...7) we know that we have to take account of  
<br />
ALL the stories. And with UDA.8 we have to to take account of only the  
<br />
mathematical even arithmetical 3-stories. But the 1-histories will  
<br />
explode in the full first person plenitude. Arithmetic as seen from  
<br />
inside is already bigger than Cantor Paradise or any mathematical  
<br />
approximation of Plato Heaven. But let us not anticipate perhaps (some  
<br />
have get the point I think, and it is a remind for them, let us say).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Experiencingo ne moment because of no communication from the future  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tothe past, and very low bandwidth rate from the past to the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present)  Surely if I was duplicated to 100 locations (only one of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which was Moscow), I could wager $1 that I will not appear in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Moscow, and 99 of my copies will be richer but
</em><br />
<br />but?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One OM that travels across all OM's, the UD?  ...Share computational  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history, same program, it is jsut that the information doesn't get  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; linked between them.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All 3-OMs are linked by one computation. But reappears in other  
<br />
computations as well. Then by UDA: all 1-OMs are linked by infinities  
<br />
of (and measure on) computations.
<br />
<br />Just remember this: the UD generates all computations. For each OMs  
<br />
there is an infinity of computations going through it. It is really  
<br />
because he first person cannot be aware of the delays (defined here by  
<br />
number of steps of the UD to get some OM),  that the 1-person  
<br />
indeterminacy bears on infinite sets of computations.
<br />
<br />Don't confuse the (abstract) running of the UD, and the computations  
<br />
on which the UD is running. I have not the yime now, but  I could try  
<br />
to draw a picture.
<br />
<br />Tell me if this has helped a bit, or not.
