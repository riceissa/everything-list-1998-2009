<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I may be wrong, but it seems to me that the notions of computer, program,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;UD ans so on... require the notion of (time ) ordering. A Turing machine is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;decribed as a sequence of states, not a set of states. But if time (as I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think too) is an illusion, why invoke a computation instead of some static
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state? Then the set of all possible finite computations is N.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So you are basically saying: the Universe is N. But why not R, P(R) or any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more complicated set?
</em><br />
<br />I am not really saying &quot;the Universe is N&quot;. I am saying (loosely 
<br />
speaking):
<br />
<br />If I am N then I will see R P(R) and a lot of complicated set, including 
<br />
a lot of universes and minds.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My opinion is you are trying the same method as Descartes: believing that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you can uncover the true reality only by thinking.
</em><br />
<br />I like Descartes very much indeed. Here is one of my admittedly 
<br />
provocative slogan : Descartes invented Modern Universal Science, ... and 
<br />
Modern Anglo-saxon Philosophy.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But Descartes (and his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;predecessors) failed to discover most of the physical laws. Only Galileo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and Newton, by trying to explain experimental facts with laws, did really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;found modern Science.
</em><br />
<br />Gosh!... I am afraid only a french can be so unfair to Descartes !
<br />
What about the optic laws, his pionnering work on dreams and 
<br />
neurophysiology, etc. Descartes also emphasized the important role of 
<br />
personal conviction in both science and philosophy ...
<br />
Without Descartes'arithmetization of geometry, neither Newton, nor 
<br />
Leibnitz would have invented calculus, etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is not surprising that the people of the last XX century imagine the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world based on a computation, just like Greeks have imagined it as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;combination of four elements, or theologist have imagined it as driven by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;God (it confirms that consciouness can only produce ideas from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interaction with an outer world!)
</em><br />
<br />... unless you find God in yourself ! (Take this as a pun).
<br />
<br />But honestly I think that in the XX century there has been Church, 
<br />
Turing, Post, Godel, and Kleene, which lead to theoretical computer 
<br />
science.
<br />
As Godel eventually realised, Church's thesis is really a kind of 
<br />
miracle: the discovery of the absoluteness of the computability concept 
<br />
(and the discovery of the corresponding relativeness of the provability 
<br />
concept). 
<br />
I believe that it is a major result in general philosophy.
<br />
(BTW Church's thesis has nothing to do with what Deutsch call The 
<br />
Church-Turing principle, unless you admit strong physicalist axiom right 
<br />
at the start).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(I agree that the world around us can be only an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appearance, but nevertheless this appearance does exist and must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explained!)
</em><br />
<br />I agree with you that the appearance must be explained. It is an 
<br />
important point where we agree. It is exactly what I propose to do.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So if you exhibit a property, or even an idea of which property  of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world could eventually be found with theory of great programmer or UD or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any theory like that, I will applaude and suscribe to the fan club.
</em><br />
<br /><br />To derive explicitely laws of nature, there is a difficulty (both my 
<br />
director and Jacques Baihache have seen rather clearly) which is that I 
<br />
cannot draw a clear line between the necessary and the contingent laws : 
<br />
comp makes necessary to deduce (by pure thinking) only the necessary part 
<br />
of physics. 
<br />
<br />Have you follow the PE-omega experience ? If yes you should understand 
<br />
how comp makes it possible to predict indeterminisme, non-locality, and 
<br />
even some kind of quantum logic. Obviously physicist have discovered all 
<br />
that before computer scientist. But computer science is still very young, 
<br />
and the idea that computer science can be &quot;the&quot; fundamental science is 
<br />
still &quot;in-birth&quot; (to say the least).
<br />
<br />But more importantly, the goal is not to derived the laws of physics by 
<br />
pure thinking, the goal is to understand where does (the belief in the) 
<br />
law of physics (whatever they are) comes from (much in the spirit of 
<br />
Wheeler's &quot;laws without law&quot;).
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Bruno
