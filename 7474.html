<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of hearing these amazing things...
</em><br />
<br />The point you are making is the most convincing, and also most troubling, 
<br />
argument in support of your thesis that we should consider copies as selves. 
<br />
If I die today and then a backup copy of me that was made yesterday is run, 
<br />
this is equivalent to me losing a day of memories. If I believe that I will 
<br />
survive if I experience the memory loss, then I must also believe that I 
<br />
will survive my death if the backup is run.
<br />
<br />I think there is good reason to equate memory loss with death. The sense of 
<br />
personal identity is dynamic, redefined every moment by the sum of all 
<br />
mental processes which, iceberg-like, surface and manifest as conscious 
<br />
experience. When I think about the immediate future, I think about what it 
<br />
will be like for me as I am *now*; how I was yesterday or last year is of 
<br />
course important in making me as I am now, but if those former selves came 
<br />
along in a time machine or as backup copies, I would not share their first 
<br />
person experiences, nor they mine. If I think about imminent death, I think 
<br />
about me-now having no more experiences of any sort, ever again. This could 
<br />
come about with the physical death of my body, or it could come about with 
<br />
the destruction of this me-now construct, which is what would happen if my 
<br />
memory were wiped. I know that Stathis will still have experiences if part 
<br />
of my memory is wiped, but in an important first person sense it will be a 
<br />
different Stathis, because it won't be me-now experiencing a next moment. If 
<br />
I die or my memory is wiped, the first person experience of the present 
<br />
moment, and all of what would have been its linear descendants, will vanish 
<br />
from the universe forever.
<br />
<br />Now, people lose parts of their memory all the time, and the person who 
<br />
survives the memory loss generally doesn't worry about the fate of the 
<br />
person who lost their memory. We have seen this in the reports of those who 
<br />
have undergone medical procedures under sedation with midazolam: even if 
<br />
they did experience pain, they can't remember it so it doesn't matter now. 
<br />
This is in keeping with what I have said above about the person who is about 
<br />
to lose their memory being effectively a separate individual who is about to 
<br />
die. Sometimes their are legal consequences for a person's bad behaviour 
<br />
when intoxicated, and often they are quite indignant that they are being 
<br />
charged: if I can't remember it, it wasn't really I who did it. (In a sense, 
<br />
this leads *away* from the conclusion that copies are selves if the analogy 
<br />
with memory loss is to be pursued: the person who loses their memory and the 
<br />
person who survives may actually know nothing about each other, care nothing 
<br />
about each other, and even work directly against each other's interests. 
<br />
They share the same identity and some or most of their past, but they are 
<br />
separate entities.)
<br />
<br />Having said all that, why have I stated in previous posts that I would agree 
<br />
to some memory loss for a sum of money? Because I will convince myself that 
<br />
I will survive it, I have seen other people apparently survive it, and I 
<br />
have apparently survived it myself in the past. So why would I not agree to 
<br />
effectively the same amount of memory loss by killing myself given that a 
<br />
backup of my mind has been made? Perhaps for the same reason that I would 
<br />
not jump out of a plane with a parachute, even if I knew that the parachute 
<br />
would work properly.
