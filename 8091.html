<br />
When considering possible continuations of &quot;observer-moments&quot;, one
<br />
speaks of dividing one's measure among them such that any succeeding
<br />
observer-moment has a relative proportion consistent with the quantum
<br />
amplitude of its wave function. (Or something like that.)
<br />
<br />My first question is: Can this go on indefinitely?  Based on my
<br />
understanding of MWI, the answer is yes, but I haven't seen this
<br />
addressed before.  I think another way to ask this is, can the amplitude
<br />
of a wave function ever go to zero for all values of it's dependent
<br />
variable?  (Forgive me if this is an ill-formed question, I'm still
<br />
sorting out in my own mind what I'm trying to figure out.)
<br />
<br />Secondly, there are value-judgment arguments made here on the list about
<br />
the desirability of taking certain actions based on the anticipated
<br />
observer-measure that would result from them, such as implied by Lee
<br />
Corbin's recent comment:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not sure I entirely understand, but it seems to me that we survive in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Harry potter like universes&quot;, but only get very little runtime there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (i.e. have very low measure in those).
</em><br />
<br />I can understand the argument that one's present expectation value of an
<br />
possible outcome is related to the proportion of one's measure that
<br />
would continue in that &quot;branch&quot; of the wave function.
<br />
<br />But here is where my first question has implications--if &quot;measure&quot; has
<br />
some finite lower bound, then eventually, all roads lead to zero at some
<br />
point.  An observer would have a strong motivation to take actions which
<br />
maximize one's future measure &quot;integral&quot;, to stave off this impending
<br />
non-existence as long as possible.
<br />
<br />If, on the other hand, measure is infinitely divisible, then there will
<br />
always be a branch that will continue.
<br />
<br />Finally, here's my second question: Does being in a &quot;low&quot; measure branch
<br />
somehow &quot;feel different&quot; from being in a &quot;high&quot; measure branch?  To take
<br />
the canonical example, let's say one is next to that 20 megaton H-Bomb
<br />
when it detonates.  In one branch, with a very very tiny fraction of
<br />
one's current measure, one will find himself magically tunneled and
<br />
reformed somewhere away from the danger.  The expectation value of this
<br />
happening, of course is tiny, but is non-zero, so it does happen
<br />
somewhere in the multiverse.
<br />
<br />Now, finding oneself, after the fact, having survived the blast by
<br />
quantum tunneling, one realizes one is in a low measure branch of his
<br />
wave function.  But does it really matter?  If measure is infinitely
<br />
divisible, I don't think it does.  But if measure can &quot;run out&quot;, then
<br />
I've just brought that point in time much closer. (Of course, one could
<br />
then also argue that the quantum amplitude of surviving the blast would
<br />
likely fall below this threshold, so there would be no continuer at all.)
<br />
<br />I've seen references to something called the &quot;no cul-de-sac theorem&quot;,
<br />
which sounds like what I'm talking about, but I can't seem to find out
<br />
more about it in Google or Wikipedia.
<br />
<br />I also think what I've been discussing is related to the RSSA and ASSA
<br />
concepts, but I don't understand those well enough.  I think I've been
<br />
assuming RSSA here in my argument though.
<br />
<br />Thoughts?
<br />
