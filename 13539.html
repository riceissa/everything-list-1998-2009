Hi Stathis,
<br />
<br />Colin
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    The bogus logic I detect in posts around this area...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    'Humans are complex and are conscious'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    'Humans were made by a complex biosphere'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    'The biosphere is conscious'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Stathis
<br />
That conclusion is spurious, but it is the case that non-conscious
<br />
evolutionary processes can give rise to very elaborate &quot;technology&quot;,
<br />
namely life, which goes against your theory that only consciousness can
<br />
produce new technology.
<br />
<br />Colin
<br />
This point is poised on the cliff edge of loaded word meanings and their
<br />
use with the words 'sufficient' and 'necessary'. By technology I mean
<br />
novel artifacts resulting from the trajectory of causality including human
<br />
scientists. By that definition 'life', in the sense you infer, is not
<br />
technology. The resulting logical loop can be thus avoided. There is a
<br />
biosphere that arose naturally. It includes complexity of sufficient depth
<br />
to have created observers within it. Those observers can produce
<br />
technology. Douglas Adams (bless him) had the digital watch as a valid
<br />
product of evolution - and I agree with him - it's just that humans are
<br />
necessarily involved in its causal ancestry.
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    That assumes that complexity itself (organisation of information) is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    origin of consciousness in some unspecified, unjustified way. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    position is completely unable to make any empirical predictions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    nature of human conscousness (eg why your cortex generates qualia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    and your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    spinal chord doesn't - a physiologically proven fact).
</em><br />
<br /><br />STATHIS
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, why does your eye generate visual qualia and not your big toe?
</em><br />
It's because the big toe lacks the necessary machinery.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Colin
<br />
I am afraid you have your physiology mixed up. The eye does NOT generate
<br />
visual qualia. Your visual cortex  generates it based on measurements in
<br />
the eye. The qualia are manufactured and simultaneously projected to
<br />
appear to come from the eye (actually somewhere medial to them). It's how
<br />
you have 90degrees++ peripheral vison. The same visual qualia can be
<br />
generated without an eye (hallucination/dream). Some blind (no functioning
<br />
retina) people have a visual field for numbers. Other cross-modal mixups
<br />
can occur in synesthesia (you can hear colours, taste words). You can have
<br />
a &quot;phantom big toe&quot; without having any big toe at all....just because the
<br />
cortex is still there making the qualia. If you swapped the sensory nerves
<br />
in two fingers the motor cortex would drive finger A and it would feel
<br />
like finger B moved and you would see finger A move. The sensation is in
<br />
your head, not the periphery. It's merely projected at the periphery.
<br />
<br />cheers
