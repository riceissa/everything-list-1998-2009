</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But we could just as easily create a cell system where there was no

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural definition of time, where C[i,j] depended on i+1, i-1, j+1

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and j-1.  You could still imaging satisfying this via some constraint

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; satisfaction algorithm.
</em><br />
<br />+1
<br />
<br />I'll have to think about the CA implications --- what is a &quot;cell&quot; in 
<br />
such a CA, and what is meant by the various &quot;nearness&quot; relationships of 
<br />
such cells?  (I'm still processing Wolfram's book, a couple of years 
<br />
after reading it the first time. ;-)
<br />
<br />I'm just adopting a relatively conventional GR point-of-view here, 
<br />
where time is just another direction, albeit one in which travel is (in 
<br />
most circumstances, depending on the local differential geometry and 
<br />
geometrodynamics) directionally constrained.  (I'm ignoring the 
<br />
thermodynamic interpretation of time's arrow, though when you throw 2LT 
<br />
into this particular brew things would seem to get rather interesting. 
<br />
;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now these jinni worlds are ones which mostly have these conditions we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identify as time and causality, but which locally, or perhaps rarely,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do not satisfy such rules.  Seen in this perspective, there is a full
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; range of possibilities, from fully causal worlds, to ones which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 99.999% causal and only .0001% noncausal, to ones which are 50-50, to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones for which no meaningful concept of causality can be defined.
</em><br />
<br />We're begging the question re: causality;  it was perhaps unfortunate 
<br />
that I chose to use that word, as it's interpretive rather than 
<br />
descriptive in itself.  The argument Boulware's making appears to be 
<br />
inherently probabilistic and geometric rather than ontological.  That 
<br />
became less clear in my exposition, my bad.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll have to look at this.  It doesn't sound quite right.  If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilities are non-unitary that violates the fundamental rules of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; QM,
</em><br />
<br />But do they?  This is, I think, perhaps a very interesting and 
<br />
pertinent question.  It certainly appears to throw both the QM 
<br />
formalism as well as its interpretations into disarray, but I think 
<br />
perhaps the result is less than fatal.  One can certainly do statistics 
<br />
(and hence QM) with non-unitary probabilities --- the method involves a 
<br />
kind of normalizing transformation between different probabilistic 
<br />
measures.  (In fact this very issue was dealt with by one of Gott's 
<br />
grad students;  the citation escapes me at the moment, but he found 
<br />
that you could patch things up by simply supplying a kind of local 
<br />
correction coefficient.  I.e., while this appears prohibitive on the 
<br />
surface, in fact &quot;fixing it up&quot; isn't all that difficult.  The 
<br />
ontological interpretation of the relationships between these patch 
<br />
coefficients, OTOH, is IMHO pretty surreal.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you're getting awfully speculative here.
</em><br />
<br />This is a criticism, in *this* group in particular? ;-)  It's 
<br />
admittedly speculative.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It sounds like you are suggesting that it would be simpler to suppose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that &quot;all universes exist which contain jinn&quot; than &quot;all universes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Not precisely;  I'm suggesting that &quot;simple&quot; is difficult to measure 
<br />
when speaking about TOEs.  There might be some measures of &quot;simple&quot; for 
<br />
which the above is true;  there are others, e.g. the Champernowne 
<br />
machine and so forth, for which it is certainly not.  But Occam's Razor 
<br />
isn't much help here by itself.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That doesn't seem at all plausble to me.  My heuristic is that any rule
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the form &quot;all universes exist except X&quot; is going to be more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complicated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than one of the form &quot;all universes exist&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />On the surface, sure.  But consider:  the statement &quot;all universes 
<br />
exist&quot; presupposes a definition of universe that it omits.  What is 
<br />
meant by &quot;universe&quot; requires an exhaustive definition, and the 
<br />
algorithmic hypotheses make varying assumptions about that definition.  
<br />
My intuition would be that the most parsimonious definition would be 
<br />
the preferable one;  but we don't have any metrics for &quot;parsimony&quot; on 
<br />
such definitions.  It could be that definitions that statically embed 
<br />
such jinn might be more parsimonious by some measure than other ones;  
<br />
the statically-defined jinn might &quot;ground out&quot; the definition and 
<br />
permit a higher-order / more abstract / terser &quot;universe generation 
<br />
algorithm.&quot;  (Think Python vs. its own bytecode.)
<br />
<br />Think of it this way:  any formal system has its base axioms.  In this 
<br />
context, the &quot;universe generator&quot; is the system in toto;  the jinn 
<br />
could form (at least a part of) its axioms.  Or, thinking about it in 
<br />
nonlinear dynamical terms, the jinn form the attractors which 
<br />
&quot;condense&quot; permissible universes out of the space of all possible 
<br />
universes.  Or, thinking about programming languages:  this works the 
<br />
same way that e.g. code generation templates for various programming 
<br />
language compilers (and the associated high-level language primitives 
<br />
and syntax) define the space of permissible programs.  This doesn't 
<br />
restrict program behavior at a high order, but does prohibit the direct 
<br />
expression of nonsensical things like 1/0.  (Okay, the latter analogy 
<br />
is stretching things pretty far... ;-)
<br />
<br />To be clear about all of this, though:  I'm not really proposing any 
<br />
hypothesis here, more like musing out loud.  :-)
