<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now suppose that two people, Alice and Bob, somehow agree that a measure M

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making decisions. He says &quot;So what if universe A has a bigger measure than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe B according to M? I just care more about what happens in universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B than universe A, so I'll use M' which assigns a bigger measure to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe B.&quot; What can Alice say to Bob to convince him that he is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not being rational? I don't see what the answer could be.
</em><br />
<br />How about if she whacks him on the head?  Maybe that would knock some sense
<br />
into him.
<br />
<br />Seriously, she could confront him with the reality that in the universe
<br />
branch they are in, measure M works, while M' does not.  Reality, whether
<br />
in the form of a knock on the head or more peaceful interactions, is
<br />
not subjective.
<br />
<br />Now, true, there would be branches in the multiverse where M' worked
<br />
while M did not.  Believers in objective measure would say that those
<br />
branches are of low measure and so &quot;don't matter&quot;, but as you point out,
<br />
Bob can argue symmetrically that this branch where he is stuck with
<br />
Alice and M has worked is also, to him, of low measure.
<br />
<br />But we can solve this conundrum while retaining symmetry.  Rationality
<br />
should demand allegience to the observed measure.   It is irrational to
<br />
cling to a measure which has been rejected repeatedly by observations.
<br />
If classical definitions of rationality don't have this property, we
<br />
should fix them.  Bob is irrational to hold to M' in a universe whose
<br />
observations reveal M.
<br />
<br />Now, this will demand that in White Rabbit universes, ones where the
<br />
quantum or thermodynamic laws just happen to fail due to bad luck, a
<br />
rational person would have to abandon his (correct!) belief in a lawful
<br />
universe and come to believe (incorrectly!) in miracles.  However this
<br />
is actually a reasonable requirement, since we are stipulating that such
<br />
miracles have been observed.
