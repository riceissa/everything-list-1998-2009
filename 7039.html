<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, if you think there is a concrete reality in which everything exists 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (your question of where does the observer live?), then the AP is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tautology.
</em><br />
<br />What I meant by &quot;where does the observer live&quot;, in more formal language, 
<br />
is &quot;how do you account for the (apparent) sense data we have?&quot;. I also 
<br />
have a strong preference for an account where the description of at least 
<br />
our &quot;world&quot; doesn't privilege one particular observer. In particular, this 
<br />
is hard to square with your insistence that &quot;the observer provides the 
<br />
interpretation&quot; of each of your bitstring universes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, if you are prepared to allow for the possibility that observers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist &quot;nowhere&quot;, then things are not quite so simple. One can always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagine being the brain-in-the-vat observer a reality which does not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain a body, or a brain, in a vat or anywhere else. Usually in this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scenario, the observer will conclude that there must be a body somewhere 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else, and so concludes that it is inhabiting some kind of virtual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality. However, this implicitly assumes there has to a brain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhere, and so implies a reality somewhere else for the brain to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inhabit. But what if the brain is not required?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously, the last conclusion is full blown solipsism, but that is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hardly a knock down argument.
</em><br />
<br />As both Hal and I keep trying to emphasise, we are interested in how, or 
<br />
whether, your theory can account for our own existence and the reality (or 
<br />
appearance, if you prefer) that we see around us. So the case of 
<br />
disembodied intelligences is a total a red herring. I don't really care 
<br />
whether these feature in your theory or not, but I do care whether you can 
<br />
account for (apparently) embodied intelligences.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Instead, one can take the Anthropic Principle as an assertion of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality we inhabit...
</em><br />
<br />Again, you are using a private language... the AP is not regarded as any 
<br />
such assertion by anyone else I've ever heard of. Most people regard their 
<br />
existence as proved by their own subjective experience, not some invented 
<br />
principle. If you don't agree I think we are just arguing about the 
<br />
meaning of &quot;exist&quot;... e.g. if we happen to be living in a computer 
<br />
simulation, or are just features of the solution of some set of equations, 
<br />
I would still say that we (really) exist.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  ... and experimentally test it. In all such cases is has been shown to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be true, sometimes spectacularly.
</em><br />
<br />If we know &quot;experimentally&quot; &quot;the reality we inhabit&quot; (?!), which I guess 
<br />
I've just claimed that we do, why do we need a principle to assert it?
<br />
<br />Likely you mean something completely different, in which case please 
<br />
explain (with examples of said experiments!).
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt; Quoting me:
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Then you are implying that the observer can, in a finite time, read and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; attach meaning to a full (space-time) description of itself, including 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the act of reading this description and so on recursively.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not at all. Consistency is the only requirement. If the observer goes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looking for erself, then e will find erself in the description. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't imply the observer is doing this all the time.
</em><br />
<br />I think here we have run into the same inconsistency that you admitted in 
<br />
your discussion with Hal. In your first reply to Hal you assert that the 
<br />
observer O(x) attaches a unique meaning to the description string. Which 
<br />
would imply processing all bits of the string up to the start of the 
<br />
&quot;don't care&quot; region. A later reply suggest that we should in different 
<br />
contexts assume (a) this and (b) what your paper actually says, i.e. the 
<br />
meanings are updated as further bits are read.  Now you have changed this 
<br />
again, and the observer is not (modelled by) a simple mapping but is a 
<br />
free agent who can choose to apply mappings to different &quot;regions&quot; of the 
<br />
bitstring at will.
<br />
<br />And even that doesn't actually answer my problem: let's assume the 
<br />
observer *does* &quot;go looking for erself&quot;. You claim he will find himself, 
<br />
but if the description is *complete* my original problem remains: he will 
<br />
never finish reading his own description. Consequently the description 
<br />
will remain uninterpreted. In particular, he will never get to the part 
<br />
which would be interpreted as &quot;himself now&quot;. So is there any sense in 
<br />
which *himself now* exists?
<br />
<br />This assumes that the string description contained a complete definition 
<br />
of the observer, which is a natural interpretation of your phrase:
<br />
<br />&quot;Since some of these descriptions describe self aware substructures,...&quot;
<br />
<br />But maybe you just meant that the string contains references to (tokens 
<br />
of) the observer. This would be consistent with your comment a couple of 
<br />
posts ago that both &quot;observers&quot; and &quot;descriptions&quot; are primary.  This also 
<br />
seems to be consistent with your other recent post in response to Hal, in 
<br />
which the bitstrings are treated not so much as universes in the usual 
<br />
sense but as either the stream of sense data entering the observer's 
<br />
conciousness, or as a continuously-updated description of that 
<br />
conciousness itself.
<br />
<br />In which case your paper should have specified the set of observers which 
<br />
are deemed to exist, e.g. is it all maps from prefix strings to natural 
<br />
numbers? Or maybe you only need one observer if its target domain is the 
<br />
full set of natural numbers, because you can then reach any of them from 
<br />
one or another of your bitstrings.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You also said:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not entirely sure I distinguish your difference between &quot;external 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; world&quot; and &quot;internal representation&quot;. We're talking about observations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; here, not models.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm sure you can distinguish *my* mental representation of the world 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from your own. Hence if we share a world, and you can't distinguish 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; between that world and your internal representation, then you are not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; granting equal status to other observers such as me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure that is the case. I have a theory of your mind. I get it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most economically by observing my own mind, hence I'm self-aware. My 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory of the mind says that you are doing the same thing. Isn't this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symmetric?
</em><br />
<br />Sure.  But a theory of other people's minds that's any use, allows them to 
<br />
be factually mistaken or ignorant (otherwise people's behaviour is 
<br />
inexplicable). Which implies there is a matter of fact about things that 
<br />
may be different from their internal representation.  And anyone but a 
<br />
solipsist should apply your symmetry principle to conclude that the same 
<br />
applies to them, i.e. that there is a difference between the &quot;external 
<br />
world&quot; and their internal representation of it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You also said (quoting me):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My problem is that you are trying to make your observers work at two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different levels: as structures within the universes generated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (somehow!) by your bitstrings, but also as an interpretive principle 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for producing meaning by operating *on* the bitstrings.  It's a bit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like claiming that PCs are built by &quot;The Sims&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes it is a bit like that. Obviously, the Anthropic Principle (or its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; equivalent) does not work with &quot;The Sims&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Actually I don't see why not. The existence of The Sims implies a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe compatible with the existence of Sims. But granting this is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not so for the sake of the argument, presumably the AP *will* apply to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the Sims Mark VII which will be fully self-aware artificial 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intelligences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the AP applies to the Sims Mark VII, then their reality will be a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description containing a &quot;body&quot; corresponding to their intelligences. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They will not be aware of the PC that their description is being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generated on. We, who inhabit the world with the PC will not be aware of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the countless other PCs, Macs, Xboxes, Eniacs, Turing machines, pebbles 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in Zen monasteries etc running Sims Mark VII. So the PC itself is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually irrelevant from the internal perspective of the Sims.
</em><br />
<br />Well at least we agree on that.  No strange loops in this picture, so 
<br />
it is unlike the picture you outline in your paper.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But it will still be absurd to claim that the Sims are responsible for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; construction of PCs (assuming they are not connected to robot arms etc, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for which no analogs exist in your theory). Let alone for them to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; construct the actual PC on which they are running, as apparently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; implied by your last message... even robot arms wouldn't help there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, it is called stretching an an analogy too far!
</em><br />
<br />I havn't stretched it at all from the analogy you originally accepted (see 
<br />
above). I've just removed your get-out about your AP not applying.
