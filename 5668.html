<br />
I have been wondering about the possibility that all possible worlds exist, 
<br />
but sequentially rather than simultaneously, under a conservative cosmology 
<br />
with assumptions as follows:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />1. There exists one, and only one, real, physical universe;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />2. While it is possible to simulate any subset of this universe, including 
<br />
conscious beings, with a computer program, this program must be implemented 
<br />
on a physical computer, or on a virtual machine (or series of such) which is 
<br />
itself implemented on a physical computer;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />3. The universe has a finite age and is comprised of a finite amount of 
<br />
matter/space/energy, but it is expanding and cooling and will continue to do 
<br />
so forever;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />4. Some single world interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />My understanding is that the above assumptions, which I have deliberately 
<br />
chosen as being contrary to many of the ideas discussed on the Everything 
<br />
List, still allow for the possibility of fantastically unlikely events, such 
<br />
as the spontaneous formation of an exact and stable copy of our solar system 
<br />
from the random motion of particles in interstellar space, or from vacuum 
<br />
fluctuations posited by the Uncertainty Principle.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Let p(t) = probability that an event P will occur somewhere in the universe 
<br />
during the next year, t years from the present. The probability that P will 
<br />
NOT occur at some time between the present (t=0) and (t=a+1) is then given 
<br />
by the product:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[1-p(0)]*[1-p(1)]*[1-p(2)]...*[1-p(a)]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />As a-&gt; infinity this becomes an infinite product, representing the 
<br />
probability that P will NEVER occur. It is easy to see that this infinite 
<br />
product diverges to zero in the special case where p(t) is constant for all 
<br />
t; in other words, that P, however unlikely, will definitely occur at some 
<br />
point in the future if the probability that it occurs during a unit time 
<br />
period remains constant over time. The same conclusion applies if p(t) 
<br />
increases with increasing t: the infinite product diverges to zero, more 
<br />
quickly than in the case of constant p(t).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Things get more difficult, however, if p(t) decreases over time. A Google 
<br />
search for &quot;infinite product&quot; brought up some very complicated expressions 
<br />
for even rather simple p(t), and it is by no means obvious (to me, anyway) 
<br />
whether the product will converge or diverge.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Now, my question is, what happens to p(t) over time? I would have guessed 
<br />
that as the universe expands, chemical and nuclear reactions are less likely 
<br />
to occur, in the same way as chemical reaction rates are proportional to the 
<br />
concentration the reagents. On the other hand, it is not clear to me how 
<br />
more exotic processes such as spontaneous appearance of particles out of the 
<br />
vacuum are affected by the expansion, which after all results in &quot;more 
<br />
vacuum&quot; - doesn't it?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I'm sure the above is a gross oversimplification - I'm not a physicist - but 
<br />
I would welcome people's thoughts on it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Stathis Papaioannou
