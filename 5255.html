<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;any kind. Clearly, you don't think the idea that ME == PE makes

sense.
<br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;That's understandable, but here's a brief sketch of why I think it
</em><br />
makes
<br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;more sense than the alternative view (which I'll call
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Instantiationism&quot;):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should respond to Kory's ME == PE idea. In PE we find such things as
<br />
&quot;thermodynamic entropy&quot; and &quot;temporality&quot;. If we are to take Kory's idea
<br />
(that Mathspace doesn't require resources) seriously, ME does not. This
<br />
seems a direct contradiction!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps Kory has a paper on-line that lays out his thesis of
<br />
&quot;Instantiationism&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Again, the mere postulation of existence is insufficient: it does
</em><br />
not
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;thing to inform us of how it is that it is even possible for us, as mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;finite humans, to have experiences that &quot;change&quot;. We have to address why
</em><br />
it
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is that Time, even if it is ultimately an &quot;illusion&quot;, and the distingtion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;between past and future is so intimately intetwined in our world of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Good question. But you know I do address this question in my thesis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (see url below). I cannot give you too much technical details, but here is
</em><br />
a
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the main line. As you know, I showed that if we postulate the comp hyp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then time, space, energy and, in fact, all physicalities---including the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicable (like 3-person results of experiments) as the uncommunicable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one (like qualie or results of 1-person experiment) appears as modalities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variant of the Godelian self-referential provability predicates. As you
</em><br />
know
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Godel did succeed in defining &quot;formal provability&quot; in the language of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent machine and many years later Solovay succeeds in formalising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all theorems of provability logic in a couple of modal logics G and G*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; G formalizes the provable (by the machine) statements about its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provability ability; and G* extends G with all true statements about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine's ability (including those the machine cannot prove).
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my thinking all 1st person experiences are &quot;best possible
<br />
simulations&quot;. The problem I find is that we can not use the modern
<br />
equivalent to Leibniz' &quot;preordained harmony&quot;, whether in the form of a
<br />
&quot;universal prior&quot; or &quot;modelization&quot; of some modal logic, since the &quot;list&quot; of
<br />
all possible interactions is not enumerable. This is the aspect that I have
<br />
tried to address by referencing Wolfram on the computational intractibility
<br />
of some key aspects of &quot;physicality&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the seperate issue of how does one aspect of a logic
<br />
&quot;address&quot; some other? We have the example of a Turing Machine that considers
<br />
a &quot;tape&quot; and a &quot;head&quot;: there are separate in that one can &quot;move&quot; relative to
<br />
the other all the while the transitions of the state of the head and the
<br />
&quot;spot&quot; on the tape change. I do not see how some form of Monism can explain
<br />
this.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, there is the problem of &quot;simulating&quot; QM using formal
<br />
logics. I have reference the Calude et al paper on this and you have said
<br />
that it is good, but you seem to not have actually read it and let its
<br />
implications &quot;set in&quot;. ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, independently, temporal logicians have defined some modal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems capable of formalizing temporal statements. Also, Brouwer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; developed a logic of the conscious subject, which has given rise to a
</em><br />
whole
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructive philosophy of mathematics, which has been formalize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by a logic known as &quot;intuitionist logic&quot;, and later, like the temporal
</em><br />
logic,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the intuitionist logic has been captured formally by an modal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extension of a classical modal logic. Actually it is Godel who has seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the first that Intuitionist logic can be formalised by the modal logic S4,
</em><br />
and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Grzegorczyk makes it more precise with the extended system S4Grz.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And it happens that S4Grz is by itself a very nice logic of subjective,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irreversible (anti-symmetric) time, and this gives a nice account too of
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship Brouwer described between time and consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, if you remember, I use the thaetetus trick of defining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (machine) &quot;knowledge of p&quot; by &quot;provability of p and p&quot;. Independently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Boolos, Goldblatt, but also Kusnetsov and Muravitski in Russia, showed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the formalization of that form of knowledge (i.e. &quot;provability of p
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and p&quot;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gives exactly the system of S4Grz. That's the way subjective time arises
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the discourse of the self-referentially correct machine.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does S4Grz solve the &quot;true concusseny&quot; problem? If so, how? Again, we
<br />
have to be able to represent more than one self-referential system
<br />
simultaneously if we are going to have a model that allows for the existence
<br />
of more than one observer. Otherwise we have a solipsism of a single mind
<br />
that must believe that all other appearences of minds are &quot;zombies&quot;. It is
<br />
an all or nothing situation!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physical discourses come from the modal variant of provability given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by &quot;provable p and consistent p&quot; (where consistent p = not provable p):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is justified by the thought experiment and this gives the
</em><br />
arithmetical
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum logics which capture the &quot;probability one&quot; for the probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure on the computational histories as seen by the average consistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where you lose me! Again, please point me to the &quot;thought
<br />
experiment&quot;. It is this part of your model that most intrigues me! ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physical time is then captured by &quot;provable p and consistant p and p&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously people could think that for a consistent machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the three modal variants, i.e:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      provable p
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      provable p and p
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      provable p and consistent p and p
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are equivalent. Well, they are half right, in the sense that for G*, they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are indeed equivalent (they all prove the same p),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but G, that is the self-referential machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot prove those equivalences, and that's explain why,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the point of view of the machine,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they give rise to so different logics. To translate the comp hyp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into the language of the machine,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  it is necessary to restrict p to the \Sigma_1 arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sentences (that is those who are accessible by the Universal Dovetailer,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that step
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is needed to make the physicalness described by a quantum logic).
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still do not see how &quot;provable p&quot; tells us anything about how some
<br />
self-referential system seperates it's model of itself from itself! This, is
<br />
similar to the situation that I mentioned above about turing machine. I am
<br />
reminded of Searl's (?) discussion of a book containing a complete map of
<br />
Einstein's brain...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you truly looked at the requirements involved in representing a
<br />
sufficient quantum logic? It does not seem that you have!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The constraints are provably (with the comp hyp) enough to defined all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the probabilities on the computational histories, and that is why, if ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a quantum computer would not appear in those logics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then (assuming QM is true!) comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would definitely be refuted; and that is all my point.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something about this stinks! Are you saying that &quot;If a quantum computer
<br />
does not appear in these logics&quot; = &quot;comp is falsified&quot;? Is this not
<br />
equivalent to saying that &quot;If a white crow is not found&quot; = &quot;all crows are
<br />
black&quot;? THis is NOT falsification! BTW, I take QM to be true to the extent
<br />
that it has yet (!) not been falsified, so I guess that I am hoisted upon my
<br />
own petard!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; OK. Just to cut the hair a little bit: with Church thesis
</em><br />
&quot;computational
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; realism&quot; is equivalent to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; a restricted form of arithmetical realism. Comp. realism is equivalent
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Arith. realism restricted to the Sigma_1 sentences,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;  i.e. those sentence which are provably equivalent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; (in Peano arithmetic, say) to sentences of the form &quot;it exists x such
</em><br />
that
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; p(x)&quot; with p(x) a decidable (recursive) predicate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; This is equivalent to say that either a machine (on any argument) will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; stop or will not stop, and this independently of any actual running.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO! You can not toss away the fact that some kind of implementation MUST
<br />
occur of the Sigma_1 sentences, or at least, be allowed. We are back to
<br />
where we started! One must have some &quot;running&quot; in order for the notion of
<br />
&quot;stop&quot; and &quot;not stop&quot; to be meaningful! This is my problem with the use of
<br />
Platonic realms.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must have some have to extract temporal modality from timeless
<br />
existence. Prof. Kitada does this in his theory, but it seems that he
<br />
requires that the &quot;machinery&quot; of  QM must have ontological reality and not
<br />
just be a Model, ala Lowenheim-Skolem. The &quot;Model&quot; is the world of
<br />
experience...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;  Indeed, sometimes I say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; (Sigma_1) arithmetical realism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; is equivalent to the belief in the excluded middle principe (that is
</em><br />
&quot;A or
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; not A) applied to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; (Sigma_1) arithmetical sentences. (Sigma_1 sentences plays a prominant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;role
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; in the derivation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of the logic of the physical propositions from the logic of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; self-referential propositions). Actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the Universal Dovetailing is arithmetically equivalent with an
</em><br />
enumeration
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of all true Sigma_1 sentences. The key feature of those sentences is
</em><br />
that
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; their truth entails their provability (unlike
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; arbitrary sentences which can be true and not provable (by Peano
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; arithmetic, for exemple).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Bruno, I do not understand why you use so weak a support for your
</em><br />
very
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;clever theory! If we are to take the collection of a &quot;true Sigma_1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;sentenses&quot; to have &quot;independent of implementation&quot; existence, why not all
</em><br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the endless hierarchy of Cantor's Cardinals? I have never understood this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Kroneckerian attitute.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is related to the Skolem theorems or to the so-called &quot;Skolem
</em><br />
Paradox&quot;,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cantorian cardinals are relative notions (in set theory). There is no
</em><br />
sense
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to talk about an absolute implementation of those cardinals. I do believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the Cantorian theory but high cardinal are measure on our high
</em><br />
ignorance;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see how we could extend a &quot;set realism&quot; for them, unlike what we

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ordinal of Church and Kleene, by using an extended version of Church
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thesis, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so-called hyper-arithmetical Church thesis; but that step would be a step

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; toward a weakening of comp and the \Sigma_1 sentences should be replaced

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by something else ...).

<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please take a look at the following paper:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.kitada.com/timeXIV.html">http://www.kitada.com/timeXIV.html</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It addresses the notion of a non-constructive ordinal. Your critique is
<br />
most welcome!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hoping having not been too technical. A good book is Rogers' one, see the
</em><br />
ref
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in my thesis or papers, and of course a must is the Boolos 1993 book.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even in my french thesis I have not give all technical details. I have
</em><br />
done
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in my &quot;brussel's thesis&quot; which I will soon put on my web page, but then it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is 800 pages of technical details ... in french (I did not choose it).
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only dream of the day that I can either read French or an English
<br />
(or Spanish!) translation is made of your paper. ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remember that I am not a defender of comp. My only goal is to show that
</em><br />
comp
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is enough precise so that it can be refuted; or put in another way, my
</em><br />
goal is
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to show comp is a scientific theory in the popper sense of the word; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; little like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; John Bell succeeded in showing that the Einstein Podolski Rosen paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads to verifiable propositions, and was not philosophy (as Bohr
</em><br />
implicitly
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argued, and as so many physicist did believe (without thinking on the
</em><br />
matter).
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But its refutation seem to be one that can not occur in finite time, so
<br />
I can only take your word or &quot;by an act of blind faith&quot; as the justification
<br />
of a belief in it. ;-)
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
<br />
<br />Stephen
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Best Regards, and have a nice week-end,
