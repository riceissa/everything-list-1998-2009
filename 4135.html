</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this does not allow the transfer of one bit from one computation to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another.
</em><br />
<br />I of course was not claiming such communication (or travel, whatever) 
<br />
would be easy. Just doing a thought experiment settting some very rough 
<br />
bounds on how impossible the communication or travel would be.
<br />
<br />One of the conclusions of &quot;How come they're not here?&quot; is that, in 
<br />
fact, such communication or travel is essentially impossible (else 
<br />
they'd _be_ here).
<br />
<br />MWI looks, then, like just another variant of &quot;modal realism.&quot; To wit, 
<br />
there IS a universe in which unicorns exist, and another in which 
<br />
Germany won the Second World War, but these universes are forever and 
<br />
completely out of touch with us.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW, Tim, I am discovering n-categories. Quite interesting. John Baez
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has written good papers on that, like his categorification paper.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have you read those stuff. Could be useful for the search of coherence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; condition in &quot;many world/observer&quot; realities ...
</em><br />
<br />I've been reading Baez for a while. An excellent teacher. I hear he's 
<br />
working on a book on n-categories. And Baez and my namesake, J. Peter 
<br />
May--unrelated to me, are leading a consortium to research n-categories 
<br />
more deeply. I confess that I have only vague ideas what they 
<br />
are....sort of generalizations of natural transformations, I sense. 
<br />
(I'm still studying categories at a more basic level, having &quot;jumped 
<br />
ahead&quot; to other areas, as is my wont.)
<br />
<br />His &quot;From Categories to Feynman Diagrams&quot; (co-authored with James 
<br />
Dolan) and several of his related papers are good introductions.
<br />
<br />Chris Isham is also very good on drawing the connections between 
<br />
conventional quantum mechanics (i.e., stuff in the lab, not necessarily 
<br />
quantum gravity or quantum cosmology) and category/topos theory. (In 
<br />
particular, the collapse of the wave function and measurement looks 
<br />
like a subobject classifier, or, put another way, the usual transition 
<br />
from &quot;neither true nor false&quot; in a Heyting algebra to the &quot;one or the 
<br />
other&quot; we _always_ see once there is any chance to 
<br />
observe/measure/decide. That is, Heyting --&gt; Boolean is what the 
<br />
mystery of QM centers around.
<br />
<br />(I am intrigued to find that Jeffrey Bub, in his &quot;Interpreting the 
<br />
Quantum World,&quot; 1997, makes central use of possible worlds, lattices, 
<br />
and such. While he does not explicitly mention Heyting algebras, the 
<br />
connection is close, and is implicit in the math. Had I encountered 
<br />
this approach when I was studying QM, I might have pursued it as a 
<br />
career. Instead, I was bored out of my mind solving partial 
<br />
differential equations for wave functions inside boxes. Ugh.)
<br />
<br />I'm reading Graham Priest's &quot;An Introduction to Non-Classical Logic,&quot; 
<br />
2001, which covers various modal logics, conditional logics, 
<br />
intuitionist logic, many-valued logics, and more (&quot;first degree 
<br />
entailment,&quot; &quot;relevant logic,&quot; etc.).
<br />
<br />The tableaux approach is new to me. They look like the trees of 
<br />
Smullyan, and hence like semilattices. (I'm also reading Davey and 
<br />
Priestley's &quot;Introduction to Lattices and Order,&quot; along with parts of 
<br />
Birkhoff's classic, and the lattice/poset approach continues to appeal 
<br />
to me greatly. It's a vantage point which makes all of this 
<br />
heretofore-boring-to-me logic stuff look terribly interesting. I'm 
<br />
viewing most programs/trees/refinements/tableaux as branching worlds, 
<br />
as possible worlds (a la Kripke), to be further branched or discarded.
<br />
<br />Hence my focus on MWI and &quot;Everything&quot; remains more on the mathematics. 
<br />
(I just ordered my own copy of Goldblatt's &quot;Mathematics of Modality.&quot;)
<br />
<br />&quot;Possible worlds,&quot; something I only encountered in any form (besides 
<br />
Borges, Everett, parallel universes sorts of references) in the past 
<br />
several years, is my real touchstone.
<br />
<br />And, more mundanely, I think it applies to cryptography and money. I 
<br />
had a meeting/party at my house a few weeks ago with about 50 people in 
<br />
attendance (gulp!). We had a series of very short presentations. I gave 
<br />
a very rushed 10-minute introduction to intuitionistic logic, mainly 
<br />
focused on my &quot;time as a poset, a lattice&quot; example, citing the natural 
<br />
way in which &quot;not-not A&quot; is not necessarily the same as A. If the past 
<br />
of an event is A, then not-A is its future. But the not-future is 
<br />
larger than the original past, as &quot;incomparable&quot; (in the 
<br />
poset/trichotomy sense) events influence the future. Or, put in 
<br />
relatitivity/cosmology terms, which many people are more familiar with, 
<br />
ironically, events outside the light cone of the present figure into 
<br />
the future. So the natural causal structure of spacetime is 
<br />
intuitionistic, a Brouwerian lattice.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I managed to spend a couple of minutes relating this to the 
<br />
world of finite knowledge about such things as &quot;money.&quot; This is related 
<br />
to belief, trust, reputation, and suchlike.
<br />
<br />Afterwards, a senior member of a leading crypto company came up to me 
<br />
and said he'd done work in mathematical logic in school. He said he's 
<br />
been waiting for ten years for crypto to turn into mathematical logic, 
<br />
that the focus on number theory has been a kind of diversion.
<br />
<br />Enough for this digression. But MWI, belief, possible worlds, alternate 
<br />
forms of logic, knowledge, category theory, toposes, and more are all 
<br />
deeply &quot;intertwingled,&quot; as Ted Nelson would say. It's all math. Good 
<br />
stuff.
