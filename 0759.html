How can 'the future' shape the present when all possible futures are 'the
<br />
future'? (You now have your response).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have posted maybe five times. I mainly explain my own personal theories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unlike Chris, I haven't read any of the archived posts. None of my posts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have fit in with the regular discussions. Remember my idea that all worlds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; branch or converge toward one future. Obviously crackpot. How 'bout when I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dropped time as a dimension. No one has posted a response to anything I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have written. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have been ignored. I posted ideas about the distant future being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determined or inevitable, and how that shapes the present, which got no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direct response. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quantumly speaking, we know the past is not determined until we observe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it, as is true of the future. There isn't merely one past. So we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagine the wave function of all possible worlds in the past. The wave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function is very wide first considering the immediate past, yet as we look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ever deeper into the past, all the many possible worlds we can envision
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; merge toward a single beginning, common to all paths, the Big Bang. All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible worlds begin from or near a common single state. Notice how that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one inevitable distant past shapes what we observe about the past. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shapes our present. It makes the background radiation evenly distributed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It shows us one model of the past, not many depending upon which direction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we look, or on different days. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The common origin of all quantum worlds makes our past consistent and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contributes to the flow of time being consistent. It radically narrows the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wave function, as related to what is possible to have happened. Now look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the future. What is possible in the immediate future is also wide.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consider that the set of all possible futures narrows toward a single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outcome, a single state, just like the past. Notice how that single future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would shape our world, our present, just as the single state in our past
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shapes our world. Notice finally that if the past only shaped the present,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if the future didn't shape the present, then what is possible; the wave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function, would expand radically into chaotic possibilities. Then, there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be no rational laws of nature. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So anyway, I don't see why Chris gets to be denoted as the worst member of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this group. This is not fair. I mean, he shared something personal but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topic clearly related to quantum immortality, and come on, it was great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reading. Damn, I thought it was an excerpt from a book or something. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reminded me of Douglas Adams. Seriously Chris, I thought it was too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; polished to be a post. You should consider publishing that story, and I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not just saying that to redeem my position. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the issue of quantum suicide, there are factors to what is possible in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the branching paths of time that are not being discussed in this group and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that are simply not known at this time. A line from LeGuin, &quot;The truth is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that as a man's real power grows and his knowledge widens, ever the way he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can follow grows narrower; until at last he chooses nothing, but does only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and wholly what he must do...&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, the future is shaping the past, so it doesn't matter much what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course one maneuvers. We cannot escape the future. Eventually we collide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the same problems, in this life or whatever follows, so we face and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually solve them. Its part of the process. We each are an evolving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe. That's not meant to be positive. Its real. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I didn't think your story was scary at all. It was real and fascinating,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort of in the sense that fact is more fascinating than fiction. You see I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think already in different terms. If this group is centered upon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussing an everything universe, and is going to do anything other than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regurgitate other peoples science and idea, it needs to confront more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vividly the issues surrounding timelessness and the meaning of an infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most people respond with fear and avoidance to the suicide option, mainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from our common struggle to cope with the meaninglessness that creeps into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our lives. How does our response change if we factually know that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer exists beyond death? If this group was really accomplishing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something, it would be a place to exercise the mind in different ways of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seeing such things as real death, or suicide, from the perspectives that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result of MWs, or an anthropic universe, an observer created reality, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is something I like to think about. There is no place where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe is not. If the observer is indeed a world in itself, then we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot stop existing. Its not a choice we have. Non-existence cannot be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What we are, what we become, is ever changing, yet each observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience ends as another begins. That is true of every moment. We die in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the stillness of each moment and are constantly reborn into another. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now that is deep shit without direct mention of any science. And I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spent hours writing my other posts, carefully explaining crackpot theories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that contradict much of what you guys discuss. I don't see why Chris
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should get all the violent opposition. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If that doesn't work, let me share other thoughts. I think there should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a different title for those such as Einstein, Newton, Feynman and Hawking,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the explorers and creators of science, and the masses that follow claiming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also to be scientists, who in fact don't relate at all. That's really not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so much of an insult to anyone as one might think. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mainly, I think most in this group need to keep in mind a healthy dose of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasonable doubt that we have all the major factors needed to understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the shape of many worlds or of an ensemble or everything theory. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shouldn't be a discussion place of sharply narrow issues yet. Ideally this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; group needs a monitor that would keep discussions civilized, open, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vibrant, to counteract individuals who desire to squelch all but their own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adherence and discipline.
