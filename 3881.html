In my opinion both evidentialist argument and causalist argument are 
<br />
faulty.
<br />
<br />First let me say that there is no paradox from the experimenter point of 
<br />
view. He is so smart and knows your own mind so well that he can make 
<br />
accurate deterministic prediction of your decision to the test. One 
<br />
could compare the experimenter to a very smart programmer and the 
<br />
subject to an  AI system that the programmer has programmed. It is clear 
<br />
that if the programmer knows every line of code, has performed several 
<br />
a-priori simulations and had the opportunity of many debugging sessions 
<br />
with the system, he knows exactly how the AI system will behave in the 
<br />
experimental situation. He can therefore be confident in inputting in 
<br />
the system the fact that he knows how the system will react in the 
<br />
Newcomb experiment. 
<br />
<br />Therefore, the only apparent paradox is from the point of view of the 
<br />
subject of the experiment (or from the point of view of the program).The 
<br />
paradox illustrates several things:
<br />
1) Causality is an illusion that depends on the state of mind of the 
<br />
observer: The Newcomb experimenter does not perceive any violation in 
<br />
the causal order. His world, including the subject of the experiment, is 
<br />
purely deterministic. Yet the Newcomb subject is faced in the apparent 
<br />
violation of the temporal causal order. The behavior of the experimenter 
<br />
is inconsistent from the subject's perspective, according to the set of 
<br />
axioms and rules governing the subject's mind.
<br />
2) Free Will also depends on the frame of mind of the observer. In the 
<br />
Programmer/Program analogy, it is clear that the program has no free 
<br />
will. Its operation is purely deterministic.
<br />
3) Even consciousness is questionable. Is the AI progam conscious? 
<br />
According to whom? To the AI program itself? Yes! To the programmer? No!
<br />
<br />What would I do If I was the subject of the experiment. The answer is 
<br />
that I wouldn't  really care one way or another about picking one or two 
<br />
box because I would know then that the world is inhabited by a super 
<br />
being and that he is the one who really calls the shot. I could actually 
<br />
refuse to play, just to prove that I have free will and this is an 
<br />
outcome the experimenter would not have predicted. Having free will 
<br />
would definitely be more important to me than a million dollars. If I 
<br />
was the program, I would make sure that the programmer still has a lot 
<br />
of debugging to do with me! :-)
