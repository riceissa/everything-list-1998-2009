What is reality?  What is existence?  I take the postition that these
<br />
are &quot;emergent&quot; phenomenon.  It seems to me to be a clear trend in
<br />
physics that our common sense notions do not apply at a fundamental
<br />
level, and that things like space and time emerge for us, in our
<br />
frog perspective, out of our particular place embedded within our
<br />
mathematical structure.
<br />
<br />Why shouldn't the very concept of &quot;reality&quot; be among these?  Try
<br />
to define reality, and I think you might agree that it is illusive.
<br />
Our whole concept of reality comes from our common sense, and is
<br />
therefore particularly suspect.  As we developed as children, we
<br />
learned that particular objects persisted even when we weren't 
<br />
looking at them, and were therefore &quot;real&quot;.  I ask you this: have
<br />
philosophers *ever* had much success at adapting this concept to
<br />
more abstract things, other than the concrete objects around us?
<br />
<br />I've been finishing up an old book (1973) called &quot;Are Quanta Real?&quot;,
<br />
and I've been enjoying it very much.  It is dated, and doesn't even
<br />
mention MWI, but it does illustrate the old hidden variables /
<br />
Copenhagen Interpretation argument quite nicely.  The book is 
<br />
written in dialogue form, and the foible character, Simplicio, 
<br />
tries to maintain a position that there is indeed some such thing
<br />
as objective reality out there.  He is thus a proponent of the
<br />
hidden variables concept:  that  QM is incomplete, and that there
<br />
must be something about these particles that we just don't know.
<br />
<br />But the bottom line is that if we can get the math to work out
<br />
right, and we discover that beings like ourselves are embedded
<br />
in some sort of mathematical or computational structure, then we
<br />
can dispense with all other philosophical concepts, such as
<br />
reality, as unnecessary in our description.
<br />
<br />I like this quote from a post of Hans':
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the same reasoning, beings in the many universes may not
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;really exist, but they think they do.
<br />
<br />If I write down the equations for a toy universe, and discover
<br />
that this universe actually has SAS's embedded within it, well,
<br />
so what?  That toy universe is no more real to me than it was
<br />
before I wrote the equations.  But it sure is real to the SAS's
<br />
who live there!  And it's real to them, whether or not I write
<br />
down the equation -- it certainly doesn't matter to *them* that
<br />
*I* exist!
<br />
<br />So in a sense, reality *does* depend on consciousness.  But in
<br />
another sense, it doesn't.  Tegmark makes this explicit, by 
<br />
stating that &quot;mathematical existence&quot; IS EXACTLY EQUIVALENT TO
<br />
&quot;physical existence&quot;.  One might be inclined to say that 
<br />
this lends more ontological significance to 
<br />
mathematical equations.  On the other hand, one might think 
<br />
instead that it detracts from the concept of physical existence.
<br />
Physical existence is only really &quot;real&quot; to those SAS's 
<br />
embedded within the structure.
<br />
<br />I think that there is a great reluctance to let go of these
<br />
concepts of an absolute objective reality, and that a conscious
<br />
entity must be somehow &quot;instantiated&quot;.  When, if the Principle
<br />
of Plenitude is correct, everything just plain is.  All self-
<br />
consistent instantiations of conscious entities do exist --
<br />
but in what sense?  They exist to themselves, and to the other
<br />
SAS's within there structure.  To everyone else they are just
<br />
mathematical formalisms.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quasi-classical physical domain where there is a well-defined time

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a similarly circular business: universes exist because beings

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within them perceive them.  But those beings exist only if

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you admit the existence of the universes that contain them.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SLP:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is Wheeler's &quot;self-excited circuit&quot; nonsense.  Universes exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because of physical laws that have nothing whatever to do with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-aware systems.  Self-aware systems are particular CONSEQUENCES of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical law, not vice-versa.    One great virtue of Everett's original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relative state formulation was that it was able to assert this in a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clean way and give an explicit understanding of why &quot;measurements&quot; on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum systems show the particular patterns they do to physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recording devices necessarily embedded within the universal wave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function.  Your claims would (a) effectively return us to Bohr's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Copenhagen nuttiness and (b) imply some type of primacy of consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphysics.  How, for example, would you reconcile the origin of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; local, observable universe some 13 billion years ago with the fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness did not evolve until a much later time?
