<br />So to elaborate, the reason applying the SSA seemed to lead to a bad 
<br />
result is that I forgot to apply game theory, which is required here 
<br />
because we have more than one person making decisions that interact with 
<br />
each other (even though they're copies of one original person and have the 
<br />
same preferences).
<br />
<br />Here's a simplified thought experiment that illustrates the issue. Two 
<br />
copies of the subject S, A and B, are asked to choose option 1 or option 
<br />
2. If A chooses 1, S wins a TV (TV), otherise S wins a worse TV (TV2). If 
<br />
B chooses 1, S wins a stereo, otherwise S wins TV. S prefers TV to TV2 to 
<br />
stereo, but would rather have a TV and a stereo than two TVs. The copies 
<br />
have to choose without knowing whether they are A or B.
<br />
<br />According to my incorrect analysis, SSA would imply that you choose option 
<br />
2, because that gives you .5*U(TV2) + .5*U(TV) &gt; .5*U(TV) + .5*U(stereo) 
<br />
since U(TV2) &gt; U(stereo). I argued that you should consider yourself A and 
<br />
B simultaneously so you could rationally choose option 2, because 
<br />
U({TV,stereo}) &gt; U({TV2, TV}). However taking both SSA and game theory 
<br />
into account implies that option 2 is rational. Furthermore, my earlier 
<br />
suggestion leads to unintuitive results in general, when the two players 
<br />
do not share the same utility function.
<br />
<br />The game theoretic analysis goes like this. There are two possible 
<br />
outcomes with pure strategies (I'll ignore mixed strategies for now). 
<br />
Either A and B both choose 1, or they both choose 2. The first one is a 
<br />
Nash equilibrium, the second may or may not be. To understand what this 
<br />
means, suppose you are one of the players in this game (either A or B but 
<br />
you don't know which) and you expect the other player to choose option 1. 
<br />
Then your expected utility if you choose option 1 is .5*U({TV,stereo}) + 
<br />
.5*U({TV,stereo}). If you choose option 2, the expected utility is 
<br />
.5*U({TV2,stereo}) + .5*({TV,TV}) which is strictly less. So you have no 
<br />
reason not to choose option 1 if you expect the other player to choose 
<br />
option 1. Whether or not the second possible outcome is also a Nash 
<br />
equilibrium depends on whether U({TV2,TV}) &gt; .5*U({TV2,stereo}) + 
<br />
.5*({TV,TV}). But even if it is, the players can just coordinate ahead of 
<br />
time (or implicitly) to choose option 1 and obtain the better equilibrium.
<br />
<br />Now I want to show that while my earlier suggestion to consider yourself
<br />
to be both A and B works in this case, it doesn't work in general when A
<br />
and B have different utility functions. Consider the following game, which
<br />
we can call Amnesiac Prisoner's Dillemma. Players A and B can choose
<br />
Cooperate or Defect. If they both Defect they both get sentenced to 5
<br />
years in prison. If they both Cooperate they both get 1 year. If one
<br />
Cooperates and the other Defects they get 3 months and 10 years
<br />
respectively. The twist is that you have no memory of who you are and
<br />
don't know whether you're A or B. If you consider yourself to be both A
<br />
and B, then you would choose Cooperate, which contradicts our intuition. A
<br />
game theoretic analysis with the SSA would go like this. Suppose you
<br />
expect the other player to Cooperate. Then EU(Cooperate) = .5*EU(Cooperate
<br />
| I'm A) + .5*EU(Cooperate | I'm B) = .5*U(I'm A and A gets 1 year and B
<br />
gets 1 year) + .5*U(I'm B and A gets 1 year and B gets 1 year) &lt;
<br />
EU(Defect) = .5*EU(Defect | I'm A) + .5*EU(Defect | I'm B) = .5*U(I'm A
<br />
and A gets three months and B gets 10 years) + .5*EU(I'm B and A gets 10
<br />
years and B gets three months). So Cooperate is not a Nash equilibrium.
