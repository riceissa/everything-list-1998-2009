<br />My current position is that one can care about any property of the entire
<br />
structure of computation. Beyond that there are no reasonable or
<br />
unreasonable goals.  One can have goals that do not distinguish between
<br />
conscious or unconscious computations, or goals that treat conscious
<br />
thoughts in emulated worlds differently from conscious thoughts in &quot;real&quot;
<br />
worlds (i.e., in the same level of emulation as the goal-holders). None of
<br />
these can be said to be unreasonable, in the sense that they are not
<br />
ill-defined or obviously self-defeating or contradictory.
<br />
<br />In the end, evolution decides what kinds of goals are more popular within
<br />
the structure of computation, but I don't think they will only involve
<br />
functions on the measure distribution of conscious thoughts. For example,
<br />
caring about thoughts that arise in emulations as if they are real (in the
<br />
sense defined above) is not likely to be adaptive, but the distinction
<br />
between emulated thoughts and real thoughts can't be captured in a
<br />
function on the measure distribution of conscious thoughts.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     So you also bring in measure that way.  By the way, this is a bad idea: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if the simulations are too perfect, they will give rise to conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thoughts of their own!  So, you should be careful with it.  The very act of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; using the oracle could create a peculiar multiverse, when you just want to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know if you should buy one can of veggies or two.
</em><br />
<br />The oracle was not meant to be a realistic example, just to illustrate my
<br />
proposed decision procedure. However to answer your objection, the oracle
<br />
could be programmed to ignore conscious thoughts that arise out of its
<br />
internal computations (i.e., not account for them in its value function)
<br />
and this would be a value judgement that can't be challenged on purely
<br />
objective grounds.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     You need to know which type of thought has greater measure, &quot;I saw 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heads, and ...&quot; or &quot;I saw tails, and ...&quot;.  I call the measure of one, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; divided by the total measure, the *effective* probability, since it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (roughly) plays the role of the probability for decision theory.  But you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a point in a way ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Decision theory is not exactly the same as anthropic reasoning.  In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision theory, you want to do something to maximize some utility function. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   By contrast, anthropic reasoning is used when you want to find out some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information.
</em><br />
<br />Anthropic reasoning can't exist apart from a decision theory, otherwise
<br />
there is no constraint on what reasoning process you can use. You might as
<br />
well believe anything if it has no effect on your actions.
