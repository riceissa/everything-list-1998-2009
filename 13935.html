<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Bruno, i failed to acknowledge your kind reply - and others 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; joining in - for the past month, not because I have been tied up with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'other' WEB lists, but because I realized that i have nothing to say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;in kind&quot; of the language you use.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No problem. But note that you can ask about language question in case 
<br />
of trouble.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not only are the terms unfamiliar (I have to think hard to put them 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into 'meaning' (proper or not), but the underlying and firmly supposed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to 'known' math-phys theories are vague at best (some, others 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unknown). So are the words used lately.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Don't hesitate, in case you have the time to tell us which one. You 
<br />
could be surprise how simple things are, and why sometimes things seems 
<br />
complex but are not (alas, sometimes the contrary is true too; they are 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;manay things which seems obvious, but are not, like Church's thesis to 
<br />
name just one important example).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I did not want to bore you with my uneducated remarks.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The &quot;average lobian machine&quot; is even less educate than you. And the 
<br />
understanding of what I'm trying to do is 50% based on the fact that 
<br />
lobian machine can already understand it, even discover it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This discussion penetrated the technical (?) level of the few adepts 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and alas I am not part of it.
</em><br />
<br />You are, imo (judging from you posts). But it asks for work, and I can 
<br />
understand it is hard to find the time and sometimes even just the 
<br />
necessary serene atmosphere for thinking ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the meantime Marc G published his tabels restricting all that can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be known (his ontology?) into the domains he presently knows. That 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also threw me out from a desire to participate:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I start from our ignorance and consider whatever we think we know as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our increasing epistemy.
</em><br />
<br /><br />A good path. Note that eventually we have to come back to ignorance. 
<br />
Bohr said something similar to &quot;the more you dig on the quantum the 
<br />
less you understand&quot;.  With comp, this is also correct, but in this 
<br />
case you can at least understand why it is necessarily so. The more you 
<br />
dig on comp, the less you understand, but at least you can understand 
<br />
why. Eventually lobian ignorance appears as something powerful and 
<br />
creative. Also, that digging is a major step to &quot;more freedom&quot;, but 
<br />
also, I think, to more humanity (because of its &quot;less certainty&quot; 
<br />
consequences; many inhuman aspects of humanity come from people having 
<br />
certainties about humans.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I keep lurking and when my mouse starts squeaking in common sense, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will put in a post.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With appreciation for your (plural) advanced knowledge
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks. Take it easy. What I propose to explain to David is the minimal 
<br />
background in 19th century mathematics which has led to Church's 
<br />
thesis, which is really somehow the &quot;Schroedinger equation&quot; of comp. 
<br />
Church thesis makes the universal machine really &quot;universal&quot;, and it 
<br />
makes the universal dovetailer really universally dovetailing.
<br />
<br />If you stick literally to the idea of complaining each time you miss a 
<br />
technical world, then you will eventually understand what I am trying 
<br />
to prove. There is not so much difficulties (beside newness or 
<br />
novelty). I propose a thought experiment (UDA) which shows why IF we 
<br />
are (digital) machine then the laws of physics have to be justified 
<br />
from the many possible relations existing between numbers/machines, and 
<br />
then I show how to put this into practice by interviewing some 
<br />
Universal Machine (the one I call lobian, which are just a slight 
<br />
extension of what a universal machine is).
<br />
<br />The real bomb is just the discovery/apparition of those universal 
<br />
machines last century. They are the &quot;heroes&quot; of our time, not because 
<br />
they are powerful, but because they indicate a path which can help a 
<br />
lot to realize our own abyssal ignorance. And adding knowledge about 
<br />
those beasts can only makes our (creative) ignorance even bigger.
<br />
<br />John, you don't have to justify your silence, but if that silence is 
<br />
based on vocabulary questions, please just dare to ask. As a teacher I 
<br />
have eventually understood that everybody can understand math, but not 
<br />
everybody can be motivated. Motivations are personal. Now, sometimes 
<br />
people are motivated, but they can be discouraged for bad reasons, like 
<br />
the feeling something is not for them, when they have actually just 
<br />
miss a definition. In *that* case I can help (and I am interested 
<br />
personally to help). The questions addressed in this list *are* 
<br />
complex; the math is needed to simplify things, not making them more 
<br />
complex ...
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
