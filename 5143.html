</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but let me just stick with the so-called mind-body issue that Hal also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alluded to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There have been two main reductionist strategies to deal with mental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states, and they both -- to say the least -- have stalled.  The two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strategies are:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.  Eliminative materialism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2.  Identity theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Eliminative materialism argued that human behavior could be explained 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientifically without reference to the mental states of folk 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychology.  S-R behaviorism -- as in Skinner -- was the great effort 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here, and it is now largely judged a failure.  We seem to need mental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states to explain human -- and even lower animal -- behavior.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So then there is the identity theory, the attempt to show that each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental state is identical to some (or finitely many) physical states. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, this has not panned out either.  At worst, we may be in for some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many-to-many correspondence between mental states and physical states, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which spells doom for identity theory and reductionism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I probably have not said enough to convince anyone here. This is a big 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issue, and much more could be said.  I am just trying to summarize the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current status of the mind-body debate.  At the very least, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reductionist argument has been stalemated -- and there are good 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasons, having to do with the role of language, for thinking it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; false.
</em><br />
<br />The CURRENT state of the art? Hold on a second. I haven't seen any 
<br />
reference in what you describe to a computational
<br />
hypothesis about the mind-body problem. i.e. that a mind is 
<br />
software+firmware running on a brain+body which is, amongst other
<br />
things, computing hardware.  The explanatory power of this hypothesis is 
<br />
such that it is hard to refute if you look into it
<br />
closely enough.  Skinner behaviorism is kind of like saying the computer 
<br />
computes about as well as a bulldozer does.
<br />
Mental state/physical state identity is some out-of-touch philosopher's 
<br />
way of saying &quot;I don't understand how (high-level)
<br />
information states in software and computer data can take on notions of 
<br />
informational locality and difference that are not 1-to-1
<br />
isomorphic in any simple sense with, say, the physical layout and 
<br />
voltage states (1/0 states) of my RAM chips.&quot; In otherwords,
<br />
the philosopher, who never took a programming course, is saying &quot;I don't 
<br />
understand how object definitions, class definitions,
<br />
procedure and function definitions etc in high-level programming 
<br />
languages could ever be expressed nor how software
<br />
could operate on those defined objects with those defined functions 
<br />
etc..&quot; Nor does the philosopher
<br />
understand how the programmer might tie those informational objects and 
<br />
their states, representing in a high-level computer
<br />
software language, and inside the computer in some kind of (who cares 
<br />
what kind of) memory and processor architecture)
<br />
back to the real world via such things as user interfaces, I/O devices, 
<br />
servos and sensors etc. Advice
<br />
to philosopher: TAKE THE PROGRAMMING COURSE. IN FACT, TAKE A GOOD 
<br />
COMPSCI DEGREE, THEN
<br />
GET BACK TO US.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.  How do you even individuate thoughts so as to count them or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlate them with physical states?  Is the belief that Mark Twain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrote Huckleberry Finn the same as or different from the belief that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Samuel Clemens wrote Huckleberry Finn?  Would that be one physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state you would seek to correlate with it or two?  There are lots of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well-discussed conceptual problems here.
</em><br />
<br />Thoughts are (sets of) information-states. The nature of their physical 
<br />
state realization (while there must be one) is only incidental
<br />
to their properties as information states. You count them as you would 
<br />
count information-states (by enumerating the different ones,
<br />
and stating things like how much mutual information is conveyed by one 
<br />
information-state (or set of them) about another, and how much
<br />
information-theoretic entropy is there in one information-state (or set 
<br />
of information-states) versus another etc.
<br />
<br />One can also talk about properties of them such as whether the 
<br />
information-state (or part of it, or sets of them) can be said to
<br />
be isomorphic to, corresponding to, abstractly representative of etc. 
<br />
some physical state or states.
<br />
<br />Most precisely, &quot;having a thought occurring to me&quot; is equivalent to 
<br />
focussing the program-counters of my attention-centre
<br />
brain hardware on certain sequences of information-states that are 
<br />
represented in my brain exactly analogously to how information
<br />
states are represented in RAM memory or disk in a computer system. And 
<br />
the thing that focuses the program-counters
<br />
of  my attention-centre brain-hardware on particular sequences of 
<br />
information-states is my &quot;pay-attention&quot; software/firmware
<br />
subroutines and my &quot;explore associated information&quot; software/firmware 
<br />
subroutines running in those attention-centre hardware regions
<br />
of my brain, and my &quot;form hypotheses&quot; software/firmware and my 
<br />
&quot;form-and-test action-plans&quot; software/firmware
<br />
and my &quot;commit important info to long-term memory with emotional 
<br />
emphasis tags&quot; software/firmware. etc etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. The mind-brain relation has sometimes been compared to the relation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between software and hardware in computers.  A certain software 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function might be endlessly realizable by different physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (hardware) configurations in different computers. Similarly, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suppose, the same hardware configuration might realize different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; software functions in different computers.  The analogy might break 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down, but this is the idea.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Yes. That's the hypothesis I just elaborated above as being a much more 
<br />
credible hypothesis these days than simple
<br />
naive-early-twentieth century lab psychology or wanking, sloppy, 
<br />
blue-sky, pre-computational-theory philosophizing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3.  The denial of reductionism does not necessarily entail belief in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is called &quot;a ghost in the machine,&quot; i.e., a soul or other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mystical something.  The denial of reductionism may instead imply that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not only is there no ghost, there also is no machine (i.e., we don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behave in machine-like ways). (This is a point made by Searle.)
</em><br />
<br />Searle is a bone-head. So is Dennett, come to think of it. I'd agree 
<br />
with them as far as to say
<br />
that there's little computation going on in THEIR heads. :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; John, I am not sure I understand everything you said. One thing I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would say along lines I think you suggest:  Determinism suggests a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; closed system.  If you don't have a closed system, you don't get 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deterministic predictiveness.
</em><br />
<br />First of all, determinism DOES NOT imply predictiveness. It is a 
<br />
fundamental theorem of theoretical computer science
<br />
that there are deterministic computations whose results CANNOT BE
<br />
PREDICTED FASTER (BY ANY LESS COMPLEX PROCESS)
<br />
THAN BY RUNNING EXACTLY THE PROGRAM WHICH IS COMPUTING THE RESULT
<br />
ANYWAY!!!
<br />
<br />So even if a person's mind, or the universe is deterministic (and being 
<br />
computed), it does NOT imply that its results
<br />
can be predicted any other way than by just &quot;running that program&quot; and 
<br />
seeing what it does, whenever it gets
<br />
around to doing it.
