<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No. But then your definition of theology is perhaps a little bit to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; much a contingent matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Perhaps the word &quot;theology&quot; has too many connotations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree largely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the correct distinction to make between what people seem to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean wrt the religion/science dispute is between 'recieved wisdom' and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'reasoned wisdom'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Religion and theology begin to encroach on liberty when the wisdom is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'recieved'. When things are true 'because that is how it is written'. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It leaves little space for question or change.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. Thanks for mentioning this important point. Here I deeply 
<br />
believed that just teaching logic could help people. Indeed, once you 
<br />
understand enough logic you understand that even in mathematics, few 
<br />
&quot;text&quot; can have an univocal interpretation and it helps you to be 
<br />
cautious in front of any &quot;literal&quot; interpretation of any text.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theology takes on a different character in the hands of a Descartes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because he reasons for his ideas. In doing so he opens himself up for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criticism and refutation. We can analyse his methodology and deductive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accuracy.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Absolutely. Note that before Descartes some other were reasoning nicely 
<br />
to. I am tring to have a better understanding of the thread Plato, 
<br />
Plotin, Proclus and other neo-platonists.
<br />
Note that Descartes miss logic, due to the exaggeration of many 
<br />
&quot;scholastic&quot; logicians, but he is really a good reasoner (which by the 
<br />
way shows we don't need logic to be a good reasoner).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Science can and does adopt sometimes a 'received' methodology. There 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a prevailing world view, a chauvanism towards certain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; methodologies. A bias towards rewarding certain research projects over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others. There seems to be little understanding that paradigmatic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shifts in science often come from left field. Theories are judged to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an extent on how well they fit in to the current model - however many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficulties that model is encountering.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As you point out, many ideas here have mystical consequences really. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They are reasoned for however. Whilst life after death is common to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many religious and philsophical models, in those presented here we can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see how the conclusions are arrived at and why.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Exactly. An expression like &quot;quantum immortality&quot; *is* theological. To 
<br />
negate this consists in making science not only theological again, but 
<br />
dogmatically so!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For me thats a critical difference.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I rarely share opinions with &quot;post-modernist&quot; and other 
<br />
&quot;deconstructivists&quot;, but I do share with some of them the idea that the 
<br />
frontier between fields are  biological-cultural, just locally useful, 
<br />
constructions. Actually I don't believe in science at all. I believe 
<br />
just in honest and curious people capable of trying to make clear and 
<br />
sharable their ideas and works.  Some gardiners and parapsychologist(*) 
<br />
can be more rigorous than mathematician and physicists. It is really a 
<br />
question of attitude.
<br />
<br />(*) I am thinking to that chef-d'oeuvre of science: &quot;In search of the 
<br />
Light&quot; by Suzanne Blackmore (much more rigorous than her more recent 
<br />
book on Memes, actually). The original discovery that lucid dreaming 
<br />
can be tested in laboratory (in a third person verifiable way) has been 
<br />
done by a parapsychologist (Hearne). The scientific community will 
<br />
gives the credit to a neuroscientist and mathematician though, Laberge, 
<br />
when he (re)published the results in &quot;scientific&quot; journal.
<br />
Some mathematician acts like Pavlov Dog. They dismiss any text has non 
<br />
serious if some words appears in it, like &quot;mind&quot;, &quot;quantum&quot; (sic).
<br />
Empirically I have discovered that engineers are most of the time more 
<br />
open to serious reasoning on fundamental questions. In science they 
<br />
still exist &quot;popes&quot;, and truth need to wait they leaves the planet to 
<br />
progress. I am not alluding to anything personal here, but what I say 
<br />
is clear from any books on the history of sciences.
