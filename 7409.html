<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So why did Einstein just assume that space/time was relative? Why did he

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assume that Newton had made a mistake at such a fundemental level? What

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reason did he have? In truth he didnt have any justifiable reason beyond:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the legal wrangling we all associate with it.
</em><br />
<br />Are you talking about special relativity or general relativity? Special 
<br />
relativity was based on the postulate that the laws of physics should work 
<br />
the same in all inertial frames, including Maxwell's laws of 
<br />
electromagnetism--that's all you need to derive special relativity. 
<br />
Supporters of the &quot;luminiferous ether&quot; hypothesis assumed Maxwell's laws 
<br />
would only work in a single preferred frame, the rest frame of the ether, 
<br />
but attempts to find deviations from Maxwell's laws that would show our 
<br />
velocity relative to the ether had failed, so there was some evidence to 
<br />
support Einstein's postulate (and aside from Maxwell's laws, I think all 
<br />
other Newtonian laws were already thought to work the same in all inertial 
<br />
frames).
<br />
<br />General relativity was also not based on a completely arbitrary guess--it 
<br />
was partly based on the desire to come up with a theory of gravity that was 
<br />
compatible with the principles of special relativity. Newtonian gravity 
<br />
wasn't, because it was thought to work instantaneously, but in special 
<br />
relativity different reference frames have different definitions of whether 
<br />
two distant events happened at the &quot;same time&quot; or not, so an instantaneous 
<br />
force would pick out a preferred frame.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, suppose Einstein was right. Suppose space/time actually is relative. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We dont /know/ that. We accept it on the basis of the accuracy of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;predictions of Albert's equations, but then where does that leave us with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;regards to Newton? Thats the really buzzing question in my opinion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It suggests that the accuracy of Newtonian equations do not depend on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;/truth/ of his assumptions. Newton got into a big row with Liebniz I think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about whether space had a frame of reference. Newton believed it did as we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;know. Well, if we accept Einstein, the we have to accept that Newton was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wrong, AND that this didnt matter. Its this latter result that is a little 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suprising. We are taught that the truth of a conclusion follows logically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from the truth of an arguments premises.
</em><br />
<br />But was this philosophical view of Newton's actually used in the derivation 
<br />
of his equations? Not much, as far as I know--I think he only held this view 
<br />
because he wanted to explain why acceleration is nonrelative, and thus why 
<br />
it was justified to distinguish between inertial reference frames and 
<br />
non-inertial reference frames, and just formulate the laws of physics in 
<br />
terms of how they look in inertial frames. It's still true in Einstein's 
<br />
theory that, in the absence of gravity (flat spacetime), non-inertial 
<br />
observers experience G-forces while inertial observers experience 
<br />
weightlessness.
