Hi Jacques,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your commentary on my (old) UDA 
<br />
argument. I must say you have a curious style for asking me 
<br />
to refresh the key definitions.
<br />
You should not excite so much my teacher professional 
<br />
deformation :)
<br />
<br />The tricky term is the term &quot;survive&quot;. The point is that we don't
<br />
need a definition of it in UDA although it helps using grandma 
<br />
definition for the first few steps. No doubt at later steps 
<br />
grandma is more and more astonished living the gap between 
<br />
what she feels to be herself (1-person) and her doubles (3-person).
<br />
<br />But ok, the 1-person and the 3-person is what you ask me 
<br />
definitions of. 
<br />
<br />If you read my posts you will see that I have given more than 
<br />
one definition of the 1-person. The simple one is enough for
<br />
both Everett's justification of the appearance of probability with
<br />
pure QM (SE + comp) and enough for my (ok, sorry) justification of the
<br />
appearance of probability in &quot;pure comp&quot; (through the grandma UDA. 
<br />
You can say I borrow it from Everett if you want.
<br />
<br />[BTW thanks for your &quot;grandma&quot; expression I love it. I recall for the
<br />
others that in the cognitive/mind science the grandmother or folk
<br />
psychology is what you need for following a Mickey comics (american
<br />
definition) or a &quot;Tintin and Milou&quot; (Belgium definition).
<br />
Grandma psychology accept explanation like &quot;John postponed the 
<br />
operation because he was afraid by anesthesia&quot;, etc. In the second 
<br />
part of my thesis I substitute grandma for an arithmetical 
<br />
grandma driven by the Godel Lob modal logic G and G*. It makes 
<br />
possible the translation of UDA in arithmetic through Kleene's 
<br />
arithmetical Metamathematics. I say a little more below].
<br />
<br /><br />1-person (simple definition working for UDA and Everett):
<br />
<br />I suppose an observer has a memory. A way to record result of 
<br />
experiment. Let us symbolize it by a diary
<br />
(but the observer's brain works aswell).
<br />
In the frame of duplication experiments (resp. the quantum 
<br />
superposition). The 1-person discourse is defined by the content
<br />
of the diary  *&lt;which is supposed to accompany the candidate of
<br />
the duplication&gt;*, i. e. the diary is duplicated too.
<br />
<br />And then the 3-person discourse is defined to be the content
<br />
of the diary of an external observer of the duplication experiment.
<br />
He is just an observer NOT entering the duplication
<br />
machine, but still trying to describe the experiment. 
<br />
(In QM the 3-person is given by the SE).
<br />
<br />Illustrations:
<br />
<br />Look at the following experiences. 
<br />
There are two rooms quite identical except that one has a zero
<br />
painted on the wall, and the other has a one painted on the wall.
<br />
<br />In the experience A I duplicate the candidate, that is I *cut* him
<br />
and *paste* him, with his diary, in both rooms. I ask the candidate
<br />
to write in his diary the number painted on the wall in front of him).
<br />
I repeat that experience 64 times, staying outside of the 
<br />
duplication machine (I play the role of the scientist here, accepting
<br />
only 3-descriptions).
<br />
Now here is my 3-description of the 1-discourses: About 18 thousand
<br />
billions of billions of diaries, in most of which, by simple arithmetic
<br />
it is just incompressible noise. A typical diary content is not unlike
<br />
<br />1100100100001111110110101010001000100001011010001100001000110100
<br />
<br />(except this one is compressible! Do you recognize or guess?).
<br />
<br />In experience B I have a Stern Gerlach Device and I send silver
<br />
atom. You are asleep (with you diary in your pocket).
<br />
We use like above two rooms with 1 and 0 painted on the wall.
<br />
If the atom goes up I put you in the first room, then wait you wake
<br />
up and you are here also supposed to write the number on the wall 
<br />
in your diary. I repeat the experience 64 times.
<br />
<br />The 3-description, i.e. SE gives a superposition of about 18 thousand
<br />
billions of billions of diaries.
<br />
But here SE entails the observer duplicate too, and SE applied to me
<br />
and the candidate gives, for a typical observer a typical diary content:
<br />
noise.
<br />
<br />In QM the observer cannot stay outside the duplication machine, but the
<br />
UDA shows that it is the same with comp, we cannot stay outside the
<br />
universal dovetailing, and that is why 3-person sharable discourse
<br />
comes first from 1-person *plural* sharing histories. (But I anticipate
<br />
perhaps too much ... on my preceding post!).
<br />
<br /><br />Although the definition of the 1-3 difference presented here is enough
<br />
for the UDA (the main and key point being that the diaries does not
<br />
contains comments on *delays* of reconstitution so that the search of the
<br />
measure must be done on the whole UD* (the whole platonistic work of the
<br />
UD), I cannot resist giving more elaborate definition useful for the
<br />
understanding of the ultimate description of the 1-person in arithmetical
<br />
term.
<br />
<br />A nice one, using more deeply grandma psychology though, is based on the
<br />
following fact: I cannot prove to you that I am conscious. Or, if you
<br />
prefer, if you decide to believe I am a zombie, there is no way for me
<br />
(if comp is true) to refute your assertion.
<br />
Still I bet most people like you and me are NOT zombie.
<br />
Now the first person is everything you know about you but that you
<br />
cannot prove to others, and which makes yourself NOT being a zombie.
<br />
<br />I let you the exercice of showing that this definition is stronger than
<br />
the simple one.
<br />
<br />Hoping that can help you.
<br />
<br /><br />The last definition (in my thesis) of the 1-person is the one given by 
<br />
Thaetetus in Plato. It is the knower. I say a honest machine 
<br />
communicates p, if the
<br />
machine gives me a proof of p. And I say, with Thaetetus that the
<br />
machine knows p, if it communicates p and p is true.
<br />
Unfortunately &quot;p is true&quot; cannot be translated in the language of the
<br />
machine (by Tarski theorem). But then I use a trick (found independently
<br />
by Boolos, Goldblatt, and Kusnestsov and Muravitskii) which leads to
<br />
identify somehow the 1-person with sort of intuitionist Brouwerian
<br />
creative subject. Here we got a theory of antisymmetrical time.
<br />
But that subject collapses into just propositional logic in UD*,
<br />
but then the miracle is that a minimal weakening of Thaethetus trick
<br />
makes possible to marry the antisymmetrical knower with its
<br />
quasi completely symmetrical surroundings in UD*. 
<br />
Well this need G and G* ... (see &quot;modalities&quot; in the archive).
<br />
<br />Hoping that can open your appetite :)
<br />
<br /><br />And the term &quot;survive&quot;? Forget it if you don't like it. 
<br />
A computationalist is just someone saying &quot;yes&quot; to its surgeon
<br />
for an artificial digital brain/body/&quot;universe&quot; transplant, 
<br />
He/She or the doctor he/she trusts (unfortunately perhaps), is 
<br />
*betting* on a level  of functional substitution relatively
<br />
to the more probable consistent extensions.
<br />
The real question is not the question of comp being true or
<br />
false, but the (relative) measure on the possible diaries content.
<br />
<br /><br />To sum up the main point, the absence of account of the UD delays
<br />
in the first person (classical memories of UTM's diaries) forces 
<br />
us to search the measure on the computational continuations 
<br />
on the *whole* UD*.
<br />
The key of the translation of the UDA in arithmetic is that the
<br />
nuance between the person point of views is literaly forced on us
<br />
by the necessary nuance between provability, truth, and 
<br />
consistency forced by the incompleteness phenomenon on the self
<br />
referentially correct machine.
<br />
Adding consistency to provability throughout UD* gives rise to
<br />
(arithmetical) sort of quantum probabilities (to describe the
<br />
mathematical content of my thesis in a nutshell).
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
