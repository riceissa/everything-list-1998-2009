<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; coming into existence say in 1850, and happening to obey

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; classical/quantum-mechanical laws as required to convince us that the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universe does follow simple laws).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but that structure would not implement any computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Many of us are computationalists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now there would seem to be far more different mathematical structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; where this type of scenario occurs (but with sufficient deviation from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'normality' such that we would notice - the odd white rabbit scuttling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; across a ceiling, for instance, to reuse an earlier example), than there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is of the relatively simple mathematical structure(s) that science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; implies underlies our phenomenal world. So statistically we should be in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one of these 'contrived' universes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the case of typical 'junk' data, yes, but there would be no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations.
</em><br />
<br />As a counter to the challenge to Tegmark's hypothesis, I am afraid I can't
<br />
see the relevance of this or the other statement above (a contrived
<br />
computation (or appearance of computation, if you prefer) can readily be
<br />
produced from a sufficiently complex mathematical structure, and it only has
<br />
to convince us that it looks like a computation), so I'll presume you are
<br />
responding from a different, computationally-generated-universe
<br />
(cgu)standpoint. Perhaps I could just clarify why, at my rather rudimentary
<br />
level of understanding, I don't find these (cgu) kind of ideas very
<br />
attractive (with one possible exception) - apologies if I am retreading old
<br />
ground:
<br />
<br />Any cgu idea must fall into one of two exhaustive categories:
<br />
<br />1. There is a required process of execution of programs which leads to the
<br />
existence of universes.
<br />
<br />For this category, then clearly any program must be executed from a universe
<br />
other than the one (or more) that is produced by it. Where does this
<br />
'higher' universe come from? Schmidhuber implies a chain of universes, but
<br />
if there is an original universe somewhere, why can't it be this (our) one,
<br />
and forget the chain? Similarly, an infinite hierarchy of TM's solves
<br />
nothing, it just sweeps the problem under the carpet of infinity. [Note to
<br />
BM: this is where the turtles come in.]
<br />
<br />2.  There is no required process of execution of programs leading to the
<br />
existence of universes.
<br />
<br />To retain any semblance of cgu, then it would seem that either
<br />
&nbsp;a) The program(s) still specify the universes, but do not need to be
<br />
formally executed . . . but this cannot be the case, since without a
<br />
computer/TM to run on, a program can be no more than a string of bits (or
<br />
however it is encoded) - another TM could well generate a totally different
<br />
universe from the same bit string; or
<br />
&nbsp;b) The bit strings specifying our, and other, universes in explicit detail
<br />
are in some sense already present - no execution of a program is necessary.
<br />
If the measure is applied on all these bit strings, then not only do we hit
<br />
the flying rabbit problem again, but we are also departing from a
<br />
computational scheme, since the input program and TM process become defunct.
<br />
But if the measure is on the input side (to obtain the advantages of simple
<br />
physics via non-functional code), how can the input be responsible for the
<br />
output if no execution of a program is to be posited?
<br />
<br />This is why Tegmark's hypothesis seems to me to have more mileage in it than
<br />
a computational scheme, if a good response can be found to the challenge I
<br />
described in my previous post.

<br />
<br />&lt;This issue was discussed in depth in the thread &quot;Why physical
<br />
laws?&quot;. A possible solution relates to giving greater measure to items with
<br />
smaller description. see &quot;unlikely universes&quot; thread (Schmidhueber)
<br />
I think this is an important problem, and I suspect the answer comes
<br />
down to the same sort of reasoning as Occam's razor. I don't think it
<br />
has been adequately resolved yet, but also don't believe it is an
<br />
effective counter argument to Tegmark's thesis.&gt;
<br />
<br />As I have mentioned before, my DA challenge was specifically aimed at
<br />
Tegmark's hypothesis (though I have a horrible feeling I may have just got
<br />
myself embroiled in another one), and not Schmidhuber's - I wouldn't want to
<br />
quarrell with the solutions he mentioned to the flying rabbit problem as
<br />
applied to *his* hypothesis.
<br />
<br />As regards Ockham's Razor, it is this principle itself that suggests the
<br />
ultimate ensemble theory, which in turn *results* in  the flying rabbit
<br />
paradox, so it is difficult for me to see how Ockham's Razor or an
<br />
equivalent on their own could be used to circumvent it.

<br />Bruno Marchal wrote:
<br />
<br />&lt;My answer was that I don't see how Tegmark can make this challenge
<br />
effective because the collection of mathematical structures is
<br />
not definable in mathematical terms.&gt;
<br />
<br />Don't we only need a rough idea of the relative measure of small samples of
<br />
these mathematical structures in order to pose the challenge? Surely it is
<br />
the case that any mathematical structure entirely confined to the
<br />
specification of a relatively simple interpretation of our universe (as
<br />
implied by current physical theories) must be of far smaller measure than
<br />
that of the myriad of 'flying rabbit' type universes? (The picture that I
<br />
have in mind here, though probably not really apposite, is of the relative
<br />
number of rotation states of a cube, and a dodecahedron.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Could you tell us if you agree that Schmidhuber &quot;great programmer&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;approach
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;should also met the flying rabbit challenge ?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I agree that it should, and moreover on the face of it appears to do
<br />
so.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And could you explain more precisely the 'turtles all the way down'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;accusation against Schmidhuber Great programmer?
</em><br />
<br />Please see my reply to Jacques Mallah above (Point 1.).
<br />
<br /><br />Thanks for all your replies, but despite rereading the threads you have
<br />
suggested, I am still looking for a clear solution to the flying rabbit
<br />
paradox challenge to Tegmark's hypothesis!
