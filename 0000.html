<br />
A weak notion of the idea that all universes exist is the many worlds
<br />
interpretation of quantum mechanics.  This is basically regular QM minus
<br />
wave function collapse.  Everett showed that, if you look at it right,
<br />
a universe which does not have wave function collapse could actually be
<br />
said to look to its inhabitants as though it did have collapse.
<br />
<br />This has the advantage that the universe becomes deterministic, and
<br />
there is no new information or randomness which must appear as the
<br />
universe evolves.
<br />
<br />Wei Dai proposed measuring the complexity of a universe model by the size
<br />
of the program it would take to run the universe.  My feeling is that
<br />
this should also count the size of the initial conditions, and the size
<br />
of any randomness which must be generated during the course of the run.
<br />
(I find it disturbing to imagine an algorithmic pseudo-random number
<br />
generator being used to generate what appears as true randomness in
<br />
the universe.)
<br />
<br />With this kind of measure, a QM universe minus wave function collapse will
<br />
require a much smaller program than one which incorporates collapse, since
<br />
the latter will require randomness to determine how each collapse occurs.
<br />
<br />Recent astronomical measurements suggest that the universe will expand
<br />
forever.  In simple Friedmann models this corresponds to a universe which
<br />
is open and infinite in spatial extent.
<br />
<br />There are some parallels between an open universe with wave function
<br />
collapse and one without.  If the universe does have wave function
<br />
collapse (i.e. many worlds is not true) you could still find spatially
<br />
distant regions of the universe which were arbitrarily close to identical.
<br />
There would be an infinite number of copies of each such region.
<br />
You could then identify all such identical regions as one entity, and
<br />
as this entity evolves it will split into sub-parts where different
<br />
events occur.  This is very similar to what happens within the MW model.
<br />
<br />What I'm not sure about then is whether the infinite universe with wave
<br />
function collapse can also be simulated with a small program, like a
<br />
universe without collapse.  Can you avoid the need for randomness by
<br />
some trick where you don't try to specify the universe as a literal
<br />
4-dimensional manifold, but use some other level of description?
<br />
Just as, when we're simulating the MW universe we don't try to identify
<br />
the individual universes (there is ambiguity about how to split them),
<br />
perhaps we can avoid specifying where everything happens in the infinite
<br />
universe.  This needs more thought...
<br />
