<em class="quotelev1">&gt; May be you could study the UDA, and directly tell me at which step

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your &quot;theory&quot; departs from the comp hyp.
</em><br />
<br />Okay, I read over your SANE2004 paper again.
<br />
<br />From step 01 of UDA:
<br />
<br />&quot;The scanned (read) information is send by traditional means, by mails
<br />
or radio waves for instance, at Helsinki, where you are correctly
<br />
reconstituted with ambient organic material.&quot;
<br />
<br />Okay, so this information that is sent by traditional means is really
<br />
I think where consciousness lives.  Though not literally in the
<br />
physical instantiation of the information.  For instance if you were
<br />
to print out that information in some format, I would NOT point to the
<br />
large pile of ink-stained paper and say that it was conscious.  But
<br />
would say that the information that is represented by that pile of ink
<br />
and paper &quot;represents&quot;, or &quot;identifies&quot;, or &quot;points to&quot; a single
<br />
instant of consciousness.
<br />
<br />So, what is the information?  Well, let's say the data you're
<br />
transmitting is from a neural scan and consists of a bunch of numbers
<br />
indicating neural connection weights, chemical concentrations,
<br />
molecular positions and states, or whatever.  I wouldn't even say that
<br />
this information is the information that is conscious.  Instead this
<br />
information is ultimately an encoding (via the particular way that the
<br />
brain stores information) of the symbols and the relationships between
<br />
those symbols that represent your knowledge, beliefs, and memories
<br />
(all of the information that makes you who you are).  (Echoes here of
<br />
the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) stuff that I referenced before)
<br />
<br /><br />From step 08 of UDA:
<br />
<br />&quot;Instead of linking [the pain I feel] at space-time (x,t) to [a
<br />
machine state] at space-time (x,t), we are obliged to associate [the
<br />
pain I feel at space-time (x,t)] to a type or a sheaf of computations
<br />
(existing forever in the arithmetical Platonia which is accepted as
<br />
existing independently of our selves with arithmetical realism).&quot;
<br />
<br />So instead I would write this as:
<br />
<br />&quot;Instead of linking [the pain I feel] at space-time (x,t) to [a
<br />
machine state] at space-time (x,t), we are obliged to associate [the
<br />
pain I feel at space-time (x,t)] to an [informational state] existing
<br />
forever in Platonia which is accepted as existing independently of
<br />
ourselves.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You have to see that, personally, I don't have a theory other than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption that the brain is emulable by a Turing machine
</em><br />
<br />I also believe that, but I think that consciousness is in the
<br />
information represented by the discrete states of the data stored on
<br />
the Turing machine's tape after each instruction is executed, NOT in
<br />
the actual execution of the Turing machine.  The instruction table of
<br />
the Turing machine just describes one possible way that a particular
<br />
sequence of information states could be produced.
<br />
<br />Execution of the instructions in the action table actually doesn't do
<br />
anything with respect to the production of consciousness.  The output
<br />
informational states represented by data on tape exists platonically
<br />
even if the Turing machine program is never run.  And therefore the
<br />
consciousness that goes with those states also exists platonically,
<br />
even if the Turing machine program is never run.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. So, now, Kelly, just to understand what you mean by your theory, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to ask you what your theory predicts in case of self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiplication.
</em><br />
<br />Well, first I'd say there aren't copies of identical information in
<br />
Platonia.  All perceived physical representations all actually point
<br />
to (similarly to a C-style pointer in programming) the same
<br />
platonically existing information state.  So if there are 1000
<br />
identical copies of me in identical mental states, they are really
<br />
just representations of the same &quot;source&quot; information state.
<br />
<br />Piles of atoms aren't conscious.  Information is conscious.  1000
<br />
identically arranged piles of atoms still represent only a single
<br />
information state (setting aside putnam mapping issues).  The
<br />
information state is conscious, not the piles of atoms.
<br />
<br />However, once their experiences diverge so that they are no longer
<br />
identical, then they are totally seperate and they represent (or point
<br />
to) seperate, non-overlapping conscious information states.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To see where does those probabilities come from, you have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand that 1) you can be multiplied (that is read, copy (cut) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pasted in Washington AND Moscow (say)), and 2) you are multiplied (by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2^aleph_zero, at each instant, with a comp definition of instant not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related in principle with any form of physical time).
</em><br />
<br />Well, probability is a tricky subject, right?
<br />
<br />An interesting quote:
<br />
<br />&quot;Whereas the interpretation of quantum mechanics has only been
<br />
puzzling us for ~75 years, the interpretation of probability has been
<br />
doing so for more than 300 years [16, 17]. Poincare [18] (p. 186)
<br />
described probability as &quot;an obscure instinct&quot;. In the century that
<br />
has elapsed since then philosophers have worked hard to lessen the
<br />
obscurity. However, the result has not been to arrive at any
<br />
consensus. Instead, we have a number of competing schools (for an
<br />
overview see Gillies [19], von Plato [20], Sklar [21, 22] and Guttman
<br />
[23]).&quot; (<a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/quant-ph/pdf/0402/0402015v1.pdf">http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/quant-ph/pdf/0402/0402015v1.pdf</a>)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The fact is that your explanation, that we are in an typical universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because those exist as well, just does not work with the comp hyp. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not work, because it does not explain why we REMAIN in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; typical worlds.
</em><br />
<br />Some Brunos will remain in typical worlds, and never see any other
<br />
type of world.  But other Brunos are finding themselves in
<br />
white-rabbit-worlds at every instant.
<br />
<br />You are a &quot;typical world Bruno&quot;, and there will ALWAYS be typical
<br />
world Brunos who ask &quot;If Kelly's theory is correct why am I still in a
<br />
typical world?&quot;
<br />
<br />And the answer is, since every possible Bruno exists, there must exist
<br />
some Brunos who only see typical worlds.
<br />
<br />So with this in mind, how could some Brunos NOT REMAIN in a typical
<br />
world?  What could possibly explain the absence of all &quot;typical world
<br />
Brunos&quot;?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that, as far as I can put meaning on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your view, the probability I will see a white rabbit in two seconds is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as great than the probability I will see anything else, and this is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contradiction with the fact. What makes us staying in apparent lawful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; histories?
</em><br />
<br />The probability that a Bruno will see a white rabbit in 02 seconds is
<br />
100%.  The probability that a Bruno will NOT see a white rabbit in 2
<br />
seconds is ALSO 100%.
<br />
<br />The key part here is the use of &quot;a&quot;, as in &quot;a Bruno&quot;.
<br />
<br />Future Brunos are independent of &quot;present Bruno&quot;, except for their
<br />
memory of you.  Again, there's nothing &quot;real&quot; that ties together
<br />
instants of consciousness except for the &quot;feeling&quot; of continuity
<br />
that's provided by memory.
<br />
<br />So with probability, you're asking &quot;what is the likelyhood that I will
<br />
see X as opposed to Y&quot;.  But YOU aren't going to see anything, you're
<br />
tied to the present.  Some future version of you will see X.  And a
<br />
different future version of you will see Y.  And there will be other
<br />
future versions of you that see A through W also.
<br />
<br />So here I guess we get into issues of personal identity over time, and
<br />
maybe also questions of transworld identity.  From SEP
<br />
(<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-personal/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-personal/</a>):
<br />
<br />&quot;What does it take for a person to persist from one time to
<br />
another—that is, for the same person to exist at different times? What
<br />
sorts of adventures could you possibly survive, in the broadest sense
<br />
of the word 'possible'? What sort of event would necessarily bring
<br />
your existence to an end? What determines which past or future being
<br />
is you? Suppose you point to a child in an old class photograph and
<br />
say, “That's me.” What makes you that one, rather than one of the
<br />
others? What is it about the way she relates then to you as you are
<br />
now that makes her you? For that matter, what makes it the case that
<br />
anyone at all who existed back then is you? This is the question of
<br />
personal identity over time. An answer to it is an account of our
<br />
persistence conditions, or a criterion of personal identity over time
<br />
(a constitutive rather than an evidential criterion: the second falls
<br />
under the Evidence Question below).&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What does you theory predict about agony and death, from the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person point of view?
</em><br />
<br />Well, I'm guessing that there is no first person death.  We are all
<br />
subjectively immortal, and all possible futures await.  Some of them
<br />
very bad.  Some of them very good.
<br />
<br />In one of my futures I will never experience a good thing again.  It
<br />
will be nothing but suffering, misery, and humiliation for eternity.
<br />
<br />BUT, on the plus side, in another future I will never experience
<br />
another bad thing again.  It's blue skies and flowers for as far as
<br />
the eye can see.
<br />
<br />Most futures will be some mix of the two.
<br />
<br />To be honest, the thought of the good futures doesn't make up for the
<br />
thought of the bad futures.  BUT, such is life.  I suspect.
