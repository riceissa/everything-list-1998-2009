<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He is correct for the same reason Alice's answer to her exams were

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct, even if luckily so.
</em><br />
<br />I think it's (subtly) incorrect to focus on Lucky Alice's *answers* to  
<br />
her exams. By definition, she wrote down the correct answers. But (I  
<br />
claim) she didn't compute those answers. A bunch of cosmic rays just  
<br />
made her look like she did. Fully-Functional Alice, on the other hand,  
<br />
actually did compute the answers.
<br />
<br />Let's imagine that someone interrupts Fully-Functional Alice while  
<br />
she's taking the exam and asks her, &quot;Do you think that your actions  
<br />
right now are being caused primarily by a very unlikely sequence of  
<br />
cosmic rays?&quot;, and she answers &quot;No&quot;. She is answering correctly. By  
<br />
definition, Lucky Alice will answer the same way. But she will be  
<br />
answering incorrectly. That is the sense in which I'm saying that  
<br />
Lucky Kory is making a false statement when he says &quot;I learned to tie  
<br />
my shoes in my youth&quot;.
<br />
<br />In the case of Lucky Kory, I concur that, despite this difference, his  
<br />
subjective consciousness is identical to what Kory's would have been  
<br />
if the teleportation was successful. But the reason I can view Lucky  
<br />
Kory as conscious at all is that once the lucky accident creates him  
<br />
out of whole cloth, his neurons are firing correctly, are causally  
<br />
connected to each other in the requisite ways, etc. I have a harder  
<br />
time understanding how Lucky Alice can be conscious, because at the  
<br />
time I'm supposed to be viewing her as conscious, she isn't meeting  
<br />
the causal / computational pre-requisites that I thought were  
<br />
necessary for consciousness. And I can essentially turn Lucky Kory  
<br />
into Lucky Alice by imagining that he is &quot;nothing but&quot; a series of  
<br />
lucky teleportations. And then suddenly I don't see how he can be  
<br />
conscious, either.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose I send you a copy of my sane paper by the internet, and that,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the internet demolishes it completely, but that by an incredible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chance your buggy computer rebuild it in its exact original form. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will not change the content of the paper, and the paper will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct or false independently of the way it has flight from me to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you.
</em><br />
<br />That's because the SANE paper doesn't happen to talk about it's own  
<br />
causal history. Imagine that I take a pencil and a sheet of paper and  
<br />
write the following on it:
<br />
<br />&quot;The patterns of markings on this paper were caused by Kory Heath. Of  
<br />
course, that doesn't mean that the molecules in this piece of paper  
<br />
touched the hands of Kory Heath. Maybe the paper has been teleported  
<br />
since Kory wrote it, and reconstructed out of totally different  
<br />
molecules. But there is an unbroken causal chain from these markings  
<br />
back to something Kory once did.&quot;
<br />
<br />If you teleport that paper normally, the statement on it remains true.  
<br />
If the teleportation fails, but a lucky accident creates an identical  
<br />
piece of paper, the statement on it is false. Maybe this has no  
<br />
bearing on consciousness or anything else, but I don't want to forget  
<br />
about the distinction until I'm sure it's not relevant.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, the movie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has still some relationship with the original consciousness of Alice,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and this will help us to save the MEC part of the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenience thesis, giving rise to the notion of &quot;computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenience&quot;, but this form of supervenience does no more refer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything *primarily* physical, and this will be enough preventing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use of a concrete universe for blocking the UDA conclusion.
</em><br />
<br />I see what you mean. But for me, these thought experiments are making  
<br />
me doubt that I even have a coherent notion of &quot;computational  
<br />
supervenience&quot;.
