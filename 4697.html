<br />I agree with your answer, and I guess I have not been enough
<br />
clear, because you repeat what I said, except for my use of
<br />
Church thesis. I was (implicitely) assuming the computationalist
<br />
hypothesis in the cognitive science. Knowing that from comp
<br />
physics is reduced into a measure on the self consistent
<br />
extension, empiricalness and all contingencies is justified by
<br />
incompleteness. Now that is not obvious. Look in my URL for
<br />
links to the proof. Note that by Godel second theorem a consistent
<br />
machine  cannot prove the existence of even just one consistent
<br />
extension, but yet can prove a lot about the geometry of those
<br />
consistent extensions, once they exist.

<br />Just to be clear on that point, I agree totally with Chaitin.
<br />
Now, some truth (like 317 is a prime) are clearer than any physical
<br />
proposition. But, as I said, there will be more and more mathematical
<br />
propositions, in the future, which will have &quot;experimental&quot; status, and
<br />
this follows from incompleteness phenomena.

<br />It is not because some question are unsolvable in one domain, that
<br />
all the question are unsolvable in that domain. Reality is most
<br />
plausibly *partially* knowable. With Godel we know that our uncertainties

are proportional to our certainties. This is perhaps related to the

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'd suggest that this notion of provability is analogous to the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;reality&quot; of physics.  Provable theorems are what we know, within

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a mathematical system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, one problem with this approach is that it focuses on the theorems,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which are generally &quot;about&quot; some mathematical concepts or objects,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but not on the objects themselves.  For example, we have a theory of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the integers, and we can make proofs about them, such as that there

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are an infinite number of primes.  These proofs are what we know about

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the integers, the &quot;mathematical reality&quot; of this subject.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But what about the integers themselves?  They are distinct from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theorems about them.  Maybe we would want to say that it is the integers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which are &quot;mathematically real&quot;, rather than proofs about them.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. Important point. Why do you ask? I am afraid you are confusing
<br />
levels. Let me be precise on this because a lot of people are wrong
<br />
or confused. So, roughly speaking.
<br />
Number theory is the study of numbers. That is, a number theorist
<br />
works on numbers, and its main methodology is informal proof, conjectures,
<br />
and nowadays : computer experimentation, and tomorrow perhaps physical
<br />
experiment.
<br />
Geometry is the study of spaces. That is a (mathematical) geometer
<br />
works on spaces (Euclidian, non euclidian, riemannian, hilbert spaces,
<br />
projective spaces, etc.). and its main methodology is informal proof,
<br />
conjectures, etc.
<br />
Proof theory (a branche of logic) is the study of formal proofs.
<br />
That is, a proof theorist works on proofs and proofs system (quantum
<br />
like, intuitionnist, monotonic, modal, classical, non standard, etc.).
<br />
And its main methodology is, like any other mathematicians, *informal
<br />
proof*, conjecture, etc.
<br />
No mathematician do formal proofs. All proof in mathematical
<br />
books and papers are informal (although rigorous). To formalise
<br />
a proof is made only by proof theorist, because formal proof are their
<br />
object of study, but then they make informal proofs *about* those
<br />
formal proofs.
<br />
So, the number theorist learn about numbers, the geometer
<br />
learns about spaces, the proof theorist learns about proofs.
<br />
And then they exist bridges between those branch, and
<br />
applications, etc.
<br />
But a mathematician does not learn about proofs per se
<br />
(of course by practice he develops skills for proving things), but
<br />
he learns about its subject matter (numbers, spaces, etc.)
<br />
*through* proofs.

<br />I don't want to look presumptuous, but then, I want to be clear about
<br />
what I have done (or at least about what I think, and apparently some other
<br />
people thinks  I have done). In particular, I don't think I have made a
<br />
*proposal*. I provide a proof. A proof that *if* we postulate the COMP 
<br />
hyp., *then* it
<br />
follows that physics is a branch of number theory. See my URL for the 
<br />
proof, and
<br />
don't hesitate to ask question if some steps are unclear.
<br />
Note that the proof assumes almost nothing in mathematics. Only the attempt
<br />
of an actual derivation of the logical skeleton of the physical propositions
<br />
assumes a lot of mathematical logics. But the proof itself of the necessity 
<br />
of the
<br />
reduction assumes nothing more that the comp hyp, and of course
<br />
some reasoning abilities, if this should be mentioned at all.
<br />
I am completely open to the idea that comp will be refuted, and that what
<br />
I have done could lead to such a refutation. But currently comp seems to be
<br />
confirmed by the facts. For example, the most obvious and oldest fact
<br />
which follows from comp is the Many-World-like ontology, and through
<br />
physics, the idea is slowly made seemingly reasonable.
