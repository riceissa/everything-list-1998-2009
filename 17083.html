</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; -  &quot;why do I feel myself in W, and not in M&quot; which is very natural

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for the

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, OK, the seven steps: but this isn't the problem.  Hmm...let's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see.  OK, let's try a different tack.  As you have observed, we may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well share some basic intuitions, but we don't share the same goal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here.  Yours intentions vis-a-vis COMP are professional, precisely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; limited, modest, practical, and as such I endorse them wholeheartedly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mine are dilettantish, more personally oriented, probably less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; useful; essentially a way of exercising my curiosity.  So before going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on, I need to state something obvious, or perhaps not-so-obvious,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related to my personal thinking style.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In internalising your ideas, I try to do so, as it were, by BECOMING
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever system you are proposing.  You might say that this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reification, but for me it's an indispensable imaginative tool: you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might call it cogification.  It's a sort of meditation, and when I was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; active as a programmer, I used to be able to do it in my dreams, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would often actually experience myself as the program going into some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; error state - a useful debugging tool!  And of course one of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; helpful aspects of cogifying in this way is that you see immediately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what you're getting, what you're NOT getting, and particularly that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can't get something for nothing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So all my questions to you really stem from these imaginative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cogifications.  I need to know what it FEELS like to be in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno-world.  Only then can I find out if it matches my own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience, and hence the non-negotiable appearances I'm committed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saving.  Thus in the present case, I first scrupulously clearing away
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extraneous notions, and commence to cogify myself to your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specifications in order to experience the consequences.  As a simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result of my going about the matter in this way I am totally present
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and personally instantiated in my cogifications.  My natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective here is that of the One - the global &quot;I&quot;: hence all my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions stem from this perspective.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, it impinges on me that I really should justify how the One could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be said to 'focus' itself on - or resolve - a COMP perspective in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first place: i.e. we must check that what I airily called 'clearing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; away extraneous notions' isn't just getting something for nothing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, 'something *from* nothing' may turn out to be more apt here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical totality - in effect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything-inter-related-in-every-possible-way - would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indistinguishable, from the perspective of the One, from 'nothing'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This has been pointed out in various ways before.  So the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cogification is (in David Bohm's term) the 'relevation' (relative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elevation) of the number realm and its basic operators: the emergence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of something from nothing.  A point of view, or the possibility of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many, emerges.  In effect, everything else falls away into background
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; noise.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Further cogifications are then further levels of relevation: that of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the UD and its infinitely iterated interlaced infinities of steps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguished from the background noise of the set of all possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programs.  As I cogify myself in the guise of the UD I'm able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider the relevation of further subsets of the global point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view.  Now &quot;I&quot; - as the One - can see interference effects relevate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; invariances from the background noise of recursive infinities;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increasingly intricate patterns built on these invariances;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pattern-pattern 'least difference' relations that both create and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiate historical sequences; 'events in time' that relevate as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these sequences phase-shift through my global 'observer moment'; white
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rabbits that flit by, but get lost against the vast illumination of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reiterated regularity.  In this broad-brushed but experientially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persuasive way I'm able to intuit how &quot;I&quot; - as the One - might both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lose and find myself in an infinity of distinguishable personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regularities against a background of noisy irrelevance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So my question to you was really about the machinery of perspective,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the sense I've described above.  We often speak of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeterminacy of the &quot;I&quot;, but I'm at least equally struck by its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determinacy.  It's always the same &quot;I&quot;, and this is consequent on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; global presence of the One in the light of the options available for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relevating a point of view.  As a direct consequence of cogifying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; myself in the form of the One, I perceive that I really have two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; options only, experientially speaking.  I can just sit here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atemporally; present, differentiated and inter-related in all possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ways, but essentially getting 'nothing' out of it.  Or I can relevate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a global observer moment and thus experience a polymorphous parade of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events phase-shifting through it as inter-laced personal histories in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space and time.  It may be all illusory, but at least they're MY
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; illusions: the mini-illusions of the vast cavalcade of mini-mes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which option is likely to be the more entertaining way of spending
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eternity?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Gosh, David, you are a champion for the difficult questions.
<br />
<br />I like to compare the effect of understanding UDA with the effect of  
<br />
smoking Salvia Divinorum. When I was young I was sure that  
<br />
understanding UDA-like reasoning and paradoxical thought experiment,   
<br />
was only a source of joy, for everyone.
<br />
<br />But life taught me that this was not so obvious.
<br />
<br />The reaction to UDA, by the few people who get the ultimate &quot;AH AH&quot;  
<br />
has been a shock for me. A computer scientist in France told me he  
<br />
lost sleep for one week. It is the same with salvia divinorum. If you  
<br />
look at the reports, you will often see similar reports with very  
<br />
different conclusions; like two quasi-same reports but one ending by  
<br />
&quot;this was the biggest joyful revelation in my life&quot;, and the other  
<br />
ending by &quot;this was the worst terrible moment in my life&quot;.
<br />
I have learned to hide, in all matter, my enthusiasm, not always with  
<br />
success actually.
<br />
<br />So, about the more entertaining way of spending eternity, I would just  
<br />
say:  try heaven, avoid hell, but don't count on any body or tierce  
<br />
soul to give you a path, or a definition, this is really *your* job.  
<br />
No two souls can find the same things entertaining.
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
