<br />
I just had a few thoughts about this, and I want to get them
<br />
down before I forget.
<br />
<br />Jacques says that the ASSA predicts that we'll never be &quot;very 
<br />
old&quot;, because the measure of observer moments goes down with
<br />
subjective time.  I'm not so sure about this.
<br />
<br />I do think that it probably predicts that we should never find
<br />
ourselves to be extraordinary - I believe he called this the
<br />
&quot;Copernican Anthropic Principle&quot;, CAP.  When I said that, no
<br />
matter how old you are, you could always argue that you're not
<br />
&quot;very old&quot;, he replied:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We have been over this *many* times.  A) &quot;Old&quot; is when your finite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain is too old to even know how old it is. 
</em><br />
<br />If we, while alive, are continually growing and assimilating more
<br />
information and more capacity for information, then this state 
<br />
will never be reached.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; B) In any case, &quot;old&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much older than the age that would be expected if QTI is false:  
</em><br />
<br />This statement begs the question.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In QTI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one should expect one's age *relative to* the other people you see to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; large, certainly *****not***** less than or of order 1!  If you were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 10,000 and everyone else was &lt;100 at least you would have reason to supect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the rules might be different for you than for third parties.
</em><br />
<br />Here's the crux of the bisquit: the CAP.
<br />
<br />Now, it is possible to live forever and not violate the CAP.  It is even
<br />
possible that the measure of observer moments throughout an infinite
<br />
lifetime never decreases substantially.  By &quot;substantially&quot;, let me throw
<br />
out the possibility that it may be true that it decreases by some function 
<br />
less than exponential.
<br />
<br />For example, we live at a time where it may be possible, in the near 
<br />
future (whatever *that* means) to increase human longevity to the point
<br />
where we are &quot;practically&quot; immortal (in the common use of the word).  
<br />
Then the things that would decrease our measure would be common household
<br />
accidents and the like.  If the probability of our death by accident were 
<br />
to remain constant, then our measure would still be decreasing exponentially
<br />
(albeit with a much longer time constant than now).  But that's not likely.
<br />
As we learn and grow, our safety precautions will become more sophisticated
<br />
(as they are becoming now), and we should expect the probability of 
<br />
accidents to continue to decrease.  Hence our measure will decrease by &quot;less 
<br />
than exponential&quot;.
<br />
<br />So I'm still not convinced that computational continuations of me at age
<br />
1000 are necessarily of a measure so low that I would not expect to find
<br />
myself at that age.
