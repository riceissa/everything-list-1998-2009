On this list, we seem to have two fairly clear camps: those who
<br />
identify observer moments as the fundamental concept, and those who
<br />
regard relationships between observer moments with equal ontological
<br />
status.
<br />
<br />With my TIME postulate, I say that a conscious observer necessarily
<br />
experiences a sequence of related observer moments (or even a
<br />
continuum of them). To argue that observer moments are independent of
<br />
each other is to argue the negation of TIME. With TIME, the measure of
<br />
each observer moment is relative to the predecessor state, or the RSSA
<br />
is the appropriate principle to use. With not-TIME, each observer
<br />
moment has an absolute measure, the ASSA.
<br />
<br />On this postulate (which admittedly still fails rigourous statement,
<br />
and is not as intuitive as one would like axioms to be), hinges the
<br />
whole QTI debate, and many other things besides. With TIME, one has
<br />
the RSSA and the possibility of QTI. With not-TIME, one has the
<br />
ASSA,and Jacques Mallah's doomsday argument against QTI is valid. See
<br />
the great &quot;RSSA vs ASSA debate&quot; on  the everything list a few years ago.
<br />
<br />Now I claim that TIME is implied by computationalism. Time is needed
<br />
for machines to pass from one state to another, ie to actually compute
<br />
something. Bruno apparently disagrees, but I haven't heard his
<br />
disagreement yet.
<br />
<br />Cheers

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't understand it. Are you saying there may never be a &quot;next moment&quot; at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the point where you are facing near-certain death? It seems to me that all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is required is an observer moment in which (a) you believe that you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are you, however this may be defined (it's problematic even in &quot;normal&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life what constitutes continuity of identity), and (b) you remember facing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the said episode of near-certain death (ncd), and it will seem to you that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you have miraculously escaped, even if there is no actual physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connection between the pre-ncd and the post-ncd observer moment. Or, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another way to escape is as you have suggested in a more recent post, that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is an observer moment somewhere in the multiverse in which the ncd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; episode has been somehow deleted from your memory. Perhaps the latter is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more likely, in which case you can look forward to never, or extremely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rarely, facing ncd in your life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It all gets very muddled. If we try to ruthlessly dispense with every 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derivative, ill-defined, superfluous concept and assumption in an effort to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simplify the discussion, the one thing we are left with is the individual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moments. We then try to sort these observer-moments into sets 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which constitute lives, identities, birth, death, amnesia, mind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplication, mind melding, multiple world branchings, and essentially every 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible variation on these and other themes. No wonder it's confusing! And 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who is to judge where a particular individual's identity/life/body/memory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; begins and ends when even the most detailed, passed by committee of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophers set of rules fails, as it inevitably will?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The radical solution is to accept that only the observer-moments are real, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and how we sort them then is seen for what it is: essentially arbitrary, a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter of convention. You can dismiss the question of immortality, quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or otherwise, by observing that the only non-problematic definition of an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual is identification with a single observer-moment, so that no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual can ever &quot;really&quot; live for longer than a moment. Certainly, this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; goes against intuition, because I feel that I was alive a few minutes ago 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as well as ten years ago, but *of course* I feel that; this is simply 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reporting on my current thought processes, like saying I feel hungry or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tired, and beyond this cannot be taken as a falsifiable statement about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state of affairs in the real world unless recourse is taken to some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrary definition of personal identity, such as would satisfy a court, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for example.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me put it a different way. Situation (a) life as usual: I die every 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment and a peson is reborn every moment complete with (most) memories and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other attributes of the individual who has just died. Situation (b) I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; killed instantly, painlessly, with an axe every moment, and a person is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconstituted the next moment complete with (most) memories and other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attributes of the individual who has just died, such that he experiences no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discontinuity. Aside from the blood and mess in (b), is there a difference? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Should I worry more about (b) than (a)? This is of course a commonplace 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought experiment on this list, but I draw from it a slightly different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusion: we all die all the time; death doesn't really matter, otherwise 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we should all be in a constant panic.
