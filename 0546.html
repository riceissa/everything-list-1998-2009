<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But &quot;COMP&quot; is (if I understood it correctly)

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a stronger hypothesis: it is that at some finite level, you could reproduce

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or duplicate EXACTLY your conscious state, or at least you could simulate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it &quot;to an arbitrary degree of accuracy&quot; (which is already somewhat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; different!) (James):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	I will not speak about &quot;COMP&quot; - it is not my term - but as far as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;duplicating your conscious state, you can.  The idea is that by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;duplicating some computation, your conscious state would be duplicated,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;since consciouness is just as aspect of certain computations.
</em><br />
<br />My argument is that this computation is so tightly linked to the physical
<br />
reality that you cannot in practice make another implementation that is
<br />
perfectly equivalent. This is analoguous to the perturbations associated
<br />
with a quantum measurement. Classical computers can be exactly duplicated
<br />
because their computations are not affected by the fact that other
<br />
identical computers exist. This could be compared to classical
<br />
measurements, that can be repeated as often as you want because they don't
<br />
perturbate the object. But a conscious being cannot exist without being
<br />
perturbated by its environment (in fact we are conscious BECAUSE we are
<br />
constantly interacting with our environment). So if something else is
<br />
implementing a conscious computation, it must be different because its
<br />
environment is different. I precize this point below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If you think that you have built a neural network almost identical to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; yourself, you know that YOU have built A MACHINE. But what does YOUR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MACHINE know?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	If computationalism is true, it knows and feels pretty much what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you know and feel.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />So I see here a logical problem. If you built a machine that you think
<br />
identical to you, you can not of course predict its state one hour after
<br />
because it would be equivalent to be able to predict your own state - which
<br />
is clearly impossible. BUT if the machine is exactly like you, it must
<br />
think also that it has built a machine (a second one), identical to it, but
<br />
whose state is not predictible. But where is this second machine and how to
<br />
simulate it? It is also clearly impossible that your machine implements a
<br />
computation of yourself + this very machine. So the first machine that you
<br />
thought identical to you is in fact in a different environment : it has no
<br />
other machine to be confronted with. For example if you start to play with
<br />
your machine and you see that it is indeed doing exactly what you are doing
<br />
at the beginning, you could be delighted to see you have succeeded. Alas,
<br />
as soon as you realize that you are delighted, you realize also that your
<br />
machine is not delighted at all, because it has no machine to play with.
<br />
The interaction with the environment has very quickly lead you to separate
<br />
from your machine, just like in QM...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And if you succeed in building an intelligent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine (which IS possible in my opinion), this machine SHOULD know that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is a machine, and hence that it is not you, exactly for the same reason why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you know that you are you, and not anybody else.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	That just depends on the view it has of the external world.  You,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Giles, *could* be an artificial digital intelligence in a simultated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;environment in a supercomputer, and you'd never know it if it's done well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;enough.
</em><br />
<br />This point must also be considered carefully. If you think of the last
<br />
point, you are inevitably led to conclude that either your machine is
<br />
interacting with the real physical environment (through sensors, photo
<br />
cells and so on...), but in this case it will be conscious to be a
<br />
different being, or that you must simulate entirely its environment, but as
<br />
you cannot put in this artificial environment a second machine identical to
<br />
the first one, it will be also different.
<br />
I can be an artificial intelligence simulated by a supercomputer, but in
<br />
this case, this supercomputer works in a world that I cannot access. And in
<br />
this simulation, I must be unique. There may be another identical
<br />
calculation with another me, but it corresponds also to another world that
<br />
I cannot access. So my point is that a conscious being cannot be duplicated
<br />
exactly IN THE WORLD WHERE HE IS LIVING, in other words he cannot INTERACT
<br />
with an exact copy of himself. Parallel computations and MWI escape this
<br />
constraint, because the duplication takes place in both cases in ANOTHER
<br />
OBSERVABLE WORLD.
<br />
Don't you think it sounds coherent?
<br />
<br />Gilles
<br />
<br />.
