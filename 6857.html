<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [Stathis wrote]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; So if I am told that tomorrow I will be copied ten times and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; one of these copies will be tortured, I am worried, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that means there is a 1/10 chance I will be tortured.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Good example, but I would say that you will be tortured with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 100% probability at some places, and tortured with 0% probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at nine others. The characterization of a piece of matter &quot;Stathis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is undergoing torture&quot; is looked upon from the 3rd person as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; entirely physically characterized objective process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But here I agree with Stathis. What you say can be said with the throw
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a dice. There *will be* a 100% probability that I will experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the result n (with n = 1, 2, ...6). And if I make the dice rolling a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long time, by adding the Heisenberg uncertainties there will be (with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the MWI) a 100% probability for each outcome. But before the experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am in a maximal state of ignorance, and that gives usually P = 1/6.
</em><br />
<br />Well, it *sounds* like you are agreeing with me, or rather, with
<br />
the idea that you will experience each outcome of the roll of the
<br />
dice. Let's be specific: you have agreed that on your 60th birthday
<br />
you will attend a large celebration in your honor, and will roll
<br />
a massive osmium die, amid cheers from all those assembled.
<br />
This is the only time that such money and effort will be expended
<br />
for the &quot;Great Bruno Osmium Die Roll&quot; (except for incidents of
<br />
extremely low measure elsewhere in the multiverse where aliens
<br />
intervene or God appears to demand it, etc.)  The entire purpose
<br />
of my hypothesis here, is just so that we do not confuse this
<br />
particular roll of the die with any other of your life.
<br />
<br />I agree: *you* will experience *each* outcome of the Die Roll.
<br />
You will even experience the event that the osmium die turns
<br />
into a cloud of dust (through a quantum fluctuation), but it's
<br />
key that this occurs with only infinitesimal measure compared
<br />
to the measures of the six Brunos who experience the usual 1..6
<br />
outcomes.
<br />
<br />So aren't we in total agreement so far?  If so, then I suggest that
<br />
the usual nuances and feelings associated with the phrase &quot;there is
<br />
a 1/6 probability that I will experience n=3 (the Die shows a three)&quot;
<br />
is highly misleading!  It makes one think that something *could*
<br />
happen to one, but that in certain cases it does *not* happen to one.
<br />
<br />The problem is actually one of *anticipation*.  As naturally evolved
<br />
creatures, we are fashioned to anticipate the next moments. I have no
<br />
time now to get into it, but I don't think that this feeling of
<br />
anticipation really can be rigorously used; it's (unfortunately)
<br />
riddled with problems. Yet we are wired to observe it. So before
<br />
the great Die roll, you must anticipate seeing 1..6 and *not*
<br />
seeing the quantum fluctuation. Moreover, if one of the normal
<br />
six outcomes is associated with a very unpleasant experience,
<br />
you cannot help but think that it's similar to having a one in
<br />
six chance of the bad thing happening, and a 5 in 6 chance of
<br />
it not happening.  But I think that's a lie:  the truth is that
<br />
each outcome *will* happen. The only thing that gives you any
<br />
consolation is that the measure of the bad thing is only 1/6
<br />
while the measure of the good things is 5/6.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree &quot;it is you&quot;, but I follow Stathis' intuition that before the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;splitting&quot; the proba is 1/10 of being &quot;that &quot;you&quot;&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />While, on the other hand, I speak this way: you definitely will be
<br />
that &quot;you&quot;, and you definitely will not be that &quot;you&quot;. Both will
<br />
happen; it's not best to speak of it as a probability IMO.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If not with comp you must accept that Bruno Marchal *is* Lee Corbin.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we did arrive at that conclusion before, [didn't we]?
</em><br />
<br />I would say that Bruno and Lee are not the same because they have
<br />
very different memories (and, also---I think it follows---different
<br />
kinds of OMs).  Now if as one poster pointed out, I live long enough
<br />
(e.g. 10^10^10^10^10) then the state *I* will have will be one of
<br />
Bruno's. But so what?  All that means is that Lee won't be there
<br />
and Bruno will be there.  It's similarity of structure that matters:
<br />
that's why I must identify with the Lee of last month, but not
<br />
necessarily the Lee of 2025 (especially if he's been drafted into
<br />
the Army and gets really, really different kinds of experience).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose immortality (for the sake of the argument).  Lee1 and Lee2 can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; become as different as Bruno and Lee now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you should consider me as a &quot;you&quot; right now. We were the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amoeba you know, a long time ago.
</em><br />
<br />As I am saying, there is no &quot;soul&quot; or other divinely registered
<br />
serial number. The paths that Lee1 and Lee2 take could take them
<br />
clear out of the Lee Corbin fuzzy sphere in personality-space.
<br />
In which case *I* am completely not getting runtime from their
<br />
execution.
<br />
<br />The only reason I resist considering you (Bruno) to be Lee, is that
<br />
over in Bruno, &quot;I&quot; have so many different memories and dispositions
<br />
that I'm not Lee any more.
<br />
<br />Lee
