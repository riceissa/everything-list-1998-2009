Colin,

<br />
I think I am missing the main point: is the room + Marvin meant to be a zombie 
<br />
or not?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From: c.hales.domain.name.hidden
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Subject: The Totally Blind Zombie Homunculus Room
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To: everything-list.domain.name.hidden
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This discussion is a hybrid of a number of very famous thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments. Unlike those thought experiments, however, this experiment is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aimed purely and only at scientists. The intent is to demonstrate clearly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and definitively the nature of subjective experience (phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness) and its primal role in a scientist's ability to function as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a scientist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Imagine a room. Its walls and celing and floor are matt black. There are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no doors or windows. All over the walls are digital displays which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; announce numbers in warm, friendly colours. Up against all four walls and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up to international standard control desk height (roughly 750mm) is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sloping console. Covering the console around all four walls  are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pushbuttons. The number of displays is equal to the number of sensory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nerves entering a typical human brain from the peripheral nervous systems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; including all sensory input. The number of pushbuttons is equal to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entire set of effector nerves emanating from a typical brain. This total
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of displays and pushbuttons is in the millions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a comfortable chair upon which is seated the room's sole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occupant, Marvin the human. Marvin is normal except for never having been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outside the room and having never otherwise acquired any knowledge of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything other than that of the room and its contents. He knows absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing of any sort of external world or any other people. He has no clue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the external world except for what he can surmise from the displays
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and buttons.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Marvin, like all healthy humans, has an experiential life which is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collection of private phenomenal scenes delivered by his brain material.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These are operating normally except that Marvin has been deprived of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the phenomenal content (experiences) that he ever could have received had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he been allowed outside the room. He has had a lifetime of experiences,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but all of them have been confined to depicting the room.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Marvin is a scientist. He studies the science of not-room. His life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consists of experiments which involve the pressing of buttons and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recording of patterns in the displays. Over time an enormous volume of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; data begins to show patterns for which Marvin constructs models. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models are generalisations of the behaviour of the displays after buttons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are pushed in a certain way. He tests and refines the models and has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; developed a form of symbolic representation of the behaviour of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; displays. Certain features on the display occur regularly enough that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; names have been given to notional not-room phenomena. One is called the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tronelec. The mathematics of not-room includes a lot of rules about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour of tronelecs. In time Marvin realises that his exploration of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not-room can be done according to routine rules and he sets about a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systematic, exhaustive assay of the entire range of possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; button/display relationships.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything is going nicely but then one day a well known pattern does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occur the way it used to. After a while the old pattern resumes. The whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics of not-room is undermined. It takes a long time for Marvin to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construct a new model that accounts for the novel behaviour. A new entity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; called gytravi is needed. Then things settle down and routine systematic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exploration resumes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In time a massive collection of not-room entities and behavioural rules is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructed and begins to repeat itself. So much so that Marvin, after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; checking and rechecking, finds that the model seems to have stabilised.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At this point we stop to survey the situation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first thing to note is that the room is an empirically verified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physiologically accurate representation of the sensory circumstances of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human brain. Nervous activity effect/affect is replicated by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; buttons/displays and all signals are standardised. There are no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiential qualities (perceptual sensation qualities) associated with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this nervous activity. This is a physiologically verified, well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; established empirical fact. Indeed the room is a little too kind - If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discarded all the buttons and displays, then that is a more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physiologically accurate circumstance .
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main point is that this collection of totally sensationless signals is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly what is available to a human brain and through which all sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measurement arrives.  Consider the room without a Marvin in it. Based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what evidence is there any reason to even conceptualise the existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an external world? Nothing in that room gives any indication of it. There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no a-priori knowledge of not-room. No possible way to interpret any of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the signals. All there is is correlated behaviour - the behaviour of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; displays correlated with other displays and buttons, none of which have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any other discernable impact. The room is quintessentially a zombie in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense it has no experiential life at all despite being wired as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extravagently as a complete human.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Marvin thinks of himself as a scientist. Exactly what is he a scientist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of? His science is, he thinks, the science of 'not-room'. But is it? All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he has is a very sophisticated model of display/button correlations. His
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science is not about 'not-room' at all! His science is the science of room
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; display/buttons. He has absolutely no justification to any claim about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything going on anywhere else, although that is how Marvin thinks of it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; His science is very very predictive of button/display behaviour. As to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality of the model he has developed? He has no way of contextualising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any of the abstractions he has created with the actual state of affairs in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'not-room'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Absolutely anything could be out there driving the displays and Marvin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will never know. Indeed worse than that, there may be an infinite number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of different ways that not-room could present the same display values and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Marvin would never know. The display data is fundamentally, intrinsically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ambiguous. Even if the displays and buttons were nicely grouped and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; labeled all that would happen is that there would be expectations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related behaviours in a group, which Marvin does not have to name himself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It could even be named 'sight', 'sound' and so on and Marvin may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand what that might mean, but it delivers no claim to any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitive or unambiguous knowledge of not-room.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And that, fundamentally, is the real nub of the matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is outside the room? It doesn't really matter. It could be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elaborate multistory building with a ratsnest of electrical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interconnections done with a computer. It could be a control room in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; head of a giant robot. It could be literally wired up to a human body with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no brain. It could be a spaceship. None of that matters except in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; details. Marvin can never know because he has no experience available to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even imagine it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To finish off the room scenario we now take Marvin out of the room. In his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place we leave a machine that is based on his systematic scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour. It runs with clockwork and pneumatics from punched cards. None
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the displays are needed, none of the buttons are needed - they are all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directly connected to the new machine. The massively complex model marvin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has constructed, which has nothing whatever to do with 'not-room' except
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the most indirect of abstracted ways, goes on being verified and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occasionally amended using more rules for amending the model, also devised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by Marvin. The model can never say anything about any changes in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'not-room'. All it can sense is novel (unexpected according to the model)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour in the sensing displays, which is an entirely different thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main message to take from this is that this bizarre concoction is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary circumstance that would exist in a human if it weren't for what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal consciousness provides a human scientist.
