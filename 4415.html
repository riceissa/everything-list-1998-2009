Dear Tim, this writing is not about YOU, only addressed to your post. It is
<br />
about the topic of it. I have no argument with you, maybe you will have with
<br />
me.
<br />
<br />I try not to repeat all that was priorly quoted nor your added texts, they
<br />
all
<br />
are available on the list. 'Science' is a battlecry, disputed on several
<br />
lists (by several aspects of the particular lists) and I have not (yet) seen
<br />
a universal agreement (what an overstatement!) about a fitting
<br />
identification.
<br />
<br />This list - several years ago - took a free approach, alas lately more and
<br />
more conventional opinions slip in, regrettable for me, because I hold  that
<br />
the conventional &quot;science establishment&quot; holds feverishly to old addages,
<br />
acquired in times when the epistemic cognitive inventory was much less than
<br />
available today (which is much less than that of tomorrow). Even the &quot;topics
<br />
of the future&quot; build on ancient observations and their explanations
<br />
(formalism), in order to conform with the scientists' earlier books,
<br />
teachings, pupils, discussions.
<br />
In MOST cases the methodology works in practical ways, builds technology, up
<br />
to the point when &quot;understanding&quot; comes in. This is a many negated term,
<br />
many so called scientists satisfy themselves with practical results (for
<br />
tenure, awards, etc.)
<br />
Few researchers take the stance to &quot;free&quot; their mind from learned prejudice
<br />
and check the 'well composed' edifice of the scientific doctrines for
<br />
sustainability under the newly evolved vistas. There were several on this
<br />
list.
<br />
<br />Kuhn went to a considerable length, I would not guess if he 'wanted' to stay
<br />
within the acceptability of the scientific audience, or his time did not
<br />
ripen more segregation from the old 'paradigm' (as he said.)
<br />
Bohm went a pretty uninhibited way, exceeding the level of the decade in
<br />
which he developed the new ideas. Robert Rosen penetrated a field called
<br />
'complexity' (an inadequate word, we just don't know about a better one)
<br />
from his ideas within mathematical biology - what he stepped out from freely
<br />
(but was still impressed by the starting topics anyway, talking about
<br />
'live', cell, etc.).
<br />
<br />The new ideas were quickly absorbed into the existing formalistic mill -
<br />
calculative obsolescence and semantic impropriety,  which confused many.
<br />
New science is like Tao: who says &quot;I developed a theory within it&quot; does not
<br />
know what he talks about. Science is on the crossroad: (I wold not say
<br />
bifurcation, because I have negative arguments against this concept) and we
<br />
know only that something 'new' is in the dreams, we need more thinking
<br />
before we can identify &quot;what&quot;.
<br />
<br />Speaking of &quot;science&quot; usually means &quot;old science&quot;. This list started out to
<br />
serve the &quot;new science&quot;.
<br />
It woulod be a shame to slip back into the conventionalities.
<br />
&quot;Paradigm shift&quot; IMO is a &quot;mending&quot; of the old, not replacing it with new.
<br />
In every branch of te sciences there are the holy cows which must not  be
<br />
questioned - or the chorus will cry &quot;unscientific&quot;.
<br />
<br />The &quot;scientific process&quot; works pretty well in developing new variants in the
<br />
practical ways. It will preserve the ancient views.
<br />
As Eric wrote: &quot;...somehow loosy-goosy and unsatisfying&quot;.
<br />
<br />I am expecting a crucifixation.
