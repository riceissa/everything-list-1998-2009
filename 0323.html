</em><br />
<br />Perhaps you were too hasty to reject the idea. I think all of the problems
<br />
can be solved. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	First of all, I don't think a string can give rise to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.  It doesn't seem to have the right sort of structure.  To
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some degree it's a matter of personal intuition, and some people have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same kind of problem with computationalism as dealing only with math and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not being able to give rise to consciousness.  While I can convince myself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that a computation, with its decision making and counterfactuals, can do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the trick, I find it harder to believe that a mere string can.
</em><br />
<br />It's a central insight of computer science that any discrete structure can
<br />
be encoded as a binary string. You haven't told me what your definition of
<br />
&quot;a computation&quot; is yet, but if it is a discrete structure than it too can
<br />
be encoded as a binary string. Therefore the real question is not whether
<br />
a string can give rise to consciousness, but rather whether &quot;a
<br />
computation&quot; (whatever that means in this context) can give rise to
<br />
consciousness and whether a brain/AI state can give rise to consciousness. 
<br />
As far as I can see there is no reason why a brain/AI state cannot give
<br />
rise to consciousness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Second, I am not at all convinced that P1 would have the structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you mentioned.  The second part - finding the brain state - would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; require a huge amount of code.  It might be more efficient to create a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bunch of neural nets, let them interact and breed for a while, and print
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out their state once they show some sign of having evolved an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence, for example.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think that would work. The subroutine for recognizing intelligence
<br />
must itself be intelligent, otherwise you will only get a bunch of
<br />
neural nets that evolved/learned to fool the detection subroutine (for
<br />
example by spitting out nonsense sentences that are grammatically correct
<br />
or otherwise satisfies whatever criteria the detection subroutine is
<br />
checking).
<br />
<br />On the other hand the state extraction subroutine I mentioned is probably
<br />
shorter than you think. The first part of this subroutine would
<br />
contain the space-time coordinates of the computer running the AI, the
<br />
second part would use some simple pattern recognition to group the
<br />
subatomic particles in that space-time region into atoms, molecules, and
<br />
memory elements, then the third part would &quot;read&quot; the memory elements and
<br />
output the AI's state.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	I don't think that having larger memory elements would really make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the algorithm much shorter.  More important would be to have a regular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arrangement of memory elements - with the disturbing implication that an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; artificial digital intelligence would have much more measure than a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; messy human brain.  Perhaps our own experience then argues against the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposal.
</em><br />
<br />What makes you think messiness would make such a big difference? The state
<br />
extraction subroutine for a human brain should be very similar to the one
<br />
for the AI. After grouping the subatomic particles into neurons, it would
<br />
just output the neural-net structure and its current firing pattern.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Third, in order for such a distribution of strings to arise, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be the case that all of those programs are really in operation.  You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call it the 'a priori distribution', but in fact it is a nontrivial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distribution, and nature surely does not know all of that information - it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be calculated.  The true default distribution would be to just let
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each bit have an equal chance of being 0 or 1.  That being the case,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strings that arise during such calculations ought to also be able to give
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rise to consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />One justification for ignoring the intermediate strings that arise during
<br />
computation is that their distribution, unlike the distribution of the
<br />
final outputs, is highly dependent on the model of computation. Another
<br />
justification is to think of all of the computations as occuring in a
<br />
universe that doesn't end. Then all of the intermediate strings last for a
<br />
finite amount of time, whereas the final outputs last for eternity.
<br />
Therefore the intermediate strings contribute zero measure.
