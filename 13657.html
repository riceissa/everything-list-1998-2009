<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the 1-person.  It's non-pareil.  But, perhaps, the sort of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-pareil that just might emerge from participating in exquisite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complexities of self-relativity.
</em><br />
<br />MP: The way I deal with this, without magic but sometimes 
<br />
gasping in wonder, is to recognise that a 'quale' is _about_ 
<br />
something. BTW I never normally use the word because it is not 
<br />
plain-English; 'appearance' or 'perceptual quality [plus an 
<br />
example]' are what most people could relate to.
<br />
<br />I think the key insight needed here is that any item of 
<br />
consciousness, using those words flexibly but not too loosely, 
<br />
must relate something to someone. Depending on the 
<br />
sophistication of the 'someone', the something can be a part of 
<br />
his/her/its body or some abstract construct. For most of the 
<br />
time though the 'something' is a process, person or object in 
<br />
the world. ISTM that this necessarily entails that within the 
<br />
brain there is something which stands for the thing in the 
<br />
external world [or body part, abstract construct,etc], something 
<br />
which stands for 'self', and something which relates these two 
<br />
in a way which adequately deals with the actual real-world 
<br />
relationship between the thing and 'me'. How could it be otherwise?
<br />
<br />I think Stephan Lehar's cartoon epistemology series at
<br />
<a href="http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/">http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/</a>
<br />
deals very well with some of the truly practical questions like 
<br />
'how the hell does it work?'
<br />
For instance he shows how there IS a homunculus within the 
<br />
brain: the transduction device which drives the skeletal 
<br />
muscles. When I see it spelled out in plain-English with clear 
<br />
and simple diagrams like that I ask: How could it not be like that?
<br />
<br />Steve Lehar is quick to point out that he doesn't have lots of 
<br />
answers to how the 3D rendition of the environment occurs but as 
<br />
you point out Dave [I hope I am joining your dots correctly], 
<br />
the human brain uses lots and lots of 2D cortical surfaces to 
<br />
create 2D virtual surfaces which embody all the information that 
<br />
composes our experience of the world. I believe this is exactly 
<br />
right, and the connections between the surfaces, the 
<br />
synthesising or merger of the relevant analytical components, 
<br />
the 'binding' as they say, is by means of harmonic resonance. 
<br />
Cortical re-entrant signalling - between all the regions 
<br />
encoding momentarily relevant features of that which we are 
<br />
attending to - is synchronising, stabilising, and maintaining 
<br />
resonant mass action in a distributed topological structure. And 
<br />
we have to say that this structure EXISTS. Without this it is 
<br />
all voodoo and worse.
<br />
<br />A structure which exists in this manner can:
<br />
*	evoke characteristic consequences, and
<br />
*	prevent other things from happening, and
<br />
*	resist its dissolution by the rest of the brain until its task 
<br />
is fulfilled.
<br />
<br />The last little bit may sound a tad romantic but the first 
<br />
criterion of 'thingness' is that the thing resist its own 
<br />
destruction for long enough to be noticed.
<br />
<br />My favourite emblem [? or symbol?] for the dynamic complexity 
<br />
and robustness of this process is the lion stalking and then 
<br />
charging its prey. [Of course it could be any other predator] If 
<br />
you recollect documentaries your have seen, remember how the cat 
<br />
focuses its attention on the prey as it creeps closer. Then 
<br />
remember how the creature charges: its eyes never leave the 
<br />
target; the lion's brain has 'locked-on' to the prey. That brain 
<br />
based lock-on [the term comes from guided missile technology I 
<br />
believe] is a prerequisite for the eventual, climactic, _dental_ 
<br />
lock-on which will secure din dins for the cat.
<br />
&nbsp;From the time it starts charging, until the prey is within 
<br />
grasp of claws and teeth, the lion cannot take its eyes of the 
<br />
prey and cannot give heed to any distractions. It must navigate 
<br />
around or over obstacles, subordinating its body to the goal of 
<br />
reaching and capturing the target.
<br />
<br />There is a simplicity in the case of the lion which we have lost 
<br />
because of our use of words. Words allowed copied behaviours to 
<br />
take on an existence of their own and to replicate, and evolve, 
<br />
proliferating into a vast cultural matrix which controls and 
<br />
instantiates human life now as much as the genome does. But that 
<br />
is another storyline.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP:  The main reason for the word 'challenge' above is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; due to the way you were using the word 'sensing' for physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and chemical interactions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DN:  Yes, it's difficult to find terms that don't mislead somebody by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unintended implication.  Let's say that I believe it helps to reduce 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;physical and chemical interactions&quot; to the logic of 'self-relativity'.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why?  Because when we conceptually isolate 'entities' like molecules, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atoms, or even quarks or super-strings, the semantics we employ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implicitly depend on this 'primitive' logical concept.  A simple notion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that embodies this is a 'modulated continuum': continuum, because it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be seamless and symmetrical ( i.e. no 'voids'); modulated, because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nonetheless this symmetry must somehow be 'broken'.  If such 'broken 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seamlessness' has a flavour of paradox, there's something 'strangely' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unavoidable in that. But ISTM that most aspects of our ontology can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuited by building on (something like) the self-participation of such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a modulated continuum.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For me, the natural term for this participatory, self-directed, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symmetry-breaking is 'self-relativity'.  The cool thing about this, is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that narratives rooted in such participatory self-relation lend 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves quite interchangeably to 0, 1, or 3-person points-of-view.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IOW, whether you want to narrate in terms of (physical) 'action', or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (personal) 'sensing', or even (mathematical) 'operations', all can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuited as built on self-relation.  And the distinctive differences 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between such narratives are then reciprocal perspectives on that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-relativity.  This is why I used the term 'sense-action' as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'bridge' between the 'physical' and 'personal' reciprocals of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-relation. The empirical 'laws' we extract from the consistent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; features of these relations can in turn be intuited as inheriting from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the self-directedness of the original symmetry-breaking: this too, will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have 0, 1, and 3-person reciprocity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP:  OK, my 'the brain makes muscles move' is basically a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bulwark against 'panpsychism' or any other forms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mystery-making. The term I like is 'identity theory' but like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most labels it usually seems to provoke unproductive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digressions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DN:  Now does it seem possible to you that your notion of 'identity' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could be accomplished via 'sense-action' reciprocity?  IOW, that 'mind' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and 'brain' are reciprocal perspectives on the same structure of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-relations?  Panpsychism?  Well, brain's perspective is 'psych'; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psych's perspective is 'brain'. The 'pan' then depends on how you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; localise 'psych', and that is a horse of a very different colour.  ISTM, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very briefly, that 'psych', in the operational sense of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; highly-specific set of biospherically-evolved mechanisms for dealing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the environment, is anything but 'pan'.  How and 'where' does it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then arise?  Well, we know from this list alone that theories abound, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but nobody knows.  This of course won't restrain my speculations!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My take would be along the lines that the brain 'hosts' (deliberate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ambiguity) 'transduction' that 'renders' information spectrally on a set 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of virtual 'surfaces'.  Metaphorically it's a bit like the telly, (very) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; loosely, in that the transducer's job is to turn 'signal' into 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'message'.  But of course there's no-one watching: the 'surfaces' *are* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our 'personal worlds'.  Such surfaces are the 'medium' of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1-personal, and the 'messages' it mediates are '3-personal' (always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remembering that the medium *is* the message).  Also - crucially - the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'surfaces' are *interactive*: messages self-relate, recombine, get 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; re-transduced, and signal flows back into the environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, how the 'transduction-signal' relationship emerges out of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation, EM, chemistry, Bose-Einstein condensate, or GOK* what, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dunno.  But if we contemplate this participatively from a self-relating 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective, then we can narrate the story from either 'action' or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'sense' perspectives interchangeably.  IOW, things happen in (something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like) the 'action' narrative, participatively it feels (something like) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 'sense' narrative, and its 'intentionality' is (something like) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-directedness.  And all of this depends ultimately on self-relativity.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not  actually the world _of_ the appearances, many millions of years 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worth of natural selection pretty much guarantees that for all normal

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purposes what we see perceive is a very good accounting of what is there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DN:  Yes, I would say that the world 'behind' the appearances is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strangely-complex structure 'built' from a network of self-relations, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; narrated 0-personally; and the world_of_the appearances is that aspect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; narrated by a 3-personal message-layer mediated at 1-personal surfaces. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Globally we can intuit these as different 'takes' on self-relativity, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I guess together you could say they render a reasonable account,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taking into account the limitations of the accountants!

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the exclusion of the others.  You lose 'reciprocal perspective'.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently you can't avoid backing blindly into 'looking glassing':

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  Accepting broadly your summary up to this point...............
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  MP:  But I have to *challenge you to clarify* whether what I write
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  next really ties in completely with what you are thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  DN:  My seconds will call on you!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  MP:  Consciousness is something we know personally, and through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  discussion with others we come to believe that their experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  is very similar.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  DN:  OK, but If you push me, I would say that we 'emerge' into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  personal world, and through behavioural exchange with it, come to act
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  consistently as if this constitutes an 'external' environment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     including
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  a community of similar worlds. For a nascent individual, such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  world is initially 'bootstrapped' out of the environment, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  incrementally comes to incorporate communally-established recognition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  and explanatory consistencies that can also be extrapolated to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     embrace
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  a wider context beyond merely 'personal' worlds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     MP2: Yes! Well put.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  MP:  This can be summarised as 'The mind is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  what the brain does', at least insofar as 'consciousness' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  concerned, and the brain does it all in order to make the body's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  muscles move in the right way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  DN:  I would say that 'minds' and 'brains' are - in some as yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  not-fully-explicated way - parallel accounts of a seamless causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  network embracing individuals and their environment.  Depending on how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  this is schematised, it may or may not be possible to fully correlate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  top-down-personal and bottom-up-physical accounts.  Nonetheless, ISTM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  more natural to ascribe intentionality to the individual in terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  environment, rather than 'the brain getting the body's muscles to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     move'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  - i.e. &quot;I move my hand&quot; runs in parallel with a physical account
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  involving the biology and physics of brain and body, but both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     ultimately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  supervene on a common 'primitive' explanatory base.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     MP2: OK, my 'the brain makes muscles move' is basically a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     bulwark against 'panpsychism' or any other forms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     mystery-making. The term I like is 'identity theory' but like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     most labels it usually seems to provoke unproductive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     digressions. The main reason for the word 'challenge' above is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     due to the way you were using the word 'sensing' for physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     and chemical interactions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I would use 'connection' with effects: action and reaction which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     include attraction and repulsion. So I would say effects' rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     than aff'ect [ie stress is on first syllable] but here, as with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     everything to do with affect and emotion, common English usage
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     is not helpful [similarly to the way 'love' in English
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     translations of the New Testament is used to translate at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     four more precise words of the original Greek].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     NB: I don't use the word 'supervene'. To me it always gives the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     impression that something like a coat of paint is being referred
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     to. 'Identity' does for me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  MP:  The answer is that the brain is structured so that behaviours -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  potentially a million or more human behaviours of all sorts - can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  *stored* within the brain. This storage, using the word in a wide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     sense,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  is actually changes to the fine structures within the brain [synapses,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  dendrite location, tags on DNA, etc] which result in [relatively]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  discrete, repeatable patterns of neuronal network activity occurring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  which function as sequences of muscle activation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  ...........&lt;snip&gt;.........
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  Behaviours, once learned, become habitual i.e. they are evoked by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  appropriate circumstances and proceed in the manner learned unless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  varied by on-going review and adjustment. Where the habitual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     behavioural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  response is completely appropriate, we are barely conscious of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  activity; we only pay attention to novelties and challenges - be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     they in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  the distant environment, our close surroundings, or internal to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     our own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  bodies and minds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  DN:  Your account reads quite cogently, and we may well agree to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     discuss
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  the issues in this way, but crucially ISTM that our accounts are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  oriented towards particular explanatory outcomes - which is why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     one size
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  doesn't fit all.  So let's see if this shoe fits............
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     MP2: Well, as someone for whom 'standard' means if the collar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     fits then the cuffs button round my finger tips ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     one size will never 'fit all' but diversity is good in company
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     with toleration and healthy scepticism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I am always keen to point out that we humans are always beset
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     with a paradox, which _can_ be seen as a kind of duality. What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     it amounts to is that we live in a real world, but we live by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     means of a description. That is to say, all our knowledge _of_
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the world is embodied in qualia which are _about_ the world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     They are our brains' method of accounting for things. Naive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     realism is how we are when we 'mistake' qualia for the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     they represent. But they exist, and that is a key point. So is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the fact that, even if the world 'behind' the appearances is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     actually the world _of_ the appearances, many millions of years
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     worth of natural selection pretty much guarantees that for all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     normal purposes what we see perceive is a very good accounting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     of what is there. The fun really starts when we de-construct the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     ways in which we see other people and social groups.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I am not sure if my formulation actually ties in with Colin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Hales's schema, but it agrees on many key points.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  MP:  I have put this description in terms of 'behaviours' because I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  am practising how to deal with the jibes and stonewalling of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  someone who countenance only 'behavioural analysis'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  descriptions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  DN:  Ahah....  I confess I've had a little peek at your dialogues
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  certain individual on another forum, and I think I discern your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     purpose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  and your problem.  All I can say is that we conduct the dialogue a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  little less fractiously on this list.   For what it's worth, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  wouldn't expend much more effort on someone with so entrenched a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  position and so vitriolic a vocabulary. &lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     MP2: Yes, I believe that person's approach to communication has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     in fact wasted all manner of good opportunities to sort out the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     agreements and congruence between behavioural analysis so-called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     and the descriptions arising from other methods of study. I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     trying to formulate a summary of how I see behavioural analysis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     descriptions fitting in with 'representational' descriptions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     brain and mind. One major hurdle is how to engage with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     behaviourist view that pretty much all behaviour is just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     response to the external environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I am trying to show how the stimuli from the external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     environment come to be internalised in the form of patterns of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     brain activity which become surrogates for the original stimuli.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     This works in several different ways and in different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     directions. For example the behaviour of others becomes part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the structure of one's world. An example of this would be where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     in a military organisation the complete obedience of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     subordinates becomes an integral feature of an officer's world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Raw behaviourist language cannot easily and effectively describe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     all that is going on because in effect the officers' environment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     is made up of subordinates' behaviours. There is at least one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     behaviourist out there who cannot cope with the fact that his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     theories have no way of describing WHERE part of the officers'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     world - which is clearly visible - actually IS. I have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     descriptive scheme outlined on some of the pages of my little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     website which deals with it quite succinctly, but that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     another story.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;  Best of luck

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     David,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     We have reached some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     understanding in the 'asifism' thread, and I would summarise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     that, tilted towards the context of this line of this thread,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     more or less as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     follows.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     Existence -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     *       The irreducible primitive is existence per se;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     *       that we can know about this implies differentiation in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     and of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     that which exists;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     *       that we can recognise both invariance and changes and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     participate in what goes on implies _connection_.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     I am sure there must be mathematical/logical formalism which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     could render that with exquisite clarity, but I don't know how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     to do it. Plain-English is what I have to settle for [and aspire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     to :-]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     There are a couple of issues that won't go away though: our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     experience is always paradoxical, and we will always have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     struggle to communicate about it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     Paradox or illusion -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     I think people use the word 'illusion' about our subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     experience of being here now because they don't want to see it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     as paradoxical. However AFAICS, the recursive self-referencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     entailed in being aware of being here now guarantees that what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     we are aware of at any given moment, i.e. what we can attend to,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     can never be the totality of what is going on in our brains. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     terms of mind, some of it - indeed probably the majority - is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     unconscious. We normally are not aware of this. [Duh, that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     what unconscious means Mark!] But sometimes we can become aware
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     [acutely!]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     of having _just been_ operating unconsciously and this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     salutary, once the sickening embarrassment subsides anyway :-0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     For those of us who have become familiar with this issue it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     no hardship but there are many who resist the idea. The least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     mortifying example that is _easy to see in oneself_ is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     happens when we look for something and then find it: before we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     find it the thing is 'not there' for us, except that we might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     believe that it is really. Then we find it; the thing just pops
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     into view! As mundane as mould on cheese, but bloody marvellous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     as soon as you start thinking about how it all works!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     But I have to *challenge you to clarify* whether what I write
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     next really ties in completely with what you are thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     I'll try it in point form for brevity's sake.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     Behaviour and consciousness -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     *       Consciousness is something we know personally, and through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     discussion with others we come to believe that their experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     is very similar.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     *       Good scientific evidence and moderately sceptical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     common sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     tell us is this experience is _intimately and exclusively_ bound
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     up with the activity of our brains. Ie the experience - the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     conscious awareness of the moment as well as the simultaneous or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     preliminary non-conscious activity - is basically what the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     does, give or take a whole range of hormonal controls of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     rest of the organism. This can be summarised as 'The mind is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     what the brain does', at least insofar as 'consciousness' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     concerned, and the brain does it all in order to make the body's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     muscles move in the right way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     *       People's misunderstanding about how we are conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     centre around how mere meat could 'have' this experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     *       The answer is that the brain is structured so that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     behaviours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     - potentially a million or more human behaviours of all sorts -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     can be *stored* within the brain. This storage, using the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     in a wide sense, is actually changes to the fine structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     within the brain [synapses, dendrite location, tags on DNA, etc]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     which result in [relatively] discrete, repeatable patterns of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     neuronal network activity occurring which function as sequences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     of muscle activation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     *       For practical purposes behaviours usually involve muscles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     moving body parts appropriately. [If muscles don't move, nobody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     else can be sure if anything is going on]. However, within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     human brain, learning also entails the formation of neuronal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     network activity patterns which become surrogates for or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     alternatives to overtly visible behaviours. Likewise the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     completely internal detection of such surrogate activities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     becomes a kind of surrogate for perception of one's own overt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     behaviours or for perception of external world activities which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     would result from one's own actions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     *       Useful and effective response and adaptation to the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     requires the review of appropriateness of one's overt behaviour
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     and to be able to adjust or completely change one's behaviours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     both at very short notice and over arbitrarily long periods
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     depending on the duration of the effects of one's actions. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     entails responding to one's own behaviours over whatever time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     scale is necessary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     *       Behaviours, once learned, become habitual i.e. they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     evoked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     by appropriate circumstances and proceed in the manner learned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     unless varied by on-going review and adjustment. Where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     habitual behavioural response is completely appropriate, we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     barely conscious of the activity; we only pay attention to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     novelties and challenges - be they in the distant environment,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     our close surroundings, or internal to our own bodies and minds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     Who? -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     *       The concept of responding to one's own responses being the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     basis of consciousness causes some to complain that this implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     some kind of infinite regress of observers. What actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     happens is that internal brain behaviours [discrete network
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     activations] occur as surrogates for all the relevant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     environmental features of interest, including one's own body and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     the storyline we are following. Where surrogates for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     environmental features are linked in with surrogates for 'self'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     [body and storyline] and with network activations that stand for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     relationships between those features of environment and self,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     THAT, moment by moment, is something which exists. So there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     'something it is LIKE something to be' and that is what it is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     The registration of novelty and the responses to it, reviewed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     ceaseless recursive cycles, gives us the basis of subjective time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     I have put this description in terms of 'behaviours' because I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     am practising how to deal with the jibes and stonewalling of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     someone who countenance only 'behavioural analysis'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     descriptions. I am happier recognising that most internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     behaviours can be called 'representations' - it is much more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;     succinct.
