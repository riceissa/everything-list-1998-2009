  </blockquote>
Actually I do think like Quentin. I don't think you can *know*
anything if you are not conscious. Knowing is a sort of truth
awareness, albeit incommunicable as such. <br>
</blockquote>
By "knowing" I mean the same thing as when you say that a computer
"knows" what are the countries in Europa if you ask the computer: "What
are the countries in Europa?", and the computer answers: "Sweden,
Norway, Denmark, Finland, ...".&nbsp; I mean nothing more with the term
"know" than just this, you have some data stored, and you can use this
data in some way.&nbsp; "Knowing" &lt;===&gt; "Using knowledge".<br>

the existence of the consciousness? <br>
  </blockquote>
An eliminativist. <br>
(But I don't understand what you mean by "persons like me", which is a
first person notion in need of some implicit notion of consciousness). <br>
</blockquote>
You can look at me as a computer that behave as if it has
consciousness.&nbsp; And I am referring to other persons behaving like me...<br>

 type="cite"> In some country, until rather recently, some doctor did
operate babies
without anesthesia, because they did believe that baby are not
conscious. Now, they have changed their mind, and babies are treated
by surgeon with anesthesia. Does this controverse makes sense for
someone who deny totally the existence of consciousness? <br>
</blockquote>
The important thing in this situation is if the pain center in the
brain is stimulated or not.&nbsp; When you operate babies (or animals)
without anesthesia, then surely the pain center is stimulated, so that
is definitely wrong.<br>

  <blockquote> (I also deny the existence of infinity...) <br>
  </blockquote>
If you deny only what is called in the literature the "actual
infinite", that is the idea of a close and well defined infinite
entity or set, then you could be an intuitionist, or a finitist, or a
computationalist. What I call "comp", or digital mechanism, is called
"finitism" by Judson Webb (ref in my thesis or any of my papers). <br>
</blockquote>
I deny the "actual infinte".&nbsp; It is impossible to construct an infinite
set, a set where you have a mapping from every element to a true subset.<br>
<blockquote cite="mid2ab1a749768ea91a3dd37440a0f43a1a.domain.name.hidden"
 type="cite"> If you deny the potential infinite as well, (that is the
idea that
some set can be generated forever although not in any actual form,
like when se say: {1, 2, 3 *ETC*}, then you belong to the few who are
"ultrafinitist". I don't believe that the very notion of
ultrafinitism could be defined in any ultrafinitist way, unless you
are materialist and physicalist, meaning that when you say that you
don't believe in infinity, you really are only saying that you don't
believe in *primary physical* infinities. Note that by UDA, comp or
finitism entails there are no physical primary entities at all,
neither finite nor infinite. <br>
</blockquote>
I accept a sort of "unlimitness".&nbsp; If you have a set of numbers, you
can
always increase that set by adding 1 to the biggest number in the set,
and then add this new number to the set.&nbsp; And you can do this as many
times as you want.&nbsp; But the new, increased, set will always be finite,
independant of how many times you add new numbers to the set, you will
never reach an infinite set.<br>
<br>
If you have the set of ALL natural numbers, then there is always a
biggest number in that set, and you can always create a new natural
number that is not member of the set of ALL natural numbers, by adding
1 to the biggest number in the set.<br>
