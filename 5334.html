<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Planet of the apes?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Greetings Mike,
<br />
<br />This post I made on a parallell thread (but not in a parrallell universe -I
<br />
think) speaks to your concerns here (I think):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; People 'want' to do what they are conditioned to do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our behavior is not 'hard wired'. Otherwise, how did I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolve to sit here and type at a computer?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Agreed. In fact nothing in your reply (or in Pinker's literature) is in
<br />
conflict with my post, aside from your apparent implication that human
<br />
culture is a entirely unique phenom w/o precedent in our biosphere.
<br />
&quot;Hardwired&quot; is your term not mine. Indeed, not even bonobos are the
<br />
&quot;mindless&quot; slaves of rigid instinct, but learn new behaviors.and even teach
<br />
others. They have their own memes, and those memes, like the organisms that
<br />
form them, are different in some order of complexity from ours and us. But,
<br />
again, not different in kind, IMHO. More complex? yes; emergent?, yes; of a
<br />
different set of things, decidedly not.
<br />
<br />Chimps did not &quot;evolve&quot; to fish termites out of a mound either, they devise
<br />
it via empirical method, then teach it to others. Culture.
<br />
<br />To meet your &quot;hard-wired&quot; criteria, one would logically have to restrict
<br />
ethology and ecology to groups at the neurological/behavioral level of the
<br />
insects (though I would argue that the distributed &quot;swarm&quot; intelligence of
<br />
the eusocials can be seen an emergent phenom greater than the constituent
<br />
sum &quot;brain power&quot;).
<br />
<br />Yes our symbolic language was and is the key to much of our resultant
<br />
culture, and that language is the emergent result of our emergent evermore
<br />
interconnected brain etc.. But that complexity does not render in
<br />
uninterpretable in the contexts that interpret less complex forms. Ethology,
<br />
ecology and evolutionary theory are plenty robust and extensible enough for
<br />
the job.
<br />
<br />Interestingly this reminds me a bit of the EO Wilson / SJ Gould embroglio.
<br />
The nature &quot;hard-wireds&quot; vs the nurture &quot;clean-slaters&quot;. What is interesting
<br />
about it is that neither giant in their fields really saw things in the
<br />
simplistic way that their position was portrayed, judging by each man's
<br />
subsequent writings in any case. For myself, I think that they were, and
<br />
are, both correct, and that both views are robust enough to integrate and
<br />
compliment the other. As is so often the case in life, the &quot;truth&quot; lies
<br />
somewhere between two opposing views (even if when deconstructed, the two
<br />
views aren't all that oppositional).
<br />
<br />Wilson's epi-genetics presaged dawkin's memes and Gould's spandrels evoke
<br />
the emergent, self-organized systems that are the &quot;order for free&quot; provided
<br />
by universal evolutionary processes in open systems. Memes are emergent,
<br />
self organized adaptive systems but are also constrained and/or amplified by
<br />
&quot;selective&quot; processes in feedback loops on the same, and on other, scales in
<br />
a hierarchy.
<br />
<br />But, in the end, this is like the NAO/ global warming issue of a prior post.
<br />
I doubt  I'd ever convince you that we're in the end naked apes that have
<br />
taken to fancy ways. I predict that you'll never convincingly argue to me
<br />
that we're not. I believe Diamond's correct that we are in fact the third
<br />
chimp and that's quite alright by me. I think we're in fine company, judging
<br />
by how they treat their home in contrast to how we treat ours. And if
<br />
somewhere in all possible universes there does exist a &quot;planet of the apes&quot;,
<br />
let us hope that they're doing a better job of running things than us. It
<br />
wouldn't be hard, I imagine.

<br />Peace
