Hi Russell,
<br />
<br />I got your book. Congratulation for that very nice introduction to the 
<br />
subject and to your ideas. It is a very gentle and lovely book.
<br />
Probably because you are to kind to your audience, it seems to me you 
<br />
have sacrifice perhaps a bit of rigor. I am still not sure about your 
<br />
most basic assumption, but I see we share a big amount of the 
<br />
philosophy.
<br />
I am already glad you did take into account 1/5 of my earlier remarks, 
<br />
I wish you at least five next editions ;-).
<br />
To be honest I don't think you really get the comp idea, and it is a 
<br />
good think your work does not really rely on it. Now I will not hide 
<br />
the pleasure I have when seeing the 8 hypostases (even the sixteen 
<br />
one!) sum up through their modal logic in table 71 page 129.
<br />
I will neither repeat my olds comments nor make new one, but hope our 
<br />
future discussion will give opportunities to clarify the possible 
<br />
misunderstandings and relationship between our approaches.
<br />
<br />I let you know that I will be very busy from now until end of october, 
<br />
so that I will be more slow for the comments' replies (or more grave 
<br />
for the spelling mistakes if that is possible).
<br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Le 23-sept.-06, ˆ 07:01, Russell Standish a Žcrit :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Anything provable by a finite set of axioms is necessarily a finite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; string of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; symbols, and can be found as a subset of my Nothing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You told us that your Nothing contains all strings. So it contains all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; formula as &quot;theorems&quot;. But a theory which contains all formulas as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theorems is inconsistent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am afraid you confuse some object level (the strings) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theory-level (the theorems about the strings).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, I was wondering if you were making this confusion, owing to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ontological status you give mathematical statements. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nothing, if interpreted in its entirety,
</em><br />
<br /><br />This can make sense only if you tell us how to interpret a string or 
<br />
how you interpret the Nothing, I mean formally.
<br />
&nbsp;From this I infer that your nothing is an informal theory of infinite 
<br />
strings.
<br />
Also I give only ontological status to object in the scope of an 
<br />
arithmetical existential statement. For example I do believe in the 
<br />
existence of prime numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be inconsistent, of course.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Only a theory can be inconsistent. But I don't see a theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasoning about it need not be, and certainly I would be grateful for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyone pointing out inconsistencies in my writing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is why I would insist to be as clear as possible so that the 
<br />
inconsistencies are more easy to find.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Perhaps the exchange is unfair because I react as a &quot;professional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; logician&quot;, and you try to convey something informally. But I think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; at some point, in our difficult subject, we need to be entirely clear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on what we assume or not especially if you are using formal objects,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; like strings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not that informal. What I talk about are mathematical objects, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one can use mathematical reasoning.
</em><br />
<br />The formal/informal distinguo has nothing to do with the 
<br />
mathematical/non-mathematical distinguo. Nor with 
<br />
rigorous/non-rigorous.
<br />
<br />100 % of mathematics, including mathematical logic is informal. Now, 
<br />
logicians studied &quot;formal theories&quot; or &quot;machines&quot; because it is what 
<br />
they are studying. But they prove things about &quot;formal systems&quot; in an 
<br />
informal way like any scientist.
<br />
In some context formal and informal are relative.
<br />
Of course a description of a formal system looks formal, but we reason 
<br />
*about* those formal systems. Now, if your strings are all there is, I 
<br />
wait for an explanation of what those strings does &quot;formally&quot;, but I am 
<br />
not asking to formalize your reasoning in your string-language, unless 
<br />
for illustrative purpose in case you want to illustrate how a string 
<br />
interprets something. Like we can explain how a brain or more simply 
<br />
how a turing machine can interpret some data. To be sure, given that 
<br />
your strings are infinite I have no clue how the strings can interpret 
<br />
things.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I should note that the PROJECTION postulate is implicit in your UDA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; when you come to speak of the 1-3 distinction. I don't think it can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; derived explicitly from the three &quot;legs&quot; of COMP.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm afraid your are confusing the UDA, which is an informal (but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rigorous) argument showing that IF I am &quot;digitalisable&quot; machine, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physics  or the &quot;laws of Nature&quot; emerge and are derivable from number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theory, and the translation of UDA in arithmetic, alias the interview
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of a universal chatty machine. The UDA is a &quot;reductio ad absurdo&quot;.  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assumes explicitly consciousness (or folk psychology or grandma
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; psychology as I use those terms in the SANE paper) and a primitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical universe. With this, the 1-3 distinction follows from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that if am copied at the correct level, the two copies cannot know the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; existence of each other and their personal discourse will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; differentiate. This is an &quot;illusion&quot; of projection like the wave 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; packet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *reduction* is an &quot;illusion&quot; in Everett theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fair enough, the &quot;Yes Doctor&quot; is sufficiently informal that perhaps it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contains the seeds of the PROJECTION postulate. When we come to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion of the W-M experiment, there are 3 possible outcomes:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) We no longer experience anything after annihilation at Brussels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    (contradicts YD)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) We experience being both in Moscow and Washington simulteously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    (kinda weird, and we dismiss as a reductio, but could also be seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    as contradicting PROJECTION)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) We experience being in one of Moscow or Washington, but not both,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    and cannot predict which.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've noticed a few people on this list arguing that 2) is a possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outcome -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably as devil's advocates.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Really? I thought only Chalmers does that. Do you know someone else?
<br />
Lee Corbin was apparently doing that, but when I insisted on the 1/3 
<br />
distinction, Lee did eventually admit he could not predict its 
<br />
immediate future *first person* experience: the comp 1-person 
<br />
indeterminacy (casr &quot;3)&quot; above). OK Lee, if you are still there?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That would certainly be eliminated by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something like the PROJECTION postulate.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Honestly I feel it not being necessary, for the same reason the 
<br />
collapse is not necessary in QM.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The UDA reasoning is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simple and the conclusion is that there is no primitive physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe or comp is false. Physics emerges then intuitively from just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;immaterial dreams&quot; with subtle overlappings. The UDA does not need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be formalized to become rigorous. But having that UDA-result, we have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thoroughly precise way to extract physics (and all the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hypostases) from the universal interview. For *this* we need to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; entirely specific and formal. That is why in *all* my papers (on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; subject) I never separate UDA from the lobian interview. This is hard:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would not have succeed without Godel, Lob and other incompleteness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theorems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I have a problem with your way of talking because you are mixing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; informal talk with formal object (like the strings). Like when you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; write:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; The Nothing itself does not have any properties in itself to speak
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of. Rather it is the PROJECTION postulate that means we can treat it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; as the set of all strings, from which any conscious viewpoint must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; correspond to a subset of strings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It looks like a mixing of UDA and the lobian UDA. It is too much fuzzy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm sure you know about mathematical modelling right? Consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modelling populations of rabbits and foxes with Lotka-Volterra
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equations. The real system differs from the equations in a myriad of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ways - there are many effects like drought, the fact that these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; animals breed sexually etc. that aren't represented in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equations. Nevertheless, the two systems, formal LV equations, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; informal real fox/rabbit system will behave concordantly provided the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems stay within certain limits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this case, I would say the &quot;Nothing&quot; is an informal concept, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the set of all strings (U say) is a formal concept that models it.
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would go further and say that whatever we observe, whatever we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construct, corresponds to that subset of U whose elements mean (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describe) what we observe etc. This is the PROJECTION postulate.
</em><br />
<br /><br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also an act of faith that this model is the best we can possibly do as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious observers,
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; so that this model is a candidate for a Theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything (or Theory of Nothing). Ultimately, one hopes for testable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predictions, and indeed there do appear to be predictions of sorts,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; although whether these are empirically verifiable is another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter. Obviously, there are a number of other seemingly reasonable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptions (which I have tried with utmost care to extract as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; postulates) needed to connect the dots. So empirical falsification
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will not necessarily bring down the entire ediface, but would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly lead to some interesting insights.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I hope your book will help me to figure out what you say.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Are you saying that your Nothing is the topological line? Again it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not nothing (or it is very confusing to call it nothing), and what you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intend will depend on your axiomatization of it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is the set of all infinite length strings (in some alphabet). There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a probability measure defined on infinite subsets - this would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough to show that the measure of the subset 1* (for binary strings)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is 0.5 and so on.
</em><br />
<br /><br />What is 1*, is it  &quot;1111111111...&quot; why 1/2?
<br />
Is it &quot;1&quot; follow by any strings. Then OK, for some measure.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Looks like a topological line, but would need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; check the axioms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is &quot;Nothing&quot;, because of the modelling relation, and the insistence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that all we can know of anything comes in the form of strings.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Is that a new postulate? Why &quot;Nothing&quot; ?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If you stay in first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; order logic, this will give an even weaker theory than the theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; finite strings: you will no more be able to prove the existence of any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; integer, or if you take a second order logic presentation of it, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your &quot;nothing&quot; will contain much more than what the ontic comp toes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; needs, and this is still much more than &quot;nothing&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This comment sounds like it is coming from arithmetic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realism. Theories about something, don't have to be the something.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Indeed, but a theory of everything should, in some sense (by definition 
<br />
of everything). If you have only infinite string in the ontology, I 
<br />
guess you have to modelize the observers by an infinite string, or by 
<br />
something you can derive from the set of infinite strings, and you have 
<br />
to explain how you make the derivation, and how those observer will 
<br />
converge on your theory, or explain why they diverge from it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can use whatever mode of logical reasoning one is comfortable with -
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sure, but in front of unclarity or conceptual problems we should be 
<br />
able to say which logic we use, even informally, like with or without 
<br />
excluded-middle, or with or without some infinity axiom, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; the onotological status is simply given by the modelling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation.
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When I say &quot;The set of all strings (or descriptions)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists&quot;, I am making an ontological statement.
</em><br />
<br />Indeed, you are saying that set (of real numbers) exists. I guess you 
<br />
presuppose some set theory? It is different to say &quot;all strings exist&quot; 
<br />
and &quot;the set of all string exists&quot;. Again, in some informal reasoning 
<br />
to make that difference explicit would be falling in the 1004 fallacy, 
<br />
but if you say the strings are the fundamental object, then if you talk 
<br />
on that set you have to explain in which sense that set is a string.
<br />
To my knowledge only the UD does that effectively. In a frame with 
<br />
infinite objects, some non effective way has been given but it always 
<br />
lead toward very difficult mathematics (ZF + axiom of anti-foundation 
<br />
like Stephen appreciates, or NF + universal sets (NF = Quine's new 
<br />
foundation; nobody know really if NF is consistent).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When one shows that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads to Occams razor, one is doing logic, not ontology.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Are you really saying that Occam follows from your string &quot;theory&quot;?
<br />
Also you could perhaps use &quot;stream&quot; instead of &quot;string&quot;, to prevent 
<br />
confusion with the use of string by physicist, and also because for 
<br />
many computer scientist strings (of characters) are supposed to be 
<br />
finite. Just a little suggestion.

<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To be franc I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; astonished you want already infinite objects at the ontological level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If *all* infinite strings are in the ontology, that could be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; departure from comp (and that would be interesting because, by UDA,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that would make your theory predicting a different physics and then we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could test it (at least in principle), and only when your theory will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be precise enough.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not convinced it is a departure from COMP, but as you say it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be interesting if true. Can you elaborate further on your reasons,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps saying which infinite strings cannot be found in UD* for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I could elaborate a lot about the vagueness of the notion of &quot;finding&quot; 
<br />
something in the UD* (the infinite complete running of the UD).
<br />
I could ask &quot;finding by who?&quot;, from inside? from the terrestrial 
<br />
(verifiable) view or the divine one (true but non verifiable)?, from 
<br />
which x-person point of view? Etc.
<br />
Given that the UD cannot not dovetail on all the reals, there is a 
<br />
sense in saying all the infinite strings are generated, but this gives 
<br />
a noisy background first person machine have to live with. The UD is 
<br />
not equivalent with &quot;all infinite strings&quot;, the UD* is a static given 
<br />
of all computations. Those computations can be represented by very 
<br />
peculiar finite and infinite strings together with a non trivial 
<br />
structure inherited from computer science/number theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I though your ontic TOE (the strings) was similar to RA, but I guess I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; was wrong, so I am less sure I understand what you try to do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say it is more like assuming that UD* exists, whilst remaining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; silent on the topic of whether a universal dovetailer exists, or even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the prerequisites such as AR or the CT thesis.
</em><br />
<br /><br />What could &quot;UD* mean, without CT? If you don't use CT, you have to give 
<br />
at least one precise universal machine (or sigma1 complete theory).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, a certain amount of this is taste - assuming that UD* is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identical to the set of all infinite length strings (which your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; previous comments have given doubt).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Either you presuppose the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of some simple program,
</em><br />
<br />I do!  The S and K combinators for example. Or the axioms of RA, or any 
<br />
Universal Diophantine Equation. I do presuppose the notion of universal 
<br />
machine. That is what CT is all about.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or you note as I do that the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strings is the simplest possible object (by definition of simplicity).
</em><br />
<br /><br />An infinite set of infinite objects ? Including obviously some 
<br />
structure on it, if only to give sense to your projection postulate, I 
<br />
am not sure this is simple. I can miss something of course, but it 
<br />
seems to me your theory, if we assume comp,  will be more or less 
<br />
equivalent to a simple infinite iteration of the WM duplication 
<br />
experiment, on which the natural comp &quot;projection&quot; leads to noise. So I 
<br />
guess your theory is complementary to comp instead. UD* is a far more 
<br />
sophisticate mathematical structure than a real topological line. Its 
<br />
sophisticateness, if I may say, comes from the non triviality of 
<br />
computer science, of the Fi and the Wi, for example,  through the many 
<br />
incompleteness phenomena, and it is that highly structured complexity 
<br />
which gives rise to highly non trivial internal n-person views (the 
<br />
hypostases and their logical multiverses).
