<br />He doesn't know whether he is Alice or Bob, but he does know that his
<br />
payoff only depends on his own action. &quot;Bob has a Bayesian probability of
<br />
affecting Alice&quot; is true in the sense that Bob doesn't know whether he is
<br />
Alice or Bob, so he doesn't know whether his action is going to affect
<br />
Alice or Bob, but that doesn't matter if he cares about himself no matter
<br />
who he is, rather than either Alice or Bob by name.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     You are correct as far as him thinking he is more likely to be in round 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2.  However, you are wrong to think he will push button 1.  It is much the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same as with the Bob and Alice example:
</em><br />
<br />You said that in the Bob and Alice example, they would push button 1 if
<br />
they were selfish, which I'm assuming that they are, and you said that the
<br />
seeming paradox is actually a result of game theory (hence the above
<br />
discussion). But in this example you're saying that the participant would 
<br />
push button 2. How is that the same?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     He thinks he is only 1/101 likely to be in round 1.  However, he also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knows that if he _is_ in round 1, the effect of his actions will be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; magnified 100-fold.  Thus he will push button 2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     You might see this better by thinking of measure as the # of copies of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; him in operation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     If he is in round 1, there is 1 copy operating.  The decision that copy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes will affect the fate of all 100 copies of him.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     If he is in round 2, all 100 copies are running.  Thus any one copy of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; him will effectively only decide its own fate and not that of its 99 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brothers.
</em><br />
<br />That actually illustrates my point, which is that the measure of oneself
<br />
is irrelevant to decision making. It's really the magnitude of the effect
<br />
of the decision that is relevant. You say that the participant should
<br />
think &quot;I'm more likely to be in round 2, but if I were in round 1 my
<br />
decision would have a greater effect.&quot; I suggest that he instead think
<br />
&quot;I'm in both round 1 and round 2, and I should give equal
<br />
consideration to the effects of my decision in both rounds.&quot;
<br />
<br />This way, we can make decisions without reference to the measure of
<br />
conscious thoughts (unless you choose to consider it as part of your
<br />
utility function), and we do not need to have a theory of consciousness,
<br />
which at least involves solving the implementation problem (or in my own
<br />
proposal where static bit strings can be conscious, the analogous
<br />
interpretation problem).
