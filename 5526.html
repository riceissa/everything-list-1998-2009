<br />
I'm a layperson fascinated with quantum mechanics and the MWI, and have
<br />
reached a point where to obtain a better understanding of the
<br />
qualitative descriptions (universes &quot;splitting&quot;, &quot;measure of a
<br />
universe&quot;, etc.) I must learn the mathematical formalism.  It appears
<br />
that the popular descriptions of MWI use very loose terminology, and I
<br />
suspect much has been lost in translation.
<br />
<br />Digging through online sources such as MathWorld, Wikipedia, and
<br />
CiteSeer, as well as reviving painful memories of matrix algebra from
<br />
university (CS), I think I've learned enough to be dangerous.  Below is
<br />
a set of (possibly incorrect) statements and questions I have.
<br />
<br />-=-=-=-
<br />
<br />Let |phi&gt; represent the quantum mechanical state of a system S as a
<br />
vector in Hilbert space.  The state is determined by the angle of the
<br />
vector, not it's length.  So any state multiplied by a constant is the
<br />
same physical state of the system. (Correct? Is this by decree or does
<br />
it fall out of something more fundamental?)
<br />
<br />Let A represent a Hermitian operator corresponding to some observable of
<br />
the system S
<br />
<br />Let {l} represent the set of eigenvalues for operator A such that
<br />
<br />A|phi&gt; = l|phi&gt;
<br />
<br />And finally:
<br />
<br />{|An&gt;} is the set of eigenvectors for operator A corresponding to {l}
<br />
<br />This set of eigenvectors (if I understand correctly) form an orthonormal
<br />
basis for the possible states of S, such that if S is in a state phi
<br />
which is not an eigenvector of observable A, it may be represented as a
<br />
linear combination of such eigenvectors:
<br />
<br />(1)  |phi&gt; = c1|A1&gt; + c2|A2&gt; + ... + cn|An&gt;
<br />
<br />In the case where |phi&gt; is indeed an eigenvector of A, then one of the
<br />
constants cn is 1 while the remainder are 0.
<br />
<br />So far so good (I hope.)  Here are my questions:
<br />
<br />A) What is the physical meaning of equation (1) above?  Is this what is
<br />
meant when a system is described as being in a &quot;superposition&quot; of states
<br />
that are measured by A?  Is &quot;superposition&quot; the accepted term in the MWI
<br />
or is there another?
<br />
<br />B) In the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI), the collapse postulate states
<br />
that (somehow) as a result of a measurement, |phi&gt; actually changes to
<br />
one of {|An&gt;} with a probability related to {cn}, though I'm not sure of
<br />
the particulars.  How do you describe the probability (within the CI) of
<br />
obtaining measurement l from state |phi&gt; based on equation (1) ?  This
<br />
is the Born rule, I think, but I haven't quite grasped the math.
<br />
<br />C) In MWI, there is no collapse postulate.  When a measurement occurs,
<br />
the quantum mechanical state of the measuring device (and ultimately the
<br />
observer) becomes a &quot;superposition&quot; as well, with each observer becoming
<br />
a linear combination of states corresponding the effect the measured
<br />
outcome has on the observer. Is this the technical meaning of &quot;splitting
<br />
universes&quot;?
<br />
<br />D) Even in the case where the spectrum of A is discrete, the set of
<br />
constants {cn} in (1) can take on continuous values.  When an observer
<br />
&quot;splits&quot; as a result of measuring A on S, how many &quot;splits&quot; occur?  Is
<br />
there an infinity of them, each corresponding to a different set of
<br />
constants {cn}?  Or, is there a split only into the number of
<br />
eigenvectors of A, since cn|An&gt; represents the same physical state
<br />
regardless of the numerical value of cn?
<br />
<br />E) What is the &quot;measure&quot; associated with each of the &quot;observer states&quot;
<br />
resulting from D?  How is this &quot;mathematically&quot; related to the
<br />
probability values from B)?
<br />
<br />F) What happens when you use a different observable B?  How do the
<br />
answers to C), D), and E) change when observables A and B have different
<br />
sets of eigenvectors?  Is this the &quot;preferred basis&quot; problem?
<br />
<br />Struggling but determined to figure this out,
<br />
<br />-Johnathan
