&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.   Could you, mhmdriad9.domain.name.hidden, please spell out what YOU
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand by the meaning of the term 'scientific method'.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RE:  'The expression Manifest Book symbolizes the Destiny Actual, which is a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title for Divine Will and God's creational and operational laws of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;universe and the physical order displayed by living creatures. The
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manifest Record means the Preserved Tablet which is the book of Divine
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge and symbolizes the Destiny Formal or Theoretical determining
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the immaterial order and the life of the universe.'
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MP: Could you please tell us just exactly where all these books and records are. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clause: 'The
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manifest Record means the Preserved Tablet which is the book of Divine
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge' 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is very confusing; something /means/ something else but /is actually/ something else again.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second clause: ' and symbolizes the Destiny Formal or Theoretical determining the immaterial order and the life of the universe.' seems to tell me that in fact all this is metaphor.
<br />
<br />I have a saying: If something can't be put into plain English then it 
<br />
probably isn't true. I apply this standard to everything I read and 
<br />
hear, particularly when I am confronted with someone or something 
<br />
who/which is 'holding forth' and purporting to describe my world for me.
<br />
<br />The other thing I do is check to what extent a person's speech and 
<br />
writings support and affirm the four fundamental ingredients of 
<br />
civilisation:
<br />
Compassion, democracy, ethics and scientific method. No civilisation can 
<br />
survive without all four of these.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Believing in Divine Destiny is one of the pillars of faith, and, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accordance with this belief, everything in the universe is determined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by God, the All-Mighty. While there are countless absolute evidences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Destiny, it may be sufficient to make some introductory remarks to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; demonstrate how important a place this pillar of faith has for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole of creation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Qur'an specifically explains that everything is predetermined, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then recorded after its coming into existence, as indicated in many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; verses like,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nor anything green or withered except it is all in a Manifest Book.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This Quranic statement is confirmed by the universe, this macro-Qur'an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the Divine Power, through its creational and operational signs like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order, harmony, balance, forming and shaping, adornment and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguishing. All seeds, fruit stones, measured proportions and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forms demonstrate that everything is pre-determined before its earthly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence. Each seed or fruit stone has a protective case formed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the factory of Kaf Nun[*], into which the Divine Destiny has in-built
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the life-story of a tree or plant. The Divine Power employs the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particles according to the measure established by Divine Destiny so as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to cause the particular stone to grow miraculously into the particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tree. This means that the future life-history of that tree is as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though written in its seed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; While there is variety between individuals and between species, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basic materials from which these plants and animals are formed are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identical. The plants and animals that grow from the same constituent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basic elements display, amid abundant diversity, such harmony and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proportion that man cannot help but conclude that each of them has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been individually given its particular form and measure. It is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Divine Power which gives to each its particular form according to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure established for it by Divine Destiny. For example, consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how vast and innumerable a mass of inanimate particles shift, cohere,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separate so that this seed grows into this tree or that drop of semen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grows into that animal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since there are the manifestations of Divine Destiny to this extent in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; visible material things, for certain, the forms with which things are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clothed with the passing of time and the states they acquire through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their motions are also dependent on the ordering of Divine Destiny.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed, a single seed displays Destiny in two ways, one by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; demonstrating the Manifest Book (Kitabun Mubin) which is but another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; title for Divine Will and God's creational and operational laws of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe; the other is by displaying the Manifest Record (Imamun
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mubin), another title for Divine Knowledge and Command. If we regard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these two as different manifestations of Divine Destiny, the former
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be understood and referred to as 'Destiny Actual' and the latter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as 'Destiny For-mal or Theoretical'. The future full-grown form of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tree can be understood as its Destiny Actual, whilst Destiny Formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refers to all the stages together through which the tree has to pass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in its life, and comprehends the entire history of its life. Such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manifestations of the Divine Destiny, so easily observed in a life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such as that of a tree, are illustrative of how everything has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pre-determined in a Record before its worldly existence. On the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hand, all the fruits and seeds which are signs of the Manifest Book
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Kitabun Mubin) and the Manifest Record (Imamun Mubin), together with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all human memories which indicate the Preserved Tablet (Lawhun
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mahfuz), prove that, as everything has been pre-recorded, its life-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history is also recorded. The life-history of every tree, for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is recorded in each of its fruits, which is the outcome of its entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life. The life-history of man including events occurring in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external world is likewise recorded in his memory. Thus, the Divine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Power registers a man's deeds with the Pen of Destiny by lodging it in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his memory so that he will be able to remember them on the Day of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Reckoning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Man should also be assured that in this world of transience and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; upheavals there are numerous 'mirrors' pertaining to eternity in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the All-Powerful and Wise One depicts and makes permanent the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identities of mortals. There are also many tablets upon which the All-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Knowing Preserver writes down the meanings of transient beings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In short: While plants, which are the simplest and lowest level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life, are completely de-pendent upon Divine Destiny, it is also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evident that the life of man, which is the highest level, has also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been minutely determined by that Destiny. Just as drops of rain are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indicative of a cloud, and trickles of water disclose a spring, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; receipts and vouchers suggest the existence of a ledger, so fruits,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sperms, seeds, and forms are indicators of the Manifest Book and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Manifest Record.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The expression Manifest Book symbolizes the Destiny Actual, which is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; title for Divine Will and God's creational and operational laws of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe and the physical order displayed by living creatures. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Manifest Record means the Preserved Tablet which is the book of Divine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Knowledge and symbolizes the Destiny Formal or Theoretical determining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the immaterial order and the life of the universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To conclude: We witness that particles are in continuous movement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during the formation of a living creature and travel to their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; destinations by complicated routes and remain there. Their movement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; results in many benefits, uses, and instances of wisdom. Evidently, an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparent measure is appointed for each thing by Divine Destiny. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is so, it is also observable that even the immaterial states of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; living beings result in certain fruits. Thus, Divine Power is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agent, and Divine Destiny is the pattern. Divine Power writes the book
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the meanings on that pattern. We see that every movement a creature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes in the course of its existence, and all the stages through which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it passes, are pre-determined by Divine Destiny and its whole life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forms a harmonious unity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since we understand that a destination and a certain purposeful result
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has been appointed for everything by Divine Destiny, and accordingly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the stages it will undergo during its life-time have also been pre-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determined by the same Destiny, surely, the life-history of man, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most perfect fruit of the tree of creation, God's vicegerent on earth,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the bearer of His greatest trust, is more than anything subject to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the law of Divine Destiny.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
