I've started reading the new novel from SF writer David Brin, Kiln People.
<br />
He describes it at his web site, <a href="http://www.kithrup.com/brin/othersfbooks.html">http://www.kithrup.com/brin/othersfbooks.html</a>:
<br />
<br />: Take the notion of golems-- temporary clay people (not clones!) -- and
<br />
: now imagine a near future when everybody can make them. Using a &quot;home
<br />
: copier&quot; you ditto your memories -- perhaps even a genuine imprint of
<br />
: your soul -- and off goes the duplicate to run your errands, attend your
<br />
: classes, or do all the drudgery work. Then, at day's end, you download
<br />
: the golem's memories.
<br />
:
<br />
: As a citizen of this near future, you've duplicated yourself a zillion
<br />
: times and take it for granted, sometimes being the original, sometimes the
<br />
: copy. You live your life in parallel, sending expensive &quot;study golems&quot;
<br />
: to the library while cheap models clean the house and your real body
<br />
: works out at the gym. Two thirds of the Earth's population consists of
<br />
: temporaries made of clay. People seem to have even adjusted to this new
<br />
: way of life, until....
<br />
<br />The interesting thing is the implication of such technology for some of
<br />
our discussions of measure.  If you duplicate yourself, of course you
<br />
and your duplicate begin to diverge.  Your measure effectively doubles.
<br />
But the duplicates have a short lifetime, just a day or two.  At the
<br />
end they either self-destruct, get killed or if they are lucky they get
<br />
their memories merged back into the biological original.
<br />
<br />If duplicating yourself doubles your measure, then merging two selves
<br />
would halve it, right?  Likewise letting one of your two selves be killed
<br />
would halve it as well.  So from the point of view of maximizing measure,
<br />
which is supposedly what evolution makes us try to do in the context
<br />
of the multiverse, is it any better to try to arrange to recapture the
<br />
memories of as many golems as possible, or to just let them expire?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the point of view of gaining useful information and experience, it
</em><br />
is certainly better to recapture the memories of the dittos.  Doing that
<br />
makes it seem like the duplicate was still alive.  Yet the measure
<br />
is halved.  That seems a little paradoxical.
<br />
<br />Another point is the experience of having a duplicate made.  The narrator,
<br />
a private detective, has several made every morning who go out and
<br />
do his investigative work.  Some come back, others don't (it's a
<br />
dangerous business).  So he has memories of being both duplicates
<br />
and original.  From his perspective, when he lies down to be scanned,
<br />
it's indeterminate and random whether he will get up as a ditto or as
<br />
the biological original.
<br />
<br />This is the famous first-person indeterminacy which we have often
<br />
discussed.  No doubt many of our philosophical conundrums would be easier
<br />
to handle if we lived in Brin's golem-ridden society.
<br />
<br />Hal
