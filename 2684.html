<em class="quotelev1">&gt;magnified 100-fold.  Thus he will push button 2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     You might see this better by thinking of measure as the # of copies

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of him in operation.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     If he is in round 1, there is 1 copy operating.  The decision that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;copy makes will affect the fate of all 100 copies of him.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     If he is in round 2, all 100 copies are running.  Thus any one copy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of him will effectively only decide its own fate and not that of its 99 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brothers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You'll have to define what &quot;effectively decide&quot; means and how to apply that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concept generally. (Have you introduced it before? I think this is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first time I've seen it.)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought the meaning to be obvious in this context.  The simplest 
<br />
interpretation of your little experiment is that whatever fraction of him 
<br />
push a particular button, is the same fraction of him that end up with the 
<br />
corresponding payoff.  That's how I always interpreted it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the measure of him is the same for the 2nd round as for after both 
<br />
rounds, then it's the same as if each copy gets to influence its own payoff.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose in round 2 he gets the $-9 payoff if any of the copies decide to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;push button 1. Intuitvely, each copy affects the fate of every other copy.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you're changing the game.  And it is a game, since as you said 
<br />
yourself, each guy affects the others.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will round 1 work?  Am I to assume that there is indeed just 1 copy 
<br />
active in round 1, or did you mean to say he gets -$9 if any fraction of him 
<br />
pushes 1 in round 1 as well?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, and assuming there are 100 copies in round 2, he may be best 
<br />
advised to push 1 about 2% of the time, randomly chosen.  (I have not 
<br />
bothered to find the optimal solution for this game.)  That way, most of the 
<br />
time (98%) he will push 2 in round 1 and usually (~75%) still get the full 
<br />
payoff of pushing 1 in round 2.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(On the other hand, if we assume an infinite # of copies and that round 
<br />
1 is also modified, then it is inevitable that at least some copies will get 
<br />
the idea to push 1 in both rounds.  So the thought processes of the majority 
<br />
of his copies is completely irrelevant, and the outcome is certain to be 
<br />
button 1 for both rounds.  Unless, that is, all copies are 100% identical 
<br />
with no access to a random # generator (Gieger counter, etc.); in that case, 
<br />
he will simply push button 2 as a matter of principle.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;I suggest that he instead think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;I'm in both round 1 and round 2, and I should give equal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;consideration to the effects of my decision in both rounds.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     I assume you mean he should think &quot;I am, or was, in round 1, and I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;am, or will be, in round 2&quot;.  There is no need for him to think that, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it's not true.  Only one of the &quot;brothers&quot; was in round 1.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;No, I meant he should think himself as being in both round 1 and round 2 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;simultaneously&quot;, and making both decisions at once.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sorry to say it but that is ridiculous.  It makes no sense.  I hope 
<br />
you have not started to smoke the same weeds as the &quot;1st person&quot; crowd.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     First, anyone whose utility function does not depend on measure is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;definately insane in my book.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     One good utility function could have the form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; U = [sum_(thoughts) f(thought) M(thought)] + V
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think anyone whose utility function does have that form is insane.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who isn't? :)  I admit it's not a perfect model, though.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;He's going to spend most of his resources running repeated simulations of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;himself having the thought that he values most.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlikely.  First, there may be no maximum of f.  For example, f could be 
<br />
proportional to the depth of the thought (roughly, the age the guy seems to 
<br />
be) as well as to a &quot;happiness&quot; factor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it is unlikely that his resources would be such that doing so 
<br />
would maximize the utility.  Even if they are, it doesn't seem so strange 
<br />
that he would want to relive his happiest moment.
