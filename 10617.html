Hi,
<br />
<br />concerning process and programs, all boils down to the timeless/time argument.
<br />
<br />I'm astonished that you accept time as is, I mean if time there is it has been 
<br />
created at the same time as our universe in the bigbang. Time begin when the 
<br />
universe begin, so you accept that time can occur in a timeless system 
<br />
because if you don't then it means time existed before it was created... that 
<br />
make me write nonsensical sentences ;)
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
Quentin

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; and if Plato's heaven can't run programmes, it can't be running us as

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; programmes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I would say that only non-physical system implement counterfactuals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A counterfactual is somethingthat could have happened, but didn't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A static, immaterial systems can only handle counterfactuals by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turning them into factuals -- everything that can happen does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen. It can fully capture the *conditional* structure of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programme,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (unlike a &quot;recording&quot;) at the expense of not being a process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A programme is not the same thing as a process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computationalism refers to real, physical processes running on material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computers. Proponents of the argument need to show that the causality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and dynamism are inessential (that there is no relevant difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between process and programme) before you can have consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implemented Platonically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To exist Platonically is to exist eternally and necessarily. There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no time or changein Plato's heave. Therefore, to &quot;gain entry&quot;, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational mind will have to be translated from a running process
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into something static and acausal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One route is to replace the process with a programme. After all, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programme does specify all the possible counterfactual behaviour, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is basically a string of 1's and 0's, and therefore a suitabale
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occupant of Plato's heaven. But a specification of counterfactual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour is not actual counterfactual behaviour. The information is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same, but they are not the same thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No-one would believe that a brain-scan, however detailed, is conscious,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so not computationalist, however ardent, is required to believe that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; progamme on a disk, gathering dust on a shelf, is sentient, however
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good a piece of AI code it may be!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another route is &quot;record&quot; the actual behaviour, under some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circumstances of a process, into a stream of data (ultimately, a string
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of numbers, and therefore soemthing already in Plato's heaven). This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; route loses the conditonal structure, the counterfactuals that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vital to computer programmes and therefore to computationalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computer programmes contain conditional (if-then) statements. A given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; run of the programme will in general not explore every branch. yet the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unexplored branches are part of the programme. A branch of an if-then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement that is not executed on a particular run of a programme will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constitute a counterfactual, a situation that could have happened but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; didn't. Without counterfactuals you cannot tell which programme
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (algorithm) a process is implementing because two algorithms could have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same execution path but different unexecuted branches.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since a &quot;recording&quot; is not computation as such, the computationalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need not attribute mentality to it -- it need not have a mind of its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own, any more than the characters in a movie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Another way of looking at this is via the Turing Test; a mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recording would never pass a TT since it has no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; condiitonal/counterfactual behaviour and therfore cannot answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unexpected questions).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That counterfactuality is the essence of (immaterial) comp. Although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; here Russell has a point: the quantum multiverse seems to handle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; counterfactual.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Multiverse theories seek to turn the 3rd-person &quot;X could have happened
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but didn't&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into the 1st-person &quot;X could have been observed by me, but wasn't&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  Now if comp is correct, I cannot distinguish a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;genuine&quot; quantum multiverse from any of its emulation in Platonia,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A quantum multiverse is sitll only a tiny corner of Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physical many-world theories have resources to keep counterfactuals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unobserved that immaterial MW-theories lack (including the simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of one that many mathematical possibilities do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist physically).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For instance, even if their are two informationally identical me's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in different branches of a phsycial universe, it is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inevitable that any sharing or corss-over of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consicousness would occur, because in  a phsyical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, cosnciousness would have something other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than informational structures to supervene on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus me might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well be able to tell that we are in a quantum multiverse rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonia, on the basis that we just do not observe enough weirdness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Too broad: If I am just a mathematical structure, I should have a much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wider range of experience than I do. There is a mathemtical structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding to myself with all my experiences up to time T. There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a vast array of mathematical structures corresponding to other versions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of me with having a huge range of experiences -- ordinary ones, like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuing to type, extraordinary ones like seeing my computer sudenly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turn into bowl of petunias. All these versions of me share the memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the &quot;me&quot; who is writing this, so they all identify themselves as me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remember, that for mathematical monism it is only necessary that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible experience has a mathematical description. This is known as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the White Rabbit problem. If we think in terms of multiverse theories,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we would say that there is one &quot;me&quot; in this universe and other &quot;me's&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in other universes,a nd they are kept out of contact with each other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question is whether a purely mathematical scheme has enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resources to impose isolation or otherwise remove the White Rabbit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Too narrow: there are a number of prima-facie phenomena which a purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical approach struggles to deal with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessity/contingency
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why space ? It is tempting to think that if a number of, or some other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical entity, occurs in a set with other numbers, that is, as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were, a &quot;space&quot; which is disconnected from other sets, so that a set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forms a natural model of an *isolated* universe withing a multiverse, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe which does not suffer from the White Rabbit problem. However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maths per se does not work that way. The number &quot;2&quot; that appears in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of even numbers is exactly the same number &quot;2&quot; that appears in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list of numbers less than 10. It does not acquire any further
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characteristics from its context.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The time issue should be obvious. Mathematics is tradionally held to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deal with timeless, eternal truths. This is reflected in the metpahor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of mathematical truth being discovered not found (which, in line with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my criticism of Platonism, should not be taken to seriously). It could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be objected that physics can model time mathematically; it can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objected right back that it does so by spatialising time, by turning it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into just another dimension, in which nothing really changes, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing passes. Some even go so far as to insist that this model is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what time &quot;really&quot; is, which is surely a case of mistaking the map for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the territory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consciousness is a problem for all forms of materialism and physicalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to some extent, but it is possible to discern where the problem is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particularly acute. There is no great problem with the idea that matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered as a bare substrate can have mental properities. Any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inability to have mental properties would itself be a property and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore be inconsistent with the bareness of a bare substrate. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;subjectivity&quot; of conscious states, often treated as &quot;inherent&quot; boils
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down to a problem of communicating one's qualia -- how one feels, how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things seem. Thus it is not truly inherent but depends on the means of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication being used. Feelings and seemings can be more readily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicated in artistic, poetic language, and least readily in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific, technical language. Since the harder, more technical a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science is, the more mathematical it is, the communication problem is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at its most acute in a purely mathematical langauge. Thus the problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with physicalism is not its posit of matter (as a bare substrate) but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its other posit, that all properties are physical. Since physics is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical, that amounts to the claim that all properties are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical (or at least mathematically describable). In making the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transition from a physicalist world-view to a mathematical one, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of a material substrate is abandoned (although it was never a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem for consciousness) and the posit of mathematical properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; becomes, which is a problem for consciousness becomes extreme.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The interesting thing is that these two problems can be used to solve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each other to some extent. if we allow extra-mathemtical properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into our universe, we can use them to solve the White Rabbit problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are two ways of doing this: We can claim either:-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; White Rabbit universes don't exist at all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; White Rabbit universes are causally separated from us (or remote in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first is basically a reversion to a single-universe theory (1).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematical monists sometimes complain that they can't see what role
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter plays. One way of seeing its role is as a solution to the WR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem. For the non-Platonist, most mathematical entitites have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;merely abstract&quot; existence. Only a subset truly, conceretely, exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is an extra factor that the priveleged few have. What is it ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Materiality. For the physicalist, matter is the token of existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maerial things, exist, immaterial ones don't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second moves on from a Mathematical Multiverse to a physical one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (3). The interesting thing about the second variety of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-just-mathematical monism is that as well as addressing the White
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rabbit problem, it removes some further contingency. If the matter,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical laws, and so on, are logically possible, then the general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach of arguing for a universe/multiverse on the grounds of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; removing contingency must embrace them -- otherwise it would be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contingent fact that the universe/multiverse consists of nothing but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the physical laws must take that into account.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All forms of physics handle counterfactuals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or do you mean it handles them in the sense of making them real  -- as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Deutsch insists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Multiverse theories claim that all possible worlds exist; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;possible&quot; has more than one meaning, so there is more than one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse theory. Logical possibility simply means that something is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not self-contradictory. Physical possibility means something is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contradictory to the laws of physics. &quot;Five-sided square&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-contradictory. &quot;Water runnig uphill&quot; is not, but it is physically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossoble.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'And, as I argued in FoR, the reality of universes in which we chose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differently makes sense of (some) formally 'counter- factual'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statements that don't make sense in single- universe physics, which can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only help in making sense of free will.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are forced to conclude that, in spacetime physics [i.e. without a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse], conditional statements whose premise is false (&quot;if Faraday
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had died in 1830 ...&quot;) have no meaning. '[Fabric of Reality, D Deutsch,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; p. 275]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose we agree. What is Deutsch himself to make of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterfactuals we need to discuss the consequences of the laws of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics themselves, such as: &quot;If charge were not conserved, the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be a very different place&quot;? The multiverse is no help, for by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition, it contains no worlds in which the laws are different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Deutsch's view thus implies that these essential claims about how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things would have been had the laws of nature been different &quot;have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning&quot;. The moral is that if we want to give truth conditions for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterfactuals in terms of possible worlds, we need the set of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ogically possible worlds, not the set of physically possible worlds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed, Deutsch's whole multiverse probably counts as a single possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world in David Lewis's account, to which Deutsch later compares his own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view: &quot;The fruitfulness of the multiverse theory in contributing to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solution of long-standing philosophical problems is so great that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be worth adopting even if there were no physical evidence for it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at all. Indeed, the philosopher David Lewis, in his book On The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Plurality of Worlds, has postulated the existence of a multiverse for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical reasons alone.&quot; [pp. 339,40], my italics. Note that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doubtful whether the italicised counterfactual is itself meaningful, on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Deutsch's view! In fact, what Lewis postulates is not a multiverse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory, in Deutsch's sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from:-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.usyd.edu.au/time/price/preprints/DeutschReview-bjps.html">http://www.usyd.edu.au/time/price/preprints/DeutschReview-bjps.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Under David's interpretation, conditional statements whose antecedents
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are false in all physically possible universes, such &quot;as there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perpetual motion machine...&quot; are meaningless.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So are positive statements about things that don't exist in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical universe, eg &quot;there is a perpetual motion machine&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So are negative statements about things that don't exist in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical universe, &quot;there is no perpetual motion machine&quot;. But, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course, we would regard the last as meaningful and true.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is in fact a whole bunch of reasons for thinking that statements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't require real-world referents to be meaningful. We judge the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meanings of statements by their semantic and syntactic makeup. we don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; judge them by peeping into the universe next door. We can make sense of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;there is life on other planets&quot; without knowing whether there is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact life on other planets. If we couldn't make (linguistic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comceptual) sense of &quot;there is life on other planets&quot;, we wouldn't know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how to go about verifying its truth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The kind of linguistic/semantic meaning I have been talking about is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; called &quot;sense&quot;, as opposed to reference, the real-world object a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement is about, if it is about one. The distinction originated with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Frege
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David's contention seems to be based on the idea that &quot;all meaning is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference&quot;. However it is arbitrary at best. It suggests statements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like &quot;if MWI is false..&quot; are meaningless unless there is a world where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MWI is in fact false. But how can that be if there is in fact, more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than one world ?
