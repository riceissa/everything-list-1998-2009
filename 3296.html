Hi John,                      
<br />
<br />You wrote (out-of-line)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno FYI here is a private message I submitted today including a copy of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;part of a post to a complexity-list yesterday.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(No restriction in using any of it anywhere)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;John Mikes   (jamikes).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks for your courageous post where you attempt to define and 
<br />
perhaps justify in some way terrorism.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Terrorism is usually assigned to activities by clandestine preparations to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cause damage both in property and life, many times unselected and randomly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;applied.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What is terrorism?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we do not include A/ anarchy against ALL power &amp; wealth and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                               B/ criminal activity aiming at financial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;extortion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then (in most general cases) it is the expression of DESPERATION 
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are the interpreter. It could be you'r right but be careful
<br />
it depends of case. Desperation can express itself, although rarely
<br />
(but this happens today (27/sept/01) in Switzerland), by terrorist act.
<br />
Desperation can aswell expresse itself in songs, literature, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;powerless against oppressing and overwhelming power, exercised in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;absence of other possible remedies sometimes up to even self-sacrificing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;acts (and I include here hungerstrike and self-setting-on-fire as well) with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the goal of hurting the powerful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is alway triggered (except for point A/ and B/ - although A/ may be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;variant)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by action(s) of the powerful and aims at making them suffer.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If that is terrorism, I don't think terrorism exists.
<br />
Intellectual left terrorism of the last (20) century was not necessarily
<br />
aimed at making people suffering. In Belgium we have known a form
<br />
of such terrorism (the CCC cellules combattantes communistes) which
<br />
demolished public and private goods, but cared not wounding people. Still
<br />
they killed two firemen accidentally and said they regret. Still they
<br />
were linked to the Baader German Group and Italian's one, who were 
<br />
murdering innocent persons, but not innocent &quot;in their mind&quot; (sure).
<br />
I think they were fighter with a (crazy) purpose, and were using
<br />
terrorism has a (unsuccesful) psychological trick to impose their
<br />
philosophy or way of life, by threaten life and goods of their &quot;enemy&quot;,
<br />
the &quot;bourgeoise classe&quot; for exemple.
<br />
Most of them were coming from wealthy family and find their inspiration
<br />
in book full of hate written by anti-humanist thinker justifying violence
<br />
with eloquence. Young people fall easily in that trap, during puberty.
<br />
<br />If you read their literature you will see they are aware of the moral
<br />
problem of making suffering. &quot;making suffer&quot; is not the goal. The problem
<br />
is that they believe the publicity on their message is worth making 
<br />
suffering
<br />
or dying innocent people.
<br />
<br />I don't see why you put hungerstrike and self-setting-on-fire with 
<br />
terrorist.  
<br />
<br />Be prudent with your desperation interpretation before revendications
<br />
are given. (For exemple, it could be your own desperation that you were 
<br />
projecting) .
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;When and how could we open our eyes that the reason for 'their' fight is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;protect themselves from all these goals of the western world? They see their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;institutions and philosophy jeopardized by us, their lifestyle in danger
</em><br />
<br /><br />The western world is a myth. Islam has produced one of the most
<br />
genteel and sophisticated civilisation, our &quot;western&quot; sciences
<br />
owes a lot to Islam thinkers especially mathematicians, philosophers.
<br />
The civilisations meshed more than one time. Not always violently.
<br />
Since christians made crusade and invented christ soldiers, some
<br />
Muslims gives the right to defend Islam by killing the crusaders. (normal)
<br />
Later some school or  sect (not easy to distinguish) developped literal
<br />
interpretation of the coran and variant of it containing the idea
<br />
that Islam must rule the world, and that any muslim who kill a 
<br />
non-muslim (infidel) go immediately to paradise. It has always been
<br />
a minority in Islam traditions.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;from the free market global economy and their 'system' (in their view the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only one worthwhile living for) being attacked. They conduct a life/death
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;struggle, in their view worthwhile dying for the noble cause. For their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;culture, which they do not want to give up.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I'm afraid it is not the case in the current affair. In america there are
<br />
people who reject modernity including electricity, and nobody really
<br />
threaten their philosophy and souls. Those who revived those agressive
<br />
version of Islam are decadent intoxicated by petrodollars wanting to
<br />
communicates nothing more than hate: no revendication, no signature.
<br />
They are not defending the poor. They oppressed them by terror. They
<br />
use that nazy trick to use their (originaly real) people frustration for
<br />
enhancing hate of a world which exists only in their imagination.
<br />
They are sellers of fear and they work hard making grow a collective
<br />
paranoia. We tolerate the saoudian school of hate by petrol addiction, and
<br />
even used them against the communist. We are indeed paying a price
<br />
for a terrible mistake (not realising that the old war rule which
<br />
consists in building enemies against our enemies is inconsistent in
<br />
the quickly mondialised world). Of course it is now that it is easy to 
<br />
say it is a mistake.
<br />
Those enemy are the enemy of any form of moderate thought Islam included.
<br />
It is not that they do not want give up their culture, it is that they
<br />
want to impose their culture on us. Not Islam, but special interpretations
<br />
provided by some cynic people who makes an anachronical reading of it.
<br />
The problem is that in some region the moderate (muslims or not)  are 
<br />
threatened by those anti-humanist &quot;value&quot; since some time. Now we are
<br />
too.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;We, in our worldview, cannot cope with that, cannot understand and most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;likely cannot win. We may reap a victory of arms, establishing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;socioeconomic (maybe also religious?) oppression - vs the world THEY feel is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their only real world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Just think of the &quot;peace&quot;-treaties of 1918, begetting WWII. That was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;political. Now we go against a culture, a religious belief and institutions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thereof. Worse than  1918.
</em><br />
<br /><br />We don't go against anyone. We made errors. (Even big one like petrol 
<br />
addiction). With the Whahhabit petrodollars they could have build
<br />
universities and revived their most glorious talent, and competing
<br />
with us with respect to the real fundamental question. Easy-money
<br />
create frustrations. The precise reason why those school has developped
<br />
in some region is still not clear for me.
<br />
But they have no revendications, except the total destruction of anything
<br />
apparently contrary to their view. The destruction of the NYC towers was
<br />
nothing more than an eloquent &quot;I hate you&quot;. It really correspond to the
<br />
case A/ you mention above. (Perhaps you have better information).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;The Muslim world is highly diversified and unsurmountable differences exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;among factions and national institutions&quot;.However: attack one little branch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and you stepped on the toes of all of them.
</em><br />
<br /><br />And *that* is natural. That is why diplomacy is so fundamental.
<br />
No one can ask the muslims to reform or to take a view with respect
<br />
with those school. There exists sons in family with the typical
<br />
adolescent difficulties falling in that collective paranoia just as
<br />
a manner of confrontation with their (moderate) parents. 
<br />
We can ONLY give exemple of moderation. But we can also illustrate
<br />
our appreciation of our value by defending them. If not we can loose
<br />
our own dignity in the process.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Many things are being written, mostly &quot;to bring them up&quot;. They feel that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;want to &quot;bring them down&quot;. 
</em><br />
<br />No.
<br />
They want to bring us down. (They = a precise minority view of Muslims
<br />
which believes Islam must rule the worlds, having schools in a minority
<br />
of country, using terroristic trick in war, ...). 
<br />
<br />Islam could very well rule the world in case the Muslims come back to
<br />
algebra and algorithm, which they invented. After all those are the
<br />
master tools of comp :-).
<br />
<br />No one believes any ruling could come from arbitrary violence. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How can we achieve a cross-cultural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cross-religious accord?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Both Oussama Ben Ladden and Gautama Bouddha grews up
<br />
in a very rich Palace. Both probably were &quot;disappointed&quot;
<br />
when discovering the outside &quot;real&quot; world.
<br />
Bouddha concludes in universal messages of compassion and love.
<br />
Ben Ladden concludes in holy wars and hate.
<br />
<br />Why do you think the Talibans destroyed the Bouddha statues?
<br />
<br />By fear of the oppressing power of Occident perhaps?
<br />
<br />Bruno
