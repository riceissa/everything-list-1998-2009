I will make some comments on the last posts. But we are entering in 
<br />
very deep
<br />
waters and I would like to make general remarks. 
<br />
<br />I said it before, but I want
<br />
repeat it here. One of my main goal is to understand what is &quot;the
<br />
physical&quot; and where does it comes from. And like Wheeler I don't think 
<br />
that this can be explain by physical laws. 
<br />
<br />With Ockham razor there is no need of
<br />
the crackpot/Maudlin argument, the UD argument (PE-omega) is quasi-enough 
<br />
to convince oneself
<br />
that the 'universal part' of physics must be extract from computer 
<br />
science.
<br />
<br />Note also that the 'reversal' is in both Tegmark and Schmidhuber (it 
<br />
seems to me), but they
<br />
haven't see the measure problem (do they ?), and they havent' put their 
<br />
methodology to its logical extreme.
<br />
<br />Another general remark is that, in your post, I agree sometimes whith 
<br />
what you are saying until you jump to a conclusion which I don't 
<br />
understand.

<br />An interesting similar (although computationalist) move  has been made
<br />
by Eric Barnes &quot;The causal history of computational activity: Maudlin and
<br />
Olympia. (The journal of philosophy 1991, pp 304-316.) 
<br />
What is interesting for me is that Barnes'move forces him to pretend
<br />
having the ability to distinguish between being awake and being dreaming
<br />
(which I doubt), (which contredict also my theetetic self-referential
<br />
theory of knowledge where p is known when p is justified by the machine 
<br />
and true or just consistent).

<br />I am definitely open to the idea that consciousness exists only in the

relativity of mutual information as defined by Claude Shannon, Kolmogorov,

quant-ph).

<br />I agree. What MW or self-duplication adds is truly random uncertainty.
<br />
This is &quot;testify&quot; by quantum computers.
<br />
I don't think determinism is an &quot;effective&quot; problem for free-will,
<br />
nor do I think randomization can help in making free-will possible.
<br />
I think free-will is related with the boundary of self-knowledge.

a doll, a teddy bear, or a sculpture.

Unlike Hans I don't understand what would it mean to ascribe them

consciousness.
<br />
<br />HF:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One of the thins which is attractive about Wei's approach, as I understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it, is that it does not try to answer the question of whether a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system is conscious, at least not in yes-or-no terms.  Rather, it tries
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to give a probability that a given system is conscious, and specifically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that it instantiates a particular consciousness, such as my own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This allows you to have such things as systems which are &quot;probably&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conscious, or, in a sense, &quot;partially&quot; conscious (in the sense that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we can treat them as having a 10% chance of being conscious, say).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This interpretation makes most sense in the context of the Strong
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Self-Selection Assumption (that we can consider our moments of experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as randomly chosen from among all observer-moments).  The probabilities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assigned to consciousness serve as a weighting factor for how much they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contribute to the ensemble of all observer-moments.
</em><br />
<br />I agree and I appreciate very much this way of seeing the things. It is
<br />
linked (from my humble understanding) to James Higgo's anthropic 
<br />
principle/occam-razor. This 'interpretation' along with comp leads to
<br />
a total reversal ....but in the relative way (I will not insist here).
<br />
I do link consciousness with machine's inference about their own possible
<br />
consistent extensions.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This seems an excellent viewpoint, consciousness requires the freedom to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;react to a reasonably wide range of circumstances in a way which is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;predictable to other observers.  So a single execution can never confirm or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;deny consciousness however many times it is replayed.  But I'm not so sure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that a Turing machine cannot have free will.  I'd guess that the appearance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of free will can emerge from a sufficiently complex TM provided that the TM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exists in a suitably complex environment.  If a person built a machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;containing a TM it would be part of our MWI universe and the requirements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could be satisfied.  This would not be an isolated TM since it would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simulated by and react to its environment, and any 'randomness' requirement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could actually involve a sensitivity to gravitons, photons, or quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I tend to agree that a completely isolated TM is unlikely to have free will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or be conscious (and in any case it would be impossible to test it).  Of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;course the program executed by an isolated TM may well be able to generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a universe containing conscious subjects.  In the special case of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;isolated TM generating a universe which contains exactly one conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subject in a suitable environment it could loosely be said that the TM's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;program is that conscious subject.  But this is different to saying that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the TM itself is conscious, and it would not be apparent from looking at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the TM that it was generating consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />I agree in part. It is easy to build version of dreaming Olympia.
<br />
A dreaming machine would be, at least here and now, an isolated 
<br />
'conscious'
<br />
(but not necessarily awake) machine.
<br />
I think an isolated 'conscious' machine cannot be isolate for ever for 
<br />
purely computational reasons.

It is clear that we have not the same primitive elements.

I believe in numbers and number's dreams. Some dreams are deep and

partially sharable among UTMs, those are their relative realities.

<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Chris, this is a well thought out reponse, and it persuades me that

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the difference between conciousness and nonconciousness could be as

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; little as the &quot;inert block of wood&quot;, precisely because it is a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on or not.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [...]
</em><br />
<br />1) The great programmer dovetail also on the quantum turing machines...
<br />
2) I think so. There is a deeper analogy between the computationalist's
<br />
counterfactuals and the quantum. This is linked to a paper by Hardegree
<br />
showing a formal similarity between a very natural definition of 'quantum
<br />
implication' and Stalnaker's logic of counterfactual and my own definition
<br />
of 'observation'. (ref. in my thesis), and the resulting arithmetical
<br />
&quot;quantum logic&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thinking about this some more, I realise this is exactly what is going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on. Consider Olympia from a MWI point of view. For the vast majority
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of worlds containing Olympia, Karas (I believe that is what the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;correcting machinery is called) is active, handling the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;counterfactuals. Only on one world line (of measure zero!) is Karas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inactive, and Olympia is simply replaying the previously recorded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;data.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now consider what happens when Karas is turned off, or prevented from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;operating. Then, in all world lines is Olympia simply a replay
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;device. From the MWI point of view, the simple inert piece of wood is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not so innocuous. It changes the systems dynamics completely.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now this has bearing on a supposition I have argued earlier - that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conciousness requires free will, and the only way to have free will is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;via the MWI picture.
</em><br />
<br />Not OK. See above. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In this context, a Turing machine can never be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concious, because it follows a preprogrammed path, without free
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will. Note this is not the same as saying comp is false, unless you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strictly define computers to be Turing machines. 
</em><br />
<br />I do. It is my working hypothesis.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My suspicion is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;adding a genuine random number generator to the machine may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sufficient to endow the architecture with free will, however, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;course the question is unresolved.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What does this all mean for your thesis Bruno? Alas I didn't follow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your argument (not because it was written in French - which I have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problem with, rather because I was not familiar with the modal logic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you employed, and haven't raised enough enthusiasm to follow up the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;references). Could it be implying that you have too restrictive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;definitions of both comp and sup-phys?
</em><br />
<br />Church's Thesis is a vaccin against any restrictive interpretation
<br />
of comp.  Comp makes the unknown much bigger that we have ever thought.
<br />
Even if from the archimedian point of view there are only numbers 
<br />
relationships.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Quote from Bruno follows:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This seems rather magical to me. If only because, for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computationalist,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the only role of the inert block (during the particular execution) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explain why the machine WOULD have give a correct answer in case the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; inputs WOULD have been different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This mean that you don't associate consciousness with a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical computation but with the entire set of possible computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But that is exactly what I do ..., and what I mean by the abandon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of physical supervenience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A singular brain's activity becomes an invention of the mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Could it mean that you are defining sup-phys to be supervenience on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the one track classical physics, rather than on the MWI style quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics?
</em><br />
<br />Most people in cognitive science do but I do not care about the level of
<br />
duplication.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I think that ANY sufficiently patient self-referentially correct
<br />
machines, either by introspection or by observation (or a mixture of 
<br />
both), will infer MWI-like physics (once observing below their level of
<br />
&nbsp;duplication, for example).
