At 08:18 PM 9/17/2005, you wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I wouldn't say a lower level, its more of an alternative route to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same point. I get there fairly directly from the observation that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Plenitude of all descriptions has zero information (according to all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers), so is in effect the simplest possible object.
</em><br />
<br />My approach starts with - I would now say - one assumption and three 
<br />
observations:
<br />
<br />Assumption: There is [exists] a list of all possible components of 
<br />
descriptions [not descriptions themselves - these are derivative of the 
<br />
list's existence but have a potential [a kernel in my model's lexicon] of 
<br />
instantations of reality [a &quot;dust in the wind&quot; &quot;physical&quot; existence.]]
<br />
<br />This list of fragments of descriptions is my primitive.  It has no 
<br />
information [meaning or boundary potential] unless divided into pairs of 
<br />
descriptions.  The ensemble of all such divisions also has no net 
<br />
information beyond its inconsistency.  This inconsistency is a tag of 
<br />
information [meaning or boundary potential] attached to the All which is 
<br />
cancelled by the dual tag of incompleteness attached to the Nothing.  Can a 
<br />
system that is both incomplete and inconsistent be said to have overall 
<br />
meaning?
<br />
<br />Observation 1: The list can be parsed so as to produce the definition of 
<br />
[is,is not] pairs.  [produce descriptions two by two]
<br />
<br />Observation 2: At least one of these pairs is unavoidable [the idea that 
<br />
there is either nothing or something is replaced with the idea that there 
<br />
is both simultaneously] and so has a &quot;permanence&quot; derived from the lists 
<br />
existence.
<br />
<br />Observation 3: Because of the logical properties of the unavoidable pair 
<br />
this &quot;permanence&quot; has a dynamic and that dynamic is random because of these 
<br />
logical properties.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I also note
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the duality relation that maps the Plenitude to Nothing, hence my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;title &quot;Theory of Nothing&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />I am not a mathematician but I have recently explored the idea of 
<br />
mathematical duality and do not contest at this time that my [Nothing;All] 
<br />
and your [Nothing;Plenitude] can be considered mathematically dual pairs.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Constrasting this with your model, you note an inherent contradiction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the Nothing not being able to state its own completeness, hence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;immediately necessitating the existence of the &quot;All&quot;,
</em><br />
<br />My Nothing and my All are both necessitated by the list, the divisible 
<br />
nature of lists, and the unavoidable nature of this particular division of 
<br />
the list.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;which in turn is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inconsistent. Your claim is that this leads to a &quot;dynamic&quot; between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Nothing and All.
</em><br />
<br />My concern for some time has been: What drives the &quot;observational&quot; 
<br />
process?  Why do we perceive a succession of events?
<br />
<br />My answer is the evolving Somethings.  Most Somethings evolve because they 
<br />
are unlikely to be complete short of when they grow to be infinite 
<br />
[encompass the entire All].  [I revised my posted model to make this more 
<br />
explicit.]
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Don't get me wrong, I think your idea has the germ of a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interesting idea,
</em><br />
<br />Thank you.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  the problem is I have never really understood what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your &quot;dynamic&quot; is supposed to be in a timeless world.
</em><br />
<br />The inconsistency of the All makes the dynamic in the All an endless change 
<br />
absence order.  I see this as timeless.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Nor have I seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anyone else on the list grok your ideas and express them in other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;words. This is not a criticism, but does make it hard for me to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;include in an integrated fashion in my book.
</em><br />
<br />I realize that over the years I have explored numerous dead ends and made 
<br />
many errors in my posts.  This naturally leads to confusion in others as to 
<br />
what I am trying to say.  I appreciate all the tolerance and comments I 
<br />
have received on this list.  I have recently managed to compact the 
<br />
resulting ideas into a two page presentation.  Perhaps this is now too 
<br />
compact, and I welcome any questions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have resolved to include a mention of your ideas in my book,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;although I don't find it an easy task to express your ideas in a way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that intergrates with the rest of the book.
</em><br />
<br />I have only reached page 63 of your book.  Perhaps as I explore it further 
<br />
I will have comments that help.
<br />
<br />However, for now I see my All as similar to your Plenitude.  However, one 
<br />
of my comments re your Plenitude is that it too should have the 
<br />
&quot;inconsistency&quot; tag which I see as making it an information bearing 
<br />
object.  I do not see it as correct to simply invoke a dual entity [that 
<br />
may cancel this tag].  This is one issue that I believe is resolved by 
<br />
starting at a more primitive structure - in my case my list.   Further as I 
<br />
said above I am not satisfied unless there is a &quot;positive&quot; driver for 
<br />
sequential observation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Do you have a write up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that I can reference - ie a journal ref, arXiv, DOI or even permanent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;URL?
</em><br />
<br />I am an engineer and my publications have dealt mostly with that 
<br />
profession.  This endeavor is an intellectual hobby.  I do own a small 
<br />
business and might be able to place it on that web site - a dot com site - 
<br />
once I am satisfied with it.  That could last as long as the business 
<br />
maintains the domain name. I do not know how to otherwise publish it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(I am reluctant to refer to URLs, as these are less permanent than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;others, but in some cases necessary).
</em><br />
<br />I had that experience when I co-authored a Law Review article re complexity 
<br />
and the law with my brother who is a Professor of Law.  I had some 
<br />
additional commentary [including a very very very early and thus error 
<br />
filled version of my model] and the article cited the URL which was lost 
<br />
when I changed ISP.
<br />
<br />Yours
<br />
<br />Hal Ruhl
