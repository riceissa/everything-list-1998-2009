<br />
Perhaps Hilbert was right and Physics ought to have been axiomatized when he
<br />
suggested it.  ;)  Then again, there might not have been a motivation to
<br />
until recently with Tegmark's MUH paper and related material (like by David
<br />
Wolpert of NASA).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I was trying to answer Bruno's objections regarding set theory being too
<br />
rich to be the 'ultimate math' the MUH needs to propose what the universe is
<br />
and I quipped that that was because math is invented or discovered to
<br />
further its own end by logicians, for the most part, and that
<br />
metamathematicians such as Cantor had no apparent interest in physical
<br />
things or furthering the pursuit of Physics.
<br />
<br />Another question of Bruno's was my motivation.  I started this quest hoping
<br />
that three truth values were sufficient to develop a set theory with a
<br />
universal set that was in a classical logic sense consistent to ZFC set
<br />
theory.  Or, if not true, prove that and figure out why.  Perhaps more truth
<br />
values would solve that.  My main motivation has definitely not been to
<br />
&quot;rescue&quot; a major apparent shortcoming in the MUH as I started this
<br />
on-and-off quest in 2003 with no internet connection or resources such as a
<br />
deluge of journals (ie, a good library).  How it started was that someone
<br />
online in a place such as this used Russell-like arguments to -prove- that
<br />
the Physic's universe -does not exist- for essentially the same reasons a
<br />
universal set can't seem to be non-antimonious.
<br />
<br />Suppose Everything is well defined along with its partner, containment (such
<br />
as the earth is contained in the solar system by the definitions of both).
<br />
Then Everything does not exist.  Proof:
<br />
Consider the thing, call it &quot;this something,&quot; that is the qualia of all
<br />
things that do not contain themselves.
<br />
Then this something contains itself if and only if this something does not
<br />
contain itself.
<br />
<br />By a simple logical tautology (a variant of ad absurdum), this proves that
<br />
&quot;Everything is well defined&quot; is a false statement.  It also raises doubts as
<br />
to the existence of this so called Everything.  Maybe this google group
<br />
should end?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I don't think so.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />My quip was something along the lines of, &quot;however, in any ternary logic, ad
<br />
absurdum is not a tautology and therefore, can't be used here.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That discussion got me going and while mostly off task, I've been thinking
<br />
about this on and off since then.  Basically, my motivation to &quot;rescue&quot; a
<br />
universal set is so that Cantor's dream of formalizing in a mathematical way
<br />
some type of deity could be realized.  The analogy would be Abraham Robinson
<br />
is to Issac Newton (on infinitesimals) as Quinne (et al) are to Cantor (on a
<br />
universal set).  Right idea, but never considered using fuzzy logic not to
<br />
be delved into much until Lukaseiwicz, Zadeh, and others revitalized FL.  As
<br />
it took an army of giants to &quot;rescue&quot; Newton's intuition which was
<br />
criticized by another philosopher (Berkeley, akin to Russell) to develop
<br />
enough tools (compactness theorem), it is taking an army of logicians to
<br />
&quot;rescue&quot; Cantor's intuition about God which, and this may be apocrypha, he
<br />
believed to be his maximally infinite set.  He thought infinity must be an
<br />
attribute of God and therefore delved into infinite sets, hoping, I assume,
<br />
to reach some type of Omega set that contains all sets and would then be
<br />
necessarily the &quot;biggest&quot; infinity.  Cantor proved that the power set of any
<br />
set is &quot;larger,&quot; however, and settled his own quest in his own way though
<br />
I'm guessing he -desired- the opposite conclusion to have been reached.
<br />
<br />Others in the FL army are trying to reach that conclusion which Cantor,
<br />
chronologically, would have to have re-discovered much mathematics to
<br />
realize in the way this army is doing.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />So the basic motivation is to find some type of thing with maximality in
<br />
some important sense and study it.  With the MUH, now I suspect that
<br />
Everything would be a likely candidate for a literal God and atheism might
<br />
have to suddenly be the irrational side to be on.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So on this note, the works of David Hawkins (a psychiatrist and
<br />
spiritualist) inspired me to ponder the following question, along with
<br />
Tegmark's articulation of the MUH, of course.
<br />
Which mathematical structure -is- the universe in Physics?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I suspect it might already exist and has been studied.  It's like finding
<br />
the correct non-Euclidean Geometry applicable to the universe we perceive
<br />
gets us to a GR that coincides with observation (for the most part?).  I am
<br />
guessing that the universe must have an MV-algebra structure.
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV-algebra">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV-algebra</a>
<br />
<br /><br />I was trying to rejoin Bruno's &quot;too rich&quot; -valid- (imho) objection to
<br />
Tegmark's approach in his MUH paper by concocting a theory that was far less
<br />
rich.  All I need are things and a notion of containment.  I was going to
<br />
call it container theory.  Then there'd be no need to develop something
<br />
strong enough to do numbers, infinite sets, and such, so with those goals
<br />
gone, so much more is available to Physics without having to squeeze any set
<br />
theory or logic into Physics.  It's there, I suspect, in -classical logic-
<br />
and recent -algebra- in the guise of MV-algebra.  This area is exactly what
<br />
I mean by thing and containment.  Now if you look at the wiki article above,
<br />
observe, firstly, how little there is reliance on sets or non-classical
<br />
logic.
<br />
<br />Secondly, I could view all the letters that would normally be variables as
<br />
things in the &quot;container theory&quot; I was trying to work on.  In MV-algebras,
<br />
the variables represent truth degrees and the carrier of the MV-algebra is
<br />
the truth set, the set of all truth values which has cardinality two in all
<br />
classical logics.  But this seems promising for my 'container theory' which
<br />
I was assuming someone had done that I just had to find somewhere.  Now if
<br />
each variable is now a worldline, one think of it that way.  The carrier of
<br />
the MV-algebra is the set of all worldlines in one parallel universe.  An
<br />
ideal could be a sub-universe that isn't parallel.  The circle-plus is the
<br />
notion of joining and the circle-times is the notion of intersecting or
<br />
meeting (to use Boolean terminology which is much more compatible with most
<br />
natural languages).
<br />
<br />The 0 in the MV-algebra could be intuitively compared to that which contains
<br />
nothing or the empty container.
<br />
<br />The notion of containment is given by the ordering induced by the
<br />
circle-plus and negation operator, listed in detail in Siegfried Gottwald's
<br />
&quot;A Treatise on Many-Valued Logics&quot; in section 9.2.1 on pages 215-234.
<br />
<br />So if each variable represents a world-line consistent with -some- laws of
<br />
some Physics, which vary from parallel to parallel (a parallel would be an
<br />
ideal of an MV-algebra), then maybe this way to view MV-algebras would prove
<br />
interesting to a Physicist.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />To glue MV-algebras together into what the multiverse might be, not much
<br />
more complex than a simple union would suffice, I think (not having thought
<br />
along those lines yet)?
