<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; this problematic &quot;physical matter&quot; is supposed to fill.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK. But then what's the difference with mathematicalism?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe that's the term I should be using. I thought that the term
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;mathematicalism&quot; had some other philosophical meaning, but I now see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it only gets 29 hits on Google, and most of them are from this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list. I like the term, and am happy to commandeer it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, it still seems that you and I can't agree on how to use it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For instance, you say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The fact is that I believe mathemaricalism is probably false too, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it could be false in the same sense that incompleteness phenomenon à-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; la- Skolem-Tarski could be used to justify that &quot;the whole of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematics&quot; cannot be a mathematical object itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is your definition of &quot;mathematicalism&quot; here?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Strong definition:  the big &quot;everything&quot; is a mathematical object.
<br />
(But perhaps this is asking too much. The whole of math is already not  
<br />
a mathematical object). So:
<br />
<br />Weak definition: every thing is mathematical, except everything!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If you agree that physics has become a statistic on computations &quot;as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; seen from inside&quot;, everything is ok.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do agree with this. So everything is ok. :)
</em><br />
<br /><br />(except that a joke is not funny if you know it already :).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Then MGA will show what you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; already believe, which is that the computations does not need to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; implemented in our, or any other, stuffy primitive material universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ok. Can you tell me a one or two word name for the belief that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;computations do not need to be implemented in our, or any other,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stuffy primitive material universe&quot;?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Do not need for what needs? To create the feeling of consciousness? In  
<br />
that case I would say: &quot;cognitive immaterialism&quot;, or something like  
<br />
that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To put it another way, can we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; come up with a name for the proposition that &quot;the Movie Graph Argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is sound&quot;? I want to use the term &quot;mathematicalism&quot; to refer to this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and only this). But above you say that you believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;mathematicalism&quot; is probably false. Yet you seem to believe that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MGA is sound, so I think you must be using the term &quot;mathematicalism&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in some other way.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say (with grain of salt) that MGA is the breakdown (or the  
<br />
seed of the breakdown) of 1500 years of Aristotelian naturalism.
<br />
Mathematicalism is a position, a philosophical position, according to  
<br />
which the big whole is of mathematical nature. In my opinion, it could  
<br />
be much more correct than physicalism (and so represents a big  
<br />
progress if we come back to it (many Platonist, like Xeusippas were  
<br />
mathematicalist, but not all Platonist are).
<br />
But I can argue (later) that mathematicalism is not true. I am even  
<br />
open to the idea that consciousness is not something mathematical, it  
<br />
is something theological. I think theologicalism could be true (but I  
<br />
don't insist, because if physics could be conceptually wrong today,  
<br />
theology (the science) is conceptually deeply buried.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe you don't want to use &quot;mathematicalism&quot; to refer to &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusion of the MGA&quot;, because that elevates your argument to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; status of a position.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No, it is because, it is a too general position, and it is not  
<br />
entirely correct (but this is a subtle point, and I am influenced by  
<br />
the interview of the lobian machine). It is almost a very technical  
<br />
thing. It is too early (with respect to the thread)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For what it's worth, I feel that it's a tactical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mistake for you to claim that you don't hold positions and that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't do philosophy.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I have abandon tactics years ago.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your critics may end up accusing you of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disingenuousness.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Critics does not read what they critic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand full well that you do not claim that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP is true. You only claim that it is testable. In that sense, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand that you don't hold a position on COMP. But the claim that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP is testable is also a position!
</em><br />
<br /><br />I use position for philosophical position. Not for scientific  
<br />
statement. Would you say &quot;17 is prime&quot; is a position? Ah yes, some  
<br />
philosopher could say that!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The claim that &quot;the MGA shows
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that computations do not need to be implemented in our, or any other,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stuffy primitive material universe&quot; is a position.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />&quot;implemented for consciousness and appearance of matter to exists&quot;?
<br />
No, it is a verifiable statement. A refutable or perhaps ameliorable  
<br />
one. It is really of the type of &quot;17 is prime&quot;, or &quot;F = ma&quot;, or &quot;Hf =  
<br />
Ef&quot;, etc.
<br />
You just need definitions on which people agree. But you can think  
<br />
axiomatically (definition are given by set of propositions on which we  
<br />
agree).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The claim that &quot;if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MECH is true, then MAT is false&quot; is a position, even if you remain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agnostic about whether or not MECH is true. This might just be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference about how we use the term &quot;position&quot;, but it seems to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causing some confusion.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I was using position for philosophical position. It is important for  
<br />
me because I have no determinate philosophical positions. And my work  
<br />
most primitive goal consists in showing that the mind body problem can  
<br />
be a scientific problem, once we choose some hypothesis.
<br />
I have a personal philosophy of life, and I like philosophy in  
<br />
general, but the &quot;philosophers&quot; I like are really scientist, like  
<br />
Plotinus or Descartes. It is a mistake, imo, to put them in  
<br />
philosophy, which in my country is a branch of literature. Descartes  
<br />
is for me a great mathematician, cognitive scientist, physicist, and  
<br />
theologian. Philosophy is sometimes used as a pretext for permitting  
<br />
lack of rigor, and eventually justifying arbitrariness, including the  
<br />
many ways of eliminating persons, and their rights.
<br />
Well I don't insist. It is vocabulary, with only &quot;political&quot;  
<br />
consequence. Maudlin would say he is a philosopher, but here, in some  
<br />
european country, this would have him made judged by people who can  
<br />
send you in Siberia because you don't cite such local of global idol.  
<br />
They makes human science inexact and inhuman. Many &quot;anglo-saxon&quot;  
<br />
philosopher are scientists, and things would be better if this was  
<br />
understood. (Because unrigorous philosophers, like most creationnist  
<br />
for example, would have less bad influences).
<br />
