</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could be different even though his physical state is unchanged.  If it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; did, you are right, it wouldn't be materialism.  In all forms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; materialism, the person's mental state has to be completely fixed by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the physical state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What non-reductive materialism *does* say is that high-level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; properties of a complex system are not completely reducible to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; descriptions in terms of lower level properties.  That is, there exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; real (objective) high-level properties of a system which cannot be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; replaced by low-level descriptions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then it seems to be a matter of semantics. You could say that a pair of peas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot be explained in terms of one pea and another pea because &quot;pair&quot; is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; higher level property of the system. It's just that in the case of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trivial example, our minds easily and intuitively see that the pair really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is nothing more than the sum of its parts. We might imagine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; super-intelligent beings who could immediately see all sorts of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fantastically intricate, complex systems for what they really are.
</em><br />
<br />In the particular exmaple you just gave, 'pair' is *not* an
<br />
*objectively real* high-level property of the system.  In this case
<br />
'pair' is indeed just a human construct which makes it easier for us
<br />
to understand the system.  The system in this example *can* be reduced
<br />
to merely the sum of the parts.  But I don't think all systems can.
<br />
The deciding factor is whether the higher level description is
<br />
*indispensible* or not. (See philosophy literature for 'Argument From
<br />
Indispensibility').  In the example you gave the higher level
<br />
description ('pair') *can* be dispensed with (the system is actually
<br />
merely the sum of the parts).   So this is indeed a completely
<br />
reductionistic example.  but not all levels of description can be
<br />
dispensed with so easily.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unfortunately reductionism appears to *the* modern day dogma of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; science and it seems to be near impossible to get through to anyone in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the grip of this dogma. 'Eliminative materialism' is all the rage
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; these days aka Daniel Dennett and co who think that consciousness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'just a fiction' (even though Dennett uses these same-said high level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cognitive processes to reason his way to his absurd conclusion).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's obviously crazy to say consciousness is just a fiction; just as it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; crazy to say a pair of peas is just a fiction. This is not the same as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying that the idea of consciousness as a separate ontological entity is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just a fiction.
</em><br />
<br /><br />True.  But the two cases 'consciousness' and 'pair of peas' are quite
<br />
different.  As I agreed 'pair of peas' is merely a human construct.
<br />
So let's clarfiy the terminology then: the question is whether
<br />
consciousness is merely a 'human mental construct' similair to the
<br />
term 'pair of peas' or whether consciousness does exist as an
<br />
objectively real ontological entity.  I'm saying it does.
<br />
<br />Below I gave example of things ('laws of physics' and 'infinite sets')
<br />
which cannot be reduced to seperate parts in the way the 'pair of
<br />
peas' system could.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We know for sure (via the argument from indispensability) than there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; exist mathematical concepts (for instance uncomputable numbers and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; infinite sets) which *cannot* be identified with finite physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; processes.  Yet we see great minds desperate to try to deny the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; existence of uncomputables (J.Schmidhuber on this very list just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; showed up recently and tried to argue that only discrete math is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; real!) - even though in fact Cantor put infinite sets on an infallible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; footing long ago (and Abraham Robinson did the same for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; infinitesimals).  See this link for an artilce I wrote giving a quick
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; demolition of the arguments against infinite sets:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;<a href="http://archives.betterhumans.com/Members/mjgeddes/BlogPost/4710/Defau">http://archives.betterhumans.com/Members/mjgeddes/BlogPost/4710/Defau</a>...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The bottom line is that if infinite sets are real (and they are!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reductive materialism is false.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see how that follows, even if by &quot;real&quot; you mean physically real as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opposed to mathematically real.
</em><br />
<br />It follows because there are *no* finite physical parts you can point
<br />
to which identify an infinite set.  Think of the 'pair of peas'
<br />
example you gave.  In that example, you *could* reduce the concept
<br />
'pair of peas' to finite physical parts with which you could identify
<br />
the system.  In the case of an 'inifinite set' you cannot.  No finite
<br />
set of physical objects can be identified with an infinite set.   We
<br />
know inifinite sets are real because they are *indispensible* to our
<br />
explanations of reality (See 'Cantor').  This shows that there exist
<br />
high level concepts which *cannot* be broken to finite parts.
<br />
<br />Now there is a possible question mark here regarding the distinction
<br />
(as you pointed out) between mathematical reality and physical
<br />
reality.    That's why I gave yet another example below of something
<br />
which *is* clearly physical, yet also cannot be broken down into
<br />
seperate parts (the ontological category 'laws of physics').
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it doesn't stop there:  Science itself (via the notion of 'laws of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physics') uses concepts which are supposed to be *universal* in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; scope.  But universals by definition cannot be empirically identified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with any finite physical concept.  Again the very use of universals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ('laws of physics') actually falsifies the reductionist claims.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This reminds me of the consternation that the logical positivists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experienced with the verifiability principle for what was meaningful in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science - which is not itself subject to the verifiability principle!
</em><br />
<br />Correct!  Considerations like these are why logical positivism went
<br />
out of fashion.  the point is that even in the physical sciences there
<br />
exist high level concepts which cannot be reduced to the interactions
<br />
of finite physical things.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Still, I don't think this has any bearing on reductionism. The scientific method is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about how we are to go about discovering scientific truths, just as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adversarial method in a court of law is about how to decide guilt or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; innocence &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;. But the world is as it is regardless of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our methods of investigation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />But it *does* have a bearing of reductionism because the very term
<br />
*laws of physics* IS itself an ontology category!  The point is that
<br />
the physicals science use the concept *laws of physics* as an
<br />
ontological category, and this category requires explanation.
<br />
<br />We can quite legitimately ask: what does the concept *laws of physics*
<br />
refer to?  (Just as we asked , in the example you gave: what does the
<br />
concept *pair of peas* refer to).  In your example, we found that the
<br />
concept *pair of peas* could be broken down (reduced) to a lower level
<br />
description (ie. the system was indeed merely the sum of the parts).
<br />
But in the case of the concept *laws opf physics* we find that we
<br />
*cannot* break down (reduce) this concept to any finite set of
<br />
physical objects or processes.  It is also the case that the concept
<br />
*laws of physics* is *indispensible* to the scientific method, so it
<br />
cannot be argued away as some kind of semantic trick.
<br />
<br />We have here a clear example of an indispensible *physical* concept
<br />
which *cannot* be broken down or reduced to any finite lower level
<br />
descriptions.  This proves that reductive materialism is false.
