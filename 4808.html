<br />It is true that in the ensemble of all possible programs (that are all
<br />
equally valid by Tegmark&#x2019;s premise), the ones that go completely wacho
<br />
(and we cease to exist) exist but no one is there to observe it.
<br />
However it would seem there will be an enormous number in which we
<br />
indeed witness bizarre events like &#x201c;popping up pink elephants&#x201d;.    The
<br />
options seem to be either
<br />
<br />1.  Programs with a special rule that is waiting to fire at a given
<br />
time/place in order to cause a bizarre event are mathematically
<br />
impossible
<br />
<br />2.  Programs with such special rules hardly ever occur (in terms of the
<br />
ensemble); or
<br />
<br />3.  Programs with such special rules are common but we have been
<br />
extraordinarily lucky
<br />
<br />None of these options appear reasonable.   It seems that the simplistic
<br />
notion of a simulation on a computer is not tamper proof.  In the
<br />
ensemble of all possible programs we must accept arbitrarily complex
<br />
programs - we have no right to limit ourselves to programs that maintain
<br />
consistent &quot;physical law&quot; over time.  The invariants in physics all
<br />
point to a &quot;program&quot; for our universe that is tamper proof.  One
<br />
potential solution is that awareness only emerges in the totality of an
<br />
infinite computation.  This could be tamper proof because of a holistic
<br />
relationship between &quot;virtual time&quot; and &quot;simulation time&quot;.  Another
<br />
solution is that our universe is not computable in any sense.

<br />
<br />Hi, this is my second post. My name is Frank Cizmic and I'm a
<br />
computer Engineer from Uruguay.
<br />
David Barrett, I'd like to comment on one aspect of your reasoning with
<br />
which I have some doubts.
<br />
If I understand correctly, you are saying that *if* the universe is the
<br />
result of a &quot;program&quot;, then it is very strange that at any one point in
<br />
time this program doesn't &quot;go nuts&quot;, making strange things occur,
<br />
like popping pink elephants out of nowhere, or resisting prediction
<br />
by us sentient beings by violating its previous &quot;good behavior&quot;.
<br />
But what would, exactly, constitute &quot;strange behavior&quot; on the part of
<br />
the universe? One could argue that the universe can't go completely
<br />
wacko because we would cease to exist, and that would
<br />
violate, the anthropic principle.
<br />
So what would constitute &quot;strange&quot; behavior? Isn't life strange enough?
<br />
Aren't we facing new facts every day? If by strange you mean &quot;twilight
<br />
zone&quot; kind of events, wouldn't we eventually adjust to this and end by
<br />
considering it normal behavior. Isn't this, in a sense, what we
<br />
experience since birth? A wacky universe, that is always surprising us ,
<br />
but never to the point where we lose sanity. One could posit that we, in
<br />
a sense, would cease to be, if we lost our mental health. This might be
<br />
formulated like a variant of the anthropic principle. We always live in
<br />
a Universe that makes a minimum of &quot;sense&quot;, otherwise, our psyque would
<br />
eventually break down, and we would, essentially, cease to be.
<br />
 
<br />
cheers

<br />
happening in the future?
