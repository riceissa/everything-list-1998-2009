<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wonderful information...
</em><br />
<br />You are welcome. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have a couple of questions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Could you please define belief and knowledge in terms of a machine's states
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or potential states...
</em><br />
<br />I will define only believable and knowledgeable. It will not be done
<br />
directly in term of machine's state or potential states but in term of
<br />
provability (consistency) and truth. I will define it in some other
<br />
post.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is there a relationship between belief, knowledge, consistency and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;provability?
</em><br />
<br />That is a key question. At some point a form of communicable belief and
<br />
communicable knowledge will be defined with the notion of provability
<br />
consistency and truth, indeed.
<br />
Accepting those definitions could depend on the acceptance of some modal
<br />
logical axioms for those concept.
<br />
I could have proceed in another way and start directly from the
<br />
provability concept  bypassing all modal logics. But modal logic
<br />
will simplify greatly the reasoning and its translation in arithmetic.
<br />
And it helps also to illustrate classical logics.
<br />
Nevertheless the fundamental notion will be the godelian formal 
<br />
provability notion *beweisbar*.
<br />
<br />The pedagogical problem we will encounter here is that we must
<br />
explain how to translate *beweisbar* in formal aritmetic (which
<br />
BTW has not yet been defined) or in the language of the sound
<br />
machine (not yet defined too). This is easy but very long to do
<br />
in all details, and very tedious too: it looks a little like
<br />
defining higher concepts like addition, multiplication, sorting, in
<br />
some assembly languages. Perhaps I will, at that moment refer
<br />
you toward some books. One of the clearest exposition
<br />
is the one given by Godel himself in the original 1931 paper, which
<br />
has been published by Dover in 1992. It is cheap.
<br />
Using Church thesis it is also possible to bypasse that &quot;assembly
<br />
programming&quot; passage, but then some familiarity with theoretical
<br />
computer science is needed. Mmmh... We will see.
<br />
Let us try not to anticipate to much. But I aknowledge that some
<br />
time I should provide motivation, because if I don't, the list
<br />
will be completely sleepy when we will arrive to the interesting
<br />
matter (interesting with respect to the contemplation of the
<br />
plenitude!).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the physical world, if I see a supernova, then all the worlds within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;light cone of the supernova see it. Worlds outside the supernova's light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cone do not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Accessibility could also be defined in terms of information flow in a social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or economic environment. In a perfectly competitive market, perfect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information must be available to all buyers and sellers. So for example, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(lowest) price P for a particular item is known to be X. .Let this be p
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;defined as P=X. Then []p = p. When information flow is restricted, buyers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and sellers may not have the same information, and therefore []p = p for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;particular market segment but not for another.
</em><br />
<br />Interesting remarks. You will discover numerous similar applications of 
<br />
modal logic in the literature.
<br />
<br />You get a good intuition but for the sake of precision and shortness I 
<br />
will recall the definition of &quot;The frame (W,R) respects a modal 
<br />
sentence S&quot;, and state precisely some theorems, instead of commenting
<br />
precisely the rest of your post. But please continue to tell me
<br />
if you follow.
<br />
<br />(W, R) respects S    
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(where W is a set of &quot;worlds&quot;, and R an &quot;accessibility&quot; relation)
<br />
<br />means that 
<br />
<br />all model (W,R,V) satisfies S.  Where V are valuations. V transforms
<br />
the frame into a model, that is V attributes truth values to the
<br />
atomic propositions p, q, r, ... inside each world.
<br />
<br />I recall of course that a model (W,R,V) satisfies S if S is true
<br />
in all the worlds in W, when we take the valuation V.
<br />
<br />iff = an abreviation of if and only if, or &lt;=&gt; 
<br />
<br />I don't recall Kripke semantics, except that []p is true in w, if
<br />
p is true in all worlds accessible from w.
<br />
<br />I will say that a frame (W,R) is reflexive (resp. transitive, ...)
<br />
when R is reflexive (resp. transitive, ...). I will perhaps
<br />
do other &quot;abus de langage&quot; of this kind without mentionning.
<br />
<br /><br />Theorems:
<br />
<br />1.     (W,R) respects []p -&gt; p  iff  (W,R) is reflexive,
<br />
<br />2.     (W,R) respects []p -&gt; [][]p  iff  (W,R) is transitive,
<br />
<br />3.     (W,R) respects p -&gt; []&lt;&gt;p  iff  (W,R) is symmetric,
<br />
<br />4.      All frames respect  [](p-&gt;q) -&gt; ([]p -&gt; []q).
<br />
<br /><br />Let us prove 1. and 4. (I leave 2. and 3. as exercice)
<br />
<br />Proof of 1.
<br />
<br />Because of the &quot;iff&quot; we must prove two things.
<br />
<br />we must prove a) if R is reflexive then (W,R) respects []p -&gt; p,
<br />
and we must prove b) if (W,R) respects []p -&gt; p then R is reflexive.
<br />
<br />Let us prove a). 
<br />
To prove that &quot;if A then B&quot;, a traditional way consists in supposing
<br />
that we have A and  not B, and showing that this leads to a 
<br />
contradiction. (BTW you can verify that ((A &amp; -B) -&gt; FALSE) &lt;-&gt; (A-&gt;B))
<br />
is a tautology).
<br />
So, let us suppose that R is reflexive and that (W,R) does not
<br />
respect []p -&gt; p.
<br />
To say that (W,R) does not respect []p -&gt; p means that there is at
<br />
least one world w in which []p -&gt; p is false. Remember that worlds
<br />
obeys classical logic, so that if []p -&gt; p is false at w, it means
<br />
that []p is true at w and p is false at w (and -p is true at w).
<br />
But (by Kripke semantics) if []p is true at w, it means p is true 
<br />
at every world accessible from w. But R is reflexive, so we have wRw.
<br />
So p and -p are true at w. But then w does not obey to classical logic.
<br />
Contradiction.
<br />
<br />Let us prove b), that is: if (W,R) respects []p -&gt; p then R is 
<br />
reflexive.
<br />
Suppose (W,R) respects []p -&gt; p and that R is not reflexive.
<br />
And let us search a contradiction from that.
<br />
If R is not reflexive, it means that there is a world w in W such that
<br />
we don't have wRw. Let us build a model on that frame by defining
<br />
a valuation V such that V(p) = FALSE in w, and V(p) = TRUE on all
<br />
world accessible from w (if there is any(°)).
<br />
By Kripke semantics we have []p true in w. So now we have both
<br />
[]p and -p true at w. But we have suppose that (W,R) respects 
<br />
[]p -&gt; p, so []p -&gt; p is true at w, so p is true at w (because []p
<br />
has been shown true at w, and w obeys classical logic). But then
<br />
again p and -p are true at w. Contradiction.
<br />
<br />OK?   For theorems 2. and 3. you should perhaps find the proofs
<br />
yourself. It is almost more easy to find the proof than to read
<br />
someone else proof. The only difficulty is in the case b) and 
<br />
consists in finding the valuation which leads to the contradiction.
<br />
Hint: put V(p) = FALSE in w, and V(p) = TRUE on all
<br />
world accessible from w; or, for 3. put V(p) = TRUE in w, and 
<br />
V(p) = FALSE on all world accessible from w.
<br />
<br />(°) Hey! but what if w is a cul-de-sac or terminal world?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then []p, or even []False is always true in w. This follows
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;easily from classical logic: []p is true at w because
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;(it exists x such that wRx) entails p true at x&quot;, this
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last sentence is true because wRx is always false for a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terminal world, and &quot;false implies whatever you want&quot; is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always true.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way to swallow this tricky point is to remember
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that []p is -&lt;&gt;-p, but -&lt;&gt;(what you want) must be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;automatically true in a terminal world, by simple
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kripke semantics for &lt;&gt;.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terminal world are are disquieting: everything is necessary
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and nothing is possible in a terminal world.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><br />Proof of 4.
<br />
We want to show that [](p-&gt;q) -&gt; ([]p -&gt; []q) is respected in all
<br />
frames. This means [](p-&gt;q) -&gt; ([]p -&gt; []q) is true in all world
<br />
in all model in all frame!
<br />
<br />It will be easier to show that the theorem holds for the equivalent
<br />
sentence ([](p-&gt;q) &amp; []p) -&gt; []q
<br />
Do you see the equivalence? It is just propositional logic:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A -&gt; (B -&gt; C)    &lt;-&gt;   (A &amp; B) -&gt; C
<br />
<br />Suppose now that ([](p-&gt;q) &amp; []p) is true in some world w.
<br />
We must show []q is true in w.
<br />
If w is a terminal world then []q is automatically true as
<br />
we have seen above.
<br />
If w is not a terminal world, then there are worlds x, z, y ...
<br />
with wRx, wRz, wRy, ...
<br />
The fact that ([](p-&gt;q) &amp; []p) is true at w entails that
<br />
both [](p-&gt;q) and []p are true at w. But this, by Kripke
<br />
semantics, entails that both (p-&gt;q) and p are true in
<br />
the accessible worlds x, z, y, ..., and so, q is true
<br />
in all those worlds (all world obeys classical logics and are
<br />
thus closed for modus ponens). But if q is true in all
<br />
accessible worlds from w, then, by Kripke again, []q must be
<br />
true in w. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
<br />
<br />In fact some other frames will play an important role, so let us
<br />
introduce them now. (The definition which follows are somehow 
<br />
less standart).
<br />
<br />I will say, by definition, that a world is transitory iff it is
<br />
not terminal.
<br />
<br />A frame (W,R) will be said ideal if all worlds in W are transitory.
<br />
(there is simply no cul-de-sac worlds in an ideal frame).
<br />
<br />A frame will be said realist if there is a terminal world accessible
<br />
from any transitory world of that frame.
<br />
(You can &quot;die&quot; at every world in a realist frame, as you are
<br />
&quot;immortal&quot; in an ideal frame).
<br />
<br /><br />The corresponding theorems (exercice) are
<br />
<br />5.     (W,R) respects []p -&gt; &lt;&gt;p  iff  (W,R) is ideal,
<br />
<br />6.     (W,R) respects &lt;&gt;p -&gt; -[]&lt;&gt;p  iff  (W,R) is realist,
<br />
<br /><br />Do you have recognize &lt;&gt;p -&gt; -[]&lt;&gt;p ?
<br />
Yes. It is our modal form of Godel theorem (with TRUE instead of p).
<br />
More will be said.
<br />
<br />I hope your binder will not explode.
<br />
My next post will anticipate toward the end of my proof to glimpse
<br />
the &quot;quasi-appearance of Hilbert Space&quot; when we explain the UDA TE
<br />
to the guardian angel of the sound machine.
<br />
<br />And, just because you promise me a prize for deriving SE from
<br />
the &quot;psychology of machine&quot; I tell you that I have decided
<br />
to call the modal formula (the one for the symmetrical frame):
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p-&gt;[]&lt;&gt;p,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the little abstract Schroedinger Equation (LASE),
<br />
<br />as I have called before the (godel-like) formula 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt;p -&gt; -[]&lt;&gt;p
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the first theorem of machine's psychology. (FTMP)
<br />
<br />And our goal is to find a natural bridge from FTMP to LASE.
<br />
<br />I must say that I have believe for a quite long time that this was
<br />
impossible. But then when you take the definition of knowledge
<br />
belief, observation/perception in Plato's thaetetus, then the
<br />
aritmetical translation of the UDA TE will lead us directly toward 
<br />
the solution.
<br />
And so you will be obliged to give me the prize (at least
<br />
a little abstract price!). 
<br />
<br />Infinite thanks for your patience. All of you.
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
