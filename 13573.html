<br /><br />OK, so by necessary primitive, you mean the syntactic or microscopic

layer. But take this away, and you no longer have emergence. See
<br />
endless discussions on emergence - my paper, or Jochen Fromm's book for
<br />
instance. Does this mean &quot;magical emergence&quot; is oxymoronic?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can't use an object derived using the contents of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness(observation) to explain why there are any contents of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness(observation) at all. It is illogical. (see the wigner quote
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; below). I find the general failure to recognise this brute reality very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exasperating.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />People used to think that about life. How can you construct (eg an
<br />
animal) without having a complete discription of that animal. So how
<br />
can an animal self-reproduce without having a complete description of
<br />
itself. But this then leads to an infinite regress. 
<br />
<br />The solution to this conundrum was found in the early 20th century -
<br />
first with such theoretical constructs as combinators and lambda
<br />
calculus, then later the actual genetic machinery of life. If it is
<br />
possible in the case of self-reproduction, the  it will also likely to
<br />
be possible in the case of self-awareness and consciousness. Stating
<br />
this to illogical doesn't help. That's what people from the time of
<br />
Descartes thought about self-reproduction.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; COLIN

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So this means that in a computer abstraction.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RUSSEL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No its not. dK/dt is generated by the interaction of the rules with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No. No. No. There is the old assumption thing again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How, exactly, are you assuming that the agent 'interacts' with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment? This is the world external to the agent, yes?. Do not say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;through sensory measurement&quot;, because that will not do. There are an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite number of universes that could give rise to the same sensory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measurements. 
</em><br />
<br />All true, but how does that differ in the case of humans?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are elctromagnetic objects. Basic EM theory. Proven
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical theorems. The solutions are not unique for an isolated

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is _no interaction with the environment_ except for that provided by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the qualia as an 'as-if' proxy for the environment. The origins of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ability to access the distal external world in support of such a proxy is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mysterious but moot. It can and does happen, and that ability must come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about because we live in the kind of universe that supports that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility. The mysteriousness of it is OUR problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />You've lost me completely here. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; RUSSEL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Evolutionary algorithms are highly effective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information pumps, pumping information from the environment into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; genome, or whatever representation you're using to store the solutions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COLIN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then we're not talking about merely being 'highly effective'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a target problem domain, are we? We are talking about proving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness in a machine. I agree - evolutionary algoritms are great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things... they are just irrelevant to this discussion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />No, we're talking about doing science, actually, not proving
<br />
consciousness. And nothing indicates to me that science is any more
<br />
than a highly effective information pump finding regularities about
<br />
the world.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; RUSSEL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Bollocks. A hydrogen molecule and an oxygen atom held 1m apart have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemical potential, but there is precious little electric field
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am talking about the membrane and you are talking atoms so I guess we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; missed somehow...anyway....The only 'potentiation' that really matters in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my model is that which looks like an 'action potential' longitudinally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traversing dendrite/soma/axon membrane as a whole.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Notwithstanding this....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The chemical potentiation at the atomic level is entirely an EM phenomenon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mediated by QM boundaries (virtual photons in support of the shell
</em><br />
<br />I never said it wasn't an EM phenomenon. Just that chemical potential
<br />
is not an EM field. The confusion may arise because your head is full
<br />
of ionic chemistry (for which chemical potential is for all intents
<br />
and purposes identical to the electrical potential between the ions),
<br />
but there are two other types of chemical bonds - the covalent and the
<br />
hydrogen bond. Both of these types of bonds occur between neutral
<br />
molecules, for which the only electric field is the rather weak van
<br />
der Waals interaction.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; RUSSEL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You're obviously suggesting single neurons have qualia. Forgive me for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being a little sceptical of this suggestion...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are so many good reasons to hold them accountable ..... Read the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recent book by Jon Edwards...In any event - I hold the FIELD accountable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The fact that it happens to be delivered by astrocytes/neuron membranes is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incidental. If you have to be skeptical about something, please be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; skeptical about the right thing for a good reason!
</em><br />
<br />Neurophysiology is not my field. I await the announcement of the Nobel
<br />
prize committee awarding you a prize for this discovery with
<br />
interest. In the meantime, I'll just go back to my evolutionary
<br />
agents, and retain my scepticism about your claims.
<br />
<br />Cheers
