<br />
I've been a little quiet over the last couple of weeks - blame it on
<br />
the dreaded lurgi.
<br />
<br />I am posting a followup to the conversation I was having with Bruno
<br />
about COMP. The first thing is that I agree with his conclusions, that
<br />
the ontology between psychology and physics is reversed. (At least in
<br />
the sense that Bruno is using this phrase!) This is the conclusion of
<br />
my Occam paper. Obviously, Church's thesis is assumed implicitly, and
<br />
the strong form of arithmetical realism taken, Schmidhuber
<br />
style. However, where I differ is Bruno's assumption 1), that is of
<br />
survival under replacement by a Turing emulation. Since this
<br />
assumption is independent of the other two (I had been calling it
<br />
COMP), it should have a different name, SURV, say.
<br />
<br />Instead, I make two additional assumptions: 1) time, and 2)
<br />
projection. I try to normalise the comparison by making a stronger
<br />
assumption, ie that I am actually a Turing emulation already - clearly
<br />
satisfying SURV. Clearly, time will be implied by this, but I'm not
<br />
sure what the status of projection is.
<br />
<br />Now consider a slight variation of Bruno's copying machine, one which
<br />
has two buttons marked &quot;W&quot; and &quot;M&quot;. Pressing the relevant button sends
<br />
me to Washington or Moscow. A Turing emulation walks into the machine,
<br />
closes the door. Before that emulation can press the button, the
<br />
outcome is decided. Knowing the precise state of the Turing emulation
<br />
prior to entering the enclosed chamber which admits no firther
<br />
stimulation from the outside world, one can predict with certainty
<br />
which button will be pressed.
<br />
<br />Now a conscious entity equipped with a real random number generator -
<br />
eg amplifying thermal noise across a synapse by means of a chaotic
<br />
network - enters the chamber. This time, we're allowed to read all the
<br />
potentials present in the brain, but we cannot predict the result of
<br />
the random number generation. We can only assign a probability
<br />
distribution between the &quot;W&quot; and the &quot;M&quot; button being predicted.
<br />
<br />So, from the &quot;God's eye&quot; view, looking at this particular quantum
<br />
history, in one case, there is only one continuation, in the other
<br />
there is two. So one is not the same as the other. However, look at it
<br />
from the first person point of view, ie the being that is entering the
<br />
teleporter. Since one can efficiently construct a pseudo random number
<br />
generator that will fool any particular observer (as has been pointed
<br />
out already in this list), the Turing emulation may well believe that
<br />
it has a free choice in deciding which button to press. It has the
<br />
&quot;illusion&quot; of free will only. The question is whether we actually have
<br />
real free will, and whether this really matters!
<br />
<br />Certainly in the everyday environment, we are swamped by randomly
<br />
generated information. It is a moot point whether this dominates our
<br />
internal sources of randomness. If it does, then a Turing emulation
<br />
would have as much free choice as do we.
<br />
<br />So clearly, if I actually made use of this randomness, I would be
<br />
losing something by being turned into a Turing emulation. On the other
<br />
hand, it may not really matter. As a consequence, I would have no
<br />
faith to enter one of Bruno's machines, knowing I could be potentially
<br />
losing a source of my creativeness.
<br />
