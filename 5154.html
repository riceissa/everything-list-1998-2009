</em><br />
<br />Life is an universal CA (it is possible to implement Life in Life e.g.), 
<br />
but not all universal CAs are suitably structure to
<br />
support emergence of life from a random pattern.
<br />
<br />Biggest problem is translation, Life doesn't support translation of large
<br />
blocks, so you have to implement storage/copy, it doesn't have noniteractive
<br />
particles natively, it doesn't conserve noise naturally (you get increasingly
<br />
rare splotches of noise of gliders colliding with stationary/evolving
<br />
structures).
<br />
<br />You could implement a more suitable CA (or any other machine) in Life, but it
<br />
couldn't emerge naturally (it would have a huge cell unit size), and it's not
<br />
obvious it could eventually overgrow the entire substrate, once emerged
<br />
(there might be tricks with perimeter guards, etc., but the whole point is
<br />
that Life is pretty hostile to emergence of life.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I want to say, vastly more rare than in our universe, but of course we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't know how rare life actually is in our universe, so that may be a
</em><br />
<br />It would be nice if we could find several independently emerged life
<br />
nucleation points in our solar system (difficult, given the high rates of
<br />
crosscontamination through impact ejecta).
<br />
<br />If we don't find them, the emergence of local life is of course causally
<br />
linked to us, so it's still biased by the anthropic principle. We need other
<br />
data points, maybe from nearby systems.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; hard claim to justify.  But the point is that our universe has stable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures; it has atoms of dozens of different varieties, which can form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncountable millions of stable molecules.  It has mechanisms to generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; varieties of these different molecules and collect them together in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environments where they can react in interesting ways.  We don't have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; full picture of how life and consciousness evolved, but looking around,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it doesn't seem like it should have been THAT hard, which is where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fermi paradox comes from.  In many ways, our universe seems tailor made
</em><br />
<br />There's not much of a paradox, if you look at Fermi from anthropic principle
<br />
angle. And we absolutely can't say how probable emergence of an advanced
<br />
culture is (given the above).  We have been leading unusually sheltered
<br />
lifes, and there's nothing particularly obvious about us coming into being
<br />
scant few 100 megayears before the curtain falls on life in the local
<br />
environment.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; for creating observers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In contrast, in the Life world there are no equivalents to atoms or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecules, no chemical reactions.  It's too chaotic; there's not enough
</em><br />
<br />Life's about patterns, not atoms or reactions. I agree that Life is sterile,
<br />
however, and there are no obvious tweaks in how make it work better.
<br />
<br />However, most digital physics people seem to think the unit cell is at Planck
<br />
scale, or below, and I have absolutely no idea how a Plack scale life would
<br />
look like on macroscale, considering how much volume one has, and how many
<br />
iterations occur there.
<br />
<br />I never figured out how to get rid of grid assymetries shining through to
<br />
macroscale, and how to generate rule tables with conservation laws intact,
<br />
but then there are perfectly spherical sound waves, and wave interferece in
<br />
stupid lattice gas automata, of all things.
<br />
<br />That's pretty surprising, so perhaps it doesn't make sense to rule out too
<br />
much yet.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure.  Replicators and life seem to require a balance between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chaos and stasis, and Life is far too dynamic.  It just looks to me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like it would be almost impossible for replicators to arise naturally.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Almost impossible, but not absolutely impossible, so if you tried enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; initial conditions as you suggest, it would happen.  I won't belabor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this argument unless you disagree about the ease with which life might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arise in a Life universe, and consciousness evolve.
</em><br />
<br />I'd rather amazed to see large assemblies capable of translation in Life
<br />
universe, already.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that those are too parochial.  But as I recall he had a number of broad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguments that would apply even to a Life-like universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This was the motivation for the idea I proposed a few days ago, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for applying anthropic reasoning, a universe should get a &quot;bonus&quot; if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it had a high density of observers, rather than merely a high absolute
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure how that follows, using anthropic principle and relativistic
<br />
pioneer expansion wavefront (which directly follows from Darwin, and
<br />
current knowledge of propulsion methods) the Fermi paradoxon completely 
<br />
disappears.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of them.  It's too easy to create universes with low-density
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers, as your example of Life suggests.  But just as the existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a counting program does not give a typical integer a low complexity,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so the existence of universes that are simple but contain super-rare
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life forms should not give those observers a high measure.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not following you here. How does the fact that we observe our existance
<br />
follow from prediction that this universe is likely to be teeming with life?
