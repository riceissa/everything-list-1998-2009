<br />
Regarding observer-moments:
<br />
<br />This is a good question because it provides an opportunity to explain the 
<br />
reason behind the idea of observer-moments (OM). Essentially, OM is the 
<br />
minimum unit of conscious experience. It is sometimes taken as being 
<br />
instantaneous, but if this presents theoretical problems, it can be 
<br />
redefined as observer-second or whatever you think the minimum should be. An 
<br />
individual's identity, or conscious experience over a period of time, is 
<br />
then constructed from a series of OM. &quot;Constructed&quot; in this context does not 
<br />
necessarily mean that any particular physical process takes place to string 
<br />
the OM's together. Most familiarly, there *is* a physical process doing just 
<br />
this: namely, the OM's follow (more precisely, supervene) in sequence from 
<br />
the electrochemical reactions in an individual brain. However, and this is 
<br />
the crucial insight, there is no reason to think that functionally the same 
<br />
multi-OM conscious interval cannot occur if the OM's are separated widely in 
<br />
time, space, or even across branches of the MW which can have no physical 
<br />
connection. This is because the OM's are &quot;connected&quot; only by virtue of their 
<br />
information content, which can transcend time, space, or being in different 
<br />
universes. This does not necessarily mean that any actual information 
<br />
transfer has to take place; it suffices that the relationship between the 
<br />
widely separated OM's is the same as it would have been if the information 
<br />
transfer had taken place in the usual way, such as in a functioning brain. 
<br />
For example, if I have the thought, &quot;I am counting 1,2,3 bananas...&quot; and by 
<br />
chance somewhere else in the multiverse there arises a sentient computer 
<br />
program which believes it is me, has the same memories as me up to that 
<br />
point, and continues &quot;...4,5,6 bananas&quot;, then that latter computer program, 
<br />
although it has no physical connection to me and indeed could not even have 
<br />
possibly obtained any information from me in this universe, nevertheless 
<br />
will experience being me in the same way as if I had continued counting 
<br />
bananas in this universe in the usual manner.
<br />
<br />A consequence of the above is that it does not make sense to talk about 
<br />
where your consciousness &quot;really&quot; is, or whether it really is the &quot;same&quot; 
<br />
individual accross different instantiations, because a multi-OM conscious 
<br />
interval can be defined any way you like. You can decide that if an OM 
<br />
deviates sufficiently from some arbitrary standard, then that is a new 
<br />
individual. You can also have multiple instances of the &quot;same&quot; individual 
<br />
running in the same or different universes. The only absolute is the OM, and 
<br />
everything else is a construct.
<br />
<br />Superficially, this may all seem a bit strange: why bother? The reason I was 
<br />
driven to this view was from consideration of the philosophical problem of 
<br />
personal identity. It may seem straightforward that you are the same person 
<br />
as you were last year, but every atom in your body may be different, in a 
<br />
different configuration, and giving rise to different memories and other 
<br />
mental properties. (It may seem that at least the latter two are identical, 
<br />
but the similarity over even a relatively short time period is only 
<br />
approximate). Add to this the result of multiple thought experiments: what 
<br />
if your future self from next week came back in time; what if you were 
<br />
exactly duplicated via a Star Trek-type teleporter; what if you were 
<br />
resurrected in Heaven; what about the multiple near-exact copies of you in 
<br />
other branches of the MW; what about mind uploads; and so on. The only way 
<br />
to avoid the paradoxes of multiple identities is to accept that every 
<br />
apparent &quot;identity&quot; is a separate entity, and moreover that every moment of 
<br />
every apparent identity is a separate entity. This leads directly to the 
<br />
concept of the observer-moment, and the paradoxes disappear.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course, many of you (maybe all) may be defining pasts from an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information-theoretic point of view, i.e. by identifying all

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer-moments in the multiverse which are equivalent as perceived by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the observer; in which case the above point is quite irrelevant. (But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; still have to distinguish the different branches to find the total

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for each OM).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hi,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I thought of Observer Moment as containing the observer... What is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of an OM (the same) which spread accross branches ? If you start by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumption that OM are fundamental, then a &quot;branch&quot; is an OM. Or a branch 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a consistent succession of OM ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the split forever is correct, then does a consciousness spread accross 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;those branch where the OM is in ? or just in one branch, and in other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;branches with the same OM, this is not the same consciousness ? If the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;later,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;why can it be said that it is in fact the same OM ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I apologize for the apparent mix of questions, and the &quot;bad&quot; english... 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hope
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you understand what I wanted to say ;)
