Re the hypotheses---Social scientists, astronomers and CSI agents are the 
<br />
only ones I'm aware of who routinely evaluate events after the fact.  The 
<br />
best, IMHO, such as the historian Toynbee, fit facts to a model. At it's 
<br />
worst, the model becomes the event and before long we're deep in 
<br />
reification (the Achilles heel of Structural Functionalism) or that 
<br />
favorite of lazy reporters, *abduction* (this is our favorite explanation, 
<br />
so that must be what happened.)  Mathematicians, philosophers and those 
<br />
with a good math and logic background prefer their battles timeless and 
<br />
relatively absent of worldly references.  Great theater, but as Scott 
<br />
Berkun noted in his excellent 
<br />
article&lt;&lt;<a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/essay40.htm">http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/essay40.htm</a>&gt;&gt; just because the 
<br />
logic holds together, doesn't mean it's true.  Or correct.  Or 
<br />
anything--other than consistent.
<br />
<br />But logic is an inestimable tool if used to evaluate models such as those 
<br />
proposed, developed and ridden into the dirt by many prominent social 
<br />
scientists.  It is always refreshing to see a lumbering behemoth like 
<br />
structural functionalism (a sociological model) dismantled by a skilled 
<br />
logician who knows reification when he sees it (saw a little of that with 
<br />
Lee Corbins' excellent rant.)  But it would be even better to see these 
<br />
tools applied to truly strange events that take place in the real 
<br />
world---things that Sheldrake writes about, for example.   Things that 
<br />
*happen* to us all.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, that's not likely to happen.  It's the knee-jerk reaction of 
<br />
most mathematicians and logicians to deride real world events as 
<br />
&quot;coincidence,&quot; when in fact, they are comparing the event to mathematical 
<br />
certainty, and logical clarity.  They might say, &quot;Why evaluate Sheldrake's 
<br />
&quot;precognitive&quot; dogs in terms of a physics model, because Sheldrake's dogs 
<br />
are not really precognitive.&quot;  That protocol (if you can call it that) 
<br />
doesn't even rise to the level of *bad* abduction.   It's a protocol that 
<br />
closes doors rather than opens them, is not designed to divine new 
<br />
information, and is neither analytic *nor* synthetic.  Worst of all, it 
<br />
claims to be science when it fact, it is preordained belief.  In other 
<br />
words, it's okay to bend the rules and prejudge a variable as long as you 
<br />
first call it &quot;rubbish.&quot;
<br />
<br />Slip-ups aside,  I would like to see a rigorous application of the powerful 
<br />
tools of philosophy, logic and mathematics applied to the study areas of 
<br />
social science, i.e. the real world.  Physicists are great at telling us 
<br />
why the rings of Saturn have braids, but terrible (or worse than that, 
<br />
dismissive) of events that occur involving consciousness. (Social 
<br />
scientists are no better---they fall back on things like structural 
<br />
functionalism).  I suggest its time for the social scientists to let the 
<br />
logicians and mathematicians have a look at the data, and it's time for the 
<br />
logicians and mathematicians to enter the real world and make an honest 
<br />
attempt at trying to explain some strange phenomena.
<br />
<br />That asking too much?
<br />
<br />RM
