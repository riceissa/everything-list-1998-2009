<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that an observer must be physically instantiated - that seems well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supported empirically.  As it is used a &quot;observer moment&quot; seems to mean a unit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of subjective experience.  That there is an &quot;observer&quot;, i.e. something with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuity over many such subjective experiences, must be an inference or a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construct within the theory.
</em><br />
<br />Personally, I would agree. But many here contend that abstract
<br />
patterns---mathematical stings, really---can do *so* much cross-
<br />
referencing and quoting of each other that a form of paste obtains
<br />
that wields them in to something capable of having experiences.
<br />
But a familiar abstract object, namely the real numbers between zero
<br />
and one, evidently already does all of that (considering the decimal
<br />
or binary expressions), and so I'm not sure what remains for the
<br />
more abstruse inhabitants of Platonia to do.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Yes, that's the simplest explanation! We have to suppose that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;physical objects continue to encode previously gained information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;in the default case.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know that &quot;we have to&quot;.  I've know idealists who suppose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that our memories are part of our immaterial spirits.  But they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a hard time explaining the limitations of memory.
</em><br />
<br />Such idealists have a hard time being credible at all, if you
<br />
ask me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But what John was perhaps saying---and what I would certainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; claim along with all the adherents of &quot;observer-moments&quot;, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; think---is that any particular version of you at any particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; moment is not conscious of the facts encoded in all your memories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Hence the idea that an observer-moment is the net intersection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; across the multiverse and across other planetary systems of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; particular sense-perception experience of a particular person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But if, for each subjective experience, there is no way to uniquely associate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it with a sequence of subjective experiences, i.e. every such experience has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many predecessors and successors, then I don't see how such sequences can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constitute a particular person(s).
</em><br />
<br />I agree. That is, freed of memory, just how are all those subjective
<br />
moments linked in a particular ordered sequence? I also agree with
<br />
your statement, when *persons* (as you write) are being considered.
<br />
I'll admit that there is something---but not very much---associated
<br />
with a person that has nothing to do with the person's memories.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems in these discussions that the existence of such sequences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding to a particular person, an &quot;observer&quot;, is taken for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; granted.  It is a natural model given that observers are physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things - but it is problematic if physics is thrown out and you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; start from nothing but &quot;observer moments&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Well said. A natural model does give us that observers are 
<br />
physical things, or at least *necessarily* instantiated in
<br />
physical things. And I agree that starting from nothing but
<br />
observer-moments won't take us any further than it took
<br />
William James <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/james/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/james/</a>
<br />
<br />I can't blame the ancients and moderns up to the 19th century
<br />
for being dualists. It seemed utterly impossible that mere
<br />
atoms in motion could give rise to such as we. But the painful
<br />
---and painstaking---defeat of vitalism achieved finally in
<br />
the 20th century leaves it the simplest hypothesis by far to
<br />
say that we are machines. Our &quot;souls&quot; and we arise by natural
<br />
means, just as do streams and mountains.
<br />
<br />Observer-moments seems to arise simply from observers, and
<br />
observers arise simply from highly intelligent mammals (or
<br />
aliens) who can think about their own thinking. Unless you
<br />
want (which is probably a good idea) to regard even
<br />
photographic plates and other matter upon which impressions
<br />
can be made as *observers*.
