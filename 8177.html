<br />This idea looks like it's pretty similar to LeSage's &quot;pushing gravity&quot; 
<br />
theory--there's an article on it at 
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeSage_gravity">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeSage_gravity</a> which points out fatal flaws in 
<br />
the the idea. It's also discussed in the second chapter of Richard Feynman's 
<br />
&quot;The Character of Physical Law&quot;, I'll quote the relevant section here:
<br />
<br />On the other hand, take Newton's law for gravitation, which has the aspects 
<br />
I discussed last time. I gave you the equation:
<br />
<br />F=Gmm'/r^2
<br />
<br />just to impress you with the speed with which mathematical symbols can 
<br />
convey information. I said that the force was proportional to the product of 
<br />
the masses of two objects, and inversely as the square of the distance 
<br />
between them, and also that bodies react to forces by changing their speeds, 
<br />
or changing their motions, in the direction of the force by amounts 
<br />
proportional to the force and inversely proportional to their masses. Those 
<br />
are words all right, and I did not necessarily have to write the equation. 
<br />
Nevertheless it is kind of mathematical, and we wonder how this can be a 
<br />
fundamental law. What does the planet do? Does it look at the sun, see how 
<br />
far away it is, and decide to calculate on its internal adding machine the 
<br />
inverse of the square of the distance, which tells it how much to move? This 
<br />
is certainly no explanation of the machinery of gravitation! You might want 
<br />
to look further, and various people have tried to look further. Newton was 
<br />
originally asked about his theory--'But it doesn't mean anything--it doesn't 
<br />
tell us anything'. He said, 'It tells you how it moves. That should be 
<br />
enough. I have told you how it moves, not why.' But people are often 
<br />
unsatisfied without a mechanism, and I would like to describe one theory 
<br />
which has been invented, among others, of the type you migh want. This 
<br />
theory suggests that this effect is the result of large numbers of actions, 
<br />
which would explain why it is mathematical.
<br />
<br />Suppose that in the world everywhere there are a lot of particles, flying 
<br />
through us at very high speed. They come equally in all directions--just 
<br />
shooting by--and once in a while they hit us in a bombardment. We, and the 
<br />
sun, are practically transparent for them, practically but not completely, 
<br />
and some of them hit. ... If the sun were not there, particles would be 
<br />
bombarding the earth from all sides, giving little impuleses by the rattle, 
<br />
bang, bang of the few that hit. This will not shake the earth in any 
<br />
particular direction, because there are as many coming from one side as from 
<br />
the other, from top as from bottom. However, when the sun is there the 
<br />
particles which are coming from that direction are partially absorbed by the 
<br />
sun, because some of them hit the sun and do not go through. Therefore the 
<br />
number coming from the sun's direction towards the earth is less than the 
<br />
number coming from the other sides, because they meet an obstacle, the sun. 
<br />
It is easy to see that the farther the sun is away, of all the possible 
<br />
directions in which particles can come, a smaller proportion of the 
<br />
particles are being taken out. The sun will appear smaller--in fact 
<br />
inversely as the square of the distance. Therefore there will be an impulse 
<br />
on the earth towards the sun that varies inversely as the square of the 
<br />
distance. And this will be the result of a large number of very simple 
<br />
operations, just hits, one after the other, from all directions. Therefore 
<br />
the strangeness of the mathematical relation will be very much reduced, 
<br />
because the fundamental operation is much simpler than calculating the 
<br />
inverse of the square of the distance. This design, with the particles 
<br />
bouncing, does the calculation.
<br />
<br />The only trouble with this scheme is that it does not work, for other 
<br />
reasons. Every theory that you make up has to be analysed against all 
<br />
possible consequences, to see if it predicts anything else. And this does 
<br />
predict something else. If the earth is moving, more particles will hit it 
<br />
from in front than from behind. (If you are running in the rain, more rain 
<br />
hits you in the front of the face than in the back of the head, because you 
<br />
are running into the rain.) So, if the earth is moving it is running into 
<br />
the particles coming towards it and away from the ones that are chasing it 
<br />
from behind. So more particles will hit it from the front than from the 
<br />
back, and there will be a force opposing any motion. This force would slow 
<br />
the earth up in its orbit, and it certainly would not have lasted the three 
<br />
of four billion years (at least) that it has been going around the sun. So 
<br />
that is the end of that theory. 'Well,' you say, 'it was a good one, and I 
<br />
got rid of the mathematics for a while. Maybe I could invent a better one.' 
<br />
Maybe you can, because nobody knows the ultimate. But up to today, from the 
<br />
time of Newton, no one has invented another theoretical description of the 
<br />
mathematical machinery behind this law which does not either say the same 
<br />
thing over again, or make the mathematics harder, or predict some wrong 
<br />
phenomena. So there is no model of the theory of gravity today, other than 
<br />
the mathematical form.
<br />
<br />If this were the only law of this character it would be interesting and 
<br />
rather annoying. But what turns out to be true is that the more we 
<br />
investigate, the more laws we find, and the deeper we penetrate nature, the 
<br />
more this disease persists. Every one of our laws is a purely mathematical 
<br />
statement in rather complex and abstruse mathematics.
