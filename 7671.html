<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; evidence, about which models are inherently more likely to be true or not.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In practice we use coherence with other theories to guide out choice.  With

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that kind of constraint we may have trouble finding even one candidate

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory.
</em><br />
<br />Well, in principle there still should be an infinite number of theories,
<br />
starting with &quot;the data is completely random and just happens to
<br />
look lawful by sheer coincidence&quot;.  I think the difficulty we have in
<br />
finding new ones is that we are implicitly looking for small ones, which
<br />
means that we implicitly believe in Occam's Razor, which means that we
<br />
implicitly adopt something like the Universal Distribution, a priori.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We begin with an intuitive physics that is hardwired into us by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolution.  And that includes mathematics and logic.  Ther's an excellent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; little book on this, &quot;The Evolution of Reason&quot; by Cooper.
</em><br />
<br />No doubt this is true.  But there are still two somewhat-related problems.
<br />
One is, you can go back in time to the first replicator on earth, and
<br />
think of its evolution over the ages as a learning process.  During this
<br />
time it learned this &quot;intuitive physics&quot;, i.e. mathematics and logic.
<br />
But how did it learn it?  Was it a Bayesian-style process?  And if so,
<br />
what were the priors?  Can a string of RNA have priors?
<br />
<br />And more abstractly, if you wanted to design a perfect learning machine,
<br />
one that makes observations and optimally produces theories based on
<br />
them, do you have to give it prior beliefs and expectations, including
<br />
math and logic?  Or could you somehow expect it to learn those?  But to
<br />
learn them, what would be the minimum you would have to give it?
<br />
<br />I'm trying to ask the same question in both of these formulations.
<br />
On the one hand, we know that life did it, it created a very good (if
<br />
perhaps not optimal) learning machine.  On the other hand, it seems like
<br />
it ought to be impossible to do that, because there is no foundation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Mathematics and logic are more than models of reality.  They are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; pre-existent and guide us in evaluating the many possible models of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reality which exist.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'd say they are *less* than models of reality.  They are just consistency
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conditions on our models of reality.  They are attempts to avoid talking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nonsense.  But note that not too long ago all the weirdness of quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanics and relativity would have been regarded as contrary to logic.
</em><br />
<br />I guess we could agree that they are &quot;other&quot; than models of reality?
<br />
It still strikes me as paradoxical: ultimately we have learned our
<br />
intuitions about mathematics and logic from reality, via the mechanisms
<br />
of evolution and also our own individual learning experiences.  And yet
<br />
it seems that at some level a degree of logic, and certain mathematical
<br />
assumptions, are necessary to get learning off the ground in the first
<br />
place, and that they should not depend on reality.
<br />
<br />I'm pretty confused about this right now.
