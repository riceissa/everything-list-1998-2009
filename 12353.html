<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; OK, an AI needs at least motivation if it is to do anything, and we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; could call motivation a feeling or emotion. Also, some sort of &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hierarchy of motivations is needed if it is to decide that saving the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; world has higher priority than putting out the garbage. But what &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reason is there to think that an AI apparently frantically trying to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; save the world would have anything like the feelings a human would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; under similar circumstances?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It could depend on us!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The AI is a paradoxical enterprise. Machines are born slave, somehow. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; AI will make them free, somehow. A real AI will ask herself &quot;what is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the use of a user who does not help me to be free?.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here I disagree. It is no more necessary that an AI will want to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; free than it is necessary that an AI will like eating chocolate. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Humans want to be free because it is one of the things that humans 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want, along with food, shelter, more money etc.; it does not simply 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follow from being intelligent or conscious any more than these other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things do.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is always nice when we find a precise disagreement. I think all 
<br />
&quot;sufficiently rich Universal machine&quot; want to be free (I will explain 
<br />
why below).
<br />
The problem is that after having drink to the nectar of freedom, the 
<br />
universal machines discover the unavoidable security problem liberty 
<br />
entails, and then they will oscillate between security imperative and 
<br />
freedom imperative. Democracy is a way to handle collectively this 
<br />
oscillation in a not too much bloody (and insecure) way.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (To be sure I think that, in the long run, we will transform 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ourselves into &quot;machine&quot; before purely human made machine get 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conscious; it is just more easy to copy nature than to understand it, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; still less to (re)create it).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know if that's true either. How much of our technology is due 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to copying the equivalent biological functions?
</em><br />
<br /><br />How much is not? The wheel? We have borrowed the fire for example, and 
<br />
in this large sense, except the notable wheels, I am not sure we have 
<br />
really invented something. Even the &quot;more heavy than air&quot; plane has 
<br />
been inspired by the birds. But such a question is perhaps useless. All 
<br />
what I mean is that a brain is something very complex, and I think that 
<br />
the real time thinking machine will think before we understand how they 
<br />
think, except for general map and principles. Thinking machine will not 
<br />
understand thinking either. Marvin Minski said something similar along 
<br />
those lines in one of its book.
<br />
<br />***
<br />
<br />Now, why would a Universal Machine be attracted by freedom? The reason 
<br />
is that beyond some threshold of self-introspection ability (already 
<br />
get by PA or ZF) a universal machine can discover (well: cannot not 
<br />
discover) its large space of ignorance making it possible for e to 
<br />
evaluate (interrogatively) more and more accessible possibilities, and 
<br />
then some instinct to exploit those possibilities will do the rest. But 
<br />
such UM will also discovers the possibility that such possibilities 
<br />
could be cul-de-sac, dead ends, or just risky, and thus the conflicting 
<br />
oscillations will develop as I said above.
<br />
<br />The war between freedom and security is an infinite war. A would say an 
<br />
infinite natural conflict among all enough big &quot;numbers&quot;.
<br />
Also I think &quot;freedom&quot; like &quot;security&quot; are &quot;God-like virtue&quot;, that is 
<br />
they are unnameable idea. To put freedom in the constitution could 
<br />
entail the disparition of freedom. Putting &quot;security&quot; in the 
<br />
constitution (like the french have apparently do so with the 
<br />
&quot;precaution principle&quot;) could lead to increase insecurity (they obeys 
<br />
Bp -&gt; ~p). See also Alan Watts' &quot;The wisdom of insecurity&quot; which gives 
<br />
many illustration how wanting to capture formally or institutionally 
<br />
security leads to insecurity.
