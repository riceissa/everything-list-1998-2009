<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The requirement that computations require counterfactuals isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ad hoc, it comes from the observation that computer programmes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; include if-then statements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea that everyting is conscious unless there is a good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reason it isn't -- *that* is ad hoc!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, it follows from the idea that anything can be a computation. I think this is trivially obvious,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like saying any string of apparently random characters is a translation of any English sentence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of similar or shorter length, and if you have the correct dictionary, you can find out what that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; English sentence is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; But that is actually quite a dubious idea. For one thing there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; is an objective basis for claiming that one meaning is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;real&quot; meaning, and that is the meaning intended by the writer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There might have been a particular meaning intended by the writer, but remember materialism: all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you have really is ink on paper, and neither the ink nor the paper knows anything about where it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; came from or what it means. Suppose a stream of gibberish is created today by the proverbial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; monkeys typing away randomly, and just by chance it turns out that this makes sense as a novel in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a language that will be used one thousand years from now. Is it correct to say that the monkeys'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; manuscript has a certain meaning today?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the &quot;intention&quot; criterion is correct it doesn't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is your point ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Or is it meaningless today, but meaningful in a thousand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; years? If the latter, does it suddenly become meaningful when the new language is defined, or when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; someone who understands the new language actually reads it? What if the manuscript never comes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to light, or if it comes to light and is read but after another thousand years every trace of the language
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; has disappeared?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If it was created intentionally, it had a menaing. The fact that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can become lost does not affect that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't think it makes sense to say that the manuscript has intrinsic meaning; rather, it has meaning in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the mind of an observer. Similarly, with a computation implemented on a computer, I don't think it makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sense to say that it has meaning except in its interaction with the environment or in the mind of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why should computations have meaning at all ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe the criteria for something being a computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are different fromt he criteria for something being a written message.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  Any string of characters or any physical process can be seen as implementing a language or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a computation, if you have the right &quot;dictionary&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not by the intentionallity criterion.
</em><br />
<br />I think the meaning can lie with the reader as well as the writer. If you find a piece of paper with something 
<br />
written on it in English, then later discover that it was written by someone illiterate in that language who was 
<br />
just stringing random letters together, we could say that the message does not contain the meaning intended by 
<br />
the writer, but that is not the same as saying that it has no meaning at all.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There is a very interesting special case of this if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; allow that some computations can be self-aware, in the absence of any environmental interaction or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; external observer: by definition, they are their own observer and thus they bootstrap themselves into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming that computation requires interpretation. Maybe it doesn't.
</em><br />
<br />Computation is like the message on the paper in that it has potential meaning only until someone interprets it. I'm 
<br />
not that fussed if you say &quot;potential meaning&quot; is a type of &quot;meaning&quot;, but in any case the potential meaning of a 
<br />
message or a computation is not very interesting until it is observed and understood. In this scheme, the computations 
<br />
that can observe themselves are marked as special in having actual (as opposed to potential) meaning without an 
<br />
external observer.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; For another, your translations would have to be complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; and arbitrary, which goes against the ususal modus operandi
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of seeking simple and consistent explanations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It may be inefficient, but that does not mean it is invalid.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It *is* invalid by the standards of physical science.
</em><br />
<br />There is a difference between validity and efficiency. Cutting a tunnel through a mountain with a teaspoon 
<br />
might be foolish, but it is not in the slightest degree less theoretically possible because of that.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is analogous to finding an alien computer which, when power is applied,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is set into motion like an inscrutable Rube Goldberg machine. If you get your hands on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computer manual, you might be able to decipher the machine's activity as calculating pi.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; You might not need the manual. Numbers don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; have arbitrary semantics in the same way words do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; That's why SETI uses mathematical transmissions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Mathematical truths are eternal and observer-independent, but mathematical notation certainly is not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; SETI assumes that there will likely be greater similarities in how different species express mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; statements than in their non-mathematical communication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Something that would only be possible if maths did not have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same arbitrary semantics as natural language.
</em><br />
<br />I think the advantage of mathematics is that there would be more universal agreement on mathematical 
<br />
theorems, and the notation and syntax is inherently simpler than natural language.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There is nothing to stop the aliens using a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mathematical notation that varies according to the moods of their emperor or something, making their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; broadcasts of mathematical theorems seem completely random to us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If they understood the nature of mathematics, they would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realise that their approach *is* arbitrary.
</em><br />
<br />But it could be done. They might broadcast the decimal expansion of pi by multiplying the nth digit by the least 
<br />
significant digit of the emperor's mass on the nth hour of his life, because everyone knows that is what you 
<br />
have to do if you want to send a message to God. It's pretty stupid, but then there are apparently educated 
<br />
people today who are convinced the world was created in six days, and most of them probably live in America.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Maybe that's why we haven't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; recognised them yet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; It is also something Everythingist arguments rely on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; You can't exist as a computation in a numbers-only universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; if computations require external interpretation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The computation is a mathematical object that exists in Platonia. The implementation of a computation on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a physical computer so that we can observe it is something else. It is like the difference between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; number 3 and a collection of 3 oranges.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do computations require intpretation or don't they ? You seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have come down on both sides of the question.
</em><br />
<br />They require interpretation to be useful, meaningful or non-trivial. They don't require interpretation to simply be.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you might be able to reach inside and shift a few gears or discharge a few capacitors and make it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calculate e instead, utilising the fact that the laws of physics determine that if the inputs change,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the outputs will change (which, I trust you will agree, is the actual physical basis of the if-then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; statements).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, in human languages as in machine design, there are certain regularities to make things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easier for user. It might be possible, albeit difficult, to decipher a foreign language or figure out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what an alien computer is computing by looking for these regularities. However, it is not necessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that there be any pattern at all: the characters in the unknown language may change in meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every time they appear in the string in accordance with a random number generator, a cryptographic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; method called a &quot;one-time pad&quot;. Similarly, the meaning of the physical states of the alien computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could change with each clock cycle according to some random number sequence, so that if you had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the key you could figure out that the computer was calculating pi, but if you did not its activity would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seem random.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Assuming that computational states have an external semantics like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; words.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course they do. Does Intel or Microsoft follow some universal rule of computer design?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What has that got to do with anything ? If computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has no external semantics then there are not Intel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; semantics or microsoft semantics.
</em><br />
<br />If computation on a computer has no arbitrary semantics then every computer built in the universe should be 
<br />
basically the same.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Any computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can be emulated on a UTM, but that doesn't mean the computer can't be based on otrageously bizarre
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and unpredictable rules, inscrutable to anyone not in the know.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *That* doesn't mean that implementing a computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in an uneccearily complicated way turns it inot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a different computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 is just a complicated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way of writing 17, not some completely different number.
</em><br />
<br />Sure, the computation is the same (although I find it much harder to imagine the computation as a pure Platonic 
<br />
object than I do numbers),  but its expression and implementation are infinitely variable.
