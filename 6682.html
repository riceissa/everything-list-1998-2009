<br />The list is very active recently and as I have to work, eat etc. I haven't 
<br />
had time to properly digest (let alone reply to) all the excellent posts. 
<br />
The above question is a version of the zombie problem, and there are two 
<br />
slightly different answers depending on whether you are talking about human 
<br />
zombies or zombies from another planet. Human zombies are easy: they're not 
<br />
really zombies. If they behave like humans, they almost certainly have the 
<br />
same subjective experiences as humans. If this were not necessarily true, 
<br />
then the added complication of consciousness would never have evolved. 
<br />
Nature cares only about behaviour, and has no way of knowing about 
<br />
subjective experience. This almost certainly means that consciousness is a 
<br />
necessary side-effect of the type of complexity needed to create human type 
<br />
behaviour. From memory, Chalmers suggests that this is possibly true, but 
<br />
still maintains that it is *logically* possible for human zombies to exist, 
<br />
supporting his thesis that it is not possible to derive consciousness from 
<br />
brain states (the &quot;hard problem&quot;). Without getting into a discussion of what 
<br />
&quot;logically possible&quot; means, I would still say that even if it could somehow 
<br />
be shown that appropriate brain states necessarily lead to conscious states, 
<br />
which I suspect is the case, it would still not be clear how this comes 
<br />
about, and it would still not be clear what this is like unless you 
<br />
experience the brain/conscious state yourself, or something like it. You 
<br />
could dismiss this as unimportant, but I think it makes 1st person 
<br />
experience fundamentally different from everything else in the universe.
<br />
<br />As for aliens, I don't see how we could possibly assume that organisms who 
<br />
did not even evolve on our planet have anything in common with us mentally. 
<br />
They may be more fundamentally alien and different to us than bats or 
<br />
lobsters are, and it may be completely impossible to empathise with them, 
<br />
even if we could somehow tap into their minds.
