Hi Stephen,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Ok, Robinson Arithmatic is &quot; ... or Q, is a finitely axiomatized  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fragment of Peano arithmetic (PA). ...Q is essentially PA without  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the axiom schema of induction. Even though Q is much weaker than PA,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is still incomplete in the sense of Gödel.&quot; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_arithmetic_Q">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_arithmetic_Q</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     It does not tell me where the assumption of implementation of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the addition and multiplication obtain.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I don't use the assumption of implementation of the addition and  
<br />
multiplication. I use only the fact that some relations among numbers  
<br />
are true or false. You could as well ask a physical realist in what he  
<br />
implements the physical laws ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just because one can define X does not mean that one has produced X;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless we are assuming that the act of defining a representational  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system is co-creative of its objects.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I think you are confusing numbers and their representations.  
<br />
Arithmetical truth is independent of the representation used for  
<br />
numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are we to consider that an object, physical or platonic, is one and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same as its representations?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Of course not. And that is why I don't need, at the ontological level,  
<br />
any representation. Of course I need some to talk with you, but that's  
<br />
different.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Oh, I forgot, it has been proposed that a book containing a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbolic representation of Einstein's Brain is equal/equivalent to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Einstein's Mind. OK! ... Moving on.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Where? In the book Mind's I, Hofstadter just argues that if comp is  
<br />
true then you can converse with Einstein through the manipulation of a  
<br />
book describing (at the right level) the brain of Einstein at some  
<br />
moment. To proceed we have to be careful in all those little nuances.  
<br />
The devil is in the details.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can entirely define in arithmetic statements of the kind &quot;The  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine x on input y has not yet stop after z steps&quot;. The notion of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;time&quot; used  here through the notion of computational steps can be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deined entirely from the notion of natural numbers successor (which  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be taken as primitive or defined through addition and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiplication).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Ok, time (pun intended!) for a thought experiment. I go the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Library of Babel and pull out the &quot;Einstein's Brain&quot; and bring it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; home with me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I sit down and ask it: &quot;what are your latest thoughts on the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nature of Unified Fields?&quot;. How long am I going to wait before I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realize that I will never get an answer?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     You might say:&quot;Stephen, you are going about it all wrong! You  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to first create a well-formed question in the language of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Eintein's Brain&quot; and then look up the appropriate responce inthe  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; book.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I answer, &quot;Ah, So &quot;Einstein's Brain&quot; can answer my question  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after all; it can only sit there on the table until I opening and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use my own computational implementation to get my answer.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Of course, if you want that Einstein answers relatively to you, you  
<br />
have to implement it relatively to you. Either with a Mac, or a PC, or  
<br />
an IBM, or with your hands, whatever. Come on Stephen ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     So where is &quot;Einstein's Mind&quot;? Nowhere...
</em><br />
<br /><br />The 3-OMs of Einstein are distributed in the whole of Arithmetic  
<br />
(assuming comp this is quasi trivial to show, yet tedious. The 1-OMs  
<br />
of Einstein appears from inside arithmetic (only Einstein knows them)  
<br />
and their relative statistics are defined by a relative measure (which  
<br />
has to exist or comp is false) pertaining on the 2^aleph_zero  
<br />
computations going through its states. Ask any precise question on  
<br />
this if you have any difficulties.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     What is it that distinguishes a random sequence of scratches on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a plane of sand from the sequence of symbols of the equation  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representing the Grand Unified Theory of Everything? Well, one  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person might say: &quot; I can read the one that is an equation...&quot;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Meaningfullness necessitates a subject to whom meaning obtains.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sure.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computational states, symbolic scratches or patterns of concurrent  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neuron firings or distributions of voltage potentials, mean  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something because their existance is such that situations would be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different otherwise for some system other than that of the states,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scratches, patterns, etc..
</em><br />
<br />Sure.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Remember the notion of Causation?
</em><br />
<br /><br />There are plenty notion of causation derivable from inside arithmetic  
<br />
when you assume comp. Most would collapse to classical logic if the  
<br />
incompleteness did not exist. But machines are incomplete and reflect  
<br />
that incompleteness. This entails not only causation, but also  
<br />
responsibility and I would even argue it implies a form of strong, but  
<br />
partial, (free)-will.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     X is the Cause of Y if and only if X would not occur without the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occurence of Y. David Deutsch defines it more pointedly: &quot;...an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; event X causes an event Y in our universe if both X and Y occur in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our universe, but in most variants of our universe in which X does  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not happen, Y does not happen either.&quot; The trouble is that unless  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there exists a unique measure on the &quot;space&quot; where in events are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coded in the Universe of possible statements or sentences of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Robinson Arithmatic, it is undecidable if X happens or Y happens  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because one can not distinguish between actual computational steps  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that would generate a means to distinguish X from Y or strings that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; code some other computational string.
</em><br />
<br />Could you explain? This is not clear too me.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remember how Goedel numbering works... Only if the number of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible statements that can be coded with the same string are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationally isomorphic (generate the same output per input) can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one obtain a means to distinguish X from Y, but if we require this  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it will be no longer possible to code any variants of our universe.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Variants would not be allowed. Without the possibility of variants,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how does one obtain a notion of contrafactuality?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I'm afraid you will have to revise your comp basic, if you allow me to  
<br />
be frank. Up to now, the real (mathematical) problem with comp is that  
<br />
it allows too much variants, including many consistent but unsound  
<br />
variants like the white rabbits. And we have the counterfactuals,  
<br />
where any particular physical activity miss them ... In comp fact and  
<br />
counterfacts are relative notions, and all exist, in the usual sense  
<br />
that prime number exist. And then we can explain how very different  
<br />
and layered notions of existence emerge from that.
<br />
Don't confuse platonia before Gödel and after Gödel: we know now that  
<br />
in Platonia everything move and shit happens. But we (the old Löbian  
<br />
machine) do have partial control on our probable realities. We  
<br />
partially define them in a sense.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     To claim that the ordering of natural numbers from the notion of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; succession allow for us to obtain a coherent notion of the ordering  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of events time is fine, but only if there is one and only one  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible successor per any given number.
</em><br />
<br />This is used to measure only the &quot;time&quot; of the UD works, not possible  
<br />
internal times of its &quot;subcomputations&quot;, and still less subjective  
<br />
times of entities, etc. Any decidable predicate pertaining on the  
<br />
proof of sentence of the shape &quot;ExP(x)&quot; with P decidable would have  
<br />
work for the UD-time. In complexity theory this is called a Blum  
<br />
Measure. It has nothing to do neither with physical times nor with  
<br />
subjective duration, which emerge statistically and from an inside  
<br />
epistemological machine point of view. Like in Borgess the UD  
<br />
generates a labyrinthine web of times.
<br />
Symmetries and relatively broken symmetries, in many (too much a  
<br />
priori yet) directions.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The notion of Causation, inherent in the notion of &quot;time&quot; requires  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there to be more than one possible successor or else there would be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no notion of &quot;variants&quot;, ala Deutsch's statement above or any  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contrafactuals. In a Mathematical Set, one can is not free to have  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uniqueness or excluded middle rules apply only when convinient for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the theorists. Axioms and Rules are Universal or Nothing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The identification of Time as a &quot;dimension&quot;, usually represented  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as the Real number line does not allow for anything like the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variants that we obtain in QM theory.
</em><br />
<br />You are a bit unfair here. All your critics bears on QM as on COMP  
<br />
(which if my work is correct are really equivalent). The UD already  
<br />
execute all evolution of all Heisenberg matrices or Schroedinger Wave.  
<br />
It even dovetails on its real and complex approximations. My point is  
<br />
that this is not enough to solve the body problem, we have to explain  
<br />
why such matrices, and exactly which one, wins the histories measure  
<br />
competition.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  As a matter of fact, events prior to the specification of 1) a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis and 2) a specific experimental condition exists as quantities  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that have a complex number value.
</em><br />
<br />We cannot invoke QM, before we have justify it. You are changing the  
<br />
topic. The point is that with classical comp we have to justify the  
<br />
quantum, even as a first person plural sharable qualia ...
<br />
<br />We have to explain why the time is illusion, and why the illusion of  
<br />
time is NOT an illusion.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Complex numbers DO NOT have a natural ordering. Thus the notion of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Time as a Real number Lines is Not an a priori defined notion, it is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strictly a posteriori and thus not available as a means to assing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successional overing to events.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I can agree, but I don't see the relevance here.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you prefer, I could tell you that in arithmetic we have a very  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion of time: the natural number sequence. Then we can define in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic the notion of computation, and the notion of next step  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a computation made by such or such machine. And from that, we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can explain how the subjective appearance of physical times and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spaces occur.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     That would make sense only if we could show how numeric  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; succession, which is a form of &quot;x is less than y, thus y succeds x&quot;,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is equivalent in all situations for sequential stepping in a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational string. If we have to allow for some form of process  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for our notion to be coherent then we have not eliminated some  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primitive form of change from our theory; we have merely pushed it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into a corner and hope that no one notices. Again, we can not derive  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any form of change from a system that does not allow for its  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Computer science can provide an infinity of counter-examples here. Of  
<br />
course, from the point of view of the ontology, there is no change,  
<br />
but from the point of view of the observer we can justify the  
<br />
dynamics. many physicist agree on this. Not Prigogine, nor those who  
<br />
want to make time primitive, but then my argument is that they should  
<br />
say no to the doctor. That's all. I am not saying they are wrong.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;         I would like to better understand tyhe notion of a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theaetetical Knower. Could you link to a discussion of it?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The best discussion is the original Theaetetus by Plato. Myles  
<br />
Burnyeat  wrote a nice book &quot;The Theaetetus of Plato&quot;.  It is the idea  
<br />
of defining knowledge by true belief, or by true and justified belief,  
<br />
and variations of this type.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I do not wish for any one to abandon Comp, I wish only to show  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it is a key fragment in a larger system.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Then you should point on what exactly you don't follow in UDA, because  
<br />
the whole point of UDA is that comp (yes doctor + Church thesis) does  
<br />
not allow for more than comp. The mind body problem in the cognitive/ 
<br />
physical science is reduced to the body problem in number theory/ 
<br />
combinator/computer science.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can easily show how &quot;static&quot; systems emerge from dynamics ones.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The converse is difficult at best.
</em><br />
<br />No, it is simple. really. What *is* difficult is to derive the  
<br />
appearance of particles ... without too much white rabbits. The  
<br />
appearance of first person time *is* already explained (in a sense),  
<br />
like the appearance of many worlds, and many times indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When we assume that &quot;Becoming&quot; is fundamental,
</em><br />
<br />If you assume this, either UDA is incorrect or you are yourself an  
<br />
actual infinite. You should say no to the doctor. You cannot keep  
<br />
comp, and make time or becoming fundamental at the ontological level.  
<br />
You can make it fundamental at the epistemological level.  I could  
<br />
agree that Becoming is fundamental from the inside points of view. UDA  
<br />
does not conclude by &quot;matter does not exist&quot;: it concludes that  
<br />
&quot;substantial matter&quot; has to be replaced by &quot;a measure on computational  
<br />
histories&quot;. The comp hypothesis is made testable, or better the degree  
<br />
of falsity of comp can be measured in the dialog with nature. Up to  
<br />
now, nature fits well with the comp &quot;internal universal machine facts&quot;.
<br />
<br />I can understand the shock you can have when grasping how the usual  
<br />
ontology is transformed with comp. What is admittedly &quot;diabolical&quot;  
<br />
with comp is that comp predicts that universal machine cannot believe  
<br />
that they are machine, but they can bet and reason to learn the  
<br />
consequence of comp. But with reasonable definition the machine cannot  
<br />
believe it and still less know it. She can reason with and from it.  
<br />
She can bet it, like with those who try artificial hypo-campus on  
<br />
rats ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Being&quot; is show to be identical to the automorphisms. A change in a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system that leaves it invariant is identical to a non-change, but to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neglect the fact that a change is possible is to nullify the entire  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion of meaningfulness.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Many change are possible ... from inside. It is the same with any  
<br />
block interpretation of physics. You are almost arguing that if the  
<br />
laws does not change themselves, then no change will ever occur.

<br />I am not proposing a theory, Stephen, I show an argument showing that  
<br />
if we say yes to the doctor, then we have to change the current  
<br />
paradigm, because it does not work  or it eliminates person,  
<br />
consciousness and meaningfulness.
<br />
<br />The difference between the betting-on-comp approach and the physicist  
<br />
one, is that it starts from the person. It disallows person and  
<br />
consciousness elimination. It works very well apparently, it can save  
<br />
the appearance of space and time ... and it save consciousness and  
<br />
meaningfullness, even sort of &quot;gods&quot; in the process. OK, the ontology  
<br />
seems so little and unattractive
<br />
at first sight, but the point if that comp leads to this or similar.  
<br />
Comp defines a realm, and is not a theories per se. The arithmetical  
<br />
hypostases are derived theories from the comp hyp. After Gödel we have  
<br />
good reason (comp) to know that we will never have a complete theory  
<br />
about either numbers, and machines.
<br />
<br />What I have done, or try to do, is to show that the comp hyp  
<br />
transforms the mind body problem into the body problem. The mind part  
<br />
is the easiest part, because it is, assuming comp, &quot;just&quot; computer  
<br />
science (and computer's computer sciences), or number theory thanks to  
<br />
Godel-Matiyasevitch translations/embedding. The body part is difficult  
<br />
and counterintuitive, but it is mainly reduce to a problem of relative  
<br />
measure on computationnal histories, as seen from internal point of  
<br />
views (which, in AUDA, are translated in term of intensional variant  
<br />
of the self-reference logics).
<br />
<br />If you keep comp in the cognitive science, you have to accept the  
<br />
consequences it has everywhere (physics, theology, whatever).
<br />
I follow Deutsch dicto: it is only by taking our theory seriously that  
<br />
we can find them false, and correct them or abandon them. If you have  
<br />
a problem with UDA, don't hesitate to let me know where and why.  
<br />
UDA1-6 is judged easy. UDA-7 is falsely easy (you need a few amount of  
<br />
computer science to not been abuse by the apparent easyness). UDA-8 is  
<br />
notoriously difficult.
<br />
And AUDA is easy ... relatively to mathematical logic, and even a bit  
<br />
of quantum mechanics to have a sort of concrete illustration of the  
<br />
comp weirdness (alas QM is still even more weirder than it has been  
<br />
possible to prove for comp ...).
<br />
<br />I hope this helps, but to play serious, you really should investigate  
<br />
each step of UDA. In all case; me or you (or both) will learn in that  
<br />
process.
