Le 15-août-06, à 20:32, David Nyman a écrit :
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But don't we just 'derive' natural numbers by establishing a semantic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalence between '6' and the collection of faces on a cube?
</em><br />
<br /><br />But what is a cube?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their additive and multiplicative structures likewise by analogy and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generalisation? Must it not be the case that all we can know of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number realm is in practice wholly instantiated in indexical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1st-persons as information, and that ideas about its further extent,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; while possibly justified as theory, are not, empirically, instantiated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *anywhere* to our knowledge?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not if we assume comp, by UDA. Concept like &quot;information&quot;, &quot;cube&quot;, etc. 
<br />
are all more complex than numbers. Recall we search a theory  (even a 
<br />
testable theory).
<br />
Note also I have not yet seen physical theory which does not assume 
<br />
numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As far as I can see, the only alternative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to this is the belief that we have 'direct contact' with this realm, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Penrose claims, which is surely equivalent to claiming knowledge of God
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by 'direct revelation'.
</em><br />
<br />I disagree. I am just now doing math with six years old children. I 
<br />
have not the feeling that they have any direct contact with the number 
<br />
realm. They have contact with empirical reality (the one which I don't 
<br />
take for granted, i.e. the one I want to explain (without eliminating 
<br />
the person)). Only through some contact with that apparent reality can 
<br />
children (and adults) learn to discern the abstract math pattern. But 
<br />
this does not mean the math pattern would be senseless in absence of 
<br />
those empirical evidences. Accepting I am myself, at least partially 
<br />
empirical, only the knowledge of numbers would disappear in absence of 
<br />
knower, not the number and their relations themselves. Now Arithmetical 
<br />
realism is just part of the comp hypothesis, which I want to show is 
<br />
testable.
<br />
Empirical physics assumes numbers too, in any assumed theories. I could 
<br />
prove too you that no axiomatization of physics can bypassed some 
<br />
belief in number. Actually string theory cannot even bypass deep and 
<br />
strange arithmetical truth like the famous Ramanujan formula which says 
<br />
that:
<br />
<br />1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + ...   =   -1/12    (!)    (it is 
<br />
zeta(-1) extended on the complex plane)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In this case we're merely substituting 'numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made us', for 'God made us'.
</em><br />
<br />This makes sense (as I see you have seen in your more recent post) if 
<br />
you take &quot;God&quot; as the 0-person notion, i.e. arithmetical truth.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; While any such belief may be *true*, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isn't logical or necessary truth. So what precisely is 'essential'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the number realm, in the sense of making it the basis of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'indexical David' - whom I claim and assert to be necessarily real?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Of course, we have access to numbers only via our first person view. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fact does not logically entails that numbers themselves are a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; personal or an indexical construction per se.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Despite your claim that they are the basis both of the personal and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indexical? I ask you again, for them to play such a profound role, what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; status, beyond that of an idealised notion, are you giving them?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I give the status of a-temporal a-spatial truth, independent of me (and 
<br />
you),  to the elementary propositions in arithmetics. I believe in the 
<br />
independence of propositions like &quot;3 * 7 = 21&quot;, where 3, 7, and 21 have 
<br />
their usual meaning (on the planet TETRA, where people have only four 
<br />
fingers at each hand, they write &quot;3 * 7 = 25&quot;, but it really means the 
<br />
same (&quot;25&quot; means 2*8 + 5 = 21).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Having remonstrated with you thus, might I suggest that I could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand your meaning better thus:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Let's proceed *as if* the number realm were the sole 'primitive', and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything else we observe could be derived from it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I propose a reasoning (UDA). I am just saying that in case we can 
<br />
survive with an artificial digital brain, then, even if that artificial 
<br />
brain looks material, we HAVE TO derive persons and appearances of 
<br />
matter from numbers, and nothing else. UDA is made simple by being not 
<br />
too much constructive. Then I show that computer science is already 
<br />
powerful enough to begin (at least) the concrete and constructive 
<br />
derivation of the comp physical laws---and then we can compared it to 
<br />
the empirical physics and so we can perhaps refute comp or confirm it. 
<br />
Until now I got only a confirmation through the appearance of an 
<br />
&quot;arithmetical quantization&quot; or of an arithmetical interpretation of 
<br />
quantum logic.
<br />
My hope is to be able to show it is enough for explaining why any 
<br />
lobian machine looking to its neighborhood and trying to get its &quot;more 
<br />
probable computational continuations&quot; will discover that &quot;its&quot; bottom 
<br />
is described by a quantum computer (actually a topological QC).
<br />
I believe that Everett, Hartle, Graham, Deutsch .... are mainly correct 
<br />
when they explain how Bits appears from Qubit. But looking closely, 
<br />
Everett ... need comp. And with comp there is a way to reverse the 
<br />
arrow and we got an explanation how Qubits arise from Bits. Qubits are 
<br />
eventually &quot;just&quot; description of bits from an indeterminate first 
<br />
person plural view, where the indeterminateness comes exclusively from 
<br />
the comp 1-indeterminacy.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we succeed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this venture, we will have gained much in the way of insight. No doubt,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there will still remain further questions as to the nature and true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; origins of the 'reality' so conjured into existence, possibly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unanswerable.
</em><br />
<br />What is cute about natural numbers is that, although we cannot justify 
<br />
their existence without assuming them, we can at least justify why any 
<br />
entity cannot justify them without assuming them.
<br />
This justification works for all self-referentially correct entities 
<br />
(not just digital machines).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But since the question - why am I in this situation at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all in which I am able to be surprised that I am in this situation at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all? - regresses inevitably to a point beyond reason, perhaps it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't put us in a worse position in this regard than any other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does this work for you?
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps. Numbers can explain our discourse, including the part &quot; ... 
<br />
but numbers cannot explain qualia&quot;. But numbers can explain why 
<br />
&quot;numbers cannot explain qualia&quot; in any third person way, and this (it 
<br />
is the key point) without eliminating them.
<br />
&quot;Why am I Bruno and not David&quot; can then be explained by relative 
<br />
indeterminacy, and is akin to the question &quot;why am I the one 
<br />
reconstituted in Moscow&quot; after a self-duplication Washington/Moscow, 
<br />
for example. The duplication is an easy way to explain why we cannot 
<br />
explain something.
<br />
<br />Note that your &quot;indexical&quot; approach fits nicely with the idea that 
<br />
&quot;everything&quot; (everything observable or measurable + qualia 
<br />
(perceptible)) comes ultimately from the self-referential intellect (G, 
<br />
G*).
<br />
Perhaps some misunderstanding grew up between us, because the 
<br />
self-referential intellect looks like a &quot;first person&quot; (because of the 
<br />
self-reference), but I have to put it in the third person (because it 
<br />
corresponds to a discourse about some 3-person description of 
<br />
yourself). I have been stuck during years on that &quot;subtlety&quot; .
<br />
<br />Bruno
