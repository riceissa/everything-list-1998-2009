<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You mentioned the ASSA. Yesterday, motivdated by your hint, I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; read about the ASSA/RSSA debate that is said to have divided the list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into two camps. Since I have trouble with the reasoning I read, I will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably send a new message hoping for leaving the misunderstanding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Searching for the Universal Dovetailer Argument, I found a quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formal demonstration that you wrote in the list, and an even more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formal demonstration that you published in the original work. I do see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the advantage to have such a formal demonstration when it comes to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; detailed discussions, but sometimes I'd prefer a simplified outline to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get the basic idea and the main conclusions before going into detail.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you have written such an outline (in English or in French as well)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would be thankful to get the link. Otherwise I'll read one of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formal versions in the future.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually I like to say that the UDA is informal, yet rigorous. The 
<br />
*formal* counterpart of the UDA is given by the &quot;interview&quot; of a lobian 
<br />
machine (or a couple of lobian machines). Thios part is called 
<br />
sometimes AUDA for Arithmetical UDA because it gives a translation of 
<br />
the thought experiment and its consequence into arithmetic. It leads 
<br />
also to a theory of everything: intensional number theory (which is 
<br />
equivalent to informal extensional number theory + computer 
<br />
science/mathematical logic,  in a large sense).
<br />
<br />Now the main consequence of the UDA is so startling (relatively to our 
<br />
current Aristotelian (naturalistic, materialist, physicalist 
<br />
prejudices) that I prefer that people got them by themselves. By 
<br />
knowing just the result, you could aswell decide I should go in some 
<br />
asylum! But I can give you a short (but risky, thus) outline:
<br />
<br />I use the computationalist thesis as a working hypothesis. The idea is 
<br />
to take seriously that hypothesis and to derive consequences from it. 
<br />
If the consequences are too much absurd, then this can be seen as an 
<br />
argument against comp. But up to now comp does not lead to 
<br />
contradiction; it leads just too some weirdness.
<br />
<br />BY comp I mean CT + &quot;Yes doctor&quot;.  CT is for CHURCH THESIS (sometimes 
<br />
called Church Turing Thesis; Post Law, etc.). CT asserts the existence 
<br />
of a *universal* language (or of a universal machine, which is the one 
<br />
&quot;understanding&quot; that language). The universality concerns computability 
<br />
abilities (not the provability one, for which there is no equivalent 
<br />
theses). CT has many forms, like:  the language LAMBDA is universal, 
<br />
FORTRAN is universal, JAVA is universal, etc. Those are provably 
<br />
equivalent. &quot;Yes doctor&quot; is the assumption that there is a level of 
<br />
description of myself such that I survive (or see nothing changed) when 
<br />
a functional substitution is made at that level. It is almost an 
<br />
operational definition: you are a comp practitioners when you accept 
<br />
that your doctor substitutes *any* part of what you think to be your 
<br />
body.
<br />
Amateurs of MATRIX and novels like SIMULACRON III can appreciate this 
<br />
... (like amateurs of Plato ...).
<br />
<br />The UDA then consists in a many steps thought experiment showing that 
<br />
IF comp is correct THEN physicalism is false, and to solve the mind 
<br />
body problem you have to, not only get a theory of mind, but you have 
<br />
to justify the belief in natural law entirely through a relative 
<br />
measure on Sigma_1 sentences (corresponds to the state accessible by 
<br />
the UD).

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So without putting any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; extra-stcruture on the set of infinite strings, you could as well have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; taken as basic in your ontology the set of subset of N, written  P(N).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now, such a set is not even nameable in any first order theory. In a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; first order theory of those strings you will get something equivalent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to Tarski theory of Real: very nice but below the turing world: the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theory is complete and decidable and cannot be used for a theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; everything (there is no natural numbers definable in such theories).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  From this I can deduce that your intuition relies on second order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; arithmetic or analysis (and this is confirmed by the way you introduce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; time).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno and Russell, I don't want to interfere with your discussion. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I want to say something concerning the mathematics applied to study
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ensemble of infinite bitstrings (which is, as you, Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mentioned correctly, equivalent to the power set of the natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers). For me, the Everything ensemble is something given.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have no problem with that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forced to restrict myself to the use of mathematical structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definable by the structure of the Everything ensemble. I can use the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole of mathematics developed until today in order to study the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything ensemble.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes, you are right; at least concerning the way you prove propositions 
<br />
about the &quot;Everything Ensemble&quot;. But obviously, if your &quot;everything 
<br />
ensemble&quot; is supposed to be the ontiic part of the &quot;theory of 
<br />
everything&quot; you have to relate that ontic base with what we observe and 
<br />
think. For doing that, you are free to use any &quot;meta-theory&quot; you want, 
<br />
as far as we can agree on it. Actually, by incompleteness, we have ot a 
<br />
lot of choice in the matter. In my appoach this difficulty can be 
<br />
circumvented by interviewing a couple of lobian machine, once being 
<br />
richer (in provability power) than the other.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's consider our universe that is studied by physics.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The problem is that after UDA an expression like &quot;universe&quot; has to be 
<br />
use with much caution, especially if you mean &quot;ohysical universe&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Probably, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; won't find the set of natural numbers within this universe, the number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of identical particles (as far as we can talk about that) of any kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is finite.
</em><br />
<br />Not in all &quot;models&quot; (cf type 1 multi-realty of Tegmark).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nonetheless, it is useful to define the natural numbers and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to construct rational, real and even complex numbers in order to study
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A vivid though quite ridiculous example might be: When we study the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unaffected tropics, we go there with cameras despite of the fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cameras don't come from the tropics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As Everything ensemble, we use the set of infinite bitstrings. But the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theory of Everything, which doesn't really exist so far, may use every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical structure that proves to be useful.
</em><br />
<br />... at the metalevel. Sure. I agree 100%.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differs seriously from arithmetical realism.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah? Why? Here I disagree 100%. First arithmetical realism is just the 
<br />
&quot;humility statement&quot; saying that whatever happens to me, with me = 
<br />
bruno marchal, that will not change the truth status  of the 
<br />
arithmetical propositions. I have never met someone who does not accept 
<br />
arithmetical realism. It is NOT the statement that ONLY arithmetical 
<br />
reality (AR) is independent of myself. It is the statement that 
<br />
arithmetical truth is independent. That statement is accepted by both 
<br />
classical and intuitionist thinkers. I have stopped to put explicitly 
<br />
AR in COMP, because Church thesis already subsumes AR. Comp, under the 
<br />
form &quot;yes doctor&quot; + Church thesis + AR is redundant. No need to accept 
<br />
&quot;actual infinite&quot; to accept comp.
