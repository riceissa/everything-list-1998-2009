<br />
I call this a framework because there are lots of details left
<br />
unspecified, problems unsolved, etc. However I expected any multiverse
<br />
decision theory will probably look something like this. My goal in writing
<br />
this down is to have a framework for formalizing problems and proposed
<br />
solutions.
<br />
<br />This decision theory is more complex than the one in [Joyce] for two
<br />
reasons. First is to take into account the lack of logical omniscience
<br />
(following [Lipman]). This is necessary because if the multiverse consist
<br />
of all logically consistent universes, then logical omniscience implies no
<br />
decision is possible, so we have to assume lack of logical omniscience in
<br />
that case. Second is to take into account the fact that you don't know
<br />
which universe you're in or which observer moment you are at in each
<br />
universe, and the different observer moments that you may be at can have
<br />
different utility functions. This implies we have to use the game
<br />
theoretic concept of equilibrium.
<br />
<br />Start with the set A of possible strategies to choose from. Consider an
<br />
element a from this set. We want to determine if a is an equilibrium
<br />
strategy. Consider another set S, where each element is a full description
<br />
of the entire multiverse (including the history of all of the universes
<br />
inside it), which may be false or even inconsistent or unsatisfiable. You
<br />
know that one and only one of the descriptions is true, but you're not
<br />
sure which one. You have a function P such that P(s) is your subjective
<br />
probability that s is true given the assumption that all observer moments
<br />
that you may be at do choose strategy a.
<br />
<br />For each s, you have:
<br />
<br />- a set M_s of observer moments, which are the possible observer moments 
<br />
that you may be at if s is true. Let M be the union of all M_s.
<br />
- a set C_s of possible consequence functions c: M_s x A -&gt; S x M. If 
<br />
&lt;s',m'&gt; = c(m,a'), then s' is what s would be if m chose a' instead of a 
<br />
(while all other observer moments in M_s still
<br />
choose a), and m' is the observer moment corresponding to m in M_s'.
<br />
- functions Pm_s and Pc_s with the interpretation that Pm_s(m) is the
<br />
probability that you are at m if s is true and Pc_s(c) is the probability
<br />
that c is the true consequence function if s is true.
<br />
- utility function u_s: M_s -&gt; R, where u_s(m) gives the utility of s 
<br />
being true if you are m.
<br />
<br />To check whether it is an equilibrium to choose a, we compute the expected
<br />
utility of all strategies under the assumption that other observer moments
<br />
choose a, and see if choosing a gives the maximum expected utility. The
<br />
expected utility of a' is:
<br />
<br />\sum_{s \in S} \sum_{m \in M_s} \sum_{c \in C_s} P(s) * Pm_s(m) * Pc_s(c) 
<br />
* u_s'(m'), where &lt;s',m'&gt; = c(m,a')
<br />
<br />Some problems and discussion:
<br />
<br />What does each element of S look like exactly? It would seem to take an
<br />
infinite string to fully describe the entire multiverse, so how can we
<br />
think about them and assign probabilities to them? Perhaps it's better to 
<br />
make them finite descriptions of the parts of the multiverse that we care
<br />
about or are relevant to the decision.
<br />
<br />What should P be? Suppose the multiverse consists of all mathematical
<br />
structures (as proposed by Tegmark). In that case each element in S would
<br />
be a conjunction of mathematical statements and P would assign
<br />
probabilities to these mathematical statements (most of which we have no
<br />
hope of proving or disproving). How should we do that? Of
<br />
course we already do that (e.g. computer scientists bet with each other on
<br />
whether polytime = non-deterministic polytime, and we make use of
<br />
mathematical facts that we don't understand the proofs for), but
<br />
there does not seem to be a known method for doing it optimally. This is
<br />
also where anthropic reasoning would come in.
<br />
<br />What about Pm? That brings up the discussions we had about whether running
<br />
an experience again doubles its measure, whether a bigger computer
<br />
generates more measure, etc. Following up on an earlier point I made, I'll
<br />
note the interchangeability between P_m(s) and the utility
<br />
u_s'(m'). You can increase one, decrease the other, and keep expected
<br />
utilities the same. (Joyce also talks about this in his book.) So you
<br />
can't really talk about what Pm should be without also talking about what
<br />
u should be.
<br />
<br />Pc is where all the causality stuff goes of course. Beyond that it's an 
<br />
open question how it should be derived.
<br />
<br />Is this framework general enough so that any rational decision maker can
<br />
be modeled by choosing the appropriate A, S, M, C, P, Pm, Pc, and u? Can
<br />
it be simplified?
