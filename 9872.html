<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone else has already answered this...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lee Corbin writes (quoting SP):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; If [a] species believed that 2+2=5, or that their kidneys were the organs of respiration, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; they would be wrong. But if they believe that they wake up a different person every day, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; live their lives based on this belief, they would *not* be wrong; they could hold this belief
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; quite consistently even if they knew all there was to know about their biology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I claim that there is an important sense in which they *would* be wrong, that is, nature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; endowed us with a strong prejudice that we are the same creature from moment to moment for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reason. A creature exhibits a great deal of fear if a threat arises not to &quot;it&quot; itself in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sense of the creature this moment, but &quot;it&quot; in the extended sense. It acts consistently to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ensure that itself of a few moments hence does not come to harm, and we, of course, understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; quite well why nature did this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Creatures who do not identify with themselves a few moments hence are &quot;punished&quot;. They undergo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pain or discomfort that is linked by their intelligence to what the other creature (i.e. its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; self of a few moments ago) actually did.  Again, in this way they become fearful of future 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pain, and, on the other hand, eager to ravish future gain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is an important difference between normative statements and descriptive or empirical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statements. Quoting from Wikipedia:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Descriptive (or constative) statements are falsifiable statements that attempt to describe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality. Normative statements, on the other hand, affirm how things should or ought to be, how to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value them, which things are good or bad, which actions are right or wrong.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose some powerful being sets up an experiment whereby organisms who believe they are the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual day after day are selectively culled, while those who believe that they are born anew
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each morning and die when they fall asleep each night, but still make provision for their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successors just as we make provision for our children, are left alone or rewarded. After several
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generations, everyone would believe that they only lived for a day, and their culture, language
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and so on would reflect this belief. Philosophers would point out that the day-person belief,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though universally accepted and understood, is nevertheless contingent on the particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment in which the species evolved. That is, it is not a fact &quot;out there in the world&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independent of culture and psychology, like the belief that &quot;2+2=4&quot; or that &quot;the most common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isotope of the element with six protons found in our planet's crust has six neutrons&quot;. Everyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capable of understanding the language would agree that these two statements are true, or at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they have a definite true or false answer. The question of the truth or otherwise of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; day-person  belief is not straightforward in the same way. In order to make, &quot;a person lives for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a day, then dies, and another person is born the next day inheriting most of his memories&quot; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true-or-false statement, one would have to add, &quot;according to the concept of personhood and death
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we have evolved to believe&quot;. If this latter clause is understood as implicit, then your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; treatment of the idea of continuity of identity over time is valid. You would then have to grant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the day-people that their belief is just as good as ours, the difference between us just being an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accident of evolution. What's more, to be consistent you would have to grant that a duplicate is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not a self, on the grounds that the great majority of people do not believe this and our very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language is designed to deny that such a thing is possible (only the British monarch uses &quot;we&quot; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean what commoners refer to as &quot;I&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Suppose on the other hand that this is incorrect. Suppose that identity does not extend in time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; past one Planck constant (whatever that is). Then no object or person &quot;survives&quot;. But then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; term &quot;survival&quot; is also lost.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Survival and continuity of identity consist solely in the fact that we *believe* we survive from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment to moment. There is no &quot;objective fact&quot; beyond this that can be invoked to decide whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we do or do not survive in ambiguous cases. Superficially it may seem that that this last
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement is false, because we can, for example, do a DNA test, or specify that there must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical and/or mental continuity between two instantiations of the same person. However, we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always come up with a counterexample that would fool any such test.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (Words don't have absolute meanings; only meanings that convey relative utility and which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; correspond to actual structure in the world. An object and even a person *does* persist in time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as is revealed by a close examination of structure. It simply isn't very different from moment 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to moment, and if it is, then the entity has not survived. For example, a rock that is crushed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; into dust no longer exists as a rock.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You could have an argument there: someone could say that the rock still does exist, but in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; powdered form. The definition of &quot;rock&quot; becomes the issue, and this is not in itself a scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question. That there is a uniform lump of several minerals at time t1, then a collection of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same mass of the same minerals in finely divided form at time t2, is something we could both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree on yet still disagree about whether the rock exists at t2. We could say, &quot;given that an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; object is said no longer to exist as such if it loses its structural integrity...&quot; or something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like that, and then the question of whether the rock exists at t2 does become an empirically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; verifiable statement once again. In a similar fashion, if we say as above &quot;given the notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personhood and death that we have evolved to believe...&quot; we could perhaps reach agreement on some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions of personal identity. But then, what do we say when the rock is half-crushed, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolved beliefs very different from our own, or the situation never previously encountered in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolution, as in the case of duplication experiments?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Each person reading this would act in the following way if he suddenly heard a loud animal roar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; behind him. If he then looked around a saw a large tiger, all thoughts about the futility of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; survival past one Planck constant would vanish. If the person takes a flying leap, and just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; manages to get on the other side of a door, and is able to slam it shut in the tiger's face,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the person will rightfully be relieved. Why shouldn't we say that the person has survived, at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; least for the nonce until the tiger figures out that it may be able to burst through the closed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; door?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You're right, of course. The belief that we are the same person from moment to moment has a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain utility, otherwise it would never have evolved. But do you think there is more to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea than evolutionary expediency? Also, if a particular belief or behaviour has evolved, does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that necessarily makes it true and/or good?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis Papaioannou 
</em><br />
<br />I would say that what makes a statement like &quot;we're the same person from moment to moment&quot; true is
<br />
that it's an inference from, or a part of, a model of the world that is &quot;true&quot; in the provisional
<br />
sense of scientific theories, i.e. it subsumes and predicts many emprically verified observations
<br />
(e.g. if I wake you up in the middle of the night and ask you your name you'll reply 'Stathis') and
<br />
it has not made any falsified predictions.  So in this sense we could say that our model of
<br />
personhood is better than that of the day-people - not in the sense that we can show theirs is
<br />
false, but in the sense that ours has greater predictive power and scope.
<br />

<br />
The sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to  interpret, they mainly make models. By 
<br />
a model is meant a  mathematical construct which, with the addition of certain verbal 
<br />
interpretations, describes observed phenomena. The justification of  such a mathematical construct 
<br />
is solely and precisely that it is  expected to work.
