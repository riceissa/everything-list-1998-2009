<br />Well, the idea I discussed was somewhat vague, I think to develop it I'd 
<br />
need to have better ideas about what a theory of consciousness should look 
<br />
like, and I don't know where to begin with that. But as for how the ASSA is 
<br />
incorporated, I'll try to summarize again and maybe make it a little 
<br />
clearer. Basically my idea was that there would be two types of measures on 
<br />
observer-moments: a relative measure, which gives you answers to questions 
<br />
like &quot;if I am currently experiencing observer-moment A, what is the 
<br />
probability that my next experience will be of observer-moment B?&quot;, and an 
<br />
absolute measure, which is sort of like the probability that my current 
<br />
observer-moment will be A in the first place. This idea of absolute measure 
<br />
might seem meaningless since whatever observer-moment I'm experiencing right 
<br />
now, from my point of view the probability is 1 that I'm experiencing that 
<br />
one and not some other, but probably the best way to think of it is in terms 
<br />
of the self-sampling assumption, where reasoning *as if* I'm randomly 
<br />
sampled from some group (for example, 'all humans ever born' in the doomsday 
<br />
argument) can lead to useful conclusions, even if I don't actually believe 
<br />
that God used a random-number generator to decide which body my preexisting 
<br />
soul would be placed in.
<br />
<br />So, once you have the idea of both a relative measure 
<br />
('probability-of-becoming') and an absolute measure ('probability-of-being') 
<br />
on observer-moments, my idea is that the two measures could be interrelated, 
<br />
like this:
<br />
<br />1. My probability-of-becoming some possible future observer-moment is based 
<br />
both on something like the 'similarity' between that observer-moment and my 
<br />
current one (so my next experience is unlikely to be that of George W. Bush 
<br />
sitting in the White House, for example, because his memories and 
<br />
personality are so different from my current ones) but also on the absolute 
<br />
probability of that observer-moment (so that I am unlikely to find myself 
<br />
having the experience of talking to an intelligent white rabbit, because 
<br />
even if that future observer-moment is fairly similar to my current one in 
<br />
terms of personality, memories, etc., white-rabbit observer-moments are 
<br />
objectively improbable). I don't know how to quantify &quot;similarity&quot; though, 
<br />
or exactly how both similarity and absolute probabilities would be used to 
<br />
calculate the relative measure between two observer-moments...this is where 
<br />
some sort of &quot;theory of consciousness&quot; would be needed.
<br />
<br />2. Meanwhile, the absolute measure is itself dependent on the relative 
<br />
measure, in the sense that an observer-moment A will have higher absolute 
<br />
measure if a lot of other observer-moments that themselves have high 
<br />
absolute measure see A as a likely &quot;next experience&quot; or a likely &quot;past 
<br />
experience&quot; (ie there's a high relative measure between them). This idea is 
<br />
based partly on that thought experiment where two copies of a person are 
<br />
made, then one copy is itself later copied many more times, the idea being 
<br />
that the copy that is destined to be copied more in the future has a higher 
<br />
absolute measure because there are more future observer-moments 
<br />
&quot;reinforcing&quot; it (see <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m4841.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m4841.html</a> for 
<br />
more on this thought-experiment). I think of this whole idea in analogy to 
<br />
the way Google's ranking system works: pages are ranked as more popular if 
<br />
they are linked to by a lot of other pages that are themselves highly 
<br />
ranked. So, the popularity of a particular page is sort of like the absolute 
<br />
probability of being a particular observer-moment, while a link from one 
<br />
page to another is like a high relative probability from one observer-moment 
<br />
to another (to make the analogy better you'd have to use weighted links, and 
<br />
you'd have to assume the weight of the link between page A and page B itself 
<br />
depends partly on B's popularity).
<br />
<br />The final part of my pet theory is that by having the two measures 
<br />
interrelated in this way, you'd end up with a unique self-consistent 
<br />
solution to what each measure would look like, like what happens when you 
<br />
have a bunch of simultaneous equations specifying how different variables 
<br />
relate to one another, and they determine a unique solution. This would 
<br />
provide a rationale for having a non-arbitrary choice of absolute and 
<br />
relative measure (see my comments about the 'arbitrariness problem' in my 
<br />
very first post on this list at 
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2606.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2606.html</a> ). Also, this type of TOE 
<br />
would give a precise answer to the 'problem of the reference class' which 
<br />
Nick Bostrom talks about in his work on the self-sampling assumption, the 
<br />
answer being that you should reason as if you were randomly sampled from the 
<br />
set of all observer-moments, weighted by their absolute measure. The final 
<br />
benefit of this type of theory is that you wouldn't need a two-step 
<br />
procedure of first coming up with a measure on &quot;universes&quot; and then 
<br />
afterwards adding anthropic considerations as a second step--I think that 
<br />
two-step idea depends on a fundamentally dualistic view of the mind/body 
<br />
problem, as I said in my post at 
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m5069.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m5069.html</a>
<br />
<br />So, does any of this help explain how I try to save the ASSA? I guess it 
<br />
depends on what you think the basic problem the ASSA has that requires it to 
<br />
be &quot;saved&quot;, I think Hal Finney was saying the problem was that it could lead 
<br />
to predictions incompatible with those of the RSSA, while others seem to 
<br />
have more of a philosophical problem with talking about the &quot;probability&quot; 
<br />
that my current observer-moment could be anything other than what it 
<br />
actually is (if 'I' were someone else, 'I' wouldn't be me!) What is your 
<br />
basic objection to the ASSA, and do you think my pet theory offers at least 
<br />
one possible way to resolve it?
