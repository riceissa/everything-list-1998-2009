<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From Osher Doctorow osher.domain.name.hidden Sunday Dec. 1, 2002 0958
</em><br />
<br />I agree again with Tim May.
<br />
<br />I also think that category theory and topos theory at least in its
<br />
definition as a branch of category theory are too restrictive, largely
<br />
because they are more abstract than concrete-oriented in their underlying
<br />
formulations.
<br />
<br />In fact, perhaps this is a key problem with computers.   Most human beings
<br />
whom I know have enormous difficulty in finding a Golden Mean between
<br />
abstraction and concreteness insofar as the concrete reality and abstract
<br />
reality are concerned if you get my meanings.   The problem is only slightly
<br />
less prevalent in academia.   Computers seem to be nowhere near solving this
<br />
problem - in fact, the more similar to human beings they get, the more
<br />
difficult it may be for them to solve the problem.   I am not even sure that
<br />
most human beings in or out of academia think that there should be a Golden
<br />
Mean between abstraction and concreteness [exclamation mark - several of my
<br />
keys are out including that one].
<br />
<br />In fact, I would conjecture a PRINCIPLE OF RECURSIVE SUBSTITUTION.   This
<br />
says that a computer or person will replace some simple operation [addition,
<br />
subtraction, multiplication, division, limits, composition, non-commutative
<br />
multiplication, etc.] by another simple operation if the result of using one
<br />
operation predominantly and/or other operations secondarily is too slow by
<br />
some standard that might be varied.   Actually, don't replace them
<br />
permanently - keep older methods indefinitely because they might eventually
<br />
pull ahead for example, but at least move the new operations into a
<br />
prominent position.   My opinion is that important subtraction or
<br />
subtraction-addition results are far more rapid in pure and applied
<br />
applications across different fields and disciplines than composition and
<br />
functors and objects in categories for example.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I agree completely with that aspect of Bruno's thesis. ;-) It is the

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; assumption that the 0's and 1's can exist without some substrate that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; bothers me. If we insist on making such an assuption, how can we even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; notion of distinguishability between a 0 and a 1?.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;    To me, its analogous to claiming that Mody Dick &quot;exists&quot; but there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; not exists any copies of it. If we are going to claim that &quot;all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; computations&quot; exists, then why is it problematic to imagine that &quot;all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; possible implementations of computations&quot; exists as well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But then you need to explain what &quot;implemention&quot; are. Computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; scientist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have no problem with this. There are nice mathematical formulation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Tim would say that an implementation is basically a functor between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; categories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You seen to want a material preeminent level, but this is more a source
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of difficulty than an explanation. What is that level?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno is right that I would emphasize the mathematics over the &quot;COMP&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aspects. Computations are kinds of mathematics: mappings, iterations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theorem provings, even topological operations of various kinds. Not all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics is easily implemented on computers, but the principle is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clear.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suppose I am partly a Platonist, in that I believe there's more to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics than merely symbol manipulation (the Formalist) school.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computers are exciting because they give us another way to make real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or reify) the abstractions of mathematics. I believe, for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that categories (e.g., HILB or VECT) are in some sense &quot;real,&quot; that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can send our minds and our computers as robot explorers into these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;scapes&quot; of Platonia, into the ideosphere, into noespace, or whatever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Sorry for waxing poetic...)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a sense in which the Platonist point of view is consistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the Chaitin/Wolfram notion that mathematics will become largely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explorational. Arguably, this has been what mathematics has _always_
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been, that the process of discovering truths is not about proving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theorems from postulates, at least not exclusively. Even geometry got
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its start not from considering abstractions out of a pure ideosphere,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but from issues of measuring the earth (geo-metry), of building
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pyramids, of dividing farmlands, of measuring grain storage, and so on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Later mathematics was also guided at least partly by the practical,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether the study of differential equations or elliptic functions. Of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all of the possibly-provable truths, laid out like stepping stones in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vast marsh of as-yet-unproved and possibly-unprovable truths, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stepping stones are followed, and are laid in the marsh as new proofs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are obtained, is often shaped by engineering and physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considerations. Even in the purest areas of mathematics, such as number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory. The Chaitin argument that computers will be used increasingly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to explore this landscape is, I think, certainly correct. (Personally,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am tremendously excited to think about what future versions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematica, for example, will look like when running on computers 100
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or 1000 times faster than my current Mac and running with immersive VR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; graphics systems. At Moore's Law rates of progress, I'll have this here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in my home within the next 10-15 years or so. This is my main interest,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more so than speculating on whether the universe runs on a computer or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not. But Everything issues touch on this...)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, so which is it, really, Platonism or Formalism? Paul Taylor makes a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good case in &quot;Practical Foundations of Mathematics&quot; that category
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory in general and topos theory in particular provide the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unification of these two points of view. Mathematical objects live in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe of categories, with certain rules for moving between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; categories, and that various universes exist as toposes. We as humans
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can manipulate these rules, learn how these objects behave, and thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explore these spaces.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now whether it makes sense (or &quot;is really the case&quot;) to say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Reality is some kind of computer program is not all clear to me. Like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many others, I have problems with the notion that reality is a program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; running on some kind of metacomputer. Perhaps computation is woven into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fabric of spacetime at a deep enough level, and perhaps there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternative &quot;state machine&quot; rules which could be imagined in other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes (or even in different parts of our universe, e.g., changes in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules at very high energies, or near singularities, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not--at this time--much engaged by the &quot;universe as a computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program&quot; idea. A useful hypothesis to have--the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Zuse/Fredkin/Lloyd/Schmidhuber/Wolfram/etc. thesis, in its various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forms--but a long, long way from being established as the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believable hypothesis. To me, at least.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I think Egan gives us a fairly plausible, fictional timeline for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; figuring this stuff out: a workable TOE by the middle of this century,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i.e., within our lifetimes. That is, a theory which unifies relativity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and QM, and which is presumably also brings in QED, QCD, etc. Perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involving a mixture of string/brane theory, spin foams and loop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gravity, etc. Lee Smolin has some plausible speculations about how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these areas may come together over the next several decades. This TOE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is of course not expected to be truly a theory of everything, as we all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know: the phrase TOE is mostly about the unification of the two major
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classes of theories noted above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then perhaps several centuries of very little progress, as the energies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to get to the Planck energy are enormous (e.g., compressing a mass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about equal to a cell to a size 20 orders of magnitude smaller than a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proton). Egan plausibly describes an accelerator the length of a chunk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the solar system, using the most advanced &quot;PASER&quot; (the solid-state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lasing accelerators proposed recently), to accelerate particles to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; energies where discrepancies in models (computer programs??) might show
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up. In one of his novels (&quot;Diaspora&quot;) he has this happening a few
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thousand years from now. This sounds about &quot;right&quot; to me. (I'll be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happy to give some of my reasons for &quot;pessimism&quot; on this timetable if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's any real interest.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, breakthroughs in mathematics may provide major new clues,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is where I put my efforts.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I take the &quot;Everything&quot; ideas in the broader sense, a la Egan's &quot;all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topologies model,&quot; a la the &quot;universes as toposes&quot; (topoi) area of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; study, etc. My focus is more on logic and the connections between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topology, algebra, and logic. It may be that we learn that at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Planck scale (approx. 10^-35 m) the causal sets are best modeled as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer-like iterations of the spin graphs. But this is a long way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from saying consciousness arises from the COMP hypothesis, so on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topic I am silent. As Wittgenstein said, &quot;Whereof one cannot speak, one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must remain silent.&quot; Bluntly, don't talk if you have nothing to say.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which is why I have little to say about the COMP hypothesis. I'll be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; excited if evidence mounts that there's something to it. If the COMP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothesis has engineering implications, e.g., affects the design of AI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems, this will be cool.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Could we not recover 1-uncertainty from the Kochen-Specker
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; theorem of QM itself?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Probably so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This seems to be assuming the conclusion. Gleason's Theorem and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kochen-Specker are about the properties of Hilbert spaces. But the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason we use the Hilbert space formulation for quantum mechanics, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opposed to just using classical state spaces, is because the Hilbert
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space formulation (largely of Von Neumann) gave us the &quot;correct&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; noncommutation, uncertainty principle, Pauli exclusion principle, etc.,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things which were consistent with the observed properties of simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atoms, slit experiments, etc. In other words, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Planck/Einstein/Heisenberg/Schrodinger/Bohr/etc. results and successful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models (e.g., of the atom) gave us the Hilbert space formulation, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gleason, Bell, Kochen, Specker, etc. then proved theorems about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think it would be kosher to assume reality has aspects of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; category HILB and then use theorems about Hilbert spaces to then prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Uncertainty Principle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (My apologies if this was not what was intended by &quot;recover
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1-uncertainty.&quot;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a good example, by the way, of how the physics applications of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hilbert spaces incentivized mathematicians to study Hilbert spaces in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ways they probably would not have had Hilbert spaces just been another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of many abstract spaces. Gleason had many interests in pure math, so he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably would have proved his theorem regardless, but Bell, Kochen,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Specker probably would not have had QM issues not been of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interest.
