<br />
What Jesse and Saibal write is the key, I think. While all successor 
<br />
states are possible,
<br />
only very few are &quot;experiencable and memorable by a coherent brain 
<br />
(computer) and mind
<br />
(software decision path in your brain). 
<br />
<br />I think that the only factor that makes these &quot;anything can happen/is 
<br />
happening&quot; theories plausible
<br />
at all is that all but a vanishingly small number or successor states 
<br />
are OVERWHELMINGLY
<br />
incoherent.
<br />
<br />The argument runs like this. To make everything come out so that 
<br />
everything seems consistent,
<br />
and mutually consistent, for one or, in our case, a large group of, 
<br />
observers, the states and behaviours
<br />
of an inconceivably vast number of different particles/waves has to be 
<br />
just so, or the whole
<br />
shebang just falls apart. There are close to zero such large-scale 
<br />
coherent states (or state-succession
<br />
paths, if you will.) There may nearly be just one such coherent 
<br />
state-succession path.
<br />
<br />Another way of putting this is that the number and type of 
<br />
future-outcome-factors that don't matter
<br />
to the ability of the whole pattern to remain coherent is relatively 
<br />
very, very small. Perhaps the different
<br />
ways in which a quantum state of some photon can come out into a 
<br />
classical state when observed
<br />
are amongst the factors that &quot;don't matter&quot; to the ability of our 
<br />
universe to continue coherent (i.e. observable)
<br />
but the probabilities of those different outcomes for the photon DO 
<br />
matter to the coherence of our
<br />
universe, and the very fact that the photon's quantum state does 
<br />
collapse into one classical state for us when
<br />
we observe it is a result of us being able to observe only a single path 
<br />
that is consistent with our and our universe's
<br />
continued overall coherence. A property of the coherent, observable path 
<br />
through the plenitude is that
<br />
quantum states MUST choose a single state, for observers inside that 
<br />
coherent observable state-evolution-path.
<br />
<br />Or something.
