<br />This is diusputed, e.g. in <a href="http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm">http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm</a>
<br />
<br />Q21 Does many-worlds violate Ockham's Razor?
<br />
William of Ockham, 1285-1349(?) English philosopher and one of the
<br />
founders of logic, proposed a maxim for judging theories which says
<br />
that hypotheses should not be multiplied beyond necessity. This is
<br />
known as Ockham's razor and is interpreted, today, as meaning that to
<br />
account for any set of facts the simplest theories are to be preferred
<br />
over more complex ones. Many-worlds is viewed as unnecessarily complex,
<br />
by some, by requiring the existence of a multiplicity of worlds to
<br />
explain what we see, at any time, in just one world.
<br />
<br />This is to mistake what is meant by &quot;complex&quot;. Here's an example.
<br />
Analysis of starlight reveals that starlight is very similar to faint
<br />
sunlight, both with spectroscopic absorption and emission lines.
<br />
Assuming the universality of physical law we are led to conclude that
<br />
other stars and worlds are scattered, in great numbers, across the
<br />
cosmos. The theory that &quot;the stars are distant suns&quot; is the simplest
<br />
theory and so to be preferred by Ockham's Razor to other geocentric
<br />
theories.
<br />
<br />Similarly many-worlds is the simplest and most economical quantum
<br />
theory because it proposes that same laws of physics apply to animate
<br />
observers as has been observed for inanimate objects. The multiplicity
<br />
of worlds predicted by the theory is not a weakness of many-worlds, any
<br />
more than the multiplicity of stars are for astronomers, since the
<br />
non-interacting worlds emerge from a simpler theory.
<br />
<br />(As an historical aside it is worth noting that Ockham's razor was also
<br />
falsely used to argue in favour of the older heliocentric theories
<br />
against Galileo's notion of the vastness of the cosmos. The notion of
<br />
vast empty interstellar spaces was too uneconomical to be believable to
<br />
the Medieval mind. Again they were confusing the notion of vastness
<br />
with complexity [15].)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I even attended a lecture by John Wheeler, David Deutsch's thesis advisor.  He gave me the same sense of unease that FoR did.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; While I have no better explanation for quantum mysteries, I remain agnostic.  &quot;MWI's main conclusion is that the universe (or multiverse in this context) is composed of a quantum superposition of very many, possibly infinitely many, increasingly divergent, non-communicating parallel universes or quantum worlds.&quot; (Wikipedia)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also can't buy &quot;wavefunction collapse.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />That is unofortunate, because if you do not have collapse, you
<br />
have MW, and if you do nto have MW, you have collapse.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps some undiscovered phenomenon is responsible for quantum mysteries - e.g., maybe the explanation lies in one or more of the ten dimensions that string theory requires.
</em><br />
<br />What is &quot;responsible&quot; for quantum phenomena is the way the universe
<br />
works.
<br />
What needs explaining is how the appearance of a classical
<br />
world-re-emerges.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Maybe these undiscovered dimensions somehow allow the fabled paired photons to instantly communicate with each other over astronomical distances.  This is a WAG (wild-ass guess) of course, but it's more believable to me than new universes being constantly generated.
</em><br />
<br />This is already explained: what allows them to communicate is the
<br />
fact that they occupy an infinitely-dimensional Hilbert space. What
<br />
needs
<br />
explaining is how that ends up looking like 3D classical/relativistic
<br />
space.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I CAN see some logic to the idea that Tegmark introduced me to - the idea that, in infinite space, a multiverse exists containing all possible universes - and we inhabit one of them.
</em><br />
<br />Then the quantum universe will be one of them. But why shouldn't it be
<br />
the only one ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I believe that, in infinite time and space, anything that can happen must happen, not only once but an infinite number of times.
