Hi Russell and Friends,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just ran across the following post and thought that you might find it interesting. Any comments?
<br />
<br />Onward!
<br />

<br />The &quot;Minkowski&quot; or &quot;inertial&quot; vacuum state seen in an &quot;accelerating
<br />
frame&quot; is a thermal state at a temperature proportional to the
<br />
&quot;acceleration&quot;; i.e., an heat bath containing an infinite number of
<br />
particles (finite density) distributed in a fashion consistent with a
<br />
gas at a particular temperature.
<br />
<br />The words in quotes are very misleading however, and require a large
<br />
amount of clarification, because the effect has little or nothing per
<br />
se to do with acceleration or being inertial; but rather with the
<br />
occurrrence of a causal horizon.
<br />
<br />A quantum field theory requires you first to define a &quot;frame&quot;, the word
<br />
which -- unlike in Relativity -- does NOT a coordinate system; but a
<br />
&quot;flow of time&quot;.  Quantum theory, is you recall, treats time as a
<br />
process, not a dimension.
<br />
<br />The flow of time is represented by a vector field which is timelike.
<br />
<br />The Minkowski or inertial frame has associated with it a constant
<br />
time-like field which (by suitable Lorentz transformation) can be
<br />
represented as T = d/dt -- i.e. the 4-vector T = T^{mu} d/dx^{mu} whose
<br />
only non-zero component is T^0 (with x^0 = t).
<br />
<br />The Unruh frame uses a time-like field which does NOT cover all of
<br />
space.  The flow lines are all hyperbolic, each naturally associated
<br />
with an observer at a given acceleration.  The hyperbolas all have, as
<br />
asymptotes, the 2+1 boundary given by an equation of the form x = c|t|;
<br />
the region associated with the field being x &gt; c|t|.
<br />
<br />The &quot;acceleration&quot; a is normally defined as that associated with one of
<br />
the worldlines in the Unruh frame.  Different worldlines have different
<br />
accelerations associated with them.
<br />
<br />At this boundary, the timelike field T becomes null.  A second, mirror
<br />
region, x &lt; -c|t| has the boundary x = -c|t|.  Both boundaries meet at
<br />
t = 0.  In this region, the field T &quot;flows&quot; in the opposite direction.
<br />
<br />The boundary x = c|t| is the causal horizon mentioned before.
<br />
<br />A field is uniquely determined by its values at t = 0, and the space of
<br />
all states of a system is generally always associated with the initial
<br />
values of whatever system is in question.  Here, that means, there is a
<br />
natural split of the underlying state space H into H1 + H2, with H1
<br />
being the state space associated with the region x &gt; c|t|, and H2 being
<br />
that associated with the region x &lt; -c|t|.
<br />
<br />(Solving the field equation by taking its initial values (and the
<br />
initial values of its time derivative) comprises what's called a Cauchy
<br />
problem.  For the Klein-Gordon field, the initial values play the
<br />
analogous role of coordinates, the initial time derivative the
<br />
congugate momenta.  The state space is then a Hilbert space in which
<br />
these quantities act as operators satisfying the usual Heisenberg
<br />
relations).
<br />
<br />H1, here, is the only one of physical relevance.  But a full
<br />
description of the Minkowski frame requires both H1 and H2.  In
<br />
particular, the vacuum state |0&gt; of a Klein Gordon field -- as seen in
<br />
the Minkowski frame -- when expressed in terms of the H1 &amp; H2 states
<br />
--becomes:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|0&gt; = sum |n&gt;_1 |n&gt;_2 exp(-pi a).
<br />
<br />This is readily identifiable in the language of finite-temperature
<br />
quantum field theory.  The states |n&gt;_1 can be thought of as particle
<br />
states, those |n&gt;_2 can be thought of as states associated with vacuum
<br />
fluctuations of the corresponding heat bath (i.e. &quot;holes&quot;).  So, the
<br />
superposition |n&gt;_1 &amp; |n&gt;_2 has total energy 0, since |n&gt;_2 reflects
<br />
|n&gt;_1.  All the states |n&gt;_2 are negative energy since the time flow in
<br />
region 2, x &lt; -c|t|, goes the other way.
<br />
<br />Since only region 1, x &gt; c|t|, is physically relevant (you can't see
<br />
past the boundary, the causal horizon), then the actual quantum state
<br />
associated with it is arrived at by phase-averaging over the states of
<br />
region 2.  This turns the Minkowski state into the region 1 state:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|0&gt;&lt;0| --&gt; Trace_2(|0&gt;&lt;0|) = V_1
<br />
with
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|0&gt;&lt;0| = sum |n&gt;_1 &lt;n|_1  |n&gt;_2 &lt;n|_2  exp(-2 pi a)
<br />
which, after being traced over give you
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trace_2(|0&gt;&lt;0|) = sum |n&gt;_1 &lt;n|_1 exp(-2 pi a)
<br />
which is a MIXED (and thermal) state, no longer a pure state,
<br />
associated with a temperature proportional to a.
<br />
<br />Having a mixed state means you've lost information -- this loss being
<br />
represented by the coefficients of the mixture
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp(-2 pi a)
<br />
which represent (up to proportion) probabilities ... and probabilities
<br />
always mean you lost information somewhere.
<br />
<br />In fact, this general process of tracing over a causal horizon of some
<br />
sort is GENERALLY how you get probabilities out of quantum theory.
<br />
Everything is a pure state, until you do a partial trace
<br />
phase-averaging cut-off on a horizon somewhere, and the horizon,
<br />
itself, can be thought of as nothing less than a way of quantifying the
<br />
word &quot;observer&quot;.
<br />
<br />The loss of information is readily identified with the loss of
<br />
information of what's going on in the other parts of spacetime outside
<br />
the region x &gt; c|t|.
<br />
<br />The general lesson is that what appears as quantum noise in one frame
<br />
becomes thermal noise seen from another frame; and there is no longer
<br />
any covariant distinction between quantum and thermal noise.
<br />
<br />There's an unlimited number of ways to define time-like fields in a
<br />
region of spacetime, and you can always have time-like fields defined
<br />
in such a way that they have causal horizons somewhere.  A more
<br />
dramatic example of this is where the region in question is actually
<br />
finite in size: |r| &lt; 1 - |t| (using units where c = 1).  Then defining
<br />
coordinates (R, T) by
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r = R (1 - T^2)/(1 - (RT)^2)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t = T (1 - R^2)/(1 - (RT)^2)
<br />
this produces a metric
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ds^2 = dT^2 ((1 - R^2)/(1 - (RT)^2))^2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ds_3^2 ((1 - T^2)/(1 - (RT)^2)^2
<br />
where
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ds_3 = dR^2 + R^2 ((d theta)^2 + (sin theta d psi)^2)
<br />
<br />The worldlines associated with (R, theta, psi) = constant are
<br />
hyperbolic worldlines that meet at (t,r) = (-1,0), (t,r) = (+1,0), and
<br />
cross the t = 0 hyperplane at r = R; and the timelike field is just
<br />
d/dT, that associated with the coordinate &quot;T&quot;, itself.
<br />
<br />Here, the causal horizon is |r| = 1 - |t| and the region enclosed is
<br />
finite, which means that the modes associated with the Klein-Gordon
<br />
field will form a discretely spaced set, rather than continuous (just
<br />
as if you were to quantize &quot;in a box&quot;).  So, there is a HUGE cut-off of
<br />
field modes here, since the globally defined quantum field has a
<br />
continuously distributed set of modes.
<br />
<br />As of yet, I still don't know what the Minkowski vacuum looks like in
<br />
this frame.  The wave equation has a particularly bizarre feature that
<br />
half of the initial values become redundant, when the initial values
<br />
are taken on the 1/2 causal horizon |r| = 1 - t, 0 &lt; t &lt; 1; or the
<br />
other 1/2; |r| = 1 + t, -1 &lt; t &lt; 0; and the Cauchy problem for the
<br />
field becomes a Dirichlet problem (in part because there are no
<br />
time-derivatives to define, since &quot;time is frozen&quot; on the causal
<br />
horizon).
