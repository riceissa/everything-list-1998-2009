</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     MP: Well that, in a nutshell, is how I understand it; with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     proviso that it is dynamic: that all representations of all salient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     features and relationships are being updated sufficiently often to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     natural world this occurs because all the creatures in the past
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     who/which failed significantly in this respect got eaten by

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     something that stalked its way in between the updates, or the

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Stathis [in another response to me in this thread]: 'You can't prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     that a machine will be conscious in the same way you are.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     MP: Well, that depends what you mean;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;        1. to what extent does it matter what I can prove anyway?   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;        2. exactly what or, rather, what range of sufficiently complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           systems are you referring to as 'machines';
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;        3. what do you mean by 'conscious in the same way you are'?;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I'm sure others can think of equally or more interesting questions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     than these, but I can respond to these.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;        1. I am sure I couldn't prove whether or not a machine was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           conscious, but it the 'machine' was, and it was smart enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           and interested enough IT could, by engaging us in conversation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           about its experiences, what it felt like to be what/who it is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           and questioning us about what it is like to be us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           Furthermore, as Colin Hales has pointed out, if the machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           was doing real science it would be pretty much conclusive that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           it was conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;        2. By the word machine I could refer to many of the biological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           entities that are significantly less complex than humans. What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           ever one says in this respect, someone somewhere is going to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           disagree, but I think maybe insects and the like could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           quite reasonably be classed as sentient machines with near
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           Zombie status.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;        3. If we accept a rough and ready type of physicalism, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           naturalism maybe the word I am looking for here, then it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           pretty much axiomatic that the consciousness of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           creature/machine will differ from mine in the same degree that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           its body, instinctive behaviour, and environmental niche
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           differ from mine. I think this must be true of all sentient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           entities. Some of the people I know are 'colour blind'; about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           half the people I know are female; many of the people I know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           exhibit quite substantial differences in temperament and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           predispositions. I take it that these differences from me are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           real and entail various real differences in the quality of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           what it is like to be them [or rather their brain's updating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           of the model of them in their worlds].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         I am interested in birds [and here is meant the feathered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         variety] and often speculate about why they are doing what they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         do and what it may be like to be them. They have very small
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         heads compared to mine so their brains can update their models
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         of self in the world very much faster than mine can. This must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         mean that their perceptions of time and changes are very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         different. To them I must be a very slow and stupid seeming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         terrestrial giant. Also many birds can see by means of ultra
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         violet light. This means that many things such as flowers and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         other birds will look very different compared to what I see.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         [Aside: I am psyching myself up slowly to start creating a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         flight simulator program that flies birds rather than aircraft.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         One of the challenges - by no mean the hardest though -  will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         to represent UV reflectance in a meaningful way.]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. If it behaved as if it were conscious *and* it did this using the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same sort of hardware as I am using (i.e. a human brain) then I would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree that almost certainly it is conscious. If the hardware were on a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different substrate but a direct analogue of a human brain and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result was a functionally equivalent machine then I would be almost as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confident, but if the configuration were completely different I would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not be confident that it was conscious and I would bet that at least it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was differently conscious. As for scientific research, I never managed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to understand why Colin thought this was more than just a version of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turing test.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. I don't consider biological machines to be fundamentally different to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other machines.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. Sure, different entities with (at least) functionally different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brains will be differently conscious. But I like to use &quot;conscious in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the way I am&quot; in order to avoid having to explain or define 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness in general, or my consciousness in particular. I can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningfully talk about &quot;seeing red&quot; to a blind person who has no idea 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what the experience is like: What wavelengths of light lead me to see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; red? Can I still see red if my eyes are closed or my optic nerve 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; severed? What if I have a stroke in the visual cortex? What if certain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parts of my cortex are electrically stimulated? That is, I can go a very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long way with the definition &quot;that experience which i have when a red 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coloured object enters my visual field&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Stathis [from the other posting again]: 'There is good reason to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     believe that the third person observable behaviour of the brain can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     be emulated, because the brain is just chemical reactions and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     chemistry is a well-understood field.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     MP: Once again it depends what you mean. Does 'Third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     observable behaviour of the brain' include EEG recordings and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     output of MRI imaging? Or do you mean just the movements of muscles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     which is the main indicator of brain activity? If the former then I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     think that would be very hard, perhaps impossible; if the latter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     however, that just might be achievable. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Huh? I think it would be a relatively trivial matter to emulate MRI and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; EEG data, certainly compared to emulating behaviour as evidenced by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; muscle activity (complex, intelligent behaviour such as doing science or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; writing novels is after all just muscle activity, which is just chemical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reactions in the muscles triggered by chemical reactions in the brain).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Stathis: 'I think it is very unlikely that something as elaborate as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     consciousness could have developed with no evolutionary purpose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     (evolution cannot distinguish between me and my zombie twin if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     zombies are possible), but it is a logical possibility.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     MP: I agree with the first bit, but I do not agree with the last
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     bit. If you adopt what I call UMSITW [the Updating Model of Self In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The World], then anything which impinges on consciousness, has a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     real effect on the brain. In effect the only feasible zombie like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     persons you will meet will either be sleep walking or otherwise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     deficient as a consequence of drug use or brain trauma. I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Oliver Sachs's book The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat gives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     many examples illustrating the point that all deficiencies in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     consciousness correlate strictly with lesions in the sufferer's brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A human with an intact brain behaving like an awake human could not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really be a zombie unless you believe in magic. However, it is possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to conceive of intelligently-behaving beings who do not have an internal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life because they lack the right sort of brains. I am not suggesting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that this is the case and there are reasons to think it is unlikely to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be the case, but it is not ruled out by any empirical observation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<br />The problem is that there doesn't seem to be any conceivable observation that could rule it out.  So by Popper's rule it is a not a scientific proposition but rather a metaphysical one.  This is another way of saying that there is no agreed upon way of assigning a truth or probability value to it.
