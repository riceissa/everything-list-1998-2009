Dear John,
<br />
<br /><br />Le 17-janv.-07, à 18:11, John M a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may I ask you to spell out your &quot;B&quot; and &quot;D&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in your:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Let D = the proposition &quot;God exists&quot;, &quot;~&quot; = NOT, B = believes.&lt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where I think I cannot substitute your &quot;~&quot; for the &quot;=NOT&quot;  - or, if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the entire line is meaning ONE idea, that &quot;B&quot; believes both the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; affirmative and the negatory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also: the difference between ~BD and ~B~D?
</em><br />
<br /><br />In this paragraph you should interpret B by &quot;believes&quot; or by &quot;the 
<br />
subject believes&quot;. And D is an abbreviation of &quot;God exists&quot; (careful! 
<br />
in other context D is an abbreviation of &quot;~B~&quot;, that is &quot;the subject 
<br />
does not believe in the negation of &quot;.
<br />
<br />Example: B(it rains) = the subject believes it rains.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BD = the subject believes that God exists.
<br />
<br />the tilde symbol  ~    represents the classical negation. A logician 
<br />
will write    ~(it rains)     for saying that it does not rain. So we 
<br />
recover the four modal negation cases already known by Aristotle (as 
<br />
the aristotelian square):
<br />
<br />BD = the subject believes that God exists
<br />
<br />B(~D) = the subject believes that God does not exist
<br />
<br />~BD = the subject does not believe that God exists
<br />
<br />~B~D = the subject does not believe that God does not exist.
<br />
<br />We have:
<br />
<br />BD is true for the so-called &quot;believer&quot; (in God)
<br />
<br />B(~D) is true for the atheist (he is a believer: he believes that God 
<br />
does not exist)
<br />
<br />~BD is true for a (consistent) atheist or for an agnostic
<br />
<br />~B~D is true for a (consistent) believer or for an agnostic.
<br />
<br />To characterize an agnostic, you have to say that both ~BD and ~B~D are 
<br />
true for him. He does neither believe in God, nor in the inexistence of 
<br />
God.
<br />
<br />If you replace God by Santa-Klaus, or by &quot;Primary matter&quot; you get the 
<br />
corresponding notion of believer, atheist, agnostic relatively to Santa 
<br />
Klaus existence or Matter existence ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have the feeling that we both are on the same ground in our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nonexistent beliefs and I expressed that also as being an agnostic, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather than the atheist (who needs a god-concept (incl. matter, for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that matter) to DENY.)
</em><br />
<br /><br />We agree on this, and I think we even agree that we agree on this :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It is contrary to the German common usage of &quot;gottlos&quot; (same in my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language) - but we try to step further than the conventional common 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; historically used  vocabulary.
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Br:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I do neither believe in the inexistence of God, nor in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;inexistence of Matter. I wait for more data.&lt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I took a more straightforward stance when a 'believer' challenged me 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to prove: there is NO god, I said I can disprove only if he proved the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is the quasi-definitive proof that you are a lobian machine ... in 
<br />
case, you accept to interpret arithmetically Plotinus' ONE by &quot;truth&quot;. 
<br />
Lobian machine can disprove any attempt to define truth ...   (this is 
<br />
mainly a consequence of Tarski theorem)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another (redface) ignorance of mine: it seems that your Wi and Fi 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; references appeared in the parts more technical than I could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciously absorb, so I am at a loss.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is not very difficult. According to Norman Samish it looks too much 
<br />
technical for the list, but I am not sure. In general those who have 
<br />
some problem with the technical stuff have just some lack of elementary 
<br />
&quot;modern math&quot;. I will have to come back on the Wi and the Fi, if people 
<br />
are interested in the real stuff ....
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computable must mean more than &quot;Turing emulable&quot; (R.Rosen) since the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unrestricted totality is not available in toto for this later concept.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;total computable&quot; means more than &quot;turing emulable&quot; (partially 
<br />
computable).  Let us not enter in the technics right now, but keep 
<br />
insisting :-)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Br asked:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;You seem quite sure about that. How do you know? &gt;Why couldn'it be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that *you* find this &quot;limited&quot; due to your &gt;own prejudice about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers and machines? &lt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was impregnated by some commi dialectic materialism over 2 decades 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and found a perspective of things developing gradually reasonable. AI 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emulates (some) human mental characteristics and I don't believe that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this process has been completed.
</em><br />
<br />Of course, but I am a theoretician interested in guessing where 
<br />
&quot;matter&quot; and &quot;mind&quot; comes from. Also I have theoretical reasons to 
<br />
believe that AI will never proVably succeed. Comp can be used to 
<br />
predict that even some of the AI products will never believe in AI. 
<br />
Some machine will be anticomputationalist.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I see additional possibilities to extend into, especially in mental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events we have not yet discovered.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmmm... Careful with this type of argument. It is like saying that I 
<br />
don't believe in quantum mechanics because it does not explain how Uri 
<br />
Geller can change the shape of a fork without touching it. I mean few 
<br />
theories can explain things not yet discovered (even theoretically).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This 'feeling' is not due to my - as you say - prejudice about numbers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and machines.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I could not spell out such 'prejudice', not in the least because of my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above argument in agnosticism: I did not get so far a firm support for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 'numbers' being the foundation of everything, so I cannot argue 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against such unproven idea (neither to believe).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lobian machine: I follow a deterministic view: everything that happens 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is entailed by originating processes (whether we know them or not), so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a 'mechanism' can be thought of (machine).  I accept your (Bruno) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teaching about Loeb's original description (I tried to read 'him', but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it was too 'technical) so I feel free to call myself a 'loebian 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine' truthfully. Especially since it is the expression used by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno et al. on this list.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consistent I am in MY common sense (which may be fallse).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Again, you talk like a lobian entity!
<br />
What I like with lobian machines (or entities) is exactly this: they 
<br />
arise from the attempt, made by mathematicians, to build the Leibnizian 
<br />
universal reasoning machine capable of answering all questions in 
<br />
mathematics.
<br />
But now, when we build anything being close to prove the most 
<br />
elementary truth about numbers, such machine, when asked if they will 
<br />
ever say some stupidity, instead of saying arrogantly &quot;no, I never say 
<br />
stupidities&quot;, say exactly the contrary: they say ``either I will say a 
<br />
stupidity, or I might say a stupidity&quot;.  (For the modalist: &quot;B(0 = 1) 
<br />
or DB(0 = 1)&quot;; this is a version of the second incompleteness theorem). 
<br />
Here D = ~B~
<br />
And all their (nameable) consistent extensions are like that !!!!!!!! 
<br />
.... !!!!!!!
<br />
<br />I have already shown that the price of being an universal machine is 
<br />
the possibility to &quot;die/dream/crash/assert-stupidities...&quot;.
<br />
A lobian machine, roughly speaking is a universal machine having the 
<br />
very basic introspective ability to prove this about herself.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; *
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; About the &quot;underlying physical reality&quot;? it became physical only by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our interpretation into matter-based model-view. Reality may be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; underlying - I know nothing about that - but we DO base our figments 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on something. Then we build up a world 'physical'
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I really do not want to tease you:  &quot;or mathematical - numbers based).
</em><br />
<br /><br />No problem,
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Bruno
