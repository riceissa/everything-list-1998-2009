<br />Only you can convince yourself. I try to help by going very slowly,

but people should really mind it y themselves, without hesitating to  
<br />
reread the definitions in case of doubt, or to attack me on the typo  
<br />
errors, I mean it is not very difficult, but revise well the  
<br />
definitions if problems.
<br />
<br />I provide a detailed solution of the first problem, hints for the  
<br />
other problems, and new problems for the adventurous.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) If A has n elements (card(A) = n), how many bijections exists  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from A to B?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      Again start with simple examples, and try to generalize.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      For example, how many bijections from {a, b, c} to {1, 2}. How  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many bijections from (a, b, c} to {a, b, c}?
</em><br />
<br /><br />How many bijections are there from {a, b, c} to {1, 2}?
<br />
<br />Let us try to build one. A bijection is a function which has to be one- 
<br />
one and onto. So I start from {a, b, c}, and I build my bijective  
<br />
function, so I open the accolades &quot;{&quot; , I open the parenthesis &quot;(&quot; of  
<br />
the first couple of my function, and I choose &quot;a&quot; in &quot;{a, b, c}&quot;,  
<br />
which is the set of input/argument of my function. This very beginning  
<br />
looks like
<br />
<br />{(a,
<br />
<br />And I have to decide where in the set {1, 2} &quot;a&quot; will be sent.  
<br />
Remembering all the times that I am building a function, so that once  
<br />
&quot;a&quot; is sent, I can no more send it again, and that my goal here is to  
<br />
build a bijection, so that I cannot send two different elements of my  
<br />
starting set on the same element in the arrival set. Nor should I miss  
<br />
an element of the arrival set.
<br />
<br />Well, cool, I *can* continue, I have actually two choices, I can send  
<br />
&quot;a&quot; on &quot;1&quot;, or I can send &quot;a&quot; on 2. I decide to send it on &quot;1&quot;,
<br />
<br />This means (a, 1) will belong to my bijection, well, the one I try to  
<br />
build.
<br />
My &quot;future&quot; bijection looks like
<br />
<br />{(a, 1),
<br />
<br />And I have to decide where &quot;b&quot; is send, now:   {(a, 1), (b,
<br />
<br />Could I send &quot;b&quot; to &quot;1&quot;? No. I can't. The function would not be one- 
<br />
one! I do have a solution yet, I can send &quot;b&quot; on &quot;2&quot;.
<br />
Note that our freedom has decreased, here. Now my bijection looks like
<br />
<br />{(a, 1), (b, 2),
<br />
<br />And I have to decide where I will send &quot;c&quot;.  {(a, 1), (b, 2), (c,
<br />
<br />Could I send it on &quot;1&quot;? No. I can't. The function would not be one-one!
<br />
Could I send it on &quot;2&quot;? No. I can't. The function would not be one-one!
<br />
Is there anywhere else? Well, the function is from {a, b, c} to {1,  
<br />
2}. If you want a function which i just ONTO, it is OK, send &quot;c&quot; on  
<br />
&quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; as you wish, but none of such function can be one-one.
<br />
<br />Or attempt has failed.
<br />
<br />OK. Perhaps it is like in the Sudoku, and our first choice was bad. My  
<br />
be we should have send &quot;a&quot;, not on &quot;1&quot;, but on &quot;2&quot;, After all we get  
<br />
two choices at the beginning. Surely we have made the bad choice. So  
<br />
let us try again:
<br />
<br />{(a, 2),
<br />
<br />and then
<br />
<br />{(a, 2), (b, 1),   .... we realize with some anxiousness that the  
<br />
number of choices has gone again from 02 to 1, and now we have to send  
<br />
&quot;c&quot; on something which has to be different from &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, and yet  
<br />
in the arrival set {1, 2}. Zero possibility, we are trapped. Perhaps,  
<br />
we should have begin by sending &quot;b&quot;. This would not change anything.
<br />
<br />We have to conclude that there is no bijection from {a, b, c} to {1, 2}.
<br />
<br />Is there a bijection from {1, 2} to {a, b, c}. No. In this case  
<br />
convince yourself that you can build a function which is one-one, but  
<br />
that there is no onto functions.
<br />
<br />Convince yourself that if there is a bijection from A to B, then there  
<br />
is a bijection from B to A. That is why we talk also of bijection  
<br />
between A and B. Hint: show that to each bijection from A to B, you  
<br />
can associate canonically a bijection from B to A.
<br />
<br />How many bijections from (a, b, c} to {a, b, c}? I let you search.  
<br />
Hint: look what happen to our choices above, compare to the choices in  
<br />
our previews counting.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) can you find, or define a bijection between the infinite set N,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the infinite set E = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ...} (E for even).
</em><br />
<br /><br />This means, by definition of bijection, can you find a function from N  
<br />
to E which is both one-one and onto.
<br />
<br />Example:
<br />
<br />The identity function which send n on n, that is I = {(0,0), (1,1),  
<br />
(2,2), (3, 3) ...} is a function from N to N which is onto and one- 
<br />
one. It is a bijection between N and itself. But it is not a function  
<br />
from N to E.
<br />
<br />The function which send n on 8*n, that is, f8 = {(0,0) (1,8) (2,16),  
<br />
(3, 24), ...} is a function from N to E. And it is one-one. But it is  
<br />
not onto. The number 04 in E remains untouched by it, like 6, or 66, or  
<br />
82, and many other numbers in E.
<br />
<br />To find a bijection between N and E, just search for a function which  
<br />
is one and onto, from N to E.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) Key questions for the sequel, on which you can meditate:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - is there a bijection between N and NxN?      (NxN = the cartesian  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; product of N with N)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - is there a bijection between N and N^N?
</em><br />
<br /><br />New exercises for the adventurous:
<br />
<br />In the context of sets, 2 will represent the set {0, 1}. OK?  And 03  
<br />
will represent {0, 1, 2}, etc.
<br />
<br />Find a bijection between NxN and N^2
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this means find a bijection between NXN and the set of functions  
<br />
from 2(= {0,1})  to N.
<br />
<br />Define NxNxN by Nx(NxN), with (x,y,z) represented (bijectively) by (x, 
<br />
(y,z)) OK?
<br />
<br />Find a bijection between NxNxN and N^3
<br />
<br />Show that there is a bijection between NxNxNxNxNx ... xN (m times) and  
<br />
N^m, in the sense of above. That is
<br />
NxNxNxNxNx ... xN is defined by Nx(Nx(Nx ... ))))), and N^m is the set  
<br />
of functions from m to N, and m = {0, 1, ... m-1}.
<br />
<br />For the very adventurous:
<br />
<br />Find a bijection between NxNxNx ....  and N^N?
<br />
<br />Despite perhaps the appearances, all those new exercises are rather  
<br />
easy. The above in &quot;4)&quot; key questions are more difficult.
<br />
<br />Oh! I forget to ask you the simplest exercise :
<br />
<br />Find a bijection between N and N^1,  with 01 = {0}.
<br />
<br />N^1 is of course the set of functions from 1 to N, i.e. from {0} to N.
<br />
<br />Don't worry, if this last exercise didn't give the clue (for the new  
<br />
exercises), I will explain why this new exercises are really simple,  
<br />
and why it is simpler than the key questions.
<br />
<br />OK, this is food for friday and the week-end,
<br />
Ask any questions, or do any remarks. We approach surely to the first  
<br />
big theorem (Cantor).
<br />
<br />Bruno
