Can you explain briefly why the choice of measure is subjective? I 
<br />
haven't read any of the
<br />
books you mentioned (will try to get to them) but am familiar with 
<br />
computability theory
<br />
and decision theory.
<br />
<br />In my favourite interpretation of the multiverse, as  a very long 
<br />
(possibly lengthening)
<br />
qubitstring containing all of the possible information-states implied in 
<br />
such a long bitstring,
<br />
the &quot;absolute&quot; measure of any information-state (instantaneous state of 
<br />
some universe)
<br />
would be the same as any other state of the same bitstring length.
<br />
<br />In that framing of things,  I guess there's another definition of 
<br />
measure, which goes something
<br />
like this:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Let Ui be an &quot;internal-time-ordered&quot; set of information-states 
<br />
s1,s2,...,s(now)    comprising
<br />
an observable universe.
<br />
<br />Ui, to be observable, is constrained to be an informationally 
<br />
self-consistent
<br />
(too complex a concept to get into right here) set of information-states.
<br />
<br />There is a constraint on any information-state which qualifies to be 
<br />
s(now+1) in any observable
<br />
universe path s1,s2,...,S(now). Specifically, any information-state that 
<br />
can be S(now+1)
<br />
must be informationally consistent (not law violating) in conjunction 
<br />
with s1,s2,...,S(now).
<br />
<br />Furthermore, the history that has evolved as s1,s2,...,s(now) has the 
<br />
result of determining
<br />
the Ui-relative probability of any particular other information-state 
<br />
being able to become
<br />
s(now+1) in that observable path.
<br />
<br />That now-in-an-observable-universe-relative probability of successorhood 
<br />
in that universe
<br />
of any other information-state is then a universe-specific measure 
<br />
value, or more specifically,
<br />
a now-state-of-universe specific measure value.
<br />
<br />That now-in-an-observable-universe measure (for potential successor 
<br />
information states for that
<br />
universe state-set) may correspond to the probabilities of  all the 
<br />
outcomes of all the wave equations
<br />
of quantum-states which are observable in the &quot;now&quot; moment in that universe.
<br />
<br />As a comp sci person and not a physicist, I look forward to your read on 
<br />
where my interpretation
<br />
is misguided, and for a better interpretation.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Some people have argued that in fact survival is an objective goal,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be modified to an assertion that people who don't pursue survival have low
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure. However the choice of measure itself is subjective, so why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shouldn't one use a measure in which people who don't pursue survival have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;high measure (e.g., one which favors universes where those people

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;survive anyway through good luck or benevolent gods)?
