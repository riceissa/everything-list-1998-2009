<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations reveal M.
</em><br />
<br />There is no need to change measures. When Bob repeatedly observes balls 
<br />
falling down, he'll conclude that he happens to be stuck in a low-measure 
<br />
universe and will just have to deal with it. The issue is, what does he do 
<br />
before making the first observation? At that point he thinks he should bet 
<br />
on the ball falling up, and wouldn't be irrational to do so. And Alice 
<br />
thinks she should bet on the ball falling down, and wouldn't be irrational 
<br />
to do so either.
<br />
<br />Maybe a different example will make my point clearer. We could be living
<br />
in base reality or a simulation. You can choose a measure in which the
<br />
observer-moments like us living in base reality have a greater measure, or
<br />
one in which the observer-moments living in simulations have a greater
<br />
measure. These two measures have different implications on rational
<br />
behavior. The former implies we should plan for the far future, whereas
<br />
the latter says we should live for today because the simulation might end
<br />
at any moment, and we should try to behave in ways that wouldn't bore the
<br />
people who might be running and observing the simulation. (See Robin
<br />
Hanson's &quot;How To Live In A Simulation&quot;,
<br />
<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/lifeinsim.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/lifeinsim.html</a>).
<br />
<br />Can you offer any arguments that one of these choices is 
<br />
irrational?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, this will demand that in White Rabbit universes, ones where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum or thermodynamic laws just happen to fail due to bad luck, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rational person would have to abandon his (correct!) belief in a lawful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe and come to believe (incorrectly!) in miracles.  However this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is actually a reasonable requirement, since we are stipulating that such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; miracles have been observed.
</em><br />
<br />You can come to believe in miracles without changing measures. You 
<br />
just conclude that you're probably in a low-measure universe with 
<br />
miracles, instead of an even-lower-measure universe where the White Rabbit 
<br />
appeared through pure chance.
<br />
<br />The beauty of the universal distributions is that if you adopt one of them
<br />
as the measure, you'll never(1) &quot;go crazy&quot; (i.e. start behaving absurdly)
<br />
after making any observation, because no matter what you observe, you'll
<br />
still prefer the algorithmically simplest explanation for your
<br />
observations. But the infinite class of universal distributions leaves you 
<br />
plenty of room to choose which universes or observer-moments are most 
<br />
important to you.
<br />
<br />(1) Well that's not completely true. You would still go crazy
<br />
if you observe something that has a logical explanation but not an
<br />
algorithmic one, for example if you observe something that can only be
<br />
explained by an uncomputable law of physics, which is why I advocate 
<br />
adopting more dominant measures based on logic or set theory.
