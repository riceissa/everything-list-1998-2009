<br /><br />Yes but the computer itself can not find this level in a provable way.

This is not obvious (search for benacerraf in the archive).

</em><br />
<br /><br />Please Neil, I quite respect the belief in the physical world, but
<br />
I argue since the begining that such a belief is inconsistent 
<br />
with comp. Physics supervene on the sharable experience of immaterial
<br />
machines existing in the Platonia.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consistancy (in the way I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understand that you to mean it) seems to be something we map onto the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;external world, rather than something that is inherant in physical nature. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why does matter need to exist at all?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't believe in matter (personal opinion)
<br />
Comp is incompatible (in some sense) with existing matter (my thesis).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Although I may not be able to convince anyone else of my perceptions, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can admit to myself that I am sure of them. A computer however, would have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to admit, even to itself, that it was not sure that it had actually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experienced what its memory dictates that it had experienced. 
</em><br />
<br />Neither are we. I can be sure I feel pain here and now, but not that
<br />
I had experience it. See previous discussions on both lists.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way it [the computer] can be certain whatsoever. Why would a computer ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have an infallible 'inner perception'?
</em><br />
<br />Why not. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let's say we take a snapshot of a consistant conscious computer that's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;been evolved to a certain point. It's possible for me to have created an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;identical computer from nothing, without having the need to evolve it. Now 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the first evolved computer, is consistant and may even have an accurate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;set of memories, reflecting where it is now, and where is has been, etc... 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, the second created machine, which is in *exactly* the same state 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as the first, has a set of false memories, that we know that it has never 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actually experienced. Its only resort, on the basis of its 'infallibility' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is that it did in fact experience them, but in the platonic (timeless) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world and not in our own. The consistancy of the computer has not been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contravened, as perhaps it would have been (as you have said previously) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if I had simply changed its memory; yet its inner certainty of memory is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fallible.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree and that is why I believe that IF we are machine THEN we are
<br />
immaterial machine. We have never leave Plato heaven if you want.
<br />
Now I don't believe &quot;copy of material universe&quot; exists in Platonia.
<br />
Appearance of physical universes emerges on the computational histories.
<br />
To explain appearnance of lawfulness we need to take into account
<br />
*ALL* computational histories.
<br />
<br />You are quite consistent, Neil. You are saying COMP entails we can
<br />
always be 3-person fallible, and I say the same. In my thesis I get
<br />
the 1-person non fallibility simply by defining knowledge by the
<br />
true (by definition) justifiable assertion. The nuance between true
<br />
and provable comes from incompleteness phenomena.
<br />
<br />No doubt comp looks weird, especially for the &quot;religious believer&quot; in
<br />
universes. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From where exactly do we get our sense of infallible perception? Are we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;going to stop short of trying to explain it? I must admit that if there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a wholly classical explanation of my 'inner certainty', then I have none!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Plato propose one in his Thaetetus, which can be translate in arithmetic
<br />
through Godel, and which explain at least why consistent machine can 
<br />
learn to distinguish 1 and 3 person point of view. Actually it explains
<br />
why it is quasi-impossible for a consistent machine to believe that 
<br />
it/he/she
<br />
is a consistent machine.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Perhaps we just cannot be sure of that link. This has nothing to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;with infallibility of inner experiences. It is the link between first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;person experience and third person &quot;reality&quot; which can be fallible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree that there is a problem translating from first person experiene to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;third person reality.  However, I believe that memory is a first-person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience, as opposed to something that is 'out-there', in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'third-person', that has a physical explanation/theory that is more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fundamental than the actuality of the experience.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This confirms what I say, you reason quite correctly. Now comp is
<br />
my working hypothesis (I don't care at all if comp is true or false).
<br />
What I say is that IF comp is true then the apparently 3-person
<br />
physical phenomena are in reality the result of interference and
<br />
partial sharing of many number theoretical machine anticipations.
<br />
<br />But so we agree. If there is a physical universe then comp is false.
<br />
Equivalently if comp is true there is no physical universe.
<br />
<br />Now you could ask me how I can still keep comp because &quot;is it not
<br />
obvious there is a physical universe?&quot; It is not, especially when
<br />
you realise that the incompleteness phenomena is enough rich
<br />
for justifying the appearance of the belief in a universe, without
<br />
any universe. Some quantum weirdness get rather nice explanation,
<br />
even if they are probably very counter-intuitive.
