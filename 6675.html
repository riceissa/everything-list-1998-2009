<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's suppose with Wei Dai that a measure can be applied to Tegmark's

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything. It certainly can to the set of UTM programs as per Schmidhuber 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and related proposals.  Obviously it is possible to assign a measure which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solves the White Rabbit problem, such as the UP.  But to me this procedure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is very suspicious.  We can get whatever answer we like by picking the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right measure.  While the UP and similar are presented by their proponents 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as &quot;natural&quot;, my strong suspicion is that if we lived in a universe that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was obviously algorithmically very complex, we would see papers arguing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for &quot;natural&quot; measures that reward algorithmic complexity. In fact the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; White Rabbit argument is basically an assertion that such measures *are* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural.  Why one measure rather than another? By the logic of Tegmark's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original thesis, we should consider the set of all possible measures over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything. But then we need a measure on the measures, and so ad 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinitum.
</em><br />
<br />I agree that this is a potential problem and an area where more work
<br />
is needed.  We do know that the universal distribution has certain
<br />
nice properties that make it stand out, that algorithmic complexity
<br />
is asymptotically unique up to a constant, and similar results which
<br />
suggest that we are not totally off base in granting these measures the
<br />
power to determine which physical realities we are likely to experience.
<br />
But certainly the argument is far from iron-clad and it's not clear how
<br />
well the whole thing is grounded.  I hope that in the future we will
<br />
have a better understanding of these issues.
<br />
<br />I don't agree however that we are attracted to simplicity-favoring
<br />
measures merely by virtue of our particular circumstances.  The universal
<br />
distribution was invented decades ago as a mathematical object of study,
<br />
and Chaitin's work on algorithmic complexity is likewise an example of
<br />
pure math.  These results can be used (loosely) to explain and justify
<br />
the success of Occam's Razor, and with more difficulty to explain why
<br />
the universe is as we see it, but that's not where they came from.
<br />
<br />Besides, it's not all that clear that our own universe is as simple as
<br />
it should be.  CA systems like Conway's Life allow for computation and
<br />
might even allow for the evolution of intelligence, but our universe's
<br />
rules are apparently far more complex.  Wolfram studied a variety of
<br />
simple computational systems and estimated that from 1/100 to 1/100000 of
<br />
them were able to maintain stable structures with interesting behavior
<br />
(like Life).  These tentative results suggest that it shouldn't take
<br />
all that much law to create life, not as much as we see in this universe.
<br />
<br />I take from this a prediction of the all-universe hypothesis to be that
<br />
it will turn out either that our universe is a lot simpler than we think,
<br />
or else that these very simple universes actually won't allow the creation
<br />
of stable, living beings.  That's not vacuous, although it's not clear
<br />
how long it will be before we are in a position to refute it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've overlooked until now the fact that mathematical physics restricts 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself to (almost-everywhere) differentiable functions of the continuum. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is the cardinality of the set of such functions? I rather suspect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they are denumerable, hence exactly representable by UTM programs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps this is what Russell Standish meant.
</em><br />
<br />The cardinality of such functions is c, the same as the continuum.
<br />
The existence of the constant functions alone shows that it is at least c,
<br />
and my understanding is that continuous, let alone differentiable, functions
<br />
have cardinality no more than c.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I must insist though, that there exist mathematical objects in platonia 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which require c bits to describe (and some which require more), and hence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can't be represented either by a UTM program or by the output of a UTM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence Tegmark's original everything is bigger than Schmidhuber's.  But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these structures are so arbitrary it is hard to imagine SAS in them, so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maybe it makes no anthropic difference.
</em><br />
<br />Whether Tegmark had those structures in mind or not, we can certainly
<br />
consider such an ensemble - the name is not important.  I posted last
<br />
Monday a summary of a paper by Frank Tipler which proposed that in fact
<br />
our universe's laws do require c bits to describe themm, and a lot of
<br />
other crazy ideas as well,
<br />
<a href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0034-4885/68/4/R04">http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0034-4885/68/4/R04</a> .  I don't think it
<br />
was particularly convincing, but it did offer a way of thinking about
<br />
infinitely complicated natural laws.  One simple example would be the fine
<br />
structure constant, which might turn out to be an uncomputable number.
<br />
That wouldn't be inconsistent with our existence, but it is hard to see
<br />
how our being here could depend on such a property.
