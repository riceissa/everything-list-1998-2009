<br />
Thanks for your reply.  I have a lot to say, so let me try to rate my
<br />
breath, as it were.
<br />
<br />1. It is nice to hear a human say this is uncharted territory.  Since
<br />
I am not in a graduate school now and have no affiliation, my research
<br />
resources are limited compared to having free access to basically any
<br />
relevant publication.  I really had no idea if this was charted
<br />
territory; if it was, that shoots down it being potentially used as
<br />
part of a PhD problem (which I'm considering going for, but others
<br />
have convinced me I'd have to move to Europe which is exceptionally
<br />
logistically hard for me due to strong unmovable attachments, if you
<br />
will -- I'm +not+ a 20-something person without a family, and such).
<br />
<br />2. I appreciate immensely the last line of your message.  Over the
<br />
years, I've asked many authors something like, &quot;do you think Russell's
<br />
paradox might be false in other logics&quot; I got, let's say, an extremely
<br />
condescending response, and so forth.  I'm not expecting praise, by
<br />
God, just to not be condescended to.  I suppose that is why I was
<br />
touchy when I perceived someone totally derailing this line of
<br />
discussion and that being continued by the third poster.  My bad.  I
<br />
think my main improvement, while not really coming close to really
<br />
answering my question, was changing the goal from prove Russell's
<br />
Theorem is not always true to asking the question &quot;Is Russell's
<br />
Theorem true in all logics?&quot;  A bonus seems that now there is a
<br />
theoretical physics, by way of the MUH, motivation for answering this
<br />
question.
<br />
<br />3. On that note, Physics/Philosophy actually what inspired me to go in
<br />
this direction.  I was mainly, back then when this idea of trying to
<br />
find a consistent universal set theory occurred to me, trying to
<br />
answer a intended-to-be serious argument against the existence of the
<br />
universe.
<br />
<br />I was stunned at the notion that someone was trying to prove the
<br />
universe does not exist.  I think they were asserting some form of
<br />
solipsism.
<br />
<br />In a nutshell, here was their argument.  My opinion is that it is not
<br />
at all formal but very clever and probably persuasive but, ultimately,
<br />
like the many clever &quot;proofs&quot; that 1=2 and such.  It's just going to
<br />
be convincing to those who aren't vigorously attacking the argument,
<br />
which I soon did.
<br />
<br />&lt;begin their argument for the non-existence for the universe&gt;
<br />
Definition: To contain means &lt;insert something most people would
<br />
accept here&gt;.  The notation and word for 'is contained in' is
<br />
is&lt;in.
<br />
<br />Thing and exists are undefined or ... acceptably defined only be
<br />
common intuitive sense of what a thing is, but neither formally (in
<br />
her argument)
<br />
<br />Definition: the universe (call it U) is a thing that has the property
<br />
that it contains all things, notated by (x) (x is&lt;in U), where x is a
<br />
thing.
<br />
<br />Theorem: If the universe exists then the (three or so) axioms of
<br />
binary logic are inconsistent.
<br />
Proof: The method is to show that if U exists then there is a logical
<br />
statement (ie, a WELL FORMED formula) that is true if and only it is
<br />
false, being simultaneously, to abuse language, true and not true,
<br />
which violates the +definition+ of the words not and and.
<br />
<br />Suppose U exists.  Then apply Russell's approach.  Given how broad and
<br />
vague 'thing' is defined, let's discuss the thing, call it S, this
<br />
thing called S is the thing that contains all things that don't
<br />
contain themselves.  In the notation, let S be the thing (given the
<br />
vagueness of 'thing', S is a thing) such that
<br />
(x) (x is&lt;in S if and only if x!&lt;x).
<br />
In other words, S is the thing such that for all things x, x is
<br />
contained in S if and only if x is not contained in x.
<br />
<br />Since we wrote (x), then apply to S by an application of some
<br />
universal quantifier rule, which most people would accept (and maybe
<br />
they should qualify the universal sometimes) to S. Then you get, just
<br />
as Russell's approach:
<br />
<br />(S is&lt;inS if and only if S!&lt;S).
<br />
<br />This contradiction proves the theorem.  That if the universe exists,
<br />
then binary logic is inconsistent.
<br />
<br /><br />Corollary: The universe does not exist.
<br />
&quot;Proof:&quot;  Binary logic is consistent, therefore, by contraposition of
<br />
the theorem, the universe does not exist.
<br />
<br />&lt;end their argument for the non-existence for the universe&gt;
<br />
<br /><br />I've been banging away at this keyboard for a while so I'll post this
<br />
and take a break.
<br />
<br />The idea came to me when I tried basically to prove her argument that
<br />
the universe does NOT exist, wrong.  It occurred to me that three
<br />
truth values are sufficient to make the usual proof by contradiction
<br />
+not a tautology+.  And, therefore, even in 3-valued logic, her
<br />
argument fails.
<br />
<br />Obviously, that doesn't prove the universe does exist, it just proves
<br />
her argument that is doesn't is wrong.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&lt;end their argument for the non-existence for the universe&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your inquiries about FL is an uncharted but important one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'd like to suggest though that your approach is too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conventional and 'consistency' is not the ultimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criteria for evaulating it's connection with validity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or more importantly - feasability - in context with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'logic' - and mathematical value judgements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've taken a wholly different/radical approach which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has been productive.  &quot;Existential Probability&quot; is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strong and broader base to use and in general is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an umbrella-space for all logic systems.  I call the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most generalized form &quot;Stochastic Logic&quot;.  It has the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting attribute of placing FL and QM on a par,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the scheme of things, with direct connection with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Boole, and Aristotelian logic before-that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In historical framing, it can be seen that the earliest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logics were limited-specific-condition logics and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each new step was toward 'improved generalization'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The leap that FL makes is removing the boundaries of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the probability space and pushing toward a 'logic'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system that copes with Cantorian infinities and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transfinites.  It pushes towards plural-criteria
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic (what you've indicated as akin to Multi-modal).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is a critically important step that out-paces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the conventional analysis.  Think of it as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tool to developing utile computation/description
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; methods for 'logic' evaluation of the (so far)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intractible &quot;many bodied&quot; problem.  Complexity math
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is one way of coping with -some- factors of many-bodied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems, but even that math hasn't been fully scrutinized
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or (logically) evaluated for kladistic characteristics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yet.  I've looked some of the equation forms and found
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some interesting things going on in 'recursion' equations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that relate to breaking away from 'zero to one' boundary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restriction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I discuss a bit of it in general vernacular at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I made an effort several years ago to get Lotfi Zadeh speaking

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and leading edge probability theories could find commonality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They did talk some but nothing definitive or fruitful came
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from it - mainly because each had too much vested interest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in separate academic venues.  And because second and third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generation 'probabilists' were so dedicated to their particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stances on 'how the math &quot;should&quot; be done', instead of opening
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves to combining the methodologies into a grander
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; schemata - it's going to take someone or someones with -your-

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sensibility and intuitions to make it happen.   :-)
