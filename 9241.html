Bruno,
<br />
<br />To help us understand this:  How is this different from saying the toss 
<br />
of a coin is both unpredictable and yet determined by laws?
<br />
<br />Another thought is that there are the two extremes of the meaning of 
<br />
&quot;law&quot;:
<br />
<br />1) The reductionist definition that something can be predicted by the 
<br />
sum of atomic parts and rules.
<br />
With the primes it is the integers and addition and multiplication.  
<br />
With a coin supposedly it is &quot;atoms&quot; and the laws of physics.
<br />
2) The statistical definition that something follows a certain 
<br />
distribution over many trials.
<br />
With the primes it would be the prime number theorem or more precise 
<br />
bounds on the distribution of the primes.  With a coin it would be the 
<br />
binomial distribution.
<br />
<br />This brought up another thought.  The definition of the primes is a 
<br />
negative definition, an integer having no factors other than 1 and 
<br />
itself.  Of course this is what makes it difficult to determine if a 
<br />
large number is prime.  But is there something about a negative 
<br />
definition that sets us up for... what... not being able to understand 
<br />
something?  This also reminds me of the diagonalization process, 
<br />
defining something by saying it is not something else, like Chaitin 
<br />
does with his Omega, and of course Cantor with the reals (resulting in 
<br />
the mystery of the continuum hypothesis).  Another famous negative 
<br />
definition is that of infinity, which causes so many weirdnesses in 
<br />
divergent series, and talking about the multiverse, etc.
<br />
<br />Perhaps free will is such a mytery because it can be defined only 
<br />
negatively.  Free from what?
<br />
<br />Tom

Subject: Do prime numbers have free will?
<br />
<br />Hi,
<br />
<br />I love so much this citation (often quoted) of D. Zagier, which seems
<br />
to me to describe so well what is peculiar with ... humans, which
<br />
behaviors are simultaneously completely determinated by numbers/math or
<br />
waves/physics and at the same time are so much rich and unpredictible.
<br />
I find instructive to see that primes already behaves like that ....
<br />
<br /><br />&quot;There are two facts about the distribution of prime numbers of which I
<br />
hope to convince you so overwhelmingly that they will be permanently
<br />
engraved in your hearts. The first is that, despite their simple
<br />
definition and role as the building blocks of the natural numbers, the
<br />
prime numbers...grow like weeds among the natural numbers, seeming to
<br />
obey no other law than that of chance, and nobody can predict where the
<br />
next one will sprout. The second fact is even more astonishing, for it
<br />
states just the opposite: that the prime numbers exhibit stunning
<br />
regularity, that there are laws governing their behaviour, and that
<br />
they obey these laws with almost military precision.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Bruno
