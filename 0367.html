Hi James, Hi Everythingers,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno, I will think about who might translate your fine thesis.
</em><br />
<br />Thank you very much.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno, you want to say mater is a subset of mind, wheras I said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mind was a subset of matter. This is a semantic point. I adopt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your terminology if you prefer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno, Russell, Jacques - you correct me where I ask what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;50% of infinity. OK, I'm wrong on this. But this measure stuff
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and 'instantiating' discussion is a red herring.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I'm afraid I don't agree, but you are very coherent : the question &quot;is 
<br />
matter a subset of mind or is mind a subset of matter ?&quot; is not a 
<br />
question of terminology, and this is a reason why the measure stuff 
<br />
discussion is not a red herring.
<br />
<br />May be I should ask you first what you really mean by matter, and what 
<br />
you mean by mind, but what I want to say is simply this. A priori there 
<br />
is more computationnal states (and histories) than quantum computationnal 
<br />
states (and histories). 
<br />
And you cannot (both with MWI, or mechanism) associate your consciousness 
<br />
with a machine state (history), you must associate it with with an 
<br />
infinite set of states (histories). [This is not an obvious statement : 
<br />
it has been seen independently by myself 1988, Maudlin 1989, and clearly 
<br />
Hal Finney has seen that point in this very discussion list, it is here 
<br />
that counterfactuality intervenes]
<br />
<br />THEN
<br />
<br />If you belief that matter is fundamental, and if you belief QM is correct 
<br />
(all this is a little mysterious for me) then to explain the apparent 
<br />
working of our prediction (in laboratory and in everyday life) you need 
<br />
to solve a measure problem. Indeed you must find a (relative) measure on 
<br />
the accessible quantum histories. That work has been partially completed 
<br />
by people like Everett, Graham, Gleason, Finkelstein, Hartle, Griffith, 
<br />
Omnes, etc. The completion, if not the completability of that work is 
<br />
still controversial.
<br />
<br />BUT
<br />
<br />Now, if you belief mind is fundamental, and if you belief COMP is correct 
<br />
(where COMP = the belief that you can survive a finitely describable 
<br />
substitution of yourself), then to explain the apparent working of our 
<br />
prediction (in laboratory and in everyday life) you need to solve a much 
<br />
more complex measure problem. Indeed you need to justify both the 
<br />
classical AND the quantum probabilities from the &quot;mechanist&quot; 
<br />
indeterminism. That is you must find a (relative) measure on the set of 
<br />
accessible computationnal histories. And this is a priori a bigger set 
<br />
than the set of quantum histories. The nice thing is that a success here 
<br />
would provide an answer to the question &quot;where does the law of physics 
<br />
come from ?&quot;. (This can also be seen as an application of the weak 
<br />
anthropic principle on number theory).
<br />
<br />Put in another way : with QM you have many &quot;worlds&quot;, but, a priori, not 
<br />
as many than with COMP. With COMP I think we must justify, in a purely 
<br />
non empirical way, why the vast majority of computationnal state we are 
<br />
living seems to be quantum computationnal state. 
<br />
And because computer science and number theory are an highly non trivial 
<br />
corpus of truth, there are hope that such a task can be completed. If the 
<br />
task is shown logically impossible then COMP would be definitely refuted. 
<br />
If the task would be completed, then, we get a real and definitive (with 
<br />
COMP!) theoretical reduction of physics to computer science, including an 
<br />
explanation why we believe there is a (lawfull) universe.
<br />
<br />I feel I agree a lot with Hal Finney and Wei Dai on these questions, 
<br />
except that I don't attribute any meaning to absolute probability of 
<br />
being me, only to conditionnal probability of staying me, ... For 
<br />
exemple, It seems obvious to me that the doomsday argument will not apply 
<br />
neither with COMP, nor with MWI. Nevertheless, I believe that Leslie 
<br />
argument can work with NOT-COMP in a &quot;Newtonian and unique&quot; universe.
<br />
And it seems to me that I agree with Jacques M on a lot of points, except 
<br />
I do not understand why he seems so reluctant to Quantum Suicide. With 
<br />
COMP, even if QM  happens to be completely false (I doubt that!), we 
<br />
still survive &quot;COMP suicide&quot;.
<br />
<br />A+ Bruno
