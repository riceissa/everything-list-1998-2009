<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So for that to be a plausible scenario we have to

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; say that a person at a particular instant in time can be fully

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; described by some set of data.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not fully. I agree with Brent that you need an interpreter to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that person manifest herself in front of you. A bit like a CD, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will need a player to get the music.
</em><br />
<br />It seems to me that consciousness is the self-interpretion of
<br />
information.  David Chalmers has a good line:  &quot;Experience is
<br />
information from the inside; physics is information from the outside.&quot;
<br />
<br />I still don't see what an interpreter adds, except to satisfy the
<br />
intuition that something is &quot;happening&quot; that &quot;produces&quot;
<br />
consciousness.  Which I think is an attempt to reintroduce &quot;time&quot;.
<br />
<br />But I don't see any advantage of this view over the idea that
<br />
conscious states just &quot;exist&quot; as a type of platonic form (as Brent
<br />
mentioned earlier).  At any given instant that I'm awake, I'm
<br />
conscious of SOMETHING.  And I'm conscious of it by virtue of my
<br />
mental state at that instant.  In the materialist view, my mental
<br />
state is just the state of the particles of my brain at that
<br />
instant.
<br />
<br />But I say that what this really means is that my mental state is just
<br />
the information represented by the particles of my brain at that
<br />
instant.  And that if you transfer that information to a computer and
<br />
run a simulation that updates that information appropriately, my
<br />
consciousness will continue in that computer simulation, regardless of
<br />
the hardware (digital computer, mechanical computer, massively
<br />
parallel or single processor, etc) or algorithmic details of that
<br />
computer simulation.
<br />
<br />But, what is information?  I think it has nothing to do with physical
<br />
storage or instantiation.  I think it has an existence seperate from
<br />
that.  A platonic existence.  And since the information that
<br />
represents my brain exists platonically, then the information for
<br />
every possible brain (including variations of my brain) should also
<br />
exist platonically.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Conscious experience is with the information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Conscious experience is more the content, or the interpretation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that information, made by a person or by a universal machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the doctor makes a copy of your brain, and then codes it into a bit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; string, and then put the bit string in the fridge, in our probable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history, well in that case you will not survive, in our local probable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history.
</em><br />
<br />Given the platonic nature of information, this isn't really a
<br />
concern.  In Platonia, you always have a &quot;next moment&quot;.  In fact, you
<br />
experience all possible &quot;next moments&quot;.  The &quot;no cul-de-sac&quot; rule
<br />
applies I think.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you say yes to a doctor for a digital brain, you will ask for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain which functions relatively to our probable computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history. No?
</em><br />
<br />I won't worry about it too much, as there is no doctor, only my
<br />
perceptions of a doctor.  Every possible outcome of the &quot;brain
<br />
replacement operation&quot; that I can perceive, I will perceive.
<br />
Including outcomes that don't make any sense.
<br />
<br />Additionally, every possible outcome of the operation that the doctor
<br />
can percieve, he will perceive.  Including outcomes that don't make
<br />
any sense.
<br />
<br />So it seems to me that a lot of your effort goes into explaining why
<br />
we don't see strange &quot;white rabbit&quot; universes.  Thus the talk of
<br />
probabilities and measures.  I'm willing to just say that all
<br />
universes are experienced.  Strange ones, normal ones, good ones, bad
<br />
ones, ones with unbreakable physical laws, ones with no obvious
<br />
physical laws at all.  It's all a matter of perception, not a matter
<br />
of physical realization.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes there is a world in which you computer will transform itself into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a green flying pig. The &quot;scientific&quot;, but really everyday life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question, is, what is the &quot;probability&quot; this will happen to &quot;me&quot; here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and now.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure what it means to ask, &quot;what is the probability that my
<br />
computer will turn into a green pig&quot;.  One of me will observe
<br />
everything that can be observed in the next instant.  How many things
<br />
is that?  I'm not sure.  More than 10...ha!  Setting aside physical
<br />
limits, maybe infinitely many?  Given that I might also get extra
<br />
sensory capacity in that instant, or extra cognitive capacity, or
<br />
whatever.
<br />
<br />So, of course all of that sounds somewhat crazy, but that's where you
<br />
end up when you try to explain consciousness I think.  Any explanation
<br />
that doesn't involve eliminativism is going to be strange I think.
<br />
<br />But, if you are willing to say that consciousness is an illusion, then
<br />
you can just stick with materialism/physicalism and you're fine.  In
<br />
that case there's no need to invoke any of this more esoteric stuff
<br />
like platonism.  Right?
