<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hi Jesse,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I was still trying to put some sort of reply together to your last post, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but I think your water analogy is making me more rather than less confused 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as to your actual position on these issues, which is obviously something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you have thought deeply about. With the puzzle in this thread, I was hoping 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that it would be clear that the subject in the room *has* to experience the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;light changing colour every 10 minutes, and therefore can draw no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conclusion about which state is the high measure one. It seems that many on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this list would indeed say that running a mind in parallel increases its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure, and some would say (eg. Saibal Mitra in recent discussions - I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;still have to get back to you too, Saibal) that the subject would therefore 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;find himself continually cycling in the 10^100 group.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To summarise my position, it is this: the measure of an observer moment is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relevant when a given observer is contemplating what will happen next. If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there are 2N successor OM's where he will experience A and 3N successor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OM's where he will experience B, then he can assume Pr(A)=0.4 and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Pr(B)=0.6. Only the ratio matters. Moreover, the ratio/ relative measure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can only be of relevance at a particular time point, when considering the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;immediate future. To say that an individual will not live to 5000 years 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even though there exist OM's where he is this age, because his measure is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;much higher when he is under 100 years of age, makes no sense to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, minimising acronym use, could you explain what your understanding is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of how measure changes with number of copies of an OM which are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instantiated, and if it doesn't, then how does it change, and when you use 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it in calculating how someone's life will go from OM to OM.
</em><br />
<br />Well, see my last response to Hal Finney; I don't have a definite answer to 
<br />
how the number of physical copies (as viewed from a third-person persective) 
<br />
affects measure, because my idea is just to start with the set of all 
<br />
possible distinct observer-moments and try to derive a unique 
<br />
self-consistent absolute and relative measure on them, and thenmy hope is 
<br />
that somehow you could derive the appearance of a regular physical universe 
<br />
from the measure on observer-moments. The measure on the set of all unique 
<br />
observer-moments is really the fundamental thing, physical notions like 
<br />
&quot;number of copies&quot; are secondary. But I have speculated on the 
<br />
&quot;anticipatory&quot; idea where multiple copies affects your conditional 
<br />
probabilities to the extend that the copies are likely to diverge in the 
<br />
future; so in your example, as long as those 10^100 copies are running in 
<br />
isolated virtual environments and following completely deterministic rules, 
<br />
they won't diverge, so my speculation is that the absolute and relative 
<br />
measures would not be affected in any way by this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also, you have talked about memory loss, perhaps even complete memory loss, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;while still being you: in what sense are you still you? Isn't that like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;saying I am the reincarnation of Alexander the Great or something?
</em><br />
<br />If we have a formal theory of the &quot;similarity&quot; between observer-moments, it 
<br />
seems unlikely to me that there would be a sharp cutoff where I could have a 
<br />
nonzero similarity to observer-moment A but 0 similarity to observer-moment 
<br />
B which differs only in the tiniest way from A. Certainly, the similarity of 
<br />
my current OM to an OM of Alexander the Great would seem to be greater than 
<br />
the similarity between my current OM and an OM of a bat or an alien or 
<br />
something; even if the details of our life histories are different, many of 
<br />
our implicit memories (how various sensations feel, how to do things like 
<br />
running or catching without thinking about it) would probably be pretty 
<br />
close. So the difference in similarity between my current moment and a 
<br />
Jesse-moment one hour from now vs. my current moment and an 
<br />
Alexander-the-Great moment would seem to be a matter of degree. Also, even 
<br />
if the probability of my &quot;next&quot; observer-moment being an Alexander-the-Great 
<br />
moment would be very tiny because of the lack of sufficient similarity, we 
<br />
could probably imagine a continuous transformation between my current OM and 
<br />
any other OM, such that each OM in the sequence would be pretty similar to 
<br />
the next one even though the endpoints are quite dissimilar.
<br />
<br />There is the question of what it is, exactly, that's supposed to be moving 
<br />
between OMs, and whether this introduces some sort of fundamental duality 
<br />
into my picture of reality. I think of position as a kind of panpsychic 
<br />
monism rather than a type of dualism, but I don't really have a perfect 
<br />
philosophical justification for this; maybe it would be better to say the 
<br />
fundamental entities in my picture of reality are *strings* of OMs rather 
<br />
than individual OMs, which sort of removes the need to picture any sort of 
<br />
entity &quot;moving&quot; between OMs. But I don't know if that's really satisfactory. 
<br />
Anyway, it seems like any &quot;first-person&quot; TOE potentially suffers from the 
<br />
charge of being dualist rather than monist, because you can always point to 
<br />
the difference between mathematical descriptions of OMs (assuming you have a 
<br />
mathematical theory of consciousness/OMs) which can be understood in 
<br />
third-person terms, and the qualia or &quot;what-it-is-likeness&quot; of those OMs. 
<br />
For example, Chalmers ( <a href="http://consc.net/chalmers/">http://consc.net/chalmers/</a> ) sometimes says that he 
<br />
is a &quot;dualist&quot; for exactly this reason, although I think he also sometimes 
<br />
calls it a &quot;dual-aspect theory&quot;.
<br />
<br />In a way I don't think such philosophical definition-wrangling is all that 
<br />
important, if one could actually come up with a mathematical theory that 
<br />
uniquely assigned each OM an absolute probability and also gave conditional 
<br />
probabilities for transitions between OMs, and this in turn allowed you to 
<br />
make predictions about what type of &quot;physical universe&quot; a typical observer 
<br />
would experience as well as the subjective probabilities he'd experience in 
<br />
various copying experiments, then we could all test such a theory against 
<br />
our own experience without having to worry too much about the philosophical 
<br />
meaning of it all--a sort of &quot;shut up and calculate&quot; approach to a 
<br />
first-person TOE.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You say we need a theory of consciousness to understand these things, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't you mean a theory of personal identity?
</em><br />
<br />To me it's all part of the same thing--if you're going to &quot;take 
<br />
consciousness seriously&quot; as Chalmers says, then one aspect of consciousness 
<br />
I think you need to take seriously (and formalize in terms of a mathematical 
<br />
theory) is the feeling of a *stream* of consciousness, rather than just an 
<br />
isolated observer-moment with memories of the past and anticipation of the 
<br />
future. But it might be possible to take seriously other aspects of 
<br />
consciousness, but say this feeling of time passing is a sort of illusion--I 
<br />
discussed this a long time ago in my '3 possible views of &quot;consciousness&quot;'
