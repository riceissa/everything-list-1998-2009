James Higgo write :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;...I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;flabberghasted that anyone could read my &quot;Universes are related to other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes only by correlation, which is a subjective feature....&quot; post and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;agree with it. 
</em><br />
<br />I agree with it ... relatively to my (comp-) understanding of it. (Of 
<br />
course).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I thought it was pretty radical.  Do you know of anywhere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these ideas are developed further?
</em><br />
<br />Difficult question. My feeling is that the idea is, more or less 
<br />
explicitly, in Pythagore, Xenocrate, Platon, the neoplatoniste (Plotin 
<br />
...), but also in some idealist school of India and nominalist school of 
<br />
China, and also in Descartes, Berkeley, Hume, Leibnitz... (you probably 
<br />
knew that).
<br />
<br />I mention <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/marchal">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/marchal</a>     :)
<br />
<br />Some modern analytical approach which bear on causality or explanation 
<br />
lends, more or less repulsively, to such ideas. Have you read &quot;David 
<br />
Lewis: the plurality of worlds&quot; (Basil Blackwell 1986) or his 
<br />
&quot;Counterfactuals&quot; (idem 1973). 
<br />
<br />Modal logic, (the science of possible &quot;worlds&quot;/relative truth), is, I 
<br />
think, an almost unavoidable tool if we hope to make things more precise. 
<br />
The best textbook, to my knowledge, is Chellas 1980 &quot;Modal Logic, an 
<br />
Introduction&quot;.
<br />
This could be premature if you are not logic-minded. Plain english is 
<br />
still better than eclectic formal exercices. But I hardly imagine 
<br />
many-worlders tripping seriously without modal logical tools at hands in 
<br />
the long run. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;	Could you refer me to something on the Skolem paradox?
</em><br />
<br />Mmh... It seems you are in a difficult-question mood today.
<br />
<br />The search on the net is rather disappointing (today too).
<br />
<br />My first encounter with Skolem Paradox (SP) is &quot;Les limitations internes 
<br />
des formalismes&quot; from Jean Ladriere 1957. 650 pages in french.
<br />
<br />A reinterpretation of SP with comp can be find in my 
<br />
Iridia-Technical-report-1995, 750 pages in french (cruel fate!)...
<br />
<br />I got it: I realise I have never mentionned &quot;Boolos G.S. &amp; Jeffrey R.C., 
<br />
Computability and Logic, Cambridge University Press, third edition 1989&quot;. 
<br />
It is a very nice and clear and deep introduction to computability, 
<br />
classical logic including modal and provability logic !
<br />
...and you will find in it more than two pages on 
<br />
Skolem Paradox: pp. 152-155.
<br />
<br />SP in a nutshell : the Skolem Paradox (paradox means here: 
<br />
counter-intuitive result) is a consequence of Loewenheim-Skolem theorem 
<br />
(LST): any first-order theory which has a model has a denumerable model 
<br />
(among others).
<br />
Now take a model U of a classical first order axiomatisation of set 
<br />
theory, like Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF). 
<br />
Such a model U is usually called a universe (sic).
<br />
By LST there is such a denumerable universe U and even transitive one 
<br />
(i.e. if x belongs to U then x is included in U). U obeys to the axioms 
<br />
and theorems of set theory, so it is easy to prove the existence of a non 
<br />
denumerable set y in U (Cantor theorem). So y is non denumerable and is 
<br />
included in U which is denumerable.
<br />
Contradiction. Contradiction?
<br />
There is no contradiction. What happens is that bijections between y and 
<br />
N (which makes y denumerable) does not belong to U. So &quot;from inside&quot; U, y 
<br />
is correctly proved to be non-denumerable, but for an &quot;outside&quot; observer 
<br />
of U, y is denumerable. Skolem paradox shows that notion like 
<br />
&quot;cardinality&quot; are not absolute but are relative to a model.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;	I think I'll pass on the program-writing. 
</em><br />
<br />Cool !
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I can't see why you need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anything more than &quot;LET A=A+1 GOTO START&quot; to generate the universe. 
</em><br />
<br />You are definitely in the difficult-question mood. 
<br />
Besides, I tell you I do NOT need anything more than &quot;LET A=A+1 GOTO 
<br />
START&quot; to generate the universe ...and other machines's dreams.
<br />
<br />The problem is to made that statement both obvious and non trivial, to 
<br />
make people understanding the point AND appreciating the richness of the 
<br />
point.
<br />
<br />The whole thread &quot;information or computation&quot; is all about that. And I 
<br />
don't thing we got consensus there.
<br />
I will not repeat statements by Gille Henry or Jacques M Mallah, but most 
<br />
of them are founded. Especially if you present such proposition in a so 
<br />
provocative statement.
<br />
<br />Actually, when you say &quot;LET A=A+1 GOTO START generates the universe&quot;, I 
<br />
am afraid you are saying something PRESUMPTUOUS, RIDICULOUS, ALMOST UGLY, 
<br />
IMPOLITE WITH RESPECT TO DEWITT &amp; WHEELER, Etc. Consolation: it is true, 
<br />
(trivially provably so with comp).
<br />
But truth is a meager and even frustrating consolation if you are not 
<br />
able to share the &quot;tresor&quot; with others. 
<br />
You know, there is a time for coming back from the mountain, ... 
<br />
<br />Now that you pass on the program-writing I will suggest you the following 
<br />
exercice (forgive my teacher-deformation) :
<br />
<br />Exercice : From the statement 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;LET A=A+1 GOTO START&quot; generates the universe.
<br />
<br />Prove (and make precise) that 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universes are related to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other universes only by correlation, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is a subjective feature.
<br />
<br />Weak anthropic principle is certainly a powerfull tool here, but that's 
<br />
hardly enough.
<br />
I doubt you will ever succeed without the concept of universal turing 
<br />
machines, and/or without finding some measure on the set of 
<br />
computationnal histories (remember the thought experiments PE-omega), etc.
<br />
And, please, don't underestimate the hardness of making the notion of 
<br />
&quot;subjective feature&quot; clearer.
<br />
<br />... An explicit UD, (or a great programmer) on the contrary, makes more 
<br />
explicit what is needed for the proof. It is just more pedagogical. 
<br />
...Luckily enough, part of the work appears to be done in some nice books 
<br />
like Li and Vityani, Boolos and Jeffrey, etc.
<br />
<br />I want add something. When you say, in the preeceding post:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In an infinite multiverse universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which appear to have any relation you like do in fact exist. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We appear to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist in those sets of universes which can be strung 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; together so that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;laws of physics appear to emerge (weak anthropic principle, my dear 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; friend).
</em><br />
<br />I agree so much that I believe a big part of the laws of physics can and 
<br />
must be derived from
<br />
&quot;a theory of consciousness&quot; which itself can and must be derived, with 
<br />
comp,
<br />
from theoretical computer science in the form of what machines can tell 
<br />
(AND NOT TELL) correctly about themselves including their most &quot;probable&quot; 
<br />
computationnal history.
<br />
<br />You can take &quot;theory of consciousness&quot; just in the sense of a theory
<br />
of what you call &quot;subjective feature&quot;.
<br />
And I hope you agree that a subjective feature, is a feature relative to 
<br />
a subject (alias a person, an observer, a point of view, an &quot;angle&quot;...).
<br />
<br />Bruno.
