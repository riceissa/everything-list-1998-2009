<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  there is 1/2^365 to remain alive (supposing mortality) or healthy

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (supposing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  immortality) after one year. 
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
With RSSA, and from the first person point of view, there is 100% 
<br />
probability of remaining alive in Washington. From the 3rd person point of 
<br />
view as you correctly stated, the probability of remaining alive is is 1/
<br />
2*365. This number coincide I think with the ASSA probability.
<br />
<br />In my opinion, the RSSA is the conditional probability of you observing 
<br />
something happening given that you are alive to observe it. Thus is it a 
<br />
first person probability measure. 
<br />
<br />In my (unpublished) book I have developed the concept of &quot;relative 
<br />
probability&quot;, 
<br />
which may be called in this group &quot;first-person probability. By extension, 
<br />
the ASSA (I think) is the third person probability.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Thus the computation of probability requires 
<br />
1) specifying if the probability is for the first or third person (ie. RSSA 
<br />
or ASSA)
<br />
2) the definition of measure at two points. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
The example provided by Jacques about teleporting Bruno, was excellent. The 
<br />
following post is an attempt on my part to go through Jacques' reasonning. 
<br />
Thus if Bruno is teleported from:
<br />
1) state A: one copy in Brussel to 
<br />
2) state B  9 copies in Moscow and one copy in Washington, 
<br />
<br />then for the transition AB, the 1st person probability that Bruno finds 
<br />
himself in Moscow is 9 times higher than in Washington. In this particular 
<br />
case, the first person probability of observing such an event is also equal 
<br />
to the 3rd person probability. Thus, in this case, the results from ASSA and 
<br />
RSSA coincide. Looking at this result, it is clear that Bruno while still in 
<br />
Brussel should buy himself a Russian dictionnary to prepare himself for the 
<br />
trip.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
--------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Consider now, as Jacques suggested, a state C created such that 8 out of the 
<br />
9 copies in Moscow are killed by the Chechnians and 8 copies are created from 
<br />
the single copy in Washington by a Hollywood Jurassic Park project.
<br />
<br />Let us now calculate the first and third person probabilities for the 
<br />
transition AC.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The ASSA says that the 3rd person probability of finding Bruno in Washington 
<br />
is 9 times higher than finding him in Moscow, since the measure is 9 times 
<br />
larger.
<br />
<br />Thus, according to ASSA, Bruno should have bought himself an English 
<br />
dictionnary while he was in Brussel.  
<br />
<br />Now let us compute the probability of transition AC from the first person 
<br />
point of view (RSSA). This probability is the product of the first person 
<br />
probabilities for transition AB and BC. 
<br />
First person probability of transition AB from Brussel to Moscow trip = 9/10
<br />
First person probability of transition BC for destruction of 8 out of 9 of 
<br />
Bruno's copies = 1 !!! (Bruno is not aware of the carnage of his own copies 
<br />
in Moscow) (Note here that I do not include the Washington experience yet 
<br />
-See note on renormalization **)
<br />
Hence combined first person probability for being in Moscow for transition AC 
<br />
= 9/10.
<br />
<br />Now for the Washington trip:
<br />
First person probability of transition AB from Brussel to Washington = 1/10
<br />
First person probability of transition BC for Jurassic Park cloning of Bruno 
<br />
= 1. (Here I do not include the Moscow experience - See note on 
<br />
renormalization **)
<br />
Combined first person probability for being in Washington for transition AC = 
<br />
1/10
<br />
<br />Thus according to RSSA, looking back on his purchase choice, Bruno should 
<br />
have bought a Russian dictionnary while he was in Brussel.
<br />
<br />This case illustrates how the decision making process differs if the world is 
<br />
viewed from a first person or third person perspective.
<br />
<br />While this example used finite value for measures (number of copies), I 
<br />
believe that copies in the  Quantum Universe exist in a continuum of 
<br />
cardinality C. So really we should always be dealing with infinite measures. 
<br />
<br />**This brings up the issue of renormalization **. This is the reason why I 
<br />
omitted the Washington experience when Bruno was in Moscow and the Moscow 
<br />
experience when he was in Washington, and I assumed that the first person 
<br />
probability of life continuation was 1 at either places. 
<br />
<br />In addition, there is a rationality constraints on the transitions, which may 
<br />
imply that the transition AC is not strictly permitted unless the 
<br />
intermediate state B is considered to be a zombie state. 
<br />
<br />In conclusion, I agree with Jacques that the ASSA and RSSA give different 
<br />
results. However, this effect is only a consequence of first and third 
<br />
persons points of views.
