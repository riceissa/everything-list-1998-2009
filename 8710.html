<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I haven't participated in the list in a while, but I try to keep up with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the discussion here and there as time permits.  I personally was raised a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fundamentalist Baptist, but lost most of my interest in that religion when 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I was taught at 9 years old that all the little kids in Africa that are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;never told about Jesus Christ go to Hell.  Even at 9, I knew that wasn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something I was going to be buying.  Who wants to believe in a God that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cruel?  Even without the problematic cruel creator, I have always been to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;oriented toward logic and proof to just accept stuff on faith.
</em><br />
<br />I sympathise with the conclusions of the young Danny, but there is a 
<br />
philosophical non sequitur here. The fact that I would like something to be 
<br />
true, or not to be true, has no bearing on whether it is in fact true. I 
<br />
don't like what happened in Germany under the Nazis, but that doesn't mean I 
<br />
should believe the Nazis did not exist, so why should my revulsion at the 
<br />
thought of infidels burning in Hell lead me to believe that God and Hell do 
<br />
not exist? It might make me reluctant to worship such a God, but that is not 
<br />
the same as believing he does not exist.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I started redeveloping religious belief, ironically, when I picked up a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;book on quantum physics 6 or so years ago.  I was at a legal seminar and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;needed something to read during the boring  sessions, and the author ran 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;through a number of experiments of QM and concluded that the MWI was the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;most logical interpretation of these experiments.  I had read all the Sci 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Fi strories of alternate realities and whatnot, but this was my first 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exposure to the concept that reality is created in such a way to allow all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;things to exist (that also actually appeared to be supported by some real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;science).  I still remember my excitement in  contemplating this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explanation, in that it seems to explain so many questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I guess I could go into a long explanation as to why I now believe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intelligence plays a key role in understanding the nature of our reality 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and how it came to be, but I probably wouldn't be able to say much that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;almost anyone on this board has not already heard.  For me it boils down to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this: I see absolutely no reason to believe our experiences are not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emulable.  I strongly suspect it is possible to create a quantum computer.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I strongly suspect technology will continue to evolve and computer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;processing will get more and more powerful.  Finally, even if we are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;somehow precluded from creating new universes in the future (i.e. universes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implented on the same level of reality as our universe, virtual universes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are obviously possible), the one we are in will last for trillions of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;years.  Final conclusion?  Well, I'll let you do the math...
</em><br />
<br />But if it's scientific, it's not religion, is it? Religion means believing 
<br />
something in the absence of sufficient evidence.
