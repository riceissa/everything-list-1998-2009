<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; doesn't do what is predicted* there is indeed a contradiction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But the conclusion is only that one of the assumptions is

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; wrong. I'm pointing to the assumption that the subject could

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;then do the opposite of what it predicted&quot; - *that* could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; wrong. Thus saving the other premises.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Obviously the contradiction originates from assuming a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; deterministic universe in which someone can decide to do other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; than what the deterministic algorithm of the universe says he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will do.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consider what the prediction algorithm would have to do. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basicly has to simulate the entire history of the universe from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the beginning until it reaches the point where the subject
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes his decision. 
</em><br />
<br />Why the whole universe?  Why would you suppose that is has to
<br />
simulate more than a very tiny part of the universe?  But really
<br />
that's beside the point - your argument rests on the idea that
<br />
the algorithm is in the tiny part, which we assume includes the
<br />
subjects brain, and therefore, in simulating the this part, it
<br />
must simulate itself - thus requiring a vicious recursion. This
<br />
is different than supposing the algorithm reaches a conclusion
<br />
and then the subject does something contrary.  It entails that
<br />
the algorithm never reaches a conclusion.
<br />
<br />However, I don't see that the argument is conclusive. Suppose the
<br />
algorithm is run on hardware outside the tiny part that must be
<br />
included to predict the subjects decision.  Then it doesn't have
<br />
to simulate itself and it can reach a decision.  If that is
<br />
possible, then it is also possible that it could be in the
<br />
subjects brain in a part (where &quot;part&quot; means logically distinct
<br />
not necessarily spacially) that does not have to be simulated to
<br />
predict his behavoir.  For example, suppose the subject is going
<br />
to decide whether to have chocolate ice cream or vanilla ice
<br />
cream and further suppose that his brain is structured such that
<br />
he always orders the one different from what he last time.  Then
<br />
the algorithm need only access his memory to see what he had
<br />
last time and with a single if-then the decision is predicted.
<br />
<br />I don't know that all decision algorithms can be split off this
<br />
way - but on the other hand I don't see any contradiction is
<br />
supposing they could.
<br />
<br />Now what if the subject has a copy of the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithm in his brain and tries to run the algorithm on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; himself? The algorithm would go into an infinite recursion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to simulate itself simulating itself ... If you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only a finite amount of time and computational power with which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to reach a decision, there is no way you can complete a run of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the prediction algorithm within that time. So again you have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make the decision without being able to predict your choice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the mathematical description of the universe.
</em><br />
<br />Of course we all know that there is no prediction algorithm and
<br />
if they were you couldn't execute it.  So I wonder how important
<br />
it is that there be this in-principle prohibition?  Are you
<br />
going to make some further argument that depends on the logical
<br />
(not just practical) impossibility of an prediction algorithm?
