SP: 'Recall that ordinary life does not involve anything like perfect 
<br />
copying of your brain from moment to moment. Thousands of neurons are 
<br />
dying all the time and you don't even notice, and it is possible to 
<br />
infarct a substantial proportion of your brain and finish up with just a 
<br />
bit of a limp. So although a copy of your brain will need to meet some 
<br />
minimum standard this standard will fall far short of perfect copying at 
<br />
the quantum level.'
<br />
<br />MP: Yes this bit is actually quite scary if you think about it too 
<br />
much!  :-0   Maybe true wisdom does indeed entail imbibing a certain 
<br />
amount of ethanol each day, [medicinal dry Red according to St Paul I 
<br />
believe] just to smooth out any awkward gaps in the transcription!
<br />
<br />However, the main thrust of my assertion about infinite resources was 
<br />
more to do with the need, in making a copy of something, to go well 
<br />
within the tolerances when taking the initial measurements because the 
<br />
digital copy, once made, has got to provide ALL the information 
<br />
necessary for reconstitution and this involves not simply something 
<br />
admittedly BIG but static, but in fact all sufficient information to 
<br />
reproduce all salient changes and transformations occurring at the time 
<br />
of read out. Admittedly the traveller will not be aware of many 
<br />
discrepancies because, to paraphrase your statement above, the process 
<br />
of living is inherently noisy anyway. The communication utility's 
<br />
engineers will have to ensure that all measuring, storing, transmission, 
<br />
and reconstitution processes operate to a resolution finer than the 
<br />
normal entropic noise of life because they will not know just which 
<br />
features/life processes are salient at the copying time.
<br />
<br />SP: 'You don't actually have to emulate the entire universe, just enough 
<br />
to fool its inhabitants. For example, you don't need to emulate the 
<br />
appearance of a snowflake in the Andromeda galaxy except in the unlikely 
<br />
event that someone went to have a look at it.'
<br />
<br />MP: I think this turns on how smart the inhabitants are, which 
<br />
ultimately comes down to whether or not they have discovered scientific 
<br />
method or not. Scientific method makes the species much smarter - 
<br />
despite themselves! If the matrixian species discovers scientific 
<br />
method, the matrix maker [Nerd, the Holy One] will have to lift 
<br />
his/her/its game to be able to cover all scientific questions the 
<br />
matrixians ask. That will not be easy! I am not sure if what I am saying 
<br />
relates well to what Colin Hales was saying about 1st person awareness 
<br />
and the nature of scientific endeavour, I don't think I really 
<br />
understood Colin's argument. I am fairly confident here though that 
<br />
scientific method imposes a discipline upon sentient observers that 
<br />
provokes the asking of truly interesting questions which eventually must 
<br />
lead to the true 'edges' of the practically testable world. The Nerd god 
<br />
will be forced to expend exponentially greater resources each time the 
<br />
matrixians make a new discovery in basic science otherwise his children, 
<br />
the matrixians, will come to smell a Rat.
<br />
<br />SP: 'They don't exist as material objects but they are true 
<br />
independently of whether anyone discovers mathematical truths. The 
<br />
number 17 is prime because it's prime, not because someone discovered it 
<br />
was prime.'
<br />
<br />MP: True, but it doesn't EXIST until someone or something discovers it. 
<br />
This is somewhat analogous to the tree falling in the forest of the deaf 
<br />
or absent.
<br />
<br />My take on the real world is that the Existent, or the existing [for 
<br />
those with eliminativist leanings], has/have a not-quite-opposite. The 
<br />
two are somehow not the same but they interpenetrate in a dynamic way 
<br />
that amounts to a constant adjustment, consolidation and simplification 
<br />
of the one which I think entails a constant adjustment, diversification, 
<br />
spreading and compexifying of the other. If that sounds bad and not 
<br />
'well formed' then you are right and it is probably much worse than you 
<br />
fear but who cares! this is metaphysics noumenal ontology not boring old 
<br />
mathematics!  [sorry, just joking! I'm adjusting the medication at the 
<br />
moment but it's all under control :-]
<br />
<br />I think the upshot of this is that quantity in my version of the real 
<br />
world goes something like 'one, two, three, many ... ' and so forth but 
<br />
each of those words applies to what is only an approximation anyway. 
<br />
Exactness doesn't come into it and the initial separation, THIS TIME, so 
<br />
to speak, was about what we might call 12+ billion years ago, if you get 
<br />
my drift. And why did it happen? Because it could I suppose, but do we 
<br />
really care? For me the central feature of this is not numbers, counting 
<br />
and so forth because that is just stuff that people do, and some a lot 
<br />
more than others. For me the central feature is that what I have 
<br />
described constitutes connectivity and the true universal matrix. The 
<br />
One - which might be called the Existent - broke or split, and started 
<br />
collapsing . It has never stopped collapsing but is still all connected. 
<br />
The Other - what might be called the not-quite-opposite - is possibly no 
<br />
more than a boundary, the fact of the Existent not being connected.
<br />
<br />I can elaborate on this, at length if this is called for, but I do not 
<br />
have any snazzy notation. It is how I think about so called Process 
<br />
Physics. A key point is that of existence. As far as I can see no amount 
<br />
of gross or subtle 'computation' theory can sidestep, let alone dispense 
<br />
with, the raw fact of existence. If it were not such a great reassurance 
<br />
to be able to be aware of one's own existence, it could be down right 
<br />
embarrassing to feel forced to appeal to common sense on such a profound 
<br />
issue, especially when confronted with deeply penetrating arguments 
<br />
uttered by highly educated people. Any way, however silly it may seem to 
<br />
some, I cling to my personal axiom that if something cannot be put into 
<br />
plain English then it probably isn't true. Then I say to myself: 'What 
<br />
if I say that I don't exist?' This just doesn't seem to ring true 
<br />
somehow, so then I try saying: 'What if I say that the universe doesn't 
<br />
exist?' This doesn't make sense to me either so I conclude, rightly or 
<br />
wrongly, that for the time being at least there is a universe and I am 
<br />
here and that it is most likely that the universe exists whether I 
<br />
happen to notice it or not. I think it is bigger than me, in fact much 
<br />
much bigger! 
<br />
<br />SP: 'What if we use the word 'cause' rather than supervenience?'
<br />
<br />MP: I prefer the word 'is'. It seems to me to be a lot simpler.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; SP: 'using the term &quot;comp&quot; as short for &quot;computationalism&quot; as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something picked up from Bruno. On the face of it, computationalism 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; seems quite sensible: the best theory of consciousness and the most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; promising candidate for producing artificial intelligence/consciousness'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That is what I thought 'comp' meant. My approach to this is to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; adhere, as much as possible, to plain and simple English. Not being a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'mathematician' I stick with my type of sceptical method. To me this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; does not seem deeply problematic although is does of course limit the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scope of conversations I can participate in. As far as I can see, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bruno's grand scheme depends on 'assume', like the economists do. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Unfortunately that which is assumed remains, I believe, unprovable. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Furthermore there are deep, common sense, problems which undermine 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all these theories of universal emulation possibilities, never mind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; those potentially lethal :-) teleporting/fax holidays and cryogenic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; time shifts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The biggest hurdle is the requirement for infinite computing ability. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is simply the recognition that all measurements are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; approximations so the teleporter/fax machine could only ever send an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; approximate copy of me to whatever destination duty or holiday 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dreamings might lead me. Still, it is probable that I, as subjective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experiencer, would not notice most anomalies, particularly if trying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to fill in the temporal gaps caused by Bruno's gratuitous delays in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reading me back out of his archive :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Recall that ordinary life does not involve anything like perfect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copying of your brain from moment to moment. Thousands of neurons are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dying all the time and you don't even notice, and it is possible to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some minimum standard this standard will fall far short of perfect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copying at the quantum level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This limitation hits all the 'Matrix' type scenarios as well: the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; emulation system would require essentially infinite computing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; capacity to reproduce any useful world that a real person inhabits. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If on the other hand the Matrix is only concerned to make A world, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; its virtual reality inhabitants might be sustained [I am admitting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this as a possibility] until they started engaging in real science. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As I understand things the denizens of a Matrix type world would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; start to find real anomalies in their 'reality' unless the matrix 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine could operate at a fineness of resolution unattainable by any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experimental method the matrixians could devise. There would be much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; less, or even no problem at all if they were all believers in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'Intelligent Design' of course. [I can put that very rudely as: the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; problem is not 'If our mind were simple enough to understand then we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would be too dumb to understand it' but rather 'If Intelligent Design 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; were really true then we have been designed to be so dumb that it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; really doesn't matter!']
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You don't actually have to emulate the entire universe, just enough to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fool its inhabitants. For example, you don't need to emulate the

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unlikely event that someone went to have a look at it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Re &quot;Platonic objects&quot; - I think this is illusory. The numbers that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; people write down and think about are words in the language/s of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; logico-mathematics. They do what they do because they are defined as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; such but they do not exist apart from the systems which generate and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; record them - by which I mean brains, blackboards and computers, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; etc... The regularities, and exciting facts people discover about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; them are just that, regularities and exciting facts about languages. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I don't mean that in any derogatory sense. We live largely BY MEANS 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OF our languages and certainly our cultural lives as human beings 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would be impossible without language in the general and inclusive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; senses. But the universe is not made out of languages, it just exists 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - for the moment at least.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They don't exist as material objects but they are true independently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of whether anyone discovers mathematical truths. The number 17 is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prime because it's prime, not because someone discovered it was prime.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [NB: it just occurs to me that certain G/goddists will say that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe is made out of the mind of G/god/s which could perhaps be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; included as a or THE language of existence. To be 'perfect' however, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this would need to be allowed to have infinite recursion, i.e. ''made 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; out of(made out of(made out of(made out of ... -&gt; inf ... ))). As far 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as I can see however this would amount to an assertion of many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; layered uncertainty and/or a Heraclitan in-falling in the direction 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of smallwards due to the necessity of each layer of divinity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; maintaining omniscience, omnipotence, and so for, over and under its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'turf'. As this has the minimalist effect of underpinning either 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; standard model QM, etc. or something like the Process Physics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; advocated by Colin Hales and friends [which I find attractive], all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is well with the world. :-]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But, seriously, all this stuff about 'supervening' and so forth is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all based on the Cartesian assumption that mind-stuff has no physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; extension. Well the Inquisition is no longer the authority or power 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; base that it was and empirical science has moved on. I think the onus 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is falling ever more heavily on those who deny the identity of mind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and brain to explain WHY they still do so. The 'distinction' between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1st and 3rd person view points is simply raw fact. Both view points 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have limits which can be seen to derive from the view of reality they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; embody. 1st person viewpoint conflates the experience of being the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; embodiment of a view point with an experience of all that is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; viewable, the 3rd person viewpoint conflates objective models of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; things with the things themselves. There is a sense in which these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are simply manifestations of the same raw fact of life: the model of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something is not the thing, it is only ABOUT the thing. Amen!   :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What if we just use the word &quot;cause&quot; in place of &quot;supervenience&quot;? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is good evidence that brain activity causes mental activity, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because whenever there is appropriate brain activity, there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding mental activity, and when the brain activity stops or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changes sufficiently, the mental activity also stops or changes. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is all very good until we speculate that emulating the physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity of a brain with a computer program, so that the program can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predict the types of behaviours a human would display in particular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situations, would also bring with it the corresponding conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences of a human: i.e., computationalism. One of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consequences of computationalism would seem to be that two systems may 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not differ in physical activity yet differ in mental activity. This is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explored in Tim Maudlin's paper:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maudlin, Tim. 1989. Computation and Consciousness. The Journal of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Philosophy, vol. LXXXVI, no. 8. p. 407-432
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is also explored in Bruno's &quot;movie graph argument&quot; in his PhD 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thesis, although that is in French. A recent discussion in the list 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; archive in which I attempted a summary of the argument is here:

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The irony is that computationalists are almost all hard-headed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; materialists, but it doesn't seem that you can consistently be both a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalist and a materialist!
