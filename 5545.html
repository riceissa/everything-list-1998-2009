</em><br />
<br /><br />But to say that there is no plenitude without an UD does not mean that the UD

is the origin of all things.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is typical classical thinking.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But I am a classical (boolean) thinker. (and actually it was a
<br />
typical confusion between A-&gt;B and B-&gt;A, don't worry it happens
<br />
all the time).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To paraphrase
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;In the beginning there was the UD (eg. x=x+1).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />(Technical details: the UD is a little more than x = x+1, but OK)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And the UD generated the Plenitude (eg. 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Be careful. I thought we agreed that the Plenitude is a first person notion.
<br />
the O, 1, 2, 3, .... could not even be used to describe a notion of 
<br />
3-plenitude.
<br />
The 3-plenitude is best described by the whole arithmetical truth, which 
<br />
has been
<br />
proved to be not describable by any finite theory. It is not completely 
<br />
unifiable.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;. Out of the plenitude came out different worlds.
</em><br />
<br />But you *do* have understand the UDA argument (I have links!), and now you 
<br />
begin to talk
<br />
like Schmidhuber. With the comp hyp only one physical world exists, and it 
<br />
is an emerging
<br />
(from the 1-point of view) appearance. It emerges from all the comp histories.
<br />
For exemple, although newtonian worlds are generated by the UD, no 
<br />
consciousness
<br />
can ever stabilize on it because it is (or should be) of measure zero.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Out of some of these worlds conscious creatures emerged. We are some of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these creatures.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />And so this sentence has just no meaning with (classical) comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is 3rd person thinking. It leads to the mind-body problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I resolve the mind-body problem at the outset by using the observer as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;starting point.  The &quot;I&quot; is both an observable fact and an axiom. &quot;I&quot; can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observe that &quot;I&quot; am capable of logical thinking and that my thoughts are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consistent. ( I will leave to you the detail regarding what kind of logic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;applies) My logical ability leads me to the principle of sufficient reason 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One way to phrase this principle is &quot;If there is no reason for something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not to be then it must be. Since I am in a particular state and there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no reason for me not to be in any other state, then I must also be in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;those states. This leads me to think that there are other observers beside 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;myself, in fact, all possible observers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I can also apply this same principle to the world that I observe. If the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world is in a particular state, and there are no reasons for this world to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be in this particular state, then in must be in all possible states. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;leads me to the plenitude. Thus the plenitude includes all possible worlds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The indistinguishability of which observer I am and (conjugately?) which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world I occupy leads to first person indeterminacy.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree with all this. my point is that this is indeed the correct (with comp)
<br />
discourse of the first person. I can't say more without technics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;If not recall me what you mean by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the plenitude.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Remember also that from a machine's point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of view (1 or 3 whatever) the plenitude
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;is given by the the UD, or more exactly its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;complete execution (UD*).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I suppose &quot;I&quot; am the UD. Or maybe &quot;I*&quot; am the UD??? I don't know if this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;makes sense.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't think so.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;It may be possible that the need to invoke a UD originates from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;classical 3rd person (objective or absolute) thinking in which several 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;separate physical worlds are simulated.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I would be prudent before linking &quot;objective&quot; with &quot;absolute&quot;. I could 
<br />
argue that
<br />
only the subjective is absolute (for example it is hard to relativize 
<br />
actual pain ...).
<br />
Also,  I insist (I know you did got that probably subtle point), but with comp
<br />
the adjective &quot;physical&quot; cannot be applied to anything capable of being
<br />
emulated (because the physical is a sum on all possible emulations at once,
<br />
and that cannot be emulated).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As I said I think the UD is a remnant of 3rd person thinking.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don' t understand why you dislike so much 3-person thinking (although I
<br />
appreciate very much your respect for the 1-person).
<br />
3-person thinking is called usually &quot;science&quot;. It is communicable
<br />
falsifiable (mainly) propositions and proofs. Like a proof that 17 is a
<br />
prime number.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The comp hypothesis may be better off without a UD simply because it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible to derive the plenitude without a UD. And should you refuse to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;accept the observer as a starting point,  you could assume the plenitude 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as a starting pont axiom. It is &quot;simpler&quot; to assume the plenitude as an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;axiom than an arbitrary UD. At least there is nothing arbitrary about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;plenitude.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />But the UD is just a machine-independent (and thus non arbitrary) 
<br />
description of the
<br />
comp plenitude as it can be talked about in a 3-person way by (consistent) 
<br />
machines.
<br />
I keep insisting that the UD is not given as an possible explanation, but it is
<br />
a *necessary problem* (once we postulate comp). I did prove that that 
<br />
necessary problem
<br />
is equivalent to the extraction of the physical laws from number 
<br />
theory/arithmetic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It may be that using the observer as starting points will force White 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Rabbits to be filtered out of the observable world
</em><br />
<br /><br />And again I totally agree. It *is* what is proved in my thesis. I have done 
<br />
two things:
<br />
1) I have given a proof that if we are machine then physics must be 
<br />
redefined as a
<br />
science which isolates and exploits a (first person plural) measure on the 
<br />
set of all
<br />
computational histories. The proof is rigorous, I would say definitive 
<br />
(unless some systematic
<br />
error of course), although provably unformalizable (so that only 1 person 
<br />
can grasp it).
<br />
2) I provide a mathematical confirmation of comp by showing that (thanks to 
<br />
Godel,
<br />
Lob, Solovay ...) we can literally interview a universal machine, acting 
<br />
like a scientist
<br />
---by which I mean we will have only a third person discourse with her. BUT 
<br />
we can
<br />
interview her about the possible 1-person discourse. That is a &quot;tour de 
<br />
force&quot; in the sense
<br />
that the notion of first person is absolutely not formalizable (and so we 
<br />
cannot
<br />
define it in any third person way). But by using in a special way ideas
<br />
from Plato's Theaetetus + Aristotle-Kripke modal logic + Godel's incompleteness
<br />
discovery make the &quot;tour de force&quot; easily tractable.
<br />
Here I can only be technical or poetical, and because being technical seems
<br />
yet premature I will sum up by saying that with comp, the plenitude is just the
<br />
incredibly big &quot;set&quot; of universal machine's ignorance, and physics is the 
<br />
common
<br />
sharable border of that ignorance, and it has been confirmed because that
<br />
sharable border has been shown to obey to quantum laws.
<br />
I get recently new result: one confirm that with comp the first person can 
<br />
hardly know
<br />
or even just believe in comp; the other (related to an error in my thesis I 
<br />
talked
<br />
about in some previous post) is the apparition of a &quot;new&quot; quantum logic (I did
<br />
not command it!) and even (I must verify) an infinity of quantum logics between
<br />
the singular first person and the totally sharable classical discourses.
<br />
This could go along with your old theory that there could be a continuum of
<br />
person-point-of-view between the 1 and 3 person, and that would confirms 
<br />
that you
<br />
are rather gifted as an &quot;introspecter&quot; (do you remember? I thought you were 
<br />
silly).
<br />
But then it looks you don't like any more the 3-person discourse, why?
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br />PS Apology for having written so many time &quot;Thaetetus&quot;, when the correct 
<br />
spelling
<br />
is Theaetetus. (Got my &quot;Myles Burnyeat&quot; book on the &quot;Theaetetus of Plato&quot;, 
<br />
a book
<br />
I recommend for those who are interested in the &quot;tour de force&quot;).
