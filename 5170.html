<br />
I'm wondering whether the following demonstrates that a computer that can
<br />
only generate &quot;thoughts&quot; which are sentences derivable from some underlying
<br />
axioms (and therefore can only generate &quot;true&quot; thoughts) is unable to think.
<br />
<br />This is based on the fact that a formal system can't understand sentences
<br />
written down within that formal system (forgive me if I've worded this
<br />
badly). For example, the expression &quot;3+4&quot; is both equal and not equal to &quot;7&quot;
<br />
depending on your point of view.  If a mathematician was wearing special
<br />
glasses that mapped every expression into the object represented by that
<br />
expression, she couldn't possibly make sense of what she was doing.  Eg
<br />
&quot;3+4=7&quot; wouldn't even appear as &quot;7=7&quot;,  but simply &quot;true&quot;.   An interesting
<br />
theorem would be replaced by &quot;true&quot; which is not very interesting!
<br />
<br />When a mathematician thinks about the expression &quot;3+4=7&quot;,  there seems to be
<br />
a duality of perspectives that must be juggled simultaneously. I think this
<br />
duality is implicit to thinking.  It seems to be associated with the
<br />
relationship between a language and a meta-language.
<br />
<br />There are some good theorem proving programs around today.  The output (and
<br />
internal trace) of these programs always correspond to true sentences,
<br />
making them infallible (but only in the sense of never making a mistake).
<br />
However,  every step is based on rules expressed in a meta-language where
<br />
the underlying mathemetical truth seems to be isolated to the computer
<br />
scientist who wrote the program.
<br />
<br />Consider that a computer has a rule &quot;It is a good idea to simplify 3+4 to
<br />
7&quot;.  If this rule is applied to itself the semantics of the rule is changed.
<br />
Clearly 3+4 is not equal to 7, for the purposes of the meta-language used to
<br />
represent both the computer's line of reasoning and the rules that it uses
<br />
to advance its line of reasoning.
<br />
<br />This suggests that thoughts must be expressed in a meta-language that can't
<br />
directly be modelled on productions from a set of &quot;true&quot; axioms.  Does this
<br />
demonstrate that any conscious being must be fallible?
<br />
<br />Consider that we allow an expression to have sub-expressions *quoted* within
<br />
it?  Eg We may write a rule like this
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a good idea to simplify &quot;3+4&quot; to &quot;7&quot;
<br />
<br />Somehow we would need to support free parameters within quoted expressions.
<br />
Eg to specify the rule
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a good idea to simplify &quot;x+0&quot; to &quot;x&quot;
<br />
<br />It is not clear that language reflection can be supported in a completely
<br />
general way.  If it can, does this eliminate the need for a meta-language?
<br />
How does this relate to the claim above?
<br />
<br />- David
