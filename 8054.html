&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it truly make sense to assume that Existence can have a Beginning? We are not talking here, I AFAIK, about the beginning of our observed universe as we can wind our way back in history to a Big Bang Event Horizon, but this event itself must have some form of antecedent that Exists. Remember, existence, per say, does not depend on anything, except for maybe self-consistency, and thus it follows that Existence itself can not have a &quot;beginning&quot;. It follows that it is Eternal, without beginning or end.

<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I would even say that it is out of time and space consideration.

<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree completely. Space and time are, at least, notions that involve relationships. Existence, in itself, can have none of these relationships. Otherwise it would be dependent on something &quot;else&quot;...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMHO, Tegmark's paper, like the rest of his papers, is not worth reading if only because they misdirect thoughts more than they inform thoughts.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You are hard. Tegmark paper is interesting, except that he still (like many physicists) put the mind-body problem under the rug, and so he misses the impact of incompleteness, and the fact that at the level of mathematical platonism, the physical world is not just a mathematical structure among others. With comp, although physics is secondary, the physical world is not just a mathematical structure among others, but a very special mathematical structures emerging from existing relations among a vast set of mathematical structures.
<br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would expect the same criticism if I engaged in behavior like that of Tegmark! Those omissions that you point out are some, but not all, of my compliant. But it is the way that a broad brush is used to dismiss possibilities, thus a prejudicial attitude is engendered in those that control the purse-strings of money going to research. I recall an exchange that I had with some one that is high up in the NSF, that used Tegmark's doctrine to dismiss out of hard any serious inquiry into quantum mechanical effects in human brains...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may disagree on the verisimilitude of Idealism, but I find your work to be, at least, very interesting and thought provoking. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, could you see if you can set the settings of your Email program so that the font is not so small? It is hard to read your HTML postings.
<br />
<br />Onward,
<br />
<br />Stephen
