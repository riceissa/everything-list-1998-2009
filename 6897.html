<br />
Here's a hypothetical situation.  Your plane goes down in the wilds and 
<br />
you're rescued by a tribe indigenous to the area.  You're wearing the 
<br />
latest clothes from the GAP, so the tribe elders decide you're a candidate 
<br />
for shaman apprentice--a position that comes with nice lodging and pays 
<br />
well indeed.  The chief shaman likes you and decides to let you in on a 
<br />
secret: shamans exploit a brand of multiverse QM theory in that they do 
<br />
their magic by scanning various future branches of the tribe's world line 
<br />
in order to predict what will take place (rain, good weather, winning 
<br />
tickets at the lottery, etc.)  Getting the branch right is a bit difficult, 
<br />
but with practice one can get within a few worlds of the path on the world 
<br />
line the tribe eventually takes.  You discover that each branch is very 
<br />
deterministic and causal-based---and once on a path, one thing reliably 
<br />
leads to another.  You discover that your job as shaman is to keep 
<br />
everyone's attention, and once you've done that, to direct them down a 
<br />
reliable path.  You decide it's not too different from the corporate world, 
<br />
so you're eager to have a go at it.
<br />
<br />You learn quickly and after a month or so, you can generally intuit (no pun 
<br />
intended) what the possibilities (paths) are for the tribe, and you're able 
<br />
to steer them as a unit down that path.  With that, the shaman retires and 
<br />
you take his place.
<br />
<br />Then, the chief takes ill.  You saw it coming but you thought it would be 
<br />
on another path---but you were wrong.  Now you look ahead and all the paths 
<br />
forward are deterministic and end with the death of the chief.   But, the 
<br />
tribe is relying on you to make the chief well.   So you go to the retired 
<br />
shaman and ask him what to do.  He replies that you *can't* make the chief 
<br />
well---especially if all the paths forward are deterministic and all end in 
<br />
death for the chief.  But as a shaman there are things you can do that will 
<br />
shake things up that will result in placing the entire tribe---and you 
<br />
included---on a completely new track---that might save the chief's 
<br />
life.  The downside: both you and tribe will be on an entirely different 
<br />
path--determined by completely unknown histories.   You might save the 
<br />
chief's life, but on that new path, an errant virus (from a different 
<br />
history) could hit the tribe, wiping it out.  Worse, to save the chief's 
<br />
life, you as a shaman would (for a few weeks or months) have no access to 
<br />
the future.  By performing a &quot;miracle&quot; you'd be placing the entire 
<br />
tribe--as well as yourself--onto a completely different path, with 
<br />
different histories and thus different rules (though the history would 
<br />
*seem* the same).
<br />
<br />Would you take the chance and shake things up?  Or would you keep the tribe 
<br />
on the familiar world line and end up losing the chief (and everyone's 
<br />
confidence.)
<br />
<br />RM
