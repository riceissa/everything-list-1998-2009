<br />
Here's how I look at the question of whether a bit string, if accidentally
<br />
implemented as part of another program, would be conscious.
<br />
<br />First, it's a little confusing what we mean by a bit string.  Is this
<br />
the program of the computer?  A snapshot of its state?  Can a program
<br />
or a snapshot be conscious?  Suppose that instead of talking about a
<br />
bit string, we consider instead the actual sequence of states that the
<br />
computer goes through.  Then we could ask, if this sequence of states
<br />
matched the sequence of states that was part of a conscious program, but
<br />
in this case they happened accidentally as part of some other program,
<br />
would they nevertheless create a consciousness?
<br />
<br />Second, even with this definition, it's an unreasonable question.
<br />
That is, given what we know about the complexity of consciousness, it
<br />
doesn't make sense that a computer could accidentally run a program that
<br />
matched the run of a conscious simulation, for a long enough period that
<br />
it would correspond to a perceptible moment of consciousness.  The brain
<br />
has something like 10^12 neurons and 10^15 synapses, and they'd probably
<br />
have to be simulated at microsecond resolution (if not a million times
<br />
smaller) to get a simulation that was at all accurate.  This means that
<br />
there would probably be something like 10^23 bits of information in a
<br />
simulation of a tenth of a second of a human brain, if you capture all
<br />
of the connectivity and timing information.
<br />
<br />There's no way that you could accidentally match a 10^23 bit pattern
<br />
in this universe.  Even if every sub-atomic particle in the observable
<br />
universe were a computer, you'd be hard pressed to match even a 300 bit
<br />
pattern by accident.  The additional difficulty for the accidental match
<br />
of a brain pattern is so much greater that our minds can't even conceive
<br />
of how impossible it is.
<br />
<br />Third, even though it will never happen in our universe, if we believe
<br />
in the multiverse then we have to admit that it will happen by accident,
<br />
somewhere.  So we might still want to answer the question of whether
<br />
this accidental instantiation of the computation is conscious.
<br />
<br />I would approach this from the Schmidhuber perspective that all programs
<br />
exist and run, in a Platonic sense, and this creates all computable
<br />
universes.  Some programs create universes like ours, which have
<br />
conscious entities.  Other programs create random universes, which may,
<br />
through sheer outlandish luck, instantiate patterns which match those
<br />
of conscious entities.
<br />
<br />All consciousnesses exist in this model, and as Bruno emphasizes, from
<br />
the inside there is no way to know which program instantiated you.
<br />
In fact this may not even be a meaningful question.  But what are
<br />
meaningful to ask, in the Schmidhuber sense, are two things.  First,
<br />
what is the measure of your consciousness: how likely are you to exist?
<br />
And second, among all of the instantiations of your consciousness in all
<br />
the universes, how much of your measure does each one contribute?
<br />
<br />This, then, is how I would approach the question.  Not, is this accidental
<br />
instantiation conscious; but rather, how much measure do such accidental
<br />
instantiations contribute, compared to non-accidental ones like those
<br />
we see in the universe around us?
<br />
<br />I suggest that the answer is that accidental instantiations only
<br />
contribute an infinitesimal amount, compared to the contributions of
<br />
universes like ours.  Our universe appears to have extremely simple
<br />
physical laws and initial conditions.  Yet it formed complex matter and
<br />
chemistry which allowed life to evolve and consciousness to develop.
<br />
Maybe we got some lucky breaks; the universe doesn't seem particularly
<br />
fecund as far as we can tell, but conscious life did happen.  The odds
<br />
against it were not, as in the case of accidental instantiation, an
<br />
exponential of an astronomical number.  This means that the contribution
<br />
to a consciousness from a lawful universe like the one we observe
<br />
is almost infinitely greater than the contribution from accidental
<br />
instantiations.
<br />
<br />Therefore, I would suggest that the answer to the question of whether an
<br />
accidental instantiation is conscious is simply this: it doesn't matter.
<br />
Even if it is conscious, its contribution to the measure of that conscious
<br />
experience is so small as to be completely negligible.
