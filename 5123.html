<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, that is the two *materialist* strategies. Buddhism, Hinduism, Plato,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;objective idealism&quot; (sometimes confused with subjective idealism, i.e.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;solipsism). I think the 20th century (perhaps by the dazzling success of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics) is the first (and probably the last too!) during which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;immaterialism has no more been defended (with some exceptions).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My work shows that comp entails a form of Eliminative immaterialism, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also that comp (but actually this works for Everett formulation of QM too) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is incompatible with identity theory. We can still ascribe a mind (a first 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person with her private life) to a body (a third person describable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;object), but we cannot ascribe a body to a mind, we can only ascribe an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinity of &quot;possible bodies&quot; to a mind (like our counterparts in the QM 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;parallel &quot;universes&quot;: i.e. the mind body relation is not one-one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In this setting the word &quot;reductionism&quot; is misleading: comp *reduces* both 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;minds and bodies to arithmetical relations between numbers, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it leads also to a machine psychology (or theology) which is everything but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reductionist, for that psychology/theology is a sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;negation theology&quot; (to use the theologians expression) in the sense that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the machine self is able to &quot;diagonalize&quot; against any proposed and well 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;defined definition of the self. The real self being necessarily undefinable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by anyself. This looks weird and perhaps even somehow mystical, but can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;related to the incompleteness phenomena, even easily so once we work a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;little bit on the modal logic formalization of those incompleteness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;phenomenon (cf Solovay's work).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A lot of problems in the &quot;modern&quot; philosophy of mind are due to a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reductionist conception of machines which is just impossible since 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Godel&amp;Al.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In some sense Godel's theorem is the big killer of any reductionist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conception of machines. And as I said, some quasi dogmatic attachment to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;materialism (even in the weaker sense of a doctrine reifying matter) will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not help.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course, just to mention them, there are also the dualist approaches (cf 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;the brain and its self&quot; by Popper and Eccles, or even Chalmers).
</em><br />
<br />Is Chalmers really a dualist? Although he does label his views this way at 
<br />
times, from his writings he does not seem to believe in &quot;matter&quot; per se, 
<br />
rather he thinks the fundamental stuff of reality is likely to be something 
<br />
like &quot;information&quot; which has both an objective description (a particular bit 
<br />
string, computation, whatever) and a subjective what-it-is-like to *be* that 
<br />
bit-string/computation/whatever.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that any formal mathematical theory of consciousness or of 
<br />
&quot;observer-moments&quot; must work the same way. If you want to have a 
<br />
mathematical theory that assigns measure to different observer-moments, for 
<br />
example, you need to have a mathematical framework for listing all possible 
<br />
observer-moments, perhaps something like treating each distinct computation 
<br />
(or any finite sequence of steps in a distinct computation) as a distinct 
<br />
observer-moment. And yet, even if I understand this mathematical framework, 
<br />
&quot;from the inside&quot; I will not be sure which of these formally-described 
<br />
observer-moments corresponds to my own current experience, the &quot;qualia&quot; that 
<br />
I am percieving at this moment. So just as in Chalmers' system, there is a 
<br />
difference between the &quot;objective&quot; mathematical description of an 
<br />
observer-moment and the subjective &quot;what-it-is-like-to-be&quot; of the 
<br />
observer-moment corresponding to that description. There's a case for 
<br />
calling this &quot;dualism&quot;, but also a case for labelling it as a monist theory, 
<br />
an &quot;eliminative spiritualism&quot; as you described it (although I'd prefer the 
<br />
label 'eliminative idealism', since 'spiritualism' has mystical 
<br />
connotations).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I don't think a lot in this list adhere to dualist positions, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;please correct me if I'm wrong).
</em><br />
<br />I think there are people on this list who *implicitly* hold dualist 
<br />
positions. There are a number of people who would use the following sort of 
<br />
procedure to find the first-person likelihood of experiencing a universe 
<br />
with a given set of properties:
<br />
<br />1. First, find a measure on all &quot;universes&quot;, regardless of whether a given 
<br />
universe is capable of supporting complex observers
<br />
<br />2. Then use the anthropic principle to take into account the idea that 
<br />
you're more likely to experience a universe with lots of observers than one 
<br />
with few or none, assuming each universe's measure is equal
<br />
<br />(see, for example, Hal Finney's post at 
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m5006.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m5006.html</a> on how to find the 
<br />
likelihood we will find ourself in a universe with no other intelligent life 
<br />
within communicating distance)
<br />
<br />If this is just taken as a heuristic procedure, in lieu some more 
<br />
fundamental procedure that does not involve two separate steps, then perhaps 
<br />
it need not be labeled &quot;dualist&quot;. But if this is really seen as the way the 
<br />
ultimate &quot;theory of everything&quot; would work, with no more fundamental theory 
<br />
to be found, then I think such a view is committed to a fundamentally 
<br />
dualist metaphysical view. Since I find dualism inelegant but I do think the 
<br />
anthropic principle has to be taken into account somehow, I prefer a TOE 
<br />
which only involves a measure on observer-moments rather than &quot;universes&quot;, 
<br />
with this measure determined by a theory that already takes into account the 
<br />
anthropic principle somehow (see my posts on the 'Request for a glossary of 
<br />
acronyms' thread at 
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/index.html?by=OneThread&amp;t=Request%20for%20a%20glossary%20of%20acronyms">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/index.html?by=OneThread&amp;t=Request%20for%20a%20glossary%20of%20acronyms</a> 
<br />
for some speculations on what such a theory would look like).
