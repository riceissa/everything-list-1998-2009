<br />I just can't see any basis for invoking quantum mechanics and &quot;no 
<br />
cloning&quot; for why I am not you, or why I cannot plausibly experience 
<br />
being you, and vice versa, and so on.
<br />
<br />Even if intelligence is purely classical (in terms of the physics), 
<br />
there are excellent reasons why there is no way today (given today's 
<br />
technology, today's interfaces, today's bandwidth) for me to &quot;compute 
<br />
what it is to be a bat.&quot;
<br />
<br />Inasmuch as we cannot even build a machine which even remotely 
<br />
resembles a bat, or even an ant, the inability to 
<br />
simulate/understand/&quot;be&quot;  a bat is not surprising. There is no mapping 
<br />
currently feasable between my internal states and a bat's. Even if we 
<br />
are made of relays or transistors.
<br />
<br />Saying that our inability to know what it is to be another person 
<br />
implies that some principle of QM is likely to be involved is, in my 
<br />
view, unsupported and unrealistic.
<br />
<br />It may well be that there are deep, QM-related reasons why Alice cannot 
<br />
emulate Bob, but we are probably a long way in _engineering_ terms from 
<br />
knowing that Alice can or cannot emulate Bob, or have a first person 
<br />
understanding of what a bat is, etc.
<br />
<br />Occam's Razor--don't multiply hypotheses needlessly.
<br />
<br />In other news, I am enjoying Barrett's book on quantum mechanics and 
<br />
minds. (Interesting to compare his views with Bub, Peres, Isham, and 
<br />
Wheeler.) Got a copy of Joyce's &quot;Causal Decision Theory,&quot; to go along 
<br />
with the QM papers Bruno and Wei have been citing. Also read an 
<br />
interesting science fiction novel with some new twists on the Many 
<br />
Worlds Interpretation (esp. the DeWitt variant): &quot;Finity,&quot; by John 
<br />
Barnes. A New Zealand astronomer/mathematician with some interesting 
<br />
ideas about &quot;abductive reasoning&quot; finds himself slipping between 
<br />
different realities.
