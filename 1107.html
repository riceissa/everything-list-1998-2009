<em class="quotelev1">&gt; among the so called computational continuations of one's brain activity&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads inevitably to the concept of near-zombies.  The description of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making a million copies of one person is a good illustration.  Each of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those copies has only a one millionth chance of &quot;being&quot; the original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person, so we should not be as concerned when one of those dies as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when someone else, who has never been copied, dies.  But is this a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refutation of the concept, by reductio-ad-absurdum?  I don't think so.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absurd to me and hopefully will be to the others.  I think
<br />
you are not being objective since you usually find zombies absurd.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I want to clarify one thing, though, in Jacques' post:

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Assume that all three branches occur (two copying events).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If there are two copying events, then there is no place for a coin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; toss to enter into the experiment, so the 'T' and 'H' should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; erased from the diagram.  The point is still made that, at time t0,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jane would figure:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     P(left branch, t1) = 1/2, P(right branch, t1) = 1/2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     P(Y, t3) = 1/2, P(R, t3) = 1/4, P(B, t3) = 1/4
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which would imply that the two copies of her that saw red and blue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be less likely to be the same Jane at t0, so in some sense, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they would be less human, you might say.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the QS claim, that is.  T and H can still label the branches.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two experiments are actually rather different and I should
<br />
have made the distiction clearer in my post.  I assume you refer below to
<br />
the case with two copying events.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   3.  Subjective probabilities can be computed, but the assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       that consciousness can &quot;flow&quot; to a continuation independent of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       time or space is flawed.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       This, I think, is Jacques' point of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       view.  Though he didn't state it, I would guess that he would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           P(H, t1) = P(H, t2) = P(H, t3) = 1/2, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       and that the original Jane would necessarily feel herself to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       continue along with her original body.  That is, if, in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       above diagram, at the copying event after Jane sees Heads, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       assume that the original Jane is the one who is shown the Red
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       card, then Jane at t1 would say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           P(R) = 1,   P(B) = 0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       The copy of Jane who sees the blue card is a new person, who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       was just &quot;born&quot; at the instant the copy was made, even though
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       she has all the same memories as the original.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is NOT my position, though of course I think 'consciousness
<br />
flowing to and being distributed among continuations' is nonsense.  I make
<br />
no distinction between a copy and the original; 'identity' is not a
<br />
fundamental concept.  Each has the same amount of measure.  For practical
<br />
purposes the distinction is useful, however.  It's just a matter of
<br />
terminology in the practical use.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   4.  Subjective probabilities can be computed on the basis of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       Strong SSA, and we get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           P(H, t1) = 1/2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           P(H, t2) = P(H, t3) = 2/3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       If this is the case, then I think we have to throw Tegmark's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       scheme using Bayesian statistics out the window.  This option
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       has severe metaphysical problems, though, in my opinion.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know what you mean by the above paragraph, but the
<br />
effective probabilities are correct if there are two copying events.  The
<br />
SSA is the right way to do Bayesian calculations.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the T-H split represented a non-MWI coin toss and was a one
<br />
time event, then P(H,t3) = 1/2.  In practice those conditions would be
<br />
impossible to achieve even without the MWI of QM (e.g. in an infinite
<br />
universe) and P(H,t3) = 2/3.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   6.  Subjective probabilities can be computed, and we should expect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       the nonsensical results
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           P(H, t1) = 2/3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           P(H, t2) = P(H, t3) = 2/3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       This is what I believe is probably true.  I think that there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       must be a sort of &quot;reverse causality&quot; at work, which would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       increase the measure of the right branch of Jane at time t1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       (the branch that sees heads, but before the copy is made).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonsense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;       This still has Jacques' problem of allowing pseudo-zombies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       If we switch to Jacques' example and assume two copying events,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       then the Jane on the left branch, at time t1, would have less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       measure than the Jane on the right (note the contrast between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       this result and the previous, where the Janes that were the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       product of the second copying operation were accorded less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       measure).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       But I don't see this as a problem.  What I'm suggesting is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       each human alive today has a varying amount of &quot;measure&quot;.  It's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       incorrect to assume that each person, when they are born, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       given a single &quot;measure unit&quot;.  By my scheme, a person with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       terminal illness with only a few days to live would have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       very small measure of existence, relative to others.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh?  This seems inconsistent with QS and the specifics aren't
<br />
there.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;       I can't help wondering, often, why I find myself to be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       particular human I am.  Do you others wonder this?  
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are arrogant.  I am not a typical human but see no reason to
<br />
suspect I could not be a randomly selected human.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;	One thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       I've had (please don't laugh at me too badly) is that the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       that I have a pretty poor memory might be significant.  If I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       had a better memory, then my measure would be less, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       fewer universes could have given rise to me.  Of course, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       reasoning probably won't work for you, but that doesn't make it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       any less valid from my perspective, which is the only one I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       have.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I hate (giggle?) to say it but that sounds stupid.  If you
<br />
remember something non-random, that shouldn't cut your measure.  If you
<br />
remember a random bit, it cuts the total measure of each type of you in
<br />
half but now there are twice as many types.  By total measure I mean, as
<br />
always, the number, so this is consistent with the SSA and leads to no
<br />
zombies.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;       I came to believe in this &quot;reverse causality&quot; while pondering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       the QS project I wrote about before.  I started to expect that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       things would crop up in my way to prevent my being able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       complete the project, before it came to fruition.  It didn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       (and it still doesn't) make sense to me that the measure of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       my branches should be unaffected until the very instant that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       carry out the experiment.  Because if the assumption that I'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       be alive after the experiment date is correct, then I can expect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       to have memories at that time of somehow having escaped.  And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       I should, in general, expect to have a memory of &quot;the most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       likely&quot; escape route, or of one of the most likely ones, if there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       are several that are near-equally likely.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       But how can one reconcile that with the concept of continuity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       consciousness from moment to moment?  Only if there is a reverse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       causality at work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       This theory has significant and testable implications.  Viz:  we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       should expect to find ourselves in a universe that will allow us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       to live forever.  I.e.  this leads directly to the requirement 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       that the FAP is true.  Just consider if time t1 and t2 are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       separated by a larger and larger time span.  Consider also that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       those branches in which we cease to exist also tend to decrease
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       the measure of all the observer-moments in previous subjective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       Basically, the measure of our observer-moments at the next 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       instant in subjective time are weighted as the number of continous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       paths from that observer-moment to the &quot;Omega-point&quot;.  This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       my crackpot theory.  Though it's certainly hard to justify on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       basis of the SSA on a moment-by-moment basis (the Strong SSA), I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       haven't yet found anything that contradicts it.  I know that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       not good enough, but anyway I find it the most satisfying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       result of the above thought experiment.  All the other possibilities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       are problematic.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Omega Point CRAP is disproven because the universe is open.
