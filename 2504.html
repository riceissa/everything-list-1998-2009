I hope this is our last *too long* post, Juergen. 
<br />
At the end of it, I propose we come back to the initial
<br />
discussion, if you agree.
<br />
<br /><br />Juergen wrote:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Normally a constructive philosopher should abandon comp right here,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because it follows from that theorem that we cannot be machine in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; any constructive sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Which theorem? Send pointer to its proof. Not to its informal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;description, but to its proof.
</em><br />
<br />Sorry but for reason of place I will remain a little bit informal.
<br />
<br />The theorem concerns sound (or just consistent) machines proving
<br />
enough elementary theorems of arithmetic.
<br />
<br />There exists multiple versions of the theorem.
<br />
<br />Theorem : no sound (or just consistent) machine can build 
<br />
a copy of itself in a provable way.
<br />
<br />Theorem : No sound machine can know its own description.
<br />
(where knowing is formalised by S4 modal logic (or S4Grz)
<br />
and description by arithmetisation).
<br />
<br />Theorem: the mechanist knower cannot know itself.
<br />
<br />Theorem: No sound machine can build a machine which
<br />
proves the same theorems as itself and at the same time proves
<br />
that fact.
<br />
<br /><br />The theorem is sometimes called &quot;the correct reconstruction of Lucas
<br />
argument&quot;. Unlike the traditional Lucas/Penrose argument this
<br />
theorem is not controversial, although the first reconstructions of it
<br />
were not very rigorous. 
<br />
<br /><br />The first one to realise that truth, and to propose a rigorous argument
<br />
is Emil Post in his 1922 anticipation (see the book of Davis 1965).
<br />
Note there is still a slight error in Post's formulation.
<br />
<br />It (re) originates in the delightful paper by Benacerraf &quot;God, the Devil
<br />
and Godel&quot;. Unfortunately, although all the interesting ideas are in 
<br />
Benacerraf's paper, the paper is wrong from the beginning to the end 
<br />
(as Benacerraf aknowledges himself in an appendice). Chihara, Wang, 
<br />
Reinhaerdt have propose, with growing level of rigor, reconstructions of 
<br />
Benacerraf's reconstruction of Lucas.
<br />
<br />Penrose (re)proposes Lucas's use of Godel theorem against mechanism in
<br />
his first book, but correct it in his second book. So you can find a 
<br />
proof in the second book of Penrose too (rather involved proof).
<br />
In the second book Penrose argue that mechanist philosophy is 
<br />
meaningfull only in the sense of &quot;being a machine and knowing which 
<br />
one&quot;. Then indeed *that* mechanist philosophy is refuted.
<br />
<br />Just look at my thesis page 40 -&gt; 44. With G and G* it is almost
<br />
an easy exercice to formalise it completely and to prove it.
<br />
<br />You will find all formal details, + the references in my thesis.
<br />
(It would just be indecent to give here a  formal description
<br />
of that theorem, because that would be long (as you can guess), 
<br />
and, until now, it would be without most distracting.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(One reason why I doubt this: isn't the lowest possible level - embodied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by what's computable in the limit - sufficient? Why not run all universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;GTM-computable in the limit?  If one of them is ours, then the set-up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is constructive.)
</em><br />
<br />How do you know there is a lowest possible level? 
<br />
What do you mean by &quot;one of them is ours&quot;?
<br />
Once you distinguish first and third person, you will understand
<br />
(well it is a consequence of the invariance lemma) that
<br />
it is at least consistent with comp that there is no lowest
<br />
possible level, and you can understand that the expression 
<br />
&quot;our universe&quot; has necessarily no obvious meaning.
<br />
We will come back to the invariance lemma later, (if you agree).
<br />
<br />Your problem is that you are attached to a very naive (and vague!)
<br />
theory of mind where the first person is attached to
<br />
a particular &quot;physical&quot; instantiation of a computation.
<br />
In 1988 I have build the movie-graph thought experiment (platonic
<br />
destructive in the James Brown's nomenclature) which shows that 
<br />
this view is incompatible with comp. Maudlin has proved in 1989 
<br />
an equivalent result. Unlike UDA the graph movie argument *is* 
<br />
difficult (we discuss it at lenght in the list). For pedagogical 
<br />
reason I don't use it here. I use some form of Occam instead.
<br />
<br /><br />If you want really be rigorous here you should solve first the
<br />
very serious Putnam-Chalmers-Mallah's physical implementation problem.
<br />
(see the thread on that implementation problem in the archive).
<br />
<br />I have not the Mallah's problem, because I have no universes at all.
<br />
Just many computational histories, which together makes first person
<br />
discourse possible.
<br />
I have *other* problems, like the white rabbits, which force us to
<br />
derive the physical law from the psychological laws of 
<br />
machine's dreams. But then, that's the result of the first part.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Not uncomputable. Any past is finite. 
</em><br />
<br />I was talking about the immediate next futur.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So it is at worst random or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Martin-Loef-random&quot; or incompressible.  None of those you cite is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;careless when it comes to the difference between countable and uncountable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sets. None claims one can compute a continuum by dovetailing. Dovetailing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will be forever limited to the countable realm.
</em><br />
<br />I have never said that we can &quot;compute a continuum&quot; by dovetailing.
<br />
Sometimes, in some context, I talk about dovetailing *on* the continuum
<br />
because I have explain precisely what I mean by that.
<br />
I do that whith people who have a precise idea on the 1/3 person
<br />
difference. From the 1-person point of view that continuum is relevant.
<br />
(see below).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The various Dempster-Shafer (DS) approaches are no alternatives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to probability theory. They are extensions designed to facilitate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;handling of uncertainty in contexts where lack of belief does not imply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;disbelief. But DS is essentially about hulls confining sets of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;traditional distributions, and thus compatible with the traditional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;framework of Bayesian statistics. (Variants of DS that are not yield
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;paradoxical results.)
</em><br />
<br />Hulls confining sets of traditional distributions? You can see it
<br />
that way, but that does not entails compatibility with the framework of
<br />
Bayesian statistics.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is this recurring type of claim I find so irritating: &quot;rigorous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proof&quot; without formal framework. 
</em><br />
<br />Let us remember that this is an important point where we *completely*
<br />
disagree.
<br />
It is possible to be 100% formally correct and still be 100% lacking
<br />
philosophical rigor. My favorite exemple is perhaps your first paper :-)
<br />
And it is also possible to be 100% rigorous although being 100% informal.
<br />
The first part of my thesis is hopefully an exemple. Others are 
<br />
provide by some thought experiment by Galileo, Simon Stevin, etc.
<br />
<br />Note that mathematicians *never* prove things formally. For exemple
<br />
Fermat theorem has been proved, but it is still an open problem
<br />
if the proof can be formalised in Peano arithmetic, or in which 
<br />
precise extension of Peano arithmetic can it be proved, ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A weakness is that I am lead toward hard mathematics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What a strange remark. The weakness of your texts is that they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so informal.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is what *I* do find irritating: the fact that you say this 
<br />
although you have admitted not having read my thesis. What kind of 
<br />
scientist are you? Where does your certainty come from?
<br />
<br />The second part belongs to mathematics (of course, there is always the
<br />
possibility of systematic error, but it has been verified by
<br />
independant mathematicians, for the thesis, for the price, etc.)
<br />
I am lead to difficult open mathematical problems.
<br />
(The most important is to axiomatise Z1*).
<br />
<br />To make things clear, the work contains two parts:
<br />
<br />-1) A rigorous thought experiment showing that if we accept comp 
<br />
then physics is a branch of machine's psychology.
<br />
It is informal but rigorous, despite your irritation with
<br />
respect to this point. It leads also toward a many-things, 
<br />
observer-moment-like, ontology (thats why I am here).
<br />
<br />-2) A mathematical part where I &quot;interview&quot; the machine and its
<br />
&quot;guardian angel&quot;. It is there that a &quot;quantum logic&quot; appears naturaly
<br />
as a kind of border of the first person. It is also there that
<br />
I am lead to difficult question of mathematical logics.
<br />
I say a little more on that second part in the archive at 
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1417.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1417.html</a> 
<br />
<br />The guardian angel is Solovay G' modal logic. (I call it G*,
<br />
nowadays provability logician call it GLS).
<br />
G has a long story and got many names: 
<br />
K4W (segerberg), PRL (smorinsky), G (Solovay), L (the Deutsch),
<br />
GL (recent american name). L is for Lob).
<br />
<br />Do you know these provability logics ?
<br />
<br />I recall to everybody that Smullyan has written a popular book on 
<br />
G and G* : Forever undecided. (Precise ref in my thesis, or paper).
<br />
This little book is a nice introduction to provability logic.
<br />
It certainly gives a feeling of what G and G* are.
<br />
<br />The second part is difficult. It needs familiarity with quantum
<br />
logic, quantum mechanics, mathematical logic, philosophical logic,
<br />
and philosophy of mind. No doubt it is difficult. But in fundamental
<br />
matter nothing is urgent. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your thesis is in French.
</em><br />
<br />I am very nervous about that. The day I have been accepted for 
<br />
doing a thesis in France, The minister TOUBON decides ALL french 
<br />
thesis, even those by foreigners,  must be done in french.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your papers are informal.
</em><br />
<br />I agree for the first part (of both my paper, and thesis).
<br />
But: please, don't confuse &quot;vague&quot; and &quot;informal&quot;. Don't confuse also
<br />
&quot;mathematical&quot; and &quot;formal&quot;.
<br />
Formalisation is useful only for metamathematics, computer science,
<br />
and computationalist philosophy. Not for doing the proof but for 
<br />
proving things (informaly) *on* the proof.
<br />
<br />Your confusion has a taste of pregodelian formalist philosophy (I tell
<br />
you that before). That has nothing to do with constructivisme.
<br />
Most important constructivist (Brouwer, Bridge) are anti-formalist.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then there is your &quot;invariance lemma: the way you quantify 1-indeterminacy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is independent of (3-)time, (3-)place, and (3-)real/virtual nature of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reconstitution.&quot; This does not make sense, because if the (3-) probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distribution on the possible futures and reconstitutions does depend on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time or place or other things (why not?) then 1-indeterminacy does so,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;too. Under most distributions, some futures are less likely than others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hence there are nontrivial, distribution-dependent, probabilistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1-predictions as well as &quot;quantifications of 1-indeterminacy&quot; that depend on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time/space/other things.
</em><br />
<br />I see you genuily fail to understand the invariance lemma. 
<br />
No problem. We will come back to this until you get the 
<br />
TILT, (if you agree).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am prejudiced against claims of rigorous proof when even the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumptions are unclear; and against statements that are plain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wrong, such as &quot;the UD generates all real numbers&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />I am not claiming I am rigorous, except when you say I am vague
<br />
and when you ask me precisions which are not relevant.
<br />
<br /><br />The sentence &quot;the UD generates all real numbers&quot; is ambiguous.
<br />
<br />Either you interpret it as
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The UD generates (enumerates) the set of all real numbers&quot; 
<br />
<br />This does indeed contradict Cantor's theorem. 
<br />
<br />Or you interpret it as 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All real number are (individually) generated by the UD&quot;.
<br />
<br />In which case, with the usual definition of &quot;generating a
<br />
real (generating all its prefixes)&quot; it is just correct. Isn't it?
<br />
<br />Of course this is make possible because each prefixe is the
<br />
prefixe  of 2^aleph_0 reals.
<br />
<br />Perhaps the confusion comes from this ambiguity.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
<br />
<br /><br />Look, Juergen, don't make yourself member of the club of those
<br />
who criticizes my work without studying it, as you confess. 
<br />
You are not the first one. 
<br />
<br />I agree the basic result is so counter-intuitive that it is easy 
<br />
to dismiss it without further consideration. But that is not how 
<br />
science progress.
<br />
<br />Let us go back to the first major point of the philosophical
<br />
(informal but rigorous) argument.
<br />
<br />(Note that it would be useless to make a discussion on the 
<br />
possibility of rigorous philosophical argument. Once you are 
<br />
convinced by just one such proof you will know that that exists).
<br />
<br />Now, with all our disgressions, I don't remember if you have
<br />
accept the first informal, but precise, point. So I ask
<br />
you again: do you agree that comp entails the existence of
<br />
first person indeterminacy, as it is shown by the 
<br />
self-duplication thought experience?
<br />
<br />You can ask me to make things more precise. Don't ask me to be 
<br />
formal, because I ask you a personal question and I cannot
<br />
formalise *you*. (Later you will discover that comp entails
<br />
in a provable way that the first person cannot never
<br />
be formalised, but that this very fact (the unformalisability 
<br />
of the &quot;I&quot;) can be proved formally!). 
<br />
<br />Later. Let us go step by step.
<br />
And let us going back to short post without speculating 
<br />
vaguely on the whole work. OK?
<br />
