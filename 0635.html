<br />&lt;&lt;  I still 
<br />
&nbsp;cannot figure out why should &quot;my&quot;  measure decrease with &quot;time&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;At least with comp, it seems to me that the measure can only grow, 
<br />
&nbsp;for I can have only a countable set of past histories, and (even &quot;without 
<br />
&nbsp;immortality&quot;) &quot;I&quot; have a uncountable set of futur &quot;histories&quot;  &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />I suspect that the opinion of a decreasing measure is due to the impression 
<br />
that entropic effect will generate many more worlds that are inauspicious to 
<br />
life than worlds that are. In other words, random quantum effects will, on 
<br />
the average, increase the amount of disorder. Here I am putting words (ideas) 
<br />
into people mouths (head). However, I think that this opinion that measure 
<br />
has a tendency to decrease is erroneous for the following two reasons. 
<br />
<br />1) While it is possible that the *now* branches into the future and into 
<br />
mostly inauspicious worlds, it is also possible that the *now* is reached 
<br />
from several past worlds, most of which would be inauspicious. Perfect 
<br />
symmetry between the future and the past hints to an equal number of 
<br />
branching into the future and *rejoining* from the past. New conscious 
<br />
identities could arise from inauspicious worlds as a counterbalance to the 
<br />
loss of identities to those worlds. The MW is not like a giant tree but more 
<br />
like a giant net. This view complicates the task of of tracking identity. Not 
<br />
only we have to explain how identity multiplies in the branching process but 
<br />
we must also explain how several identities merge in the rejoining process.  
<br />
Personally, I see no problem with the MW=net since I view the perception of 
<br />
identity as the *limited* perception of the self from a SINGLE POINT of the 
<br />
MW net, the *here and now*.   
<br />
<br />2) The second reason is that if we conceive of both the MW and the measure as 
<br />
uncountable infinite quantities, then the whole idea of measure &quot;decreases&quot; 
<br />
must be qualified. Any finite trimming in the branching process(say due to 
<br />
suicide) will be insufficient to make any dent in the size of the measure and 
<br />
consciousness will continue. To really affect the measure, the suicide would 
<br />
have to be done with an infinitely reliable machine, capable of operation 
<br />
throughout all branches stemming from the *now*. Such a machine, I believe 
<br />
would be impossible to build even in principle (for the reason that the MW is 
<br />
big enough to include worlds that do not include the machine). The big 
<br />
question is what kind of infinite are the MW and the measure of the self. Are 
<br />
they countable or uncountable? How can the nitty gritty of physical science 
<br />
(i.e., Heisenberg constant = h) bridge to the philosophical vagueness  of the 
<br />
MW (i.e Heisenberg constant = anything). 
<br />

<br />
<br />PS. Bruno, I started reading your thesis. It is impressive. My knowledge of 
<br />
French is definitely an advantage in understanding it.
