2008/11/27 Brent Meeker &lt;meekerdb.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Doesn't this antinomy arise because we equivocate on &quot;running Firefox&quot;.  Do we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean a causal chain of events in the computer according to a certain program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specification or do we mean the appearance on the screen of the same thing that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the causal chain would have produced?  We'd say &quot;no&quot; by the first meaning, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;yes&quot; by the second.  Obviously, there the question is not black-and-white.  If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computer simply dropped a bit or two and miscolored a few pixels, no one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would notice and no one would assert it wasn't running Firefox.  So really, when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we talk about &quot;running Firefox&quot; we are referring to a fuzzy, holistic process
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that admits of degrees.
</em><br />
<br />A functionally equivalent copy of Firefox behaves in the same way as
<br />
the standard copy to which we are comparing it, giving the same output
<br />
for a given input. Differences which the program can't &quot;know&quot; about
<br />
are not important in this context, and the exact nature of the
<br />
hardware - whether solid state or valve, causal or random - is one
<br />
such difference. Of course, if the hardware is causal the program will
<br />
run much more reliably, but if the random hardware runs appropriately
<br />
through luck, I don't see how the program could know this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm developing a suspicion of arguments that say &quot;suppose by accident...&quot;.  If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we say that the (putative) possibility of something happening &quot;by accident&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; destroys the relevance of it happening as part of a causal chain, we are, in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense, rejecting the concept of causal chains and relations - and not just in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, as your Firefox example illustrates.
</em><br />
<br />I would say that the significance of the causal chain is in
<br />
reliability, not in the experience the computation has, such as it may
<br />
be.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wrote &quot;putative&quot; above because this kind of thought experiment hypothesizes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events whose probability is infinitesimal.  If you take a finitist view, there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a lower bound to non-zero probabilities.
</em><br />
<br />Can't we stay finitist and say these improbable things are very likely
<br />
to happen given a very big universe, say 3^^^3 metres across in
<br />
Knuth's notation?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is still trivial in the sense that it could be said to instantiate all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible conscious worlds (at least up to some size limit).  Since we don't know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is necessary to instantiate consciousness, this seems much more speculative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than saying the block of marble instantiates all computations - which we already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree is true only in a trivial sense.
</em><br />
<br />We do know what it takes to instantiate consciousness: chemical
<br />
reactions in the brain. If these chemical reactions are computable
<br />
then an appropriate computation should also instantiate consciousness.
<br />
If we consider only the case of inputless conscious beings, I still
<br />
don't see why they won't be instantiated in randomness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;as I see no reason why the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness of these observers should be contingent on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; possibility of interaction with the environment containing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; substrate of their implementation. My conclusion from this is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness, in general, is not dependent on the orderly physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; activity which is essential for the computations that we observe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet this is directly contradicted by those specific instances in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is interrupted by disrupting the physical activity.
</em><br />
<br />But if it's all a virtual reality, it isn't a concrete physical
<br />
disruption that affects consciousness. It's just that the program
<br />
takes a turn which manifests in the virtual world as brain and
<br />
consciousness disruption.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Rather, consciousness must be a property of the abstract computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; itself, which leads to the conclusion that the physical world is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; probably a virtual reality generated by the big computer in Platonia,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This seems to me to be jumping to a conclusion by examining only one side of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument and, finding it flawed, embracing the contrary.  Abstract computations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are atemporal and don't have to be generated.  So it amounts to saying that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical world just IS in virtue of there being some mapping between the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and some computation.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. But I arrive at this conclusion because I can't think of a reason
<br />
to constrain computation so that it is only implemented by
<br />
conventional computers, and not by any and every random process.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The Fading Qualia argument proves functionalism, assuming that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical behaviour of the brain is computable (some people like Roger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Penrose dispute this). Functionalism then leads to the conclusion that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness isn't dependent on physical activity, as discussed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the recent threads. So, either functionalism is wrong, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness resides in the Platonic realm.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of there's something wrong with the argument that functionalism implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness isn't dependent on physical activity.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but I find the argument convincing.
