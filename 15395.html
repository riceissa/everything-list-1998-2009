Allow me to try analyzing MGA 1 in the context of what I call the UDASSA
<br />
framework, which I have discussed here on this list in years past. First
<br />
I will briefly review UDASSA.
<br />
<br />In UDASSA, the measure of an observer experience, an observer moment, or
<br />
for that matter anything that can be thought of as an information pattern,
<br />
is its measure in the Universal Distribution, a mathematically defined
<br />
probability distribution which is basically the probability that a given
<br />
Universal Turing Machine will output that bit pattern, given a random
<br />
program as input. This turns out to be approximately equal to 1/2 to the
<br />
power of AC, where AC is the algorithmic complexity of the bit pattern,
<br />
i.e. the length of the shortest program that outputs that bit pattern.
<br />
More precisely, the measure is actually the sum of contributions from all
<br />
programs that output that pattern. For each program, if its length is L,
<br />
its contribution to the measure of that pattern is 1/2 to the L power.
<br />
<br />UDASSA also assumes that experiences that have higher measure are more
<br />
likely to be experienced, hence that we would predict that we are more
<br />
likely to experience something that has high measure than something low.
<br />
This is the ASSA part.
<br />
<br />The first step to analyzing most of our thought experiments is to assume
<br />
that consciousness can be represented as an abstract information pattern
<br />
of some yet-to-be-determined nature. Assume that as our understanding
<br />
of psychology and brain physiology grows, we are able to achieve a
<br />
mathematical definition of consciousness, such that any system which
<br />
implements a pattern which meets various criteria would be said to be
<br />
conscious. Brains presumably would then turn out to be conscious because
<br />
they implement (or &quot;instantiate&quot;) patterns that follow these rules.
<br />
<br />In the UDASSA framework, we would apply this understanding and model
<br />
of consciousness slightly differently. Rather than asking whether a
<br />
particular brain or other system implements a given consciousness, or
<br />
more generally asking whether it is conscious at all, we would ask what
<br />
contribution the system in question makes to the measure of a given,
<br />
mathematically-defined, conscious experience. Systems which we would
<br />
conventionally say &quot;are conscious&quot;, like brains, would be ones which
<br />
make a large contribution; systems which do not, like rocks, would make
<br />
virtually no contribution to the measure.
<br />
<br />The manner in which a brain makes a contribution to the measure of the
<br />
abstract information pattern representing its conscious experience is
<br />
like this: The measure of the abstract consciousness is based on the
<br />
size of the shortest program which can output it. A short program to
<br />
output a given person's conscious experience is to start a universe off
<br />
with a Big Bang in a simple initial state and with simple physical laws;
<br />
run it for a while; and then look at a given location in space-time for
<br />
patterns of activity which can be specified by simple rules, and record
<br />
those patterns. The rules in this case would be those corresponding to
<br />
neural events in the brain, in whatever form is necessary to output the
<br />
appropriate mathematical representation of consciousness.
<br />
<br />Some years back on this list, I estimated that a particular observer
<br />
moment might correspond to a program of this nature with a length in
<br />
the tens of thousands of bits.  This is very short considering that
<br />
the raw data of neural activity would be billions of bits; any program
<br />
which tried to use a rock of some other non-conscious source as its
<br />
raw material for outputting the bit pattern would have to hard-code the
<br />
entire bit pattern within itself. Since the contribution of a program
<br />
is inversely exponential in the length of the program, the enormous
<br />
economy of brain-scanning type programs means that they would contribute
<br />
essentially all the measure to conscious experiences, rocks essentially
<br />
none, and hence that we &quot;really are&quot; brains in this sense.
<br />
<br />Turning now to the zombie based thought experiments, let us think of Alice
<br />
whose brain malfunctions for a while but who gets lucky due to cosmic ray
<br />
strikes and so the overall brain pattern proceeds unchanged.  What impact,
<br />
if any, would such events have on her consciousness in this framework?
<br />
<br />Under UDASSA, we would not ask if she is conscious or a zombie. We would
<br />
ask what contribution this instance of her experience makes to the measure
<br />
of the information pattern representing her conscious experience during
<br />
this time (that is, what her experience would be if all were working
<br />
well). If her brain still contributes about as much as it would if it
<br />
were working right, we'd say that she is conscious. If it contributes
<br />
almost nothing, we'd say she was not conscious and was, in that sense,
<br />
a zombie. The UDASSA framework also allows for intermediate levels of
<br />
contribution, although due to the exponential nature of the Universal
<br />
Distribution, even small increases in program size will greatly reduce
<br />
the amount of contribution.
<br />
<br />Assuming that the shortest possible program for outputting the
<br />
mathematical representation of Alice's conscious experience is based on
<br />
the brain scan concept sketched above, what happens when a neuron stops
<br />
working? Well, the brain scan is not going to work the same way. Now,
<br />
if it is a single neuron, it's likely that there would be no noticeable
<br />
effect on consciousness. The brain is an imperfect machine and must have
<br />
a degree of redundancy and error correction. It is likely that the fact
<br />
that one neuron has stopped working would be caught and corrected by the
<br />
error-correction part of the brain-scan program, and its output would not
<br />
be changed. So although the input is different, the output is probably
<br />
the same and so we would say that Alice is not a zombie. Fundamentally
<br />
this is because the brain is immune to noise at this level (we assume).
<br />
<br />Now let us suppose a more serious failure, thousands of neurons, enough
<br />
that it really would make a difference in her experience. But we assume
<br />
that just through luck, cosmic rays activate those neurons so that there
<br />
is no long term change in her thought processes or behavior. The rest
<br />
of her brain works normally. In this case, the brain scanning program
<br />
would possibly output a different result. It would be working by tracking
<br />
neural events, synaptic activity and so on. Depending on the details,
<br />
the fact that the neurons continued to fire in the right patterns might
<br />
not be good enough.
<br />
<br />Let's suppose that the neurons are firing but their synapses are broken
<br />
and are not releasing neurotransmitters. Suppose it turns out that
<br />
the optimal brain-scanning program studies synaptic activity as well
<br />
as overall neural activity. In that case it would output a different
<br />
result. In order to get the program to output the same thing as it would
<br />
have if the brain weren't broken, we would have to make it more complex,
<br />
so that the cosmic ray activity was just as good as neural stimulation,
<br />
for making neurons fire and for producing the desired output pattern. This
<br />
would complicate the program and probably make it substantially larger, at
<br />
least hundreds of bits. This would then decrease its contribution to the
<br />
measure of Alice's conscious experience by at least a factor of 2 to the
<br />
100th power. Alice would have to be though of as a zombie in this case.
<br />
<br />Now, this is based on the assumption that the optimal brain-scanning
<br />
program would be disrupted by whatever aspect it is about Alice's brain
<br />
which is &quot;broken&quot;. By playing around with various ways of doing brain
<br />
scanning and various ways a brain might break, we can get different
<br />
answers. But at a minimum, if Alice's neurons had never been wired up
<br />
to each other in her whole life, and all her life they had merely fired
<br />
sheerly by luck in the same patterns they would have had if properly
<br />
connected, then it seems clear that no simple program could extract the
<br />
proper causal connections among the neurons that would be a necessary
<br />
prerequisite to analyze their logical relationships and output a concise
<br />
mathematical representation of her consciousness. So in that case she
<br />
would certainly be a zombie. A momentary interruption, with the causal
<br />
channels still in place but perhaps temporarily blocked, might still be
<br />
tolerated, again depending on the details.
<br />
<br />Note that in principle, then, whether Alice would be a zombie is an
<br />
empirical question that can be solved via sufficient study of psychology
<br />
and brain physiology (to understand what characterizes consciousness),
<br />
and computer science (to learn what kinds of programs can most efficiently
<br />
translate raw brain measurements into the mathematical representation
<br />
of conscious experience).
<br />
<br />This framework also allows answers to the various other thought
<br />
experiments which have been raised, such as whether a sufficiently
<br />
detailed recording of the brain's activity would be conscious. UDASSA
<br />
suggests that not only is the answer yes (assuming that a simple program
<br />
can infer the same logical relationships as it could from the actual
<br />
brain itself), but that actually such a recording might contribute
<br />
vastly more to the measure of the conscious experience than an ordinary
<br />
brain! That is because the recording persists, and so the program to
<br />
output the mathematical representation of the conscious experience
<br />
can be shorter due to the reduced precision necessary in specifying
<br />
the time coordinate where the scan should start. Hence such &quot;static&quot;
<br />
recordings can apparently produce experiences with much higher measure
<br />
than ordinary brains. We might therefore endorse something like Nick
<br />
Bostrom's Simulation Argument (simulation-argument.com) with the proviso
<br />
that not only are we living in simulations, but that the simulations
<br />
are recorded in persistent storage in some form.
