Hi George,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Thanks for the clarifications. Let me see if I understand you better.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Godfrey Kurtz

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I am sorry I was sloppy in my explanation. Let me try to be clearer. 
</em><br />
&quot;I&quot; is the kernel of consciousness. It does not include &gt;memories which 
<br />
are different for everyone and change as a person ages. I agree with 
<br />
you that since &quot;I&quot; is based on a logical &gt;system it must follow 
<br />
Goedel's theorem, perhaps at the border between incompleteness and 
<br />
inconsistency. It seems that is &gt;precisely what consciousness &quot;feels&quot; 
<br />
like.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is lovely! That may be how your consciousness feels: mine feels 
<br />
like something at the border between dazed and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;confused ;-) Now, seriously, I wish I was as sure as you that there is 
<br />
such kernel once you strip away all the memories.
<br />
&nbsp;(Does this include biological memories, by the way? If so which ones?)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But just in any case: do you have an idea on how to formalize that 
<br />
logical system or in any way, explicate it?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GL]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;I am not saying that &quot;I&quot; is a physical system or is the world. Rather 
</em><br />
that the world that &quot;I&quot; perceive is anthropically constrained &gt;by the 
<br />
&quot;I&quot; and that the physical laws have the same limitations as the &quot;I&quot; 
<br />
including the incompleteness/inconsistency &gt;requirement.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem here though I am trying to understand you as saying that it 
<br />
is the existence of such a logical kernel of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;consciousness that places anthropical constraints on physical laws. 
<br />
The way people usually refer to anthropic constraints
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is as obvious restictions on observation not on the laws! In fact the 
<br />
copernician view is that our *observations* are just
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;as accidental as we believe ouselves to be. I hope you understand that 
<br />
your using &quot;anthropic constraint&quot; in a very
<br />
&nbsp;oblique way...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GL]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;I think that a TOE would have to include an explanation of 
</em><br />
consciousness. In explaining the world we'll have to explain
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; ourselves.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I surely agree with you that this would be desirable but constraining 
<br />
physics on having to evolve consciousness
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;deterministically is not an explanation, in my book. Accidents happen 
<br />
after all.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GL]
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt;&gt; Objective reality is an illusion that disappears when observers 
</em><br />
differ in their frame of reference. In this particular case, it does &gt;&gt; 
<br />
not exist when observers operate according to different but entirely 
<br />
consistent fundamental logics. In fact, such observers &gt;&gt; would have a 
<br />
lot of difficulty communicating since their worlds would be different 
<br />
slices of the plenitude.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;the &quot;strangeness&quot; of relativistic physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;is that observers can actually compare and agree on their 
</em><br />
observations even when they have entirely different deployments
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;in their different frames of reference!
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[GL]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Before relativity, one might have argued that different observers 
</em><br />
experienced different laws of physics. For example, I might &gt;experience 
<br />
a gravitational field while you may experience an acceleration. 
<br />
Relativity is a set of far ranging laws that unified &gt;under the same 
<br />
umbrella what were deemed smaller ranging laws experienced by different 
<br />
observers. I am saying exactly the &gt;same thing. Different frames of 
<br />
reference will generate different perceived laws. Since the frames of 
<br />
reference I am discussing &gt;include logical systems, the perceived 
<br />
worlds will be different.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you wrong in what you say above. Relativity did not change 
<br />
your experience of gravity or acceleration: it changed
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the way you interpret it. The Equivalence Principle is just as valid 
<br />
within Newtonian gravity as in GR (and Carton showed
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that the same is the case for the Principle of Covariance). Einstein's 
<br />
genius was that of &quot;cross breeding&quot; two apparently
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;ancilliary principles into a more general theory of Gravity, general 
<br />
enough to apply to the whole cosmos, etc...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't quite see why you insist in this by the way!? If the &quot;I&quot; is 
<br />
commonly shared and is mapped to a shared physical
<br />
&nbsp;system why different physical laws for different people?
<br />
&nbsp;(Are we still in Kansas, Toto?)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;On this I am sticking with Bruno. I don't think you answer him any 
<br />
better below...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Objective reality is an illusion that disappears when observers

<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;I would say, almost like a physicalist, that &quot;objective reality&quot; is 
</em><br />
what is common to all frame of reference. I would even say that &gt;&quot;the 
<br />
physical laws&quot; are exactly what is true in all observer-moment, 
<br />
relative state/worlds, etc.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GL]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Einstein has demonstrated that under different state of motion and 
</em><br />
acceleration the old objective reality breaks down and a &gt;new objective 
<br />
reality must take its place. Objective reality depends on the range of 
<br />
the laws. Newton's laws are not true in all &gt;frame of reference in 
<br />
various kinds of motion, but Relativity provides unified laws that 
<br />
cover all frames of reference that differ &gt;according to their motion 
<br />
and their acceleration. QT/MWI offers a different kind of relativism. 
<br />
Shannon offers yet another kind &gt;of relativism. Why not just go all the 
<br />
way - no more objective reality. Each &quot;I&quot; has his own reality. If your 
<br />
accept this as a law &gt;then we have objective reality. :-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;Kansas, oh yes!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I could challenge you for giving me two entirely consistent logics 
</em><br />
having nothing in common, and sufficiently rich to keep &gt;natural 
<br />
numbers (but perhaps you don't put weight on arithmetical truth, in 
<br />
which case I could imagine some solution in a non &gt;comp framework)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I am not sure what you mean by your statement in parenthesis. Bruno, 
</em><br />
I am not an expert in logic. Perhaps you can help. Is it &gt;possible that 
<br />
&quot;I&quot; (and the anthropically derived world) may include all the (logical) 
<br />
systems &quot;I&quot; can imagine, and therefore it &gt;would be impossible for &quot;I&quot; 
<br />
to provide you with a system that &quot;I&quot; cannot imagine? So it is 
<br />
impossible for us to see beyond our
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; slice of the plenitude.
