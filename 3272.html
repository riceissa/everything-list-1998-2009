<br />
Some initial musings on extending my one page model to cover SAS:
<br />
<br />The only characteristics I can see that can distinguish various portions of 
<br />
a given isomorphism are:
<br />
<br />i) The way in which they interact during successive isomorphic links with 
<br />
other portions of the isomorphism.
<br />
<br />ii) The manner in which the random or &quot;Do not care&quot; portion of the rules of 
<br />
isomorphic succession apply to them.
<br />
<br />As for the first - SAS seek out other portions of the isomorphism [ranging 
<br />
from individual &quot;particles&quot; [such as photons] to whole collections of 
<br />
&quot;particles&quot; [such as a slice of roast]] and absorb some part of them.
<br />
<br />As for the second - SAS - in order to accomplish the first - need to be 
<br />
structured so that more medium and large size acceptable succession 
<br />
cascades [medium and large &quot;events&quot; within a series of successive 
<br />
isomorphic links] are triggered by the random portion of the rules than for 
<br />
non SAS portions of the isomorphism.  This is necessary because &quot;seek&quot; is 
<br />
an incomplete information concept - SAS have to hunt information and food.
<br />
<br />Observation:
<br />
<br />An observation is just the change in a SAS that takes place from a current 
<br />
&quot;Something&quot; to its immediate successor acceptable &quot;Something&quot; for that 
<br />
SAS's universe.
<br />
<br />Free will:
<br />
<br />If no portion of the next &quot;Something&quot; is acceptable as an isomorphic link 
<br />
for a SAS's universe even with the random content of the rules then that 
<br />
universe skips until an acceptable link is found in some future &quot;Something&quot;.
<br />
<br />Free will can only be found in a SAS's ability - if any - to restrict the 
<br />
range of acceptable successor isomorphic links, that is to reduce the 
<br />
degree to which the random portion of the rules of succession apply to its 
<br />
own structure.
<br />
<br />I currently see no reason why some portions of a isomorphism could not have 
<br />
a structure that has the above distinctions that establish it as a SAS 
<br />
while also exhibiting &quot;free will&quot;.
<br />
<br />xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
<br />
<br />A slightly edited version of the initial post is below
<br />
<br />1) The single postulate is &quot;The total system contains no information.&quot;
<br />
<br />2) The &quot;Nothing&quot; contains at least some information:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever it is manifest any question asking if it is manifest
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must receive the response &quot;yes&quot;.
<br />
<br />3) #2 violates the postulate so the system must contain more component(s), 
<br />
i.e. a &quot;Something&quot; or succession of &quot;Somethings&quot; or an ensemble of all 
<br />
possible &quot;Somethings&quot; that balance or neutralize this information.
<br />
<br />4) The &quot;Nothing&quot; since it contains information can not be stable with 
<br />
respect to the manifestation of the other component(s) or the system again 
<br />
violates the postulate because no neutralization is possible.
<br />
<br />5) Any individual &quot;Something&quot; or a simultaneously manifest ensemble of all 
<br />
possible &quot;Somethings&quot; must also comply with #2 so are violations of the 
<br />
postulate and unstable with respect to the &quot;Nothing&quot;.
<br />
<br />6) The instabilities result in an alternation between the &quot;Nothing&quot; and the 
<br />
other component(s).
<br />
<br />7) The incorporation into the system of a FIXED &quot;other component&quot; which is 
<br />
either an individual &quot;Something&quot; or the complete ensemble of &quot;Somethings&quot; 
<br />
is a selection representing additional information which can not be 
<br />
balanced out by corresponding antipodal information present in the &quot;Nothing&quot;.
<br />
<br />8) The way to make the total system comply with the postulate:
<br />
<br />a) The Nothing alternates with a succession of &quot;Somethings&quot; randomly 
<br />
selected [no rules of selection control] from the ensemble.
<br />
<br />b) The selection of the next &quot;Something&quot; out of the ensemble must be random 
<br />
or the selection process is additional information in violation of the 
<br />
postulate.
<br />
<br />c) The ensemble contains an infinite number of individual &quot;Somethings&quot; so 
<br />
there can be no endless loops of repeats which would represent additional 
<br />
information and are forbidden by the postulate.
<br />
<br />-------------------
<br />
<br />Evolving universes are successive isomorphisms [isomorphic links] to some 
<br />
portion of each successive &quot;Something&quot;.
<br />
<br />An individual &quot;Something&quot; is just a pattern and a given universe is just an 
<br />
isomorphism to a portion of this pattern.
<br />
<br />Each manifestation of the &quot;Nothing&quot; corresponds to the emptiness or gap 
<br />
between successive discrete isomorphisms of universe evolution.
<br />
<br />Enduring evolving universes with fully deterministic rules of isomorphism 
<br />
succession find no home in this model because the gap for such universes 
<br />
would quickly become open ended.  This violates the &quot;Nothing&quot; &quot;Something&quot; 
<br />
alternation and the condition of &quot;evolving&quot;.
<br />
<br />The total system or &quot;Grand Ensemble&quot; is the &quot;Everything&quot;.  It contains no 
<br />
information and it can not contain enduring fully deterministic universes.
