Steve Price, MD:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;HM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;This makes our own self-awareness a circular object: its causes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;only exist when we already admit to its existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;SLP:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;No.  Logically, for any A, the cause of A must PRECEDE A's existence.
</em><br />
<br />The late Gerry O'Neill (Princeton physicist who invented colliding
<br />
beams and space habitats) once noted that if you encounter an alien
<br />
who insists on an assertion in this spirit (eg. every logical system
<br />
must begin with a solid foundation of axioms) you can assume they
<br />
probably live on a planet, where structures must be built bottom up.
<br />
Those who live in space, say in rotating habitats, will be more
<br />
open to the idea that logical constructs can exist without support,
<br />
or particular starting points, merely holding themselves together
<br />
by internal logical consistency.  The latter is the only way I've been
<br />
able to make sense of consciousness: it is an abstract attributed
<br />
property that exists in its own (abstract, attributed) eyes.
<br />
[It probably evolved in a social context as a way of seeing
<br />
others, the better to interact with them, and was at some point
<br />
applied to the observer itself.]
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But a human's self-awareness is generated by a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical system, a brain, which is a macroscopic object inhabiting a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quasi-classical physical domain 
</em><br />
<br />I don't think so.  Consciousness is just one way of interpreting
<br />
the functioning of a brain: it is a complex and observer-dependent
<br />
attribution like beauty, not a simple physical property like gravity.
<br />
What's tricky is that a property attributed with consciousness is
<br />
the ability to make attributions, so the consciousness can then
<br />
atribute its own consciousness to itself.  So &quot;you&quot; (accepting
<br />
&quot;your&quot; existence for the sake of argument!) believe you are conscious.
<br />
But for all that, it is an arbitrary attribution, and doesn't
<br />
invalidate the position of my super-alien, who understands your
<br />
construction and function precisely, and can predict and affect
<br />
your behavior much better than I (or you!) can, and has no need to
<br />
attribute a fuzzy, made-up psychological concept like consciousness
<br />
to interact effectively with you.  The alien finds plain, unadorned
<br />
physics a much more satisfactory way to interpret your functioning.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; where there is a well-defined time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direction.  So in this particular case, &quot;precede' ALSO has a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well-defined temporal sense.
</em><br />
<br />In fact, I think our experience of time is also a subjective
<br />
attribution tied up in the way our conscious self-defines.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;HM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;But isn't a tenet of the larger discussion that existence itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;a similarly circular business: universes exist because beings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;within them perceive them.  But those beings exist only if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;you admit the existence of the universes that contain them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;SLP:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is Wheeler's &quot;self-excited circuit&quot; nonsense.  Universes exist
</em><br />
<br />Calling it names doesn't refute it.  It certainly resonates with
<br />
my thinking.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;because of physical laws that have nothing whatever to do with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-aware systems.  Self-aware systems are particular CONSEQUENCES of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical law, not vice-versa.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think either is true. Self-aware systems are logical
<br />
constructs involving psychological terms that can be mapped onto
<br />
any(!) physical or abstract systems, though particular observers,
<br />
because of their own perspective, will find some mappings easier
<br />
to make than others.  For instance, we find it easy to map
<br />
consciousness onto our internal self-model, and the models we have
<br />
of our friends. We sometimes also map awareness onto inanimate
<br />
objects like fictional characters and teddy bears.  The latter may
<br />
provide so little input to our &quot;attributer&quot; that many different
<br />
attributions are equally easy (is your teddy bear happy, or is it
<br />
angry?). This doesn't make the attributions invalid, just less useful
<br />
in discussions with others, who may choose to attribute differently.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;One great virtue of Everett's original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relative state formulation was that it was able to assert this in a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;clean way and give an explicit understanding of why &quot;measurements&quot; on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quantum systems show the particular patterns they do to physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;recording devices necessarily embedded within the universal wave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;function.
</em><br />
<br />Everett only showed that it was consistent to model a measurement
<br />
without collapse by expressing it as the superposition of 
<br />
a number of correlated observer and system states, each representing
<br />
a different measurement outcome.  I'm for that 100%: gets rid of
<br />
ill-defined collapse, and gains you many-worlds.  But he didn't
<br />
touch the question of why the decomposition should be into the
<br />
particular semi-classical alternatives we experience.  After all,
<br />
the wave function just goes on happily evolving in toto.  Who
<br />
needs any kind of decomposition?  Well, I think our self-defining
<br />
consciousness abstractly maps itself onto the undifferentiated
<br />
wave function, carving out little volumes in the Hilbert space
<br />
that we see as semi-classical reality.  But the only skin
<br />
around those little volumes is in our own way of looking at
<br />
it!  I don't know how this works in detail: Hartle and Gell-Mann
<br />
have been struggling to an answer: how our kind of observation
<br />
&quot;decoheres&quot; parts of the wave function in apparently uncorrelated
<br />
consistent alternatives.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your claims would (a) effectively return us to Bohr's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Copenhagen nuttiness and
</em><br />
<br />I don't think so.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(b) imply some type of primacy of consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;metaphysics.  How, for example, would you reconcile the origin of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;local, observable universe some 13 billion years ago with the fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness did not evolve until a much later time?
</em><br />
<br />Probably.  I am pretty partial to the idea that the universe we
<br />
percieve, in all its great temporal and spatial extent, is probably
<br />
the simplest way for our personal subjective experience to come into
<br />
being. The simplicity isn't immediately obvious, but is implied by
<br />
the &quot;unreasonable efficacy of mathematics in explaining reality&quot; and
<br />
by the probable existence of a simple TOE. We find ourselves in this
<br />
universe (as opposed to someplace completely different) because
<br />
it's the simplest, and thus most probable, explanation for us.
<br />
(To answer your last question, sometimes the shortest program
<br />
to generate a particular string needs to run a very long time and
<br />
generate a lot of intermediate stuff.)
<br />
<br />Whether you call this primacy of consciousness is arbitrary. The
<br />
chain of cuase is not a pyramid, it is a circle.  You can stand on
<br />
one part of a circle and say all the rest of the circle follows
<br />
from this point.  But you can also stand elswhere on it and say
<br />
the same thing!
<br />
We physical scientist types tend to think in terms of how we evolved
<br />
under the physical laws.  But that doesn't invalidate the position
<br />
that these particular physical laws exist because they're necessary
<br />
to produce us.
<br />
(Or more precisely, to produce each of us individually.  Another
<br />
consequence of this whole way of thinking is that we each experience
<br />
somewhat different realities.  For instance, I might find myself in
<br />
a situation where you no longer existed, but I did.  But I will never
<br />
find myself in a situation where you exist but I don't!  For you the
<br />
situation is reversed.  The radically different probabilities we
<br />
experience for these ultimate outcomes must affect the probabilities
<br />
of contingent events, with the simplest overall situation for each
<br />
of us individually having the highest probability of being observed.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From what I've seen in the last few days, most of the folks on this
</em><br />
list have positions closer to mine than to yours.  In the larger
<br />
scientific world, your position is orthodoxy.  I love this list!
