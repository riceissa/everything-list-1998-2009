<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How can an abstraction be felt?
</em><br />
<br />This is a very deep question. To me, anyway.
<br />
<br />I have followed this thread with spattering distraction while doing other
<br />
things, and I am greatly interested in the relative roles of the self,
<br />
observer and causality. My interest is in nailing the human mind's position
<br />
in this regard. I have come a long way in this (I think!)
<br />
<br />What I wanted to run by you folks for comment was the notion of and
<br />
'instance' of 'type &quot;mind&quot;' as simultaneously being a member of class
<br />
'observer' and of class 'observed'. In particular I am concerned with us
<br />
homo sapiens sapiens  role as observer and as observed. It is part of my
<br />
dealing with self referentiality - the notion of self and the human mind, if
<br />
you can just bear with me a second.
<br />
<br />Throw an N-dimensional net around any portion of any process in any
<br />
universe. Call it a computational entity 'X'. Entity X (described by an as
<br />
yet undefined observer), will have within it a model of its surroundings
<br />
commensurate with the a) sophistication of the 'computational abstraction
<br />
capacity' within it and b) the sophistication of connectivity of the entity
<br />
with the rest of the universe(s).
<br />
<br />If you consider the well worn 'what it is like' question as applied to the
<br />
netted entity you begin to approach the answer to the &quot;How can an
<br />
abstraction be felt?&quot; question. There is only one unassailable fact
<br />
(opinions please) about this: The only way that the 'what it is like to be
<br />
entity X' question can be answered is to 'be' entity X .ie. The
<br />
computational process itself is the description of 'what it is like'. The
<br />
3rd person observer simply cannot 'be' entity X and hence is forever
<br />
excluded from the 'what it is like' descriptive milieux.
<br />
<br />This concept can be applied to entity X1 = 1 x homo sapiens or X2 = the
<br />
complete homo sapiens population of Greenland. The defining thing is the
<br />
boundary formed by the net. The computational capacity X2 when considered as
<br />
a single entity will have a dim notion of self and poor sensory feeds as
<br />
compared to X1.
<br />
<br />Q1 Can X2 as observer describe X1 to another instance of type X2? 	A. Not
<br />
very well.
<br />
Q2 Can X1 as observer describe X2? To another instance of type X1? 	A. much
<br />
better.
<br />
<br />Why? Because the computational model within X1 for describing things that
<br />
are NOT X1 is far superior to that of X2, which is a highly watered down
<br />
computational critter with poor sensory feeds.
<br />
<br />Is this way of thinking useful? IMO: Yes, when you turn it around an apply
<br />
it to the observer.
<br />
<br />It tells you that when you throw a 'net' around a chunk of universe, if you
<br />
capture optimally you will have the complete computational
<br />
universe-modelling contents and all sensory feeds. As such the entity can
<br />
then become an observer in the universe commensurate with the sophistication
<br />
of its modelling .ie. the causality predictions produced by the models
<br />
within the net, given all history and current sensory inputs. Put observer
<br />
and observed together (as two 'instances' of entities of a class) and you
<br />
have each modelling the other and themselves.
<br />
<br />Getting back to the original question &quot;How can an abstraction be felt?&quot;. Now
<br />
'be' the abstraction. Now apply it to a rock, insect, mouse, dog, dolphin,
<br />
human. Consider throwing a net around a galaxy or an entire universe.
<br />
Examples:
<br />
<br />Consider X1 = a whole universe.
<br />
Does it have any sensory feeds or anything 'outside' to model? Nope.
<br />
Being like 'a universe' is like being nothing.
<br />
<br />Consider X1 = an atom of silicon. Does it have any sensory feeds or anything
<br />
'outside' to model? Maybe a tiny bit eg some sense of temperature and no
<br />
model of self. It has a lot to model but very little to model with. 'Being'
<br />
an atom is very like being nothing, but not quite.
<br />
<br />The trick thing that has distracted us all is that we tend to thing of the
<br />
'feeling' aspect as 'happening to us'. The reason for this is that we have a
<br />
very sophisticated model for self. It is NOT happening to us. We ARE it. Our
<br />
skull contains brain matter. The brain matter models internal and external
<br />
processes and it is so sophisticated we feel like we are outside ourselves.
<br />
We deal with the rest of the universe at the boundary of our bodies (or
<br />
temporary extensions we connect to it). The collective effect of a
<br />
concentration of modelling capacity and sensory nexus makes us feel like our
<br />
cranium is where it's all happening.
<br />
<br />You can do various thought experiments on this.
<br />
Eg. Blow your brain up to the size of a Mac Truck (keeping everything else
<br />
scaled appropriately). What happens to the model of self?
<br />
Eg. Distribute you brain around you whole body instead of just the cranium.
<br />
Now what is it like?
<br />
&nbsp;:-) It's helpful knowing that to talk to a human you look at the head, but
<br />
what happens when there is no 'focus' of attention at the physical scales
<br />
you are forced to inhabit?
<br />
<br />In this way I have been able to formulate the upper most level my model for
<br />
a potential AI.
<br />
<br />I have never had anyone to talk this through with. There appears to be
<br />
no-one else on the planet but you guys that get it. I look forward to seeing
<br />
how you 'feel' about the descriptive capacity of this way of looking at
<br />
things. I'm also interested in how others' way of describing things matches
<br />
with this. Baars and Chalmers and Dennett and Sloman slide tantalisingly by
<br />
and miss it. There seems to be an industry built on being boggled by the
<br />
issue with things like qualia endlessly debated. Why is it that a group of
<br />
people focussed on QM/MWI hit this issue? Or is it me simply not being
<br />
widely read enough?
<br />
<br />Your thoughts?
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
<br />Colin Hales
