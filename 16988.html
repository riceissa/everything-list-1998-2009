<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brent,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So my first draft addressed many of the points you made, but it that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; email got too big and sprawling I thought.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I've focused on what seems to me like the key passage from your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; post.  If you think there was some other point that I should have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; addressed, let me know.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, key passage:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do these mathematical objects &quot;really&quot; exist?  I'd say they have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; logico-mathematical existence, not the same existence as tables and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; chairs, or quarks and electrons.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So which kind of existence do you believe is more fundamental?  Which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is primary?  Logico-mathematical existence, or quark existence?  Or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are they separate but equal kinds of existence?
</em><br />
<br />The way I look at it there is knowledge we gain from perception, including the 
<br />
inner perception of logical and mathematical facts.  We make up theories that 
<br />
unify and explain these perceptions and which extend beyond what we perceive. 
<br />
These theories have ontologies: things they assume to exist - within the domain 
<br />
of the theory.  There's no way to say that one is more fundamental than the 
<br />
other so long as they are in separate theories.  Only if they are subsumed 
<br />
within one theory can there be some sense in which one is more fundamental than 
<br />
the other.  I don't think we have such a theory yet.  And note that even if we 
<br />
have theory including both mathematical and physical objects in its ontology it 
<br />
may turn out that either one can be used to explain the other; so it's not 
<br />
necessarily the case that one is more fundmental.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In what way, exactly, does logico-mathematical existence differ from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quark existence?  
</em><br />
<br />You can kick quarks and they kick back.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is logico-mathematical existence a lesser kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence?  Is logico-mathematical existence derivative of and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dependant on quark existence?
</em><br />
<br />See above.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Further, do tables and chairs even have the same kind of existence as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quarks and electrons?  
</em><br />
<br />Although the explanation of the macroscopic world from the quantum world is not 
<br />
worked out it is generally supposed that tables and chairs will eventually be 
<br />
explained in terms of quarks and electrons.  The interesting thing is that from 
<br />
the standpoint of epistemology, the tables and chairs are more fundamental, 
<br />
while the theory makes the quarks and electrons more fundamental to the 
<br />
ontology.  So there are different senses of &quot;fundamental&quot; too.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;A table is something that we perceive visually,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but we intellectually take &quot;tables&quot; to be ultimately and fully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reducible to &quot;quarks and electrons&quot;.   So chairs and quarks certainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist at different levels.  Quarks would seem to be more fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than chairs.  But obviously we don't actually perceive quarks or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electrons...instead we infer their existence from our actual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceptions of various types of experimental equipment and from there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; associate them back with tables.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for our experience of logico-mathematical objects, we certainly can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; translate them into more &quot;chair-like&quot; perceptions by visualization via
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer programs, right?  
</em><br />
<br />I'm doubtful of that.  Certainly many mathematical objects can be illustrated 
<br />
because they were invented to describe something we could perceive - like 
<br />
spheres or symmetries.  But I don't see how you would visualize Shannon 
<br />
information or strings in ten dimensional space.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This would put them very much on similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; footing with our experience of quarks and electrons at least, which we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also only visualize via computer reconstructions.
</em><br />
<br />But there's more than visualization.  We can also manipulate and use quarks and 
<br />
electrons, i.e. we can make them kick each other and us.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And, presumably it is possible for a human with exceptional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; visualization abilities to experience logico mathematical objects in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way that is even more &quot;chair-like&quot; than that.  For instance, there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people with Synesthesia (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia</a>),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for whom some letters or numbers are perceived as inherently colored,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or for whom numbers, months of the year, and/or days of the week
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elicit precise locations in space (for example, 1980 may be &quot;farther
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; away&quot; than 1990).
</em><br />
<br />I don't think that's good example. Synesthesia comes from cross coupling in the 
<br />
brain of concepts that are usually separate.  I synesthesia were like perception 
<br />
then all synesthesists would see the same numbers as having the same color, etc. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thing that causes us to attribute a form of existence to mathematical 
<br />
objects is that everyone who understands them agrees on their properties.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But what if this type of synesthesia had some use that strongly aided
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in human survival and reproduction?  Then (speaking in materialist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms) as we evolved synesthesia would have become a standard feature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for humans and would now be considered just part of our normal sensory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparatus.  We would be able to &quot;sense&quot; numbers in a way similar to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how we sense chairs.  In this case we would almost certainly consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers to be unquestionably objectively real and existing.  Though
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maybe we would ponder their peculiar qualities, in the same way we now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; puzzle over the strangeness of quantum mechanics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A further example:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Autistic savant Daniel Tammet shot to fame when he set a European
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; record for the number of digits of pi he recited from memory (22,514).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  For afters, he learned Icelandic in a week. But unlike many savants,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he's able to tell us how he does it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Q.  But how do you visualise a number? In the same way that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; visualise a giraffe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A.  Every number has a texture. If it is a &quot;lumpy&quot; number, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immediately my mind will relate it to other numbers which are lumpy -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the lumpiness will tell me there is a relationship, there is a common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; divisor, or a pattern between the digits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Q. Can you give an example of a &quot;lumpy&quot; number?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A.  For me, the ideal lumpy number is 37. It's like porridge. So 111,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a very pretty number, which is 03 times 37, is lumpy but it is also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; round. It takes on the properties of both 37 and 3, which is round.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's an intuitive and visual way of doing maths and thinking about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers.  For me, the ideal lumpy number is 37. It's like porridge.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we can say (again, speaking in materialist/physicalist terms)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it's purely an accident of evolution that numbers don't seem as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuitively real to us as chairs, or colors, or love, or free will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (ha!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Speaking in platonist terms, it's an accident of our particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental/symbolic structure that numbers don't seem as intuitively real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to us as chairs, or colors, or love, or free will (ha!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Speaking in computationalist terms, it's an accident of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causal/representational/algorithmic structure that numbers don't seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as intuitively real to us as chairs, or colors, or love, or free will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (ha!).
</em><br />
<br />But numbers don't cause anything and they are not caused by other things.  So 
<br />
it's not an accident.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, no matter what terms you use, it's conceivable, and we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significant evidence that points to the possibility, that our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious perceptions could be modified in a way such that numbers and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other abstractions would seem much more substantial and real than they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do currently, even as substantial and real as chairs and tables.  And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this wouldn't require any change in what actually exists or &quot;how&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these things exists (logico-mathematical or otherwise).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So based on all of the above, returning to your original statement:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;I'd say they have logico-mathematical existence, not the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence as tables and chairs, or quarks and electrons.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say that most people PERCEIVE logico-mathematical objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differently than they perceive tables and chairs, or quarks and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electrons.  But this doesn't tell us anything about whether these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things really have different kinds of existence.  That we perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them differently is just an accident of fate.
</em><br />
<br />It is more than just perceiving them differently.  For example mathematical 
<br />
objects are not located in space or time.  They exist timelessly and in no 
<br />
particular place.
