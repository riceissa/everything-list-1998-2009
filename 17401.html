</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure I understand. Peter seems to defend, like many both CTM  
<br />
and PM.
<br />
So he assumes, without showing, there is an error in UDA, which is a  
<br />
proof that CTM + PM is epistemologically inconsistent.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the basis of some of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things he's said in reply to me recently, I think it may not be.  If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we could resolve this key point, perhaps it would cast fresh light on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some of the issues thrown up e.g. (BTW I'm not expecting answers to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these questions here and now):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) What motivates the assumption of different theoretical postulates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of primitiveness, contingency and necessity?
</em><br />
<br />Is that question really important? It is a bit a private question.  
<br />
Typical motivation for comp, are that it is very plausible under a  
<br />
large spectrum of consideration, and it leads naturally to the use of  
<br />
Computer science, which is full of interesting result which put light  
<br />
on those question. In the process you try to find the faithful  
<br />
representations to reason correct at the relevant level of your inquiry.
<br />
The advantage of comp is that you can get a lot, without theoretical  
<br />
assumptions (other that yes doctor and some high school math, and then  
<br />
Church thesis, virtually accepted by everybody, curiously enough)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) How do explanations of physical and mental phenomena diverge on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis of these different assumptions?
</em><br />
<br />Hmm...  It depends of the future. If UDA leads to a refutation of  
<br />
comp, it will lead to non computationalist theory of mind, perhaps  
<br />
coherent with physicalism (I don't know, I doubt this actually). If  
<br />
UDA leads to a empirically correct physics, it will leads to  
<br />
Pythagorean second birth and probably the slow, or not so slow,  
<br />
explorations of the matrix. I dunno.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) What kind of non-computational theories of mind might be viable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assuming &quot;CTM + PM = false&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />It is a bit vexing that you assume the result of a an argument!  You  
<br />
are assuming UDA is valid. Thanks!
<br />
<br />UDA shows that CTM + PM -&gt; false. Equivalently, it shows this:  CTM -&gt;  
<br />
not PM,  or this: PM -&gt; ~CTM.
<br />
<br />Non computational theory of mind? There are three kinds. But it needs  
<br />
even more mathematical logic. Sorry.
<br />
1) Those for which AUDA still works completely and soundly, at the  
<br />
propositional level. Most self-referentially correct &quot;angels&quot;, that is  
<br />
non turing emulable entities still obeys to the AUDA hypostases.
<br />
2) Those for which AUDA remains sound, but no more complete, but that  
<br />
you can effectively complete (example: true in all transitive models  
<br />
of ZF). G and G* are still sound for such a &quot;divine&quot; entity, but no  
<br />
more complete.  You have to add a formula to characterize them.
<br />
3) Those for which AUDA could apply soundly, but can no more be  
<br />
completed.
<br />
4) Those for which AUDA does no more apply at all. I suspect they are  
<br />
very &quot;near&quot; the &quot;0-person&quot; ONE itself, but the math are hard, if not  
<br />
collapsing actually.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) And my original question: does the notion of &quot;emulation =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitution&quot; have any force outside CTM?
</em><br />
<br />I have too many interpretations for &quot;emulation = substitution&quot;. I am  
<br />
not sure what you refer to.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; IOW if I believe I'm made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of primitive matter, what does this imply in terms of evaluating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposals from the doctor?
</em><br />
<br />If the doctor proposes a digital machine, and you accept, it means you  
<br />
will either become zombie, or a non working zombie, or a dead person.
<br />
If he propose a non digital machine coherent with your non comp theory  
<br />
of mind, it will be OK, but such theory have not yet been proposed in  
<br />
any rationalist frame. Except in a sense Roger Penrose, and precursors  
<br />
(the QM-Copenhagen).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ....and so forth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, it would be nice to get past an impasse which has plagued the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussions interminably whilst continually failing to be resolved.
</em><br />
<br />If Peter is really interested in the subject he could search for the  
<br />
point where he has trouble in the UDA. But he seems to defend PM and  
<br />
CTM a priori, so we can't help. He want believe that the problem is in  
<br />
step 0, where I would assume Platonism at the start. But he is  
<br />
ambiguous about what he means by Platonism. In some post it means  
<br />
Arithmetical Realism (the banal believe that classical logic can be  
<br />
applied to the number realm), and in some post it means the falsity of  
<br />
CTM+PM, like if I was assuming at the start that only numbers exists.  
<br />
UDA would loss its main purpose!
<br />
<br />I have met other similar person. They believe so much in CTM+PM that  
<br />
they does not take the time to study the argument that PM+CTM is  
<br />
false. (well &quot;is false OR eliminate consciousness and the person&quot;: it  
<br />
*is* an epistemological contradiction).
<br />
<br />Too bad for them. OK? The rationalist loves to search errors and  
<br />
criticize reasoning. I have decompose the reasoning in step to provide  
<br />
helps, but dogmatic person seems not to take the opportunity. I guess  
<br />
CTM+PM is a sort of &quot;religious&quot; dogma, for them.
<br />
<br />And they are never clear on PM. Somehow they cannot be clear, because  
<br />
if they are too much clear, Church thesis entails that comp + a level  
<br />
low enough will &quot;generate the appearance of that PM&quot;. This why Peter  
<br />
is nervous with the idea that PM is really what is relatively  
<br />
contingent in the arithmetical context. &quot;PM&quot; exists but with comp it  
<br />
is just &quot;M&quot;.
<br />
<br />Now David, if you have any trouble with UDA, as you seem to have  
<br />
sometimes, I can help, and I am certainly open to the idea that things  
<br />
are still unclear, or even that, who knows, a fatal error is hidden.
<br />
But since the time, I doubt it. Some reluctance to Platonism  is just  
<br />
normal, given history, but also a natural fear that all Lobian machine  
<br />
can have in front of their ignorance.
<br />
Note that many in this list have still problem with step-8, and that  
<br />
is why I have begun to do the &quot;step seven&quot; with the math in details,  
<br />
to get a better understanding of what happens in step 8, and what is  
<br />
computational supervenience. The math is counter-intuitive.  
<br />
Computerland is wonderland!
<br />
<br />May be you don't want to do the math? The math for UDA are really  
<br />
basic compared to the math needed for AUDA.
<br />
<br />But that's OK. Take it easy,
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
