<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After very kindly concurring with bits of my recent posts, Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nonetheless quite reasonably questioned whether I followed his way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proceeding.  Having read the UDA carefully, I would say that in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'grandmotherly' way I do, although not remotely at his technical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Concerning the Universal Dovetailer Argument (UDA) a subtle 
<br />
prerequisite is Church Thesis, if only to understand the relation with 
<br />
arithmetical realism and also to understand the term &quot;Universal&quot; in the 
<br />
UD. Coming back from Siena I am not sure &quot;Church thesis&quot; is well 
<br />
understood today.
<br />
BTW I have discovered that the book edited by Martin Davis &quot;The 
<br />
undecidable&quot; has been republished in 2004 by Dover. This is really the 
<br />
comp basic bible. It contains the readable original paper by Godel, 
<br />
Church, Kleene, Rosser, and, above all the incredible anticipation by 
<br />
Post. Actually Post did even anticipate my thesis, that is the 
<br />
platonistic reversal physics/number-computer-science. To be sure he 
<br />
adds a footnote (footnote 118) saying he changed his mind ... I think I 
<br />
will write a paper just on that footnote ....
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I had been doing thought experiments of a somewhat similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nature literally for decades, based on questions like &quot;why am I me and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not you?&quot; or &quot;how do I know that me now is the same as me 5 minutes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ago?&quot; or &quot;is the person who gets out of the transporter the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person as the one who began the journey?&quot;  For some time, faced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; largely with incomprehension or disinterest, and seeing hardly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything remotely like this referred to in print, I despaired of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finding others who believed these questions were anything but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irrelevant or crazy.  But gradually these topics seemed to emerge into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion from a variety of directions, and now I've found a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; community of similarly crazy people on the Internet.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually those typical comp or mechanist thought experiences 
<br />
(reasonings) exist since humans use tools. Reference are in the biblios 
<br />
of &quot;conscience et mécanisme&quot;. Many Sc. fiction book go through such 
<br />
experience, and the book &quot;Mind's I&quot; (ed. by Hofstadter and Dennett) 
<br />
contains relevant thought (but miss my favorite sc. fi. book, the 
<br />
&quot;SIMULACRON III&quot; by Daniel Galouye).
<br />
Mind'I eyes missed the first person comp indeterminacy and the 
<br />
subsequent reversal.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The conclusion I had come to is broadly summarised in my recent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; posts.  It seemed to me that the 'transporter' questions could only be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resolved if I thought in terms of my being incorporated in some unique
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or 'global' pre-differentiated manner, which nonetheless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multifariously self-localised by differentiation of structures that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; embodied distinct 'histories'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say that, once we accept comp, the only problem which remains 
<br />
is the &quot;white rabbit problem&quot;, that is: the problem of isolating from 
<br />
computer science the measure on the relative computational histories 
<br />
capable of justifying the apparent normality of the observable laws.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This seemed somehow to entail the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emergence of finitude from the not-finite, which seemed weirdly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right.
</em><br />
<br /><br />? (comp presupposes the natural numbers. Indeed they constitute the 
<br />
absolutely unsolvable mysteries).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, it would be the histories that differed, not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'self'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This could depend on choice of vocabulary. If you define the self by 
<br />
what is consistent, or better sound, and invariant in all comp 
<br />
histories, you will get the arithmetical hypostases.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The histories would break the symmetry of the self into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiated sub-selves that would be 'I' with respect to their own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; private environments.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hopefully. That is what is under the course of verification. Again, 
<br />
accepting the positive integers makes such symmetry breaking easy to 
<br />
understand. The real mystery (partially solved though) is in the 
<br />
understanding of the physical initial apparent symmetry.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; These environments, being participatory, could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only be shared with other such sub-selves by signalling', and the sum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; total of shareable signals, re-embodied, would be the 'objective' or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'outside' physical description of the situation.
</em><br />
<br />Hopefully again. This would correspond to the first
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;person plural notion, as far as some part of the comp indeterminacy is 
<br />
sharable (like the quantum reality seems to confirm).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But since these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'entities' could only be self-defined emergents of the original self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relativisation, everything was in fact 'outside-less' and continued to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist uniquely or monistically as a network of self-relation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />... itself emerging from the additive/multiplicative number relations. 
<br />
The self itself is what computer science and provability logic explains 
<br />
the better.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Depending on whether the participatory or 'objective' perspective was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adopted, self-relation could apparently decompose into 'sense' or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'action' narratives, but such decomposition was in fact illusory, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective-dependent.  Self-relation in fact remained singular or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decomposable in nature
</em><br />
<br />This is fuzzy. I can agree but I have more than one interpretation. 
<br />
It's hard not being more technical here.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Having said this, I can now perhaps contextualise more clearly my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concern about functionalism.  Functionalism is the doctrine that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is a function of the relationship between parts.
</em><br />
<br />Hmmm... I would say that this is the old, pre-comp, physicalist account 
<br />
of functionalism. With comp, and with the fact that consciousness is a 
<br />
typical first person notion, it is not clear if we can describe 
<br />
consciousness by any local relation between part. Consciousness (but 
<br />
also matter) is necessarily related to &quot;all histories&quot;. Only the 
<br />
possible third person discourse can be locally related to describable 
<br />
relations between describable parts.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entails that, discounting eliminativism, consciousness must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actualised by such relations,
</em><br />
<br />by an infinity of them. This should follow from the UDA.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that if such parts were to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered 'ultimately' to be physical,
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think this has no meaning in the comp frame. The physical is what 
<br />
glues the (lobian) personal experience. This includes an infinity of 
<br />
&quot;linear stories&quot; capable of multiplying themselves by &quot;tensor product&quot; 
<br />
of independent computational histories. But I have not yet isolate this 
<br />
tensor structure, to be sure. If it does not exist, comp is false. 
<br />
Cosmology could be related to the depth and other Church-Turing like 
<br />
complexity notions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; then the relevant relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could only be physical relations.  If this were so, the actual or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realised relationships existent in a physical structure would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exhausted by its physical description, and the ascription of a super-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; added set of 'computational' relationships would merely be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphorical and hence not real enough to be &quot;I&quot;.  Consequently, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics is held to be fundamental to consciousness, and consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is an observer effect, then such observers must be fully describable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by physical relationships, not functional ones, and the appropriate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitution level is physical duplication, to some level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tolerance.
</em><br />
<br />OK, but this is explicitly what cannot be done in the comp frame. A 
<br />
good thing given that &quot;physical&quot; can hardly be defined by the product 
<br />
of observation.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By contrast, if the reality of parts and relationships is to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered fundamentally numerical,
</em><br />
<br />The main first half of my work consists in showing that comp does not 
<br />
give a choice in those matter.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; then consciousness and physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could indeed be derived functionally or computationally from this kit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of parts and their relations.  From this perspective, the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure of the body and the observational structure of the mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could be held to emerge
</em><br />
<br />... should emerge, ok.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; respectively from 'action' and 'sense'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decompositions of the fundamental self-relative nature of number-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relations.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nonetheless, if the observer decomposition continues to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regarded as 'functional' with respect to the physical one,
</em><br />
<br />This is unclear, I'm afraid.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; they remain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in some deep sense orthogonal - i.e. the 'functionalism' is that of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'imaginary parts' and 'imaginary relations' with respect to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical description.
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It follows that there may be no final way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'de-crypting' any unambiguous observer structure from the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description alone.  We would then be left unavoidably with an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'objectively' unknowable and unprovable imputation of consciousness to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any physically-defined structure.  So be it.
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it might then be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questioned how observer and physical narratives could somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'converge' on a common or consistent environmental interface as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result of any form of co-evolution. Such a notion would seem to imply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that equivalent selection effects could be operating on both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environments despite their orthogonal orientation. It is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immediately apparent why this should be so.
</em><br />
<br />As far as I understand, this is *the* problem. It seems insoluble 
<br />
untill you take into account explicitly the incompleteness phenomenon 
<br />
which put high constraint of what sound machines can believe, bet, 
<br />
observe, feel ... (that what the hypostases are all about).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may consequently offer some theoretical advantages to suppose that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a single evolutionary path is followed as a consequence of one-to-one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reciprocity at some level between sense and action components of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primitively self-relative narrative, and that consciousness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consequently not 'functional' with respect to the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description, but in some real sense isomorphic or analogic.
</em><br />
<br />Hmmm ... there is a fixed point ... I am not sure this helps here ....
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would not, ISTM, be to postulate any fundamental 'material' substrate,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but rather to be saying something about the way a 'neutral'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamentally self-relative process could 'decompose' into apparently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reciprocal components as a consequence of the embodiment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observation.  However, I can't at this point see whether such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternatives can be resolved purely theoretically, or whether they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamentally empirical issues.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Grandma
</em><br />
<br />I think I have make progress in that direction. BTW you can consult my 
<br />
last SIENA paper &quot;A Purely Arithmetical Interpretation, yet empirically 
<br />
falsifiable, of Plotinus' theory of Matter&quot;. Click on the title here:
