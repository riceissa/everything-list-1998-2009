Hal, a decade ago I 'read' your text easier than now: you firmed up your vocabulary - gradually out of my understanding. Sorry.
<br />
*
<br />
You seem to accept 'observer moments' and their interaction - even postulate one variable needed.
<br />
<br />How long is an OM? a million years (cosmology) or a msec? Even if it is a portion of the latter, it makes the existence quite discontinuous - with all the difficulties in it. If it is continuous, then how can we talk about 'moments'? Should we assign an equal rate change to all existence (meaning: ONE selection for the OM length)? If it can be ANY, varying from the infinitely short to the other extreme, it would 'wash away' any sense of the meaning of an Observer MOMENT concept. 
<br />
I think the OM is the figment of us, human observers, who want to use an 'understandable' model. [Like: numbers (in the human logic sense).] 
<br />
<br />Then, in view of the resulting 'unfathomable', we 'complicate' these models - originally created FOR comprehension - into incomprehensibility. [The way as e.g. to bridge Bohm's Explicate to the Implicate (by Nic de  Cusa's 2nd principle, left out by Bohm: the &quot;Complicate&quot; - what I like to assign as math).] 
<br />
*
<br />
That 'one' variable property you mention as needed for state- interaction is IMO not necessarily  o n e  within our (present) comprehension. 
<br />
I like your 'abhorring' a selection: we could select only from within boundaries of our *present* epistemic cognitive inventory. (Or: from a much narrower one dating back 2500+ years or any time in between).

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: RE: ASSA and Many-Worlds
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that I do not agree with is what seems to me to be a common 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;holding regarding observer moments [by this I mean discrete states of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;universes [which are a sub set of possible &quot;objects&quot;]] is that they 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;are each so far assumed to have a set of properties that are to some 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;extent the same as other observer moments and to some extent 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;different from all other observer moments [to distinguish individual 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;moments] but nevertheless the properties of an individual observer 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;moment are fixed for that observer moment.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This to me is not logical since it is a selection and why that 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;selection?  Why not have some blend of variable properties and fixed 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;properties as a possibility?  This seems more in accord with a zero 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;information ensemble.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if it is also held that observer moments can not interact - 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that is also a selection.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I have proposed in other posts that there should be at least one 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;variable property through which universe states can interact.  The 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;idea is that all possible universe states have a uniform existence 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;property, but also can have an addition property that is a variable 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that one could call hyper existence through which they can 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;interact.  They interact by mutually altering each others hyper 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;existence property.  This variable property should not have just a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;binary set of values as a possibility but should also have many 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;discrete levels as a possibility - again to avoid selection.  In 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;other words a universe state could experience a non square pulse of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;hyper existence which could span many of the &quot;this particular state&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to other state interactions.  This would be like a &quot;wave&quot; of hyper 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;existence propagating through some succession of universe 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;states.  Non binary, non square pulses of propagating hyper existence 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;could be a basis for what is called &quot;consciousness&quot; - a &quot;flow&quot; of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;modulated awareness.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Given a random component to the underlying dynamic [which I have also 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;discussed ] some such wave propagations with non binary, non square 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;pulses of hyper existence would be through infinite strings of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;successive states that would all be &quot;life&quot; - and even beyond that - 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SAS&quot; friendly.
