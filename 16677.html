<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I insist on this well before Chalmers. We are agreeing on this.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then you associate consciousness with the experience of information.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is what I told you. I can understand the relation between

<br />Information.  Information content.  Hmmmmmmmm.  Well, I'm not entirely
<br />
sure what you're saying here.  Maybe I don't have a problem with this,
<br />
but maybe I do.  Maybe we're really saying the same thing here, but
<br />
maybe we're not.  Hmmmmm.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Note that I don't have Bruno's fear of white rabbits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then you disagree with all reader of David Lewis, including David
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lewis himself who recognizes this inflation of to many realities as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weakness of its modal realism. My point is that the comp constraints
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads to a solution of that problem, indeed a solution close to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum Everett solution. But the existence of white rabbits, and thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the correctness of comp remains to be tested.
</em><br />
<br />True, Lewis apparently saw it as a cost, BUT not so high a cost as to
<br />
abandon modal realism.  I don't even see it as a high cost, I see it
<br />
as a logical consequence.  Again, it's easy to imagine a computer
<br />
simulation/virtual reality in which a conscious observer would see
<br />
disembodied talking heads and flying pigs.  So it certainly seems
<br />
possible for a conscious being to be in a state of observing an
<br />
unattached talking head.
<br />
<br />Given that it's possible, why wouldn't it be actual?
<br />
<br />The only reason to think that it wouldn't be actual is that our
<br />
external objectively existing physical universe doesn't have physical
<br />
laws that can lead easily to the existance of such talking heads to be
<br />
observed.  But once you've abandoned the external universe and
<br />
embraced platonism, then where does the constraint against observing
<br />
talking heads come from?
<br />
<br />Assuming platonism, I can explain why &quot;I&quot; don't see talking heads:
<br />
because every possible Kelly is realized, and that includes a Kelly
<br />
who doesn't observe disembodied talking heads and who doesn't know
<br />
anyone who has ever seen such a head.
<br />
<br />So given that my observations aren't in conflict with my theory, I
<br />
don't see a problem.  The fact that nothing that I could observe would
<br />
ever conflict with my theory is also not particularly troubling to me
<br />
because I didn't arrive at my theory as means of explaining any
<br />
particular observed fact about the external universe.
<br />
<br />My theory isn't intended to explain the contingent details of what I
<br />
observe.  It's intended to explain the fact THAT I subjectively
<br />
observe anything at all.
<br />
<br />Given that it seems theoretically possible to create a computer
<br />
simulation that would manifest any imaginable conscious being
<br />
observing any imaginable &quot;world&quot;, including schizophrenic beings
<br />
observing psychodelic realities, I don't see why you are trying to
<br />
constrain the platonic realities that can be experienced to those that
<br />
are extremely similar to ours.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is just a question of testing a theory. You seem to say something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like &quot;if the theory predict that water under fire will typically boil,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that experience does not confirm that typicality (water froze
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regularly) then it means we are just very unlucky&quot;. But then all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories are correct.
</em><br />
<br />I say there is no water.  There is just our subjective experience of
<br />
observing water.  Trying to constrain a Platonic theory of
<br />
consciousness so that it matches a particular observed physical
<br />
reality seems like a mistake to me.
<br />
<br />Is there a limit to what we could experience in a computer simulated
<br />
reality?  If not, why would there be a limit to what we could
<br />
experience in Platonia?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The double-aspect principle stems from the observation that there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; direct isomorphism between certain physically embodied information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; spaces and certain phenomenal (or experiential) information spaces.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This can be shown false in Quantum theory without collapse, and more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; easily with the comp assumption.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No problem if you tell me that you reject both Everett and comp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chalmers seems in some place to accept both Everett and comp, indeed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He explains to me that he stops at step 3. He believes that after a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplication you feel to be simultaneously at the both place, even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assuming comp. I think and can argue that this is non sense. Nobody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defends this on the list. Are you defending an idea like that?
</em><br />
<br />I included the Chalmers quote because I think it provides a good image
<br />
of how abstract information seems to supervene on physical systems.
<br />
BUT by quoting the passage I'm not saying that I think that this
<br />
appearance of supervenience is the source of consciousness.  I still
<br />
buy into the putnam mapping view that there is no 1-to-1 mapping from
<br />
information or computation to any physical system, which of course
<br />
makes physicalism untenable as an explanation for consciousness.
<br />
<br />As for Everettian MWI, I don't think that quantum mechanics has
<br />
anything to do with conscious experience.  The fact that we see a
<br />
world which is apparently quantum mechanical in nature is a
<br />
coincidence.  A fluke.  In keeping with an unconstrained platonic
<br />
theory of consciousness, I would expect that there are other conscious
<br />
observers who experience other very different worlds where they make
<br />
observations that are not consistent with quantum mechanics.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps. I don't see the relevance. It is quite coherent with comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that some form of meaning can be approached in this or similar ways.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming comp, what can be considered as lacking is the self-reference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the universal machine involved in the attribution of meaning.
</em><br />
<br />I included the LSA discussion because I think it gives a good image of
<br />
how I see information being structured in a platonic sense, as
<br />
relationships between symbols, and also because it said some
<br />
interesting things about the symbol grounding problem.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; With comp, those other &quot;sensory modalities&quot; are coded before being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processed by the brain, or the universal machine under consideration.
</em><br />
<br />I agree, other sensory modalities are just more ungrounded tokenized
<br />
information that is included in the web of relationships which
<br />
ultimately, when consciously experienced &quot;from the inside&quot;, provides
<br />
meaning to the otherwise purely abstract &quot;ungrounded&quot; platonic
<br />
symbols.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kelly, the question is: do we disagree?
</em><br />
<br />I've wondered that too.  It could be that we only differ on a few
<br />
relatively minor points.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I criticize your statement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;consciousness = information&quot; for vagueness, but only BECAUSE you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oppose it to the computationalist hypothesis,
</em><br />
<br />I don't deny that there are computational/arithmetical descriptions of
<br />
how instances of consciousness can be related.  We agree on that.  I
<br />
just question what role, OTHER than describing the possible
<br />
relationships between sets of information, that computation plays.
<br />
Given that many algorithms can produce the same output from the same
<br />
input, I am inclined to say that it's the output that matters for
<br />
consciousness, not the algorithm.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that connections between instances of consciousness are
<br />
implied, but that there's nothing &quot;real&quot; actually binding these
<br />
instances together other than the subjective feelings of continuity
<br />
arising from the memory each instant has of previous instances.  But
<br />
&quot;memory&quot; would seem to be a informational/data related concept I'd
<br />
think, not an algorithmic one.
<br />
<br />If an algorithm results in the overwriting or erasure of memory, then
<br />
there is no longer the flow of conscious experience.  The algorithm
<br />
doesn't provide that &quot;subjective&quot; connection between instances of
<br />
consciousness.  The information stored in memory does.
