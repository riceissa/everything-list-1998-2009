<br />Greetings, John. Over the decades I've waffled a lot on that
<br />
very question. I currently do not believe that any type of
<br />
gravity force carrier exists, and it is an attempt to
<br />
explain the (seemingly verified by observation of supernova)
<br />
accelerating expansion of the universe that tilts me in that
<br />
direction.
<br />
<br />But I do believe in the existence of virtual particles, and
<br />
I further believe that our entire universe is a rather
<br />
improbable but possible collection of virtual particles.
<br />
Actually, I think there might be 2 entirely different
<br />
classes of virtual particles. One type is seen as
<br />
particle/anti-particle pairs. The other type has no anti-
<br />
particle pair, and the first type of virtual particles along
<br />
with all the matter in our universe is composed of it. I
<br />
think of this second type of virtual particles to be a
<br />
localized (meaning the spheroid and non infinite but
<br />
expanding boundaries of our entire universe) energy
<br />
fluxation against a truly infinite area that is on the
<br />
average composed of 100% nothingness. That fluxation I think
<br />
of as being something not at all related to nothingness, I
<br />
think of it as being completely separate and not sharing any
<br />
properties of nothingness. Nonetheless, I think of the
<br />
fluxation as being exactly that - a fluxation that seeks to
<br />
ultimately return a localized area of (on the average) 100%
<br />
nothingness back to its average energy density of exactly
<br />
zero. I think that gravity is that `seeking' phenomenon, the
<br />
universal `desire' to return to an equilibrium condition of
<br />
zero energy.
<br />
<br />Through some more convoluted thinking, I think of space/time
<br />
and matter/energy as being `universally localized'
<br />
expressions of that `seeking' phenomenon, i.e. what is
<br />
measurable within the spheroid volume that we call our
<br />
universe. I also think that the `seeking' phenomenon, not
<br />
being particle based, is a true analog phenomenon and thus
<br />
not describable by QM; it is a separate thing expressed as
<br />
space/time coexisting with an ultimately temporary condition
<br />
known as matter/energy. My thoughts are that space/time and
<br />
matter/energy, these 2 things, are not at all related to
<br />
each other and that they are what we can `locally' measure.
<br />
For lack of a better word, I've thought of that `seeking'
<br />
phenomenon as a sort of tension that is not a force nor is
<br />
it energy. Weirdly, I think that our universe exists and is
<br />
only measurable within its own framework against something
<br />
that we call space/time, but that on the average and in the
<br />
context of infinity it never really existed, because an
<br />
equilibrium of 100% nothingness exists on the average. That
<br />
thought is quite difficult to fully explain.
<br />
<br />And I've certainly been wrong before!
<br />
<br />But the thought of virtual particles appearing and
<br />
disappearing (and so on the average never having existed)
<br />
affecting upon our universe is also quite difficult to fully
<br />
explain. Perhaps one must conceptualize outside the boundary
<br />
of our universe in order to explain our universe.
<br />
