I previously tried cutting and pasting the text instead of giving a
<br />
link no one apparently went to before replying because the formatting
<br />
was off.  So I will do that because it seems that would be prudent.  I
<br />
figured it out.  (I'm not computer guru....)

[This post is in sci.logic because of the employment of model
<br />
<br />theory
<br />
and discussion of abstract math structures by the author and
<br />
<br />for other
<br />
reasons which may come up during the discussion.]
<br />
Here is a link to the article:
<br />
<a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0704/0704.0646v2.pdf">http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0704/0704.0646v2.pdf</a>
<br />
Abstract:
<br />
I explore physics implications of the External Reality
<br />
<br />Hypothesis
<br />
(ERH) that there exists an
<br />
external physical reality completely independent of us humans.
<br />
<br />I argue
<br />
that with a sufficiently
<br />
broad definition of mathematics, it implies the Mathematical
<br />
<br />Universe
<br />
Hypothesis (MUH) that our
<br />
physical world is an abstract mathematical structure. I
<br />
<br />discuss
<br />
various implications of the ERH
<br />
and MUH, ranging from standard physics topics like symmetries,
<br />
<br /><br />irreducible representations, units,
<br />
free parameters, randomness and initial conditions to broader
<br />
<br />issues
<br />
like consciousness, parallel
<br />
universes and G&quot;odel incompleteness. I hypothesize that only
<br />
computable and decidable (in G&quot;odel's
<br />
sense) structures exist, which alleviates the cosmological
<br />
<br />measure
<br />
problem and may help explain why
<br />
our physical laws appear so simple. I also comment on the
<br />
<br />intimate
<br />
relation between mathematical
<br />
structures, computations, simulations and physical systems.
<br />
Quote from Intro:
<br />
The idea that our universe is in some sense mathematical
<br />
goes back at least to the Pythagoreans, and has been
<br />
extensively discussed in the literature (see, e.g., [2-25]).
<br />
Galileo Galilei stated that the Universe is a grand book
<br />
written in the language of mathematics, and Wigner reflected
<br />
on the &quot;unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics
<br />
in the natural sciences&quot; [3]. In this essay, I will push this
<br />
idea to its extreme and argue that our universe is mathematics
<br />
<br /><br />in a well-defined sense.

The article linked to above is regarded by its author as a
<br />
<br />sequel to
<br />
this:
<br />
<a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/toe.pdf">http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/toe.pdf</a>
<br />
Abstract: (sorry, some characters didn't enjoy being c&amp;p'ed)
<br />
We discuss some physical consequences of what might be
<br />
called \the ultimate ensemble theory&quot;, where not only worlds
<br />
corresponding to say di erent sets of initial data or di erent
<br />
<br /><br />physical constants are considered equally real, but also
<br />
<br />worlds
<br />
ruled by altogether di erent equations. The only postulate
<br />
in this theory is that all structures that exist
<br />
<br />mathematically
<br />
exist also physically, by which we mean that in those
<br />
complex enough to contain self-aware substructures (SASs),
<br />
these SASs will subjectively perceive themselves as existing
<br />
<br />in
<br />
a physically \real&quot; world. We  nd that it is far from clear
<br />
<br />that
<br />
this simple theory, which has no free parameters whatsoever,
<br />
is observationally ruled out. The predictions of the theory
<br />
take the form of probability distributions for the outcome of
<br />
experiments, which makes it testable. In addition, it may be
<br />
possible to rule it out by comparing its a priori predictions
<br />
for the observable attributes of nature (the particle masses,
<br />
the dimensionality of spacetime, etc.) with what is observed.
<br />
Quote:
<br />
In other words, some subset of all mathematical structures
<br />
(see Figure 1 for examples) is endowed with an
<br />
elusive quality that we call physical existence, or PE for
<br />
brevity. Specifying this subset thus speci es a category
<br />
1 TOE. Since there are three disjoint possibilities (none,
<br />
some or all mathematical structures have PE), we obtain
<br />
the following classi cation scheme:
<br />
1. The physical world is completely mathematical.
<br />
(a) Everything that exists mathematically exists
<br />
physically.
<br />
(b) Some things that exist mathematically exist
<br />
physically, others do not.
<br />
(c) Nothing that exists mathematically exists
<br />
physically.
<br />
2. The physical world is not completely mathematical.
<br />
The beliefs of most physicists probably fall into categories
<br />
2 (for instance on religious grounds) and 1b. Category
<br />
2 TOEs are somewhat of a resignation in the sense of
<br />
giving up physical predictive power, and will not be further
<br />
discussed here. The obviously ruled out category
<br />
1c TOE was only included for completeness. TOEs in
<br />
the popular category 1b are vulnerable to the criticism
<br />
(made e.g. by Wheeler [6], Nozick [7] and Weinberg [8])
<br />
that they leave an important question unanswered: why
<br />
is that particular subset endowed with PE, not another?
<br />
...
<br />
In this paper, we propose that category 1a is the correct
<br />
one.
<br />
[End quote]
<br />
I'm also interested in discussing what SAS'es might there be.
<br />
<br />Perhaps
<br />
nail down axioms and/or defining traits of SAS'es.  This next
<br />
<br />link
<br />
might be a diversion, but it is a starting point for the
<br />
<br />discussion of
<br />
formalizing awareness:
<br />
<a href="http://cs.wwc.edu/~aabyan/Colloquia/Aware/aware2.html">http://cs.wwc.edu/~aabyan/Colloquia/Aware/aware2.html</a>
<br />
I suppose the direction I'd +like+ this discussion to go is
<br />
investigation of this material as conjecture, what these
<br />
<br />conjectures
<br />
would entail (physically, mathematically, and
<br />
<br />philosophically), etc., +
<br />
+rather than debate as to the validity of these conjectures.++
<br />
It seems to me that, at worst, these conjectures form an
<br />
<br />internally
<br />
consistent theory, not unlike Cantor's theory of the infinite;
<br />
<br /><br />whether  or not these conjectures are correct in a physics
<br />
<br />sense as
<br />
being an accurate characterization of &quot;reality,&quot; I would like
<br />
<br />to view
<br />
these conjectures/hypotheses as, in this discussion at
<br />
<br />sci.logic, at
<br />
worst, an internally consistent framework, worthy enough of
<br />
investigation because of the consistency, regardless of
<br />
<br />physical
<br />
correctness.
<br />
Obviously, if these conjectures/hypotheses are correct in a
<br />
<br />physics
<br />
sense, then the investigation is even more justified when
<br />
<br />compared to
<br />
mathematical and/or philosophical justification for the
<br />
<br />investigation.

<br />
section VII of the very first article linked to in the
<br />
<br />previous post,
<br />
&quot;assuming&quot; that non-computability of consciousness implies the

Non-Computability of Consciousness

Abstract:
<br />
With the great success in simulating many intelligent
<br />
<br />behaviors using
<br />
computing devices, there has been an ongoing debate whether
<br />
<br />all
<br />
conscious
<br />
activities are computational processes. In this paper, the
<br />
<br />answer to
<br />
this
<br />
question is shown to be no. A certain phenomenon of
<br />
<br />consciousness is
<br />
demonstrated to be fully represented as a computational
<br />
<br />process using
<br />
a
<br />
quantum computer. Based on the computability criterion
<br />
<br />discussed with
<br />
Turing machines, the model constructed is shown to necessarily
<br />
<br />involve
<br />
a
<br />
non-computable element. The concept that this is solely a
<br />
<br />quantum
<br />
effect
<br />
and does not work for a classical case is also discussed.

I recently came across an apparent rejoinder (intentional or
<br />
<br />not, I
<br />
don't know) by Tegmark on the subject of the quantum nature of
<br />
<br />brain
<br />
function.
<br />
<a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/brain.html">http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/brain.html</a>
<br />
Tegmark makes a case for brain function being modeled
<br />
<br />adequately with
<br />
classical theoretical means (possibly such as Turing machines)
<br />
<br />and
<br />
that brains do not function like quantum computers.
<br />
<br />(Essentially the
<br />
main factor is that the brain is not nearly at absolute zero
<br />
<br />degrees,
<br />
or otherwise in an environment in which superposition type
<br />
<br />effects
<br />
that consciousness apparently mimics well enough to keep many
<br />
<br />on the
<br />
fence, is more common than Earthly temperatures where our
<br />
<br />brains
<br />
normally reside.)
<br />
If Tegmark does prove his point, while others in his community
<br />
<br />remain
<br />
skeptical that brain function is +not+ an example of a quantum
<br />
<br /><br />computer, then the paper I cited about the non-computability
<br />
<br />of
<br />
consciousness does not invalidate Tegmark's CUH, mentioned in
<br />
<br />section
<br />
VII of the first link in the first post.  The
<br />
<br />non-computability of
<br />
consciousness would seem to invalidate Tegmark's CUH
<br />
<br />(Computable
<br />
Universe Hypothesis) in that the universe, by even a narrow
<br />
<br />definition
<br />
of universe, must contain consciousness, and, I presume, non-
<br />
computability of consciousness would imply the CUH is false.
<br />
<br />That is,
<br />
unless consciousness can have non-computable aspects that when
<br />
<br /><br />&quot;glued&quot; (ultraproduct or some other method of &quot;gluing&quot;???)
<br />
<br />together
<br />
throughout the universe, somehow (I know this is vague) the
<br />
<br />non-
<br />
computable aspects of various parts of the universe all
<br />
<br />balance out to
<br />
a computable universe.  Hmm...things to think about...  Maybe
<br />
<br />the CUH
<br />
is true and brains work like quantum computers, somehow...?
<br />
Anyway, Tegmark would be lending credence to his point by
<br />
<br />invalidating
<br />
the proof of non-computability of consciousness for that
<br />
<br />relies on the
<br />
&quot;presumption&quot; that consciousness is inherently a quantum
<br />
<br />process;
<br />
obviously if their critical &quot;presumption&quot; is wrong, then their
<br />
<br /><br />conclusion (consciousness not being computable) isn't
<br />
<br />necessarily so.
<br />
I think it is worth splitting hairs here about the difference
<br />
<br />between
<br />
consciousness and brain function but as of yet am aware of
<br />
<br />very little
<br />
of the +formal+ theory behind either of these notions,
<br />
philosophically, psychologically, or cognitive-scientifically.
<br />
I am compiling a list of other discussion points.
<br />
First on this list of discussion points, I will make a
<br />
<br />connection to
<br />
abstract fuzzy logic and the Level IV multiverse situation.
<br />
<br />If you
<br />
haven't read these fascinating articles yet, Level IV's brief
<br />
definition is:
<br />
Other mathematical structures give different +fundamental+
<br />
<br />equations
<br />
of physics.
<br />
In the MUH article (first link, first post), appendix A
<br />
<br />defines what
<br />
Tegmark means by a mathematical structure.
<br />
[Compilation Process] I'm thinking of whether or not the
<br />
<br />aggregate of
<br />
all MS's can be &quot;glued&quot; together somehow (doubtfully by a
<br />
<br />simple
<br />
union) in order to get the MS of all MS's.
<br />
This brings me to the connection to abstract fuzzy logic and
<br />
<br />my
<br />
personal quest to continue my education in the area of Fuzzy
<br />
<br />Logic.
<br />
(Apparently, no one in the US works specifically in the area I
<br />
<br />want to
<br />
work in but there are many in Europe at institutions that
<br />
<br />award
<br />
Phds.)  It also gratifies me, on a personal note, to think
<br />
<br />that my
<br />
research, if carried out, might settle some question about
<br />
<br />whether or
<br />
not the [Compilation Process]  is at all possible in any
<br />
<br />&quot;reasonable&quot;
<br />
sense whatsoever.  It would be nice to know either way, rather
<br />
<br />than a
<br />
&quot;this smells like Russell's Paradox, so let's not try it&quot; sort
<br />
<br />of
<br />
deal.
<br />
My research would focus on somewhat recent papers on fuzzy
<br />
<br />logic
<br />
pertaining to involving FL at the axiomatic level to create
<br />
generalizations and anti-generalizations of ZFC set theory, or
<br />
<br />other
<br />
suitably modified set theory (eg, remove Foundation Axiom
<br />
<br />immediately
<br />
for reasons that would be clear later).
<br />
According to the conclusion of that paper, linked to below, an
<br />
<br />open
<br />
problem is figuring out how other axioms could be, should be,
<br />
shouldn't be, and can't be consistently added to the list of
<br />
<br />axioms
<br />
they present in a FL-sense.
<br />

<br /><a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/22478/http:zSzzSzw">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/22478/http:zSzzSzw</a>
<br />
<br />ww.cs.c...
<br />
In an effort to push question (2) in a particular direction,
<br />
<br />let me
<br />
attempt to formulate my question/problem.  Start with the
<br />
<br />bare-bones
<br />
fuzzy set theory presented in [[1]].  Let the truth set be
<br />
<br />denoted D.
<br />
Consider the following axioms:
<br />
[[U.Strong]]  there is a y such that for all x, the truth
<br />
<br />degree of
<br />
the formula &quot;x is in y&quot; is the maximal (in the sense
<br />
<br />appropriate to
<br />
the type of algebraic structure D has, such as an MV-algebra,
<br />
<br />but
<br />
definitely not Boolean as we know Russell's Paradox +will+
<br />
<br />rear its
<br />
ugly head in the Boolean case) element in D.
<br />
In other words, if the maximal element in D is equipped with
<br />
<br />the
<br />
baggage &quot;true&quot;, U.S. says there is a set y for which all sets
<br />
<br />x are
<br />
elements of y.  This is one reason to drop the Foundation
<br />
<br />Axiom
<br />
immediately, as such a y is obviously not well-founded.  This
<br />
<br />could be
<br />
called a (strong) universal set, with appropriate adjectives
<br />
<br />that
<br />
reference D and the syntactical entailment axioms used, the
<br />
<br />underlying
<br />
language, etc...
<br />
[[U.Weak]]  there is a y such that for all x, the truth degree
<br />
<br />of the
<br />
formula &quot;x is in y&quot; is a designated element of D.
<br />
In words, I view the designated, anti-designated, and
<br />
<br />non-designated
<br />
partitions of D as shades of gray of truth.  Designated means
<br />
<br />more
<br />
light than not, where light = truth in this analogy,
<br />
<br />anti-designated
<br />
means more dark than not, and non-designated means more gray
<br />
<br />than
<br />
not.  So to say &quot; 'x is in y' is a designated truth value&quot;
<br />
<br />would mean
<br />
something like, &quot;it's essentially true that y is a universal
<br />
<br />set.&quot;
<br />
One could say that y would be a weak universal set and it is
<br />
<br />doubtful
<br />
that such a y need be unique, unlike a strong universal set
<br />
<br />is.
<br />
That sets (pun intended) up the problem (below) that I hope to
<br />
<br /><br />formalize into the beginnings of a PhD thesis in the area of
<br />
<br />FL
<br />
someday.
<br />
Let R be some type of unary predicate.
<br />
Recall that D is the set of truth degrees, with some algebraic
<br />
<br />(eg,
<br />
MV) structure associated with it.
<br />
Consider the statement below:
<br />
[[Statement]] A fuzzy set theory, starting with the one in
<br />
<br />[[1]],
<br />
without Foundation, plus either the strong or weak universal
<br />
<br />set
<br />
axiom, is consistent relative to ZFC (the best situation one
<br />
<br />can hope
<br />
for) if and only if R(D).
<br />
The question: Determine for what R is the above statement
<br />
<br />true, if
<br />
any, or prove that for all R, the above statement is false.
<br />
Obviously, I want, at worst, an existence proof on R, that
<br />
<br />there are
<br />
some properties D could possess that enables a fuzzy universal
<br />
<br />set
<br />
theory that is consistent relative to ZFC.
<br />
Also, I strongly hope that the statement is not false for all
<br />
<br />R, that
<br />
there aren't any exotic D's or structures they could be
<br />
<br />equipped with,
<br />
to make a universal set theory as consistent as ZFC.  Clearly,
<br />
<br />if D =
<br />
{0,1} then the set of all R's for which [[Statement]] is true
<br />
<br />is empty
<br />
(bad but expected and well known).  In the binary logic case,
<br />
Russell's Theorem proves that the set of all R's for which
<br />
[[Statement]] is true is empty.  No properties on D make the
<br />
<br />universal
<br />
set a possibility in classical logic (except possibly the work
<br />
<br />of the
<br />
sort Quinne did with the New Foundations although, in NF,
<br />
<br />Choice must
<br />
be dropped, in some sense, which is highly disadvantageous to
<br />
<br />anyone
<br />
who enjoys using Zorn's Lemma).
<br />
(I posed this to someone known in the area of FL and he
<br />
<br />encouraged me
<br />
to come to Europe (as apparently no one does this type of work
<br />
<br />in FL
<br />
in the U.S.) to formally work this into a PhD thesis.)
<br />
Now, ultimately, the connection to the CUH is that if there is
<br />
<br />an
<br />
ultimate set of +some kind+, like a strong universal set, then
<br />
<br />perhaps
<br />
that could provide a link to the MS of all MS's, ie, the
<br />
<br />mathematical
<br />
structure of all mathematical structures, without leading to
<br />
<br />deals
<br />
like, &quot;this smells like Russell's dirty laundry, so let's not
<br />
<br />go
<br />
there.&quot;
<br />
&lt;punchline tag&gt;
<br />
Either that or provide an interesting, to say the least, MS (a
<br />
<br />fuzzy
<br />
and strong universal set theory) to investigate in the context
<br />
<br />of the
<br />
MUH, as this strong universal fuzzy set may, in fact, be a
<br />
<br />candidate
<br />
for what the universe literally is in a physical sense,
<br />
<br />assuming the
<br />
MUH, of course.
<br />
&lt;/punchline tag&gt;
<br />
If I could make all of that work, I would be a very happy man.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Even
<br />
if I could be proved wrong, at least then I can rest on this
<br />
<br />issue in
<br />
particular.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Abstract:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; With the great success in simulating many intelligent
</em><br />
<br />behaviors using
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computing devices, there has been an ongoing debate
</em><br />
<br />whether all
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; activities are computational processes. In this paper, the
</em><br />
<br />answer to
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; question is shown to be no. A certain phenomenon of
</em><br />
<br />consciousness is
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; demonstrated to be fully represented as a computational
</em><br />
<br />process using
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; quantum computer. Based on the computability criterion
</em><br />
<br />discussed with
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Turing machines, the model constructed is shown to
</em><br />
<br />necessarily involve
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; non-computable element. The concept that this is solely a
</em><br />
<br />quantum
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; effect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and does not work for a classical case is also discussed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I recently came across an apparent rejoinder (intentional or
</em><br />
<br />not, I
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't know) by Tegmark on the subject of the quantum nature
</em><br />
<br />of brain
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function.<a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/brain.html">http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/brain.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tegmark makes a case for brain function being modeled
</em><br />
<br />adequately with
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classical theoretical means (possibly such as Turing
</em><br />
<br />machines) and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that brains do not function like quantum computers.
</em><br />
<br />(Essentially the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; main factor is that the brain is not nearly at absolute zero
</em><br />
<br />degrees,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or otherwise in an environment in which superposition type
</em><br />
<br />effects
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that consciousness apparently mimics well enough to keep
</em><br />
<br />many on the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fence, is more common than Earthly temperatures where our
</em><br />
<br />brains
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normally reside.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If Tegmark does prove his point, while others in his
</em><br />
<br />community remain
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; skeptical that brain function is +not+ an example of a
</em><br />
<br />quantum
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer, then the paper I cited about the non-computability
</em><br />
<br />of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness does not invalidate Tegmark's CUH, mentioned
</em><br />
<br />in section
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; VII of the first link in the first post.  The
</em><br />
<br />non-computability of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness would seem to invalidate Tegmark's CUH
</em><br />
<br />(Computable
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Universe Hypothesis) in that the universe, by even a narrow
</em><br />
<br />definition
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of universe, must contain consciousness, and, I presume,
</em><br />
<br />non-
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computability of consciousness would imply the CUH is false.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;That is,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless consciousness can have non-computable aspects that
</em><br />
<br />when
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;glued&quot; (ultraproduct or some other method of &quot;gluing&quot;???)
</em><br />
<br />together
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; throughout the universe, somehow (I know this is vague) the
</em><br />
<br />non-
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable aspects of various parts of the universe all
</em><br />
<br />balance out to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a computable universe.  Hmm...things to think about...
</em><br />
<br />Maybe the CUH
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, Tegmark would be lending credence to his point by

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formula &quot;x is in y&quot; is a designated element of D.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In words, I view the designated, anti-designated, and
</em><br />
<br />non-designated
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; partitions of D as shades of gray of truth.  Designated
</em><br />
<br />means more
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; light than not, where light = truth in this analogy,
</em><br />
<br />anti-designated
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means more dark than not, and non-designated means more gray
</em><br />
<br />than
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not.  So to say &quot; 'x is in y' is a designated truth value&quot;
</em><br />
<br />would mean
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something like, &quot;it's essentially true that y is a universal
</em><br />
<br />set.&quot;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One could say that y would be a weak universal set and it is
</em><br />
<br />doubtful
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that such a y need be unique, unlike a strong universal set
</em><br />
<br />is.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That sets (pun intended) up the problem (below) that I hope
</em><br />
<br />to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formalize into the beginnings of a PhD thesis in the area of
</em><br />
<br />FL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someday.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let R be some type of unary predicate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Recall that D is the set of truth degrees, with some
</em><br />
<br />algebraic (eg,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MV) structure associated with it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consider the statement below:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [[Statement]] A fuzzy set theory, starting with the one in
</em><br />
<br />[[1]],
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without Foundation, plus either the strong or weak universal
</em><br />
<br />set
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axiom, is consistent relative to ZFC (the best situation one
</em><br />
<br />can hope
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for) if and only if R(D).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question: Determine for what R is the above statement
</em><br />
<br />true, if
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any, or prove that for all R, the above statement is false.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously, I want, at worst, an existence proof on R, that
</em><br />
<br />there are
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some properties D could possess that enables a fuzzy
</em><br />
<br />universal set
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory that is consistent relative to ZFC.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, I strongly hope that the statement is not false for
</em><br />
<br />all R, that
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there aren't any exotic D's or structures they could be
</em><br />
<br />equipped with,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to make a universal set theory as consistent as ZFC.
</em><br />
<br />Clearly, if D =
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; {0,1} then the set of all R's for which [[Statement]] is
</em><br />
<br />true is empty
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (bad but expected and well known).  In the binary logic
</em><br />
<br />case,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Russell's Theorem proves that the set of all R's for which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [[Statement]] is true is empty.  No properties on D make the
</em><br />
<br />universal
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set a possibility in classical logic (except possibly the
</em><br />
<br />work of the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort Quinne did with the New Foundations although, in NF,
</em><br />
<br />Choice must
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be dropped, in some sense, which is highly disadvantageous
</em><br />
<br />to anyone
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who enjoys using Zorn's Lemma).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I posed this to someone known in the area of FL and he
</em><br />
<br />encouraged me
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to come to Europe (as apparently no one does this type of
</em><br />
<br />work in FL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the U.S.) to formally work this into a PhD thesis.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, ultimately, the connection to the CUH is that if there
</em><br />
<br />is an
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ultimate set of +some kind+, like a strong universal set,
</em><br />
<br />then perhaps
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that could provide a link to the MS of all MS's, ie, the
</em><br />
<br />mathematical
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure of all mathematical structures, without leading to
</em><br />
<br />deals
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like, &quot;this smells like Russell's dirty laundry, so let's
</em><br />
<br />not go
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;punchline tag&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Either that or provide an interesting, to say the least, MS
</em><br />
<br />(a fuzzy
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and strong universal set theory) to investigate in the
</em><br />
<br />context of the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MUH, as this strong universal fuzzy set may, in fact, be a
</em><br />
<br />candidate
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for what the universe literally is in a physical sense,
</em><br />
<br />assuming the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MUH, of course.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;/punchline tag&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I could make all of that work, I would be a very happy
</em><br />
<br />man.  Even
<br />

A paradox???
<br />
<a href="http://www.torrentreactor.net/torrents/1588942/Parallel-Worlds">http://www.torrentreactor.net/torrents/1588942/Parallel-Worlds</a>
<br />
<br />-Parall...
<br />
There is one part when Tegmark is speaking, around the 27-30
<br />
<br />minute
<br />
mark or so, that they give a visual clue about parallel
<br />
<br />universes that
<br />
was perhaps more interesting than the director realized,
<br />
<br />unless the
<br />
director's assistant was Tegmark himself.
<br />
When they showed two universes splitting, in one parallel, the
<br />
<br /><br />Copenhagen interpretation is correct...and in the other, the
<br />
<br />Many
<br />
Worlds interpretation is correct.
<br />
There is a QM formula with [[[EXCEPT DURING OBSERVATION]]] in
<br />
<br />one half
<br />
of the screen
<br />
and
<br />
in the other half of the screen, [[[EXCEPT DURING
<br />
<br />OBSERVATION]]] is +
<br />
+crossed out++ by Tegmark.
<br />
Interestingly, part of Tegmark's work says just that: not only
<br />
<br />do
<br />
physical things split into parallels, but the laws of physics
<br />
themselves are different in different universes.
<br />
+++Therefore, The Copenhagen view is correct and the Many
<br />
<br />Worlds
<br />
interpretation is correct.+++
<br />
But which is correct in THIS universe?
<br />
Or, maybe, that is a loaded question.  More details on why
<br />
<br />that might
<br />
be a loaded question has to do with my crew's speculation
<br />
<br />about there
<br />
not just being parallel universes but also &quot;overlaying&quot; (or
<br />
overlapping) of parallels, where the aggregate of parallels
<br />
<br />(aka, the
<br />
universe) are (is) very much like the water system on earth:
<br />
<br />separate
<br />
at times and other times, quite combined and overlaid upon one
<br />
<br /><br />another.  Indeed, if one &quot;frog&quot; is floating on the river, the
<br />
<br />&quot;bird&quot;
<br />
sees the &quot;frog&quot; actually pass from the North Pole somehow
<br />
<br />through down
<br />
to the Nile, passing thousands of different waterways in
<br />
<br />between, and
<br />
the &quot;frog&quot; just thinks he has been in one body of water all
<br />
<br />along,
<br />
which couldn't have been more wrong, at least, as far as the
<br />
<br />&quot;bird&quot;
<br />
sees things.
<br />
Then again, is there a bird's &quot;bird?&quot;
<br />
And a bird's bird's bird?
<br />
And a bird's bird's bird's bird?
<br />
And do frogs have pets?
<br />
Do those pets have pets?
<br />
Do those pets have pets that have pets?
<br />
Sound familiar?  To me it sounds like a self-similar fractal
<br />
<br />and the
<br />
way the universe would look if you started at a string and
<br />
<br />zoomed out
<br />
to view the universe from the boundary of the universe, which
<br />
<br />might
<br />
not &quot;exist&quot;, unless the boundary of the universe exists
<br />
mathematically, of course!  I suppose one might want to push
<br />
<br />the
<br />
envelope of mathematics to determine what the boundary of the
<br />
<br />universe
<br />
is, to mightily abuse language.
<br />
Well, assuming the MUH, this overlaying of parallels +must+ be
<br />
<br />the
<br />
case due to the hierarchical nature of mathematics.  Set
<br />
<br />theory is on
<br />
a +somewhat+ lower echelon in the hierarchy than Category
<br />
<br />Theory,
<br />
which is, on a lower echelon than Logic which is, in turn, on
<br />
<br />a lower
<br />
echelon than Fuzzy Logic, a generalization of Logic.  Perhaps
<br />
<br />instead
<br />
of the ultimate set, I need to search for the ultimate math,
<br />
<br />but I
<br />
think Logic and Model Theory and/or Cat might be that, except
<br />
<br />Logic
<br />
does have its limitations, in some sense.

The only problem is that Aristotle's mutual exclusivity might
<br />
<br />not
<br />
actually be universal, to resolve this apparent paradox.  But
<br />
<br />even
<br />
within one parallel (mathematical structure?), ME (mutual
<br />
<br />exclusivity)
<br />
might be true in one region of space (ie, the context between
<br />
<br />and
<br />
containing mathematical structures), false in another, both
<br />
<br />true and
<br />
false in still another part of that parallel, and absolutely
<br />
<br />all
<br />
values of truth between true and false elsewhere in that
<br />
<br />parallel
<br />
universe.  It seems somewhat mind boggling when pondering
<br />
<br />that.
<br />
In our &quot;neck of the woods,&quot; I think ME is &quot;almost&quot; (sort of in
<br />
<br />a
<br />
Lesbegue measure sense) true.  In other words, locally to
<br />
<br />myself and
<br />
probably you as well (whatever that might mean), the
<br />
<br />pseudo-well-
<br />
formed-formula below has a ++designated++ truth value in some
<br />
<br />truth
<br />
set D:
<br />
&nbsp;'   for all wffs f, ( f &amp; not(f)   ||--&gt;    ^D)   '
<br />
where ^D is the minimal element in D, or an arbitrarily chosen
<br />
<br /><br />representative of the ones of equally least value, respective
<br />
<br />of the
<br />
order on D.  ^D is interpretable as the qualia FALSE.
<br />
In fewer words (in English):
<br />
&quot;locally,&quot;   D+( W(f)--&gt;( f &amp; not(f) ||--&gt; ^D) )
<br />
where D+(  ) means, &quot;the truth degree of what follows is
<br />
<br />designated,&quot;
<br />
and W(  ) means, &quot;what follows is a well formed formula,&quot; and
<br />
<br />||--&gt;
<br />
means there is a fuzzy logical sort of valuation function
<br />
<br />being
<br />
applied, and --&gt; is the standard (in a fuzzy logical sense, of
<br />
<br />course,
<br />
but the truth set of this symbol definitely need not also be
<br />
<br />D--too
<br />
bad tex is not available to my knowledge here, that would make
<br />
<br />this
<br />
notation less unappealing to the eye) conditional connective.
<br />
<br />(I
<br />
think all of this is formalizable.)
<br />
I think in our dreams (double entendre intended), ME is
<br />
<br />&quot;almost&quot;
<br />
false, ie, D-( W(f)--&gt;( f &amp; not(f) ||--&gt; ^D) ) where D-(  )
<br />
<br />means,
<br />
&quot;what follows has an anti-designated truth degree.&quot;
<br />
Perhaps that could be related to the true difference between
<br />
<br />conscious
<br />
and unconscious.
<br />
Conscious could mean something like
<br />
X( D+( W(f)--&gt;( f &amp; not(f) ||--&gt; ^D) ) )
<br />
and
<br />
unconscious could mean something like
<br />
X( D-( W(f)--&gt;( f &amp; not(f) ||--&gt; ^D) ) )
<br />
where X( ) means something like, &quot;in the context of the the
<br />
<br />parallel
<br />
network SAS labeled X is embedded or embeddable within, the
<br />
<br />following
<br />
is true.&quot;
