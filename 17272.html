<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, I think that's what I'm saying.  Causal explanations are not

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; really explanations, because you can never trace the causal chain back
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to it's ultimate source.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That's silly.  If my wife's car won't start and I explain that it's out of gas, that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; really an explanation even if I don't know why it's out of gas.  he operational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; definition of an explanation of an event is what you would do to effect or prevent that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; event.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Oh.  Is that what we're interested in here?  Operationally defined explanations?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I apologize.  I had not realized.  I thought we were discussing deeper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issues.  So sure, if you want to stick to &quot;operational explanations&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things are pretty straightforward.  Physics is indeed the language for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operational explanations and perhaps we should confine ourselves to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussions of the latest developments in physics.  I propose a name
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change, from the &quot;Everything List&quot; to &quot;Everything Physics-related
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; List&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Though, actually, I thought that we were discussing the *ultimate*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; underlying nature of reality.  Not operational explanations that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provide us with strategies for avoiding car problems in that reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, upon further reflection, I think I'm in the right list.  You,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; however, may not be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay, sarcasm over, though I think my point above is valid.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BUT, actually I do very much appreciate your response, as it forces me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to examine, clarify, and articulate my own thoughts.  Which is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole point of this exercise I think.  So, the only thing worse than a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; negative response is no response!  Ha!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In general there are multiple things you could do and hence multiple causes of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; an event.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are many ways the history of the world could have played out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differently that would have resulted in your wife's car not having an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empty gas tank (many of them quite gruesome) but if physicalism is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct then there's only ONE way the world DID play out...and that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the causal structure that led to your wife's situation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The image of a causal chain leading back to an ultimate link is misleading - it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more like causal chain mail that branches out as you trace it back.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I follow your meaning, but it just means that the chain is a directed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acyclic (presumably!) graph, that can be divided into layers, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each layer viewed as a link in the chain.  But there must be a base
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; layer, right?  An infinite past is a possibility too, I suppose, but I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't think that negates my argument, it just changes the wording a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bit.  But let's not go there just yet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But just because you can't trace it back to a single ur-cause doesn't nullify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; my advice to my wife to put gas in the tank.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay, two scenarios:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1)  Physicalism is true, you're in the real world, and your wife ran out of gas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2)  Physicalism is true, you're in a computer simulation of the real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world, and your virtual-wife ran out of virtual-gas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SO, in both scenarios, your operational approach to explanation is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; useful.  But it isn't meaningful in the context of what I take us to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be discussing:  the underlying nature of reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your operational explanations have SUBJECTIVE MEANING.  Not absolute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning.  If they had absolute meaning, then they wouldn't apply in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both scenario 01 and scenario 2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My point is that there IS NO absolute meaning.  And where there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning, there can be no explanation.  In an absolute sense, things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just are what they are.  Tautology.
</em><br />
<br />There seems to be a lot switching back and forth between cause and meaning and explanation 
<br />
as though were interchangable.  And even those have different modes, e.g. first cause, 
<br />
effective cause, proximate cause,...  Meaning=standing for something else.  Meaning=having 
<br />
inherent value (to someone).
<br />
<br />I agree that one can always ask &quot;Why?&quot; as children sometimes do; and the ultimate answer
<br />
is, &quot;Because I say so.&quot; So you may well say, &quot;Things are just what they are.&quot; but that
<br />
doesn't mean that we cannot have and explanation of QM and gravity and consciousness, and
<br />
after than an explanation of the explanation ad infinitum. So I guess I'm unclear on your
<br />
point. Are you advising that we give up all explanation and just chant &quot;It is what it is.&quot;
<br />
<br />Incidentally, there is a different form of explanation/cause which people schooled in
<br />
logic tend to reject at first sight, but which I think actually has merit. Bruno wrote it
<br />
once as: NUMBERS -&gt; &quot;MACHINE DREAMS&quot; -&gt; PHYSICAL -&gt; HUMANS -&gt; PHYSICS -&gt; NUMBERS
<br />
<br />Yes, I know it's circular. Thats the point.  But I think it can be a virtuous rather than 
<br />
a vicious circle, and the wider the circle the more virtuous.
<br />
