Bruno:
<br />
a beautiful position statement. Very sage and humane.
<br />
Thanks
<br />
John

<br />
PS: unfortunately the overwhelming majority of humankind is within some kind 
<br />
of religious belief system and this makes a very lucrative political stock 
<br />
to crooks (oops: politicians, as contrasted to 'statesmen). Some thousand 
<br />
thinking sould cannot change the fear-based mindset of 6 billion.   J

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suspect you can talk about God in this way when the subject of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atheism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comes up because you live in post-Enlightenment Europe.


</em><br />
It is a difficult subject, perhaps a bit out of topics or premature,
<br />
but I do not believe so much in the enlightenment in Europe. It has
<br />
been a very partial &quot;enlightenment&quot; ...




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But if you lived in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a certain large English-speaking country where a substantial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proportion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the population believe that God created Adam and Eve 6000 years ago and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the dinosaurs died out because they didn't fit on Noah's ark, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; keen to suggest anything that might be construed as supporting theism.


</em><br />
I live in one of the most catholic country in the world, with some
<br />
island of atheism, but both catholics and atheists believe agnosticism
<br />
(which is imo the best scientist methodology)  is a mental disease.
<br />
Actually atheists are even far more dogmatic than educated christians,
<br />
but, ok,  indeed few people here would take Adam and Eve for real
<br />
history.


<br />
But now, I do believe that if today so many people here and there
<br />
believe &quot;seriously&quot; in religious legends or dogma, this is due to the
<br />
fact that the scientific attitude in theology has been successfully
<br />
banished from the academy since a long time. It is because &quot;theology&quot;
<br />
is no more taken seriously that obscurity and superstition develop
<br />
itself in the religious realm. Under the (neo)platonist, you have to
<br />
pass exams in advanced mathematics, astronomy, music before entering
<br />
the theology field. If we continue to forbid or discourage the
<br />
rationalist attitude in theology, then unfounded theology and
<br />
superstition will continue to reign, and ... many will use this to say
<br />
we have to continue to forbid rationalism in it. I think we should cut
<br />
that loop. If we don't,  it is because &quot;naturalism&quot; or &quot;physicalism&quot; or
<br />
&quot;materialism&quot; is the new (fake) religion with new &quot;Gods&quot; like the
<br />
physical universe (a concept which does not explain a lot, and which is
<br />
not clear at all once you take the fundamental question seriously, this
<br />
should be clear with the UDA and any serious reasoning on the mind body
<br />
problem).

<br />
An honest scientist should admit that we are still very ignorant on
<br />
most fundamental questions.  Today it is politically correct to be open
<br />
minded toward any religion and belief system. I think we should on the
<br />
contrary be more demanding in rigor, in all inquiry fields.

<br />
My father (who was working in the law) told me once that it is much
<br />
more important to be rigorous in the human science than in exact
<br />
science.
<br />
Indeed, an error in the exact science leads quickly to a catastrophe
<br />
(from the rejected paper, to the explosion of the laboratory ...) so
<br />
that you learn quickly. An error in the human science could lead to
<br />
millenaries of useless suffering if not longer.

<br />
Do you see what I am trying to say? I understand Colin's feeling of
<br />
being fed up with religion, I am too. But I react differently because I
<br />
think that the widespread superstitions really are due to the fact that
<br />
we are not taking seriously enough the fundamental matters.

<br />
Recall that for me SCIENCE = DOUBT. When I say we should be serious in
<br />
theology, it means we should develop and encourage that doubting
<br />
attitude in theology. This is not incompatible with faith. But it is
<br />
incompatible with any form of blind faith, brainwashings, etc.

<br />
Bruno
