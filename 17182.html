This is /the/ question. It always  seems to get sidestepped in 
<br />
discussions that fail to distinguish between (a) &quot;/reality as some kind 
<br />
of natural computation/&quot; and (b) &quot;/reality represented by formal 
<br />
statements(laws of nature) of regularity, //apparent in an observer, 
<br />
//that may be artificially computed/ /by a Turing style machine/&quot;. The 
<br />
conflation of (a) and (b) is a constant in the discussions here.
<br />
<br />(a) does not need an observer. It /constructs/ an observer.
<br />
(b) involves an observer and are  regularities constructed by the 
<br />
observer made by (a)
<br />
<br />The (roughly 5) conflations (from my paper that refutes COMP) are:
<br />
<br />Conflation #1:     Deploying an artificial scientist ? Bestowing 
<br />
scientific knowledge
<br />
Conflation #2:     COMP(utation) ? experience
<br />
Conflation #3:    A Scientist  ? Formal system
<br />
Conflation #4     Rules of a rule generator ? the generated rules 
<br />
(except once)
<br />
Conflation #5     AC Artificial Turing style abstract symbol 
<br />
manipulation ? NC The computation that is the natural world
<br />
<br />Note that all 05 of these permeate the discussions here. I see it all the 
<br />
time. The main one is #5. When you realise how many combinations of 
<br />
these can misdirect a discussion, you realise how screwed up things are. 
<br />
The following statements summarise the effects:
<br />
<br />(A) The fact that the natural world, to an observer, happens to have 
<br />
appearances predicted by a set of formal statements (Laws of 
<br />
Nature/Physics) does not entail that those statements are in any way 
<br />
involved in running/driving the universe. Eg. The assumption that the 
<br />
concept of a 'multiverse' is valid or relevant is another symptom of the 
<br />
conflation....the reason?  QM is a mathematical construct of type (b), 
<br />
/not/ an example of (a). The whole concept of a multiverse is a malady 
<br />
caused by this conflation.
<br />
<br />(B) The operation of a Turing Machine ( = hardware-invariant//artificial 
<br />
abstract/ symbol manipulation) is /not  /what is going on in the natural 
<br />
world and, specifically, is /not/ what is happening in the brain (of a 
<br />
scientist). Assuming 'cognition is computation' is unjustified on any level.
<br />
<br />I find the situation increasingly aggravating. It's like talking to cult 
<br />
members who's beliefs are predicated on a delusion, and who a re so deep 
<br />
inside it and so unable to see out of it that they are lost. Common 
<br />
sense has left the building. The appropriate scientific way out of this 
<br />
mess is to
<br />
<br />(i) let (a) descriptions and (b) descriptions be, for the purposes, 
<br />
/separate scientific depictions of the natural world/ If they are not 
<br />
then at some point in the analysis they will become 
<br />
indistinguishable...in which case you have a /scientific/logical approach./
<br />
(ii) Drop /all/ assumptions that any discussion involving Turing 
<br />
machines as relevant to understanding the natural world. This means 
<br />
accepting,/ for the purposes of sorting this mess out/, (a) as being a 
<br />
form of computation fundamentally different to a Turing machine, where 
<br />
the symbols and the processor are literally the same thing. If you 
<br />
predicate your work on (i) then if COMP is true then at some point, if 
<br />
(a) and (b) become indistinguishable, /then/ COMP will be a-priori 
<br />
/predicted/ to be true.
<br />
<br />I leave you to unpack your personalised version of the conflations. 
<br />
Traditional physics/math training will automatically infect the trainee 
<br />
with the affliction that conflates (a) and (b). The system of organised 
<br />
thought in which an observer is a-priori predicted with suggested 
<br />
sources of empirical evidence, is the system that we seek. (a) and (b) 
<br />
above represent that very system. We are currently locked into (b) and 
<br />
have all manner of weird assumptions operating in place of (a) which 
<br />
mean, in effect, that _the /last/ thing physicists want to explain is 
<br />
physicists_. Endlessly blathering on about multiverses and assuming COMP 
<br />
does /nothing/ to that end. I've had 5 years of listening to this 
<br />
COMP/Turing machine/Multiverse stuff. It's old/impotent/toothless/mute 
<br />
(predicts nothing) and sustained only by delusion . It operates as a 
<br />
cult(ure). I am the deprogrammer. :-)
<br />
<br />colin
<br />
PS. Brent .... I seem to have picked up a SHOUTING habit from a 
<br />
relatively brain dead AGI forum, where the folk are particularly deluded 
<br />
about what they are doing .... They are so lost in (ii) above and have 
<br />
so little clue about science, they need therapy! I'll try and calm 
<br />
myself down a bit. Maybe use /italics/ instead  :-)
