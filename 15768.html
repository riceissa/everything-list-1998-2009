Hi Bruno,
<br />
<br />first of all thanks for the long answer, and yes, it was very helpful.
<br />
<br />You described the production of all reals with a very vivid imagery; it 
<br />
showed a glimpse of the vastness of the UD. And, I agree, _in the limit_ 
<br />
there will be an infinite number of histories. So, as we have to also 
<br />
take into account infinite delay, we must take this limit into account 
<br />
and have infinite histories going through a &quot;state&quot; (do I understand you 
<br />
correctly?).
<br />
<br />As to the interacting programs: do you consider them purely because they 
<br />
are part of UD or do you think this is a possible way to share histories?
<br />
<br />(I am interested in this because I find COMP very convincing, though I 
<br />
am still a bit worried about solipsism).
<br />
<br />I am also preparing a few thoughts (in a later post, but see hints 
<br />
below) on how consciousness might supervene on large parts of past 
<br />
causal histories, thereby also steering a bit away from solipsism 
<br />
(arguing via the concept of external realism from analytic philosophy, 
<br />
summarized by Putnam's &quot;meaning is not in the head&quot;).
<br />
<br />I also have another question (related to the above issue of solipsism):
<br />
<br />We have considered COMP and MAT and seen that the two are not really 
<br />
compatible.
<br />
<br />But you also say that with COMP, the universe itself is not computable 
<br />
(I understand why, and I agree with your reasoning as you have presented 
<br />
it).
<br />
<br />But I have one &quot;worry&quot;: what if the subsitution level is &quot;at the bottom&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the universe - (for a moment drawing on materialist intuitions, the 
<br />
universe in the &quot;normal&quot; sense and not considering infinite histories 
<br />
for the moment).
<br />
<br />If the universe is a computation, then also an individual in the 
<br />
universe is part of this computation. But this individual can't be 
<br />
&quot;duplicated&quot; because of the quantum no-cloning theorem (that is what I 
<br />
mean with &quot;at the bottom&quot; - not above the quantum level).
<br />
<br />Svozil for instance refers in a number of papers to the work of Moore 
<br />
and Finkelstein that show, assuming we have an automaton, we would 
<br />
witness complementarity.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~svozil/publ/publ.html">http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~svozil/publ/publ.html</a>
<br />
<br />(see for instance these overview papers:
<br />
<br />Svozil, K. ``How real are virtual realities, how virtual is reality? The 
<br />
constructive re-interpretation of physical undecidability'', Complexity, 
<br />
1, 43-54 (1996).
<br />
<br />Svozil, K. Computational Universes Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals, 2005, 25, 
<br />
845-859
<br />
<br />Svozil, K. Physical Unknowables physics/0701163, 2007)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />The results of course would also apply if we were &quot;solipsist&quot; automatons 
<br />
and &quot;the whole&quot; not (so the arguments are quite compatible with varying 
<br />
versions of machine conception (universe/person) ).
<br />
<br />I am just saying that we can't know if we are &quot;separable&quot; from the universe.
<br />
<br />To state it differently (and to make the connection with complementarity 
<br />
and duplication):
<br />
<br />If we assume the whole universe to be an automaton, also it's 
<br />
inhabitants would be &quot;mechanical&quot; =effectively computable of course - 
<br />
but maybe they could then not be duplicated, because, when person A were 
<br />
trying to make a scan of the properties of person B, the universe as a 
<br />
whole would move into different states and make complementary 
<br />
observables - which _could_ be necessary for a duplication - unavailable.
<br />
<br />This may only work if consciousness supervenes not on &quot;isolated&quot; 
<br />
computations, but only if it is embedded in computations constructing 
<br />
whole universes - but then again, we can't exclude this a priori.
<br />
<br />And we would still have to consider many worlds, but these would then 
<br />
indeed be _worlds_ and not only OMs with incoming/outgoing histories (of 
<br />
course it would still seem this way from the concrete OM, but with 
<br />
greatly reduced danger of white rabbits) - the laws of physics would not 
<br />
emerge for OM's stranded in the UD deployment but for OM's embedded 
<br />
already in highly structured computational environments - we would only 
<br />
have to take into account duplications of OM's where also whole 
<br />
universes are duplicated.
<br />
<br />So, what I am getting at, wouldn't you have to modify your argument - 
<br />
the reversal physics/machine psychology - insofar that not only a 
<br />
substitution level exists (COMP), but that this level is &quot;separable&quot; 
<br />
from a possible universe-machine (the possibility of which we can't 
<br />
exclude at the beginning of the argument). A kind of qualified COMP, QCOMP?
<br />
<br />Of course, the variant where the whole universe is necessary for 
<br />
duplication would still be machine psychology, but at a different level 
<br />
- at the universe level (classical sense again) and not at the level of 
<br />
everday conception of persons. Maybe COMP with the assumption that 
<br />
consciousness needs whole universes to supervene on (I don't mean that a 
<br />
universe is conscious; persons, brains would be conscious, but they 
<br />
would need the surrounding computations supplied by the universe to 
<br />
provide &quot;meaning&quot;) is even preferable to the view that one can duplicate 
<br />
a person from _within_ a universe (because of the white rabbit problem).
<br />
<br />Reading through my post above again, I believe that your COMP argument 
<br />
also works with the above conception.
<br />
<br />QCOMP and UNIVERSE-COMP would just be different as to what would be 
<br />
possible for us in _this_ universe: for instance, QCOMP would allow 
<br />
mind-uploading and teleportation and other such things in _this 
<br />
universe_ (materialist intuition again); while UNIVERSE-COMP would only 
<br />
allow this in Platonia, in the Universal deployment, which is 
<br />
inaccessible for manipulation for us inhabitants of the rather small 
<br />
(considered against Platonia) visible universe.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Best Wishes,
<br />
Günther
