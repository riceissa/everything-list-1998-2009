Principle

<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stephen writes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you seem to be making a case of the Anthropic Principle,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but I am not sure if this is your intension. (I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ignoring my own allergy to the idea that 1st person aspects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can be faithfully represented by Turing algorithms.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I myself had no clue that these ideas could be connected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the Anthropic Principle.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You wrote &quot;...the vast winnowing of branches that people find themselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in...&quot; Isn't this exactly what we would expect if we assume that any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; slice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the Multiverse that an observer finds itself in will be restricted to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessarily allowing for some measure of &quot;being alive&quot; such that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; meaningful notion of &quot;observation&quot; can obtain? [Are we inadvertently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assuming some kind of &quot;outside of the multiverse&quot; point of view to define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this???]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Could you possibly expand on this notion?  Maybe with shorter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sentences?  :-)   As for me, trying to keep the ideas simple,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I often read in literature how some character is surprised to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find himself alive. There have been parallels (perhaps weak
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones) in my own life where I am surprised to find myself still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; employed.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will try, but as often is the case these ideas are not easily 
<br />
explained in small sound byte size morsels, especially by someone like 
<br />
myself that is dislexic. ;-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, at least, two seperate issues here: the multiplicity of 
<br />
relative states of an observer and the notion of continuity of the 1st 
<br />
person aspect (subjective experience), i.e., that for any given notion of an 
<br />
observer and the possible choices that they could make of that causally 
<br />
impact upon them there exists one universe within which that observer could 
<br />
find itself. The former is easily seen to follow the notion that any 
<br />
universe that an observer finds itself &quot;in&quot; will have conditions that, at 
<br />
least, allow for the existence of that observer. This, for example, would 
<br />
exclude universes that do not have some form of gravity that would give rise 
<br />
to stars, planets, etc.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter notion is not very obvious and as Bruno has pointed out we 
<br />
have strong reasons to believe that the 1st person aspect is not reducible 
<br />
to some 3rd person aspect. As an aside, I do believe that the converse is 
<br />
the case: any 3rd person aspect can be constructed from 1st person aspects. 
<br />
Another way of putting the second notion out there is to refere to the 
<br />
rubric, whose origin escapes me, &quot;I am what I remember myself to be&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It hasn't occurred to me that this warrants any revision, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess the adherents of the strong no-cul-de-sac theory should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be incapable of being surprised that they were still alive. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can just hear them saying to themselves &quot;Well, OF COURSE I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still alive...what else could I expect?  To find myself dead?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Duh!&quot;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the observer is incapable of making an observation of a given 
<br />
universe, it easily follows that there is some strong reason why. One simple 
<br />
reason could be that that observer can not have any 1st person aspects 
<br />
consistent with that particular universe. To say that one is dead in such 
<br />
and such a universe is the same thing, unless we are going to postulate some 
<br />
kind of disembodied &quot;consciousness&quot;, like a self-aware ghost.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The idea of immortality seems to assume some means by which a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; observer's 1st person aspect can be continuously traced through the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Multiverse. Right? Would not such a &quot;trace&quot; obey topological rules such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not allowing for the 1st person awareness of the effects of &quot;cutting&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;pasting&quot;, &quot;tearing&quot; and other kinds of topological surgery?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure that I follow. It seems to me that I experience a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain (probably mundane) discontinuity when I sleep and then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wake. Other people, especially amnesiacs, or those involved in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very severe injuries to the head, report discontinuities. Later
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on, if/when we have &quot;learning pills&quot;, one might suddenly remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that he knew French. Since it's not so difficult to imagine this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it seems to me that all of the kinds of surgery you list above
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be experienced.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, this is captures by: I am what I remember myself to be&quot;, or in 
<br />
Vaughan Pratt's terms: &quot;I think, therefore I was&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Would these global rules not fall under the AP as well or is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this outside of the AP?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps you should also expand on the Anthropic Principle. I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very hazy on it. The Weak anthropic principle seemed only to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; common sense, and the Strong and Final forms, as I recall, were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pretty dubious so far as I was concerned.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See: <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/anthropic-principle">http://www.answers.com/topic/anthropic-principle</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am dubious about the restriction to &quot;carbon-based&quot; and frame the AP in 
<br />
generic terms that only assume that some kind of 1st person aspect exists 
<br />
such that the notion of an &quot;Observer&quot; has meaning: An observer will only 
<br />
have 1st person experiences of universes that allow for their existence.&quot; I 
<br />
find that the notion of &quot;fine-tuning&quot; is as silly as assuming that the nose 
<br />
on my face was formed over the millennia by forces, random and/or otherwise 
<br />
to allow for my spectacles to fit on them. Instead, we find ourselves in a 
<br />
universe that has the particular properties and values of constants because 
<br />
it is within such a universe that we, as observers, evolved.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notion of prior measures of universes seems to necessitate some form 
<br />
of an Observer that exists &quot;outside&quot; of the powerset of universes, U, such 
<br />
that It can compare one subset of U to another. Is this not a sorry 
<br />
throwback to deistic thinking and is self-stultifying, since it assumes that 
<br />
observers can exists that have no universe within which to evolve?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same contradiction follow the notion of a &quot;block universe&quot;, where it 
<br />
is assumed that space-time is much like a fish bowl that some Observer may 
<br />
perceive &quot;all at once&quot;.
