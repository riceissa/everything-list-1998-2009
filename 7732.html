<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
<br /><br />I will try to explain. The word &quot;theology&quot; has many connotations. The 
<br />
word is not so important if you understand the idea.
<br />
I have favorite theologians. Plato (who invents the word), but also 
<br />
Plotinus and &quot;neo-platonist&quot; in general. But also many &quot;oriental&quot; 
<br />
researchers ...
<br />
I could argue that Deutsch's FOR book, or more clearly TIPLER's 
<br />
&quot;physics of immortality&quot; book are (physicalist) approach to theological 
<br />
questions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -&gt; we are still a long way before we succeed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -&gt;keeping alive the scientific attitude in that field.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can only presume you must be speaking of questions of the type,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;why is there something rather than nothing&quot;    and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;what was there before the big bang&quot;  ?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well not really. I'm just looking to the consequences of our 
<br />
assumptions.
<br />
To say &quot;yes&quot; to a doctor who propose you a digital brain substitution 
<br />
needs to make a non trivial &quot;act of faith&quot;. To say &quot;no&quot;, also. Imagine 
<br />
a pro-life physician who does not believe in mechanism. Heavy 
<br />
&quot;conscience&quot; problems.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If so, I would have said these were metaphysical questions rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theological ones; and whatever one calls them, they hardly seem to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the same category as what can be treated by science.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't believe that there is any field of enquiry where the scientific 
<br />
attitude should not be applied. Scientific attitude, I think, is not 
<br />
much more than modesty.
<br />
The more fundamental are the questions, the more modest the &quot;scientist&quot; 
<br />
should be.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -&gt; The subject is still too hot.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And too vague.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Vagueness is not necessarily a problem, unless it is (mis)used by 
<br />
people who wants manipulate other people. Less vague statements are 
<br />
born from more vague statements.
<br />
Degree of vagueness could also depend on the assumptions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -&gt;Most theological questions are still buried under the carpet,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where they belong.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The problem is that if the &quot;scientist&quot; dismiss some fundamental 
<br />
questions, they will be tackled by those who will use some urgency 
<br />
feeling related to them to to do &quot;total unrigorous manipulative 
<br />
pseudo-theology&quot;, so that the scientist will say &quot;you see, let us keep 
<br />
those things under the carpet&quot;. Your negative attitude is unfounded and 
<br />
self-fulfilling, I'm afraid.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -&gt;or dismiss as non scientific.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I have just done.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No sincere questions are &quot;non scientific&quot;.  Prejudice against some 
<br />
possible sense in those questions will not help making them more clear 
<br />
and, who can know in advance, susceptible to scientific progress on 
<br />
them.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -&gt; All this is helped by many &quot;materialist or atheist superstitions&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One doesn't need to be either of those things in order to question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the appropriateness of metaphysical matters to scientific ones.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Some scientists pretend not doing metaphysics, but when you dig a 
<br />
little bit you realized they believe in Nature or in a primitive 
<br />
physical world. That *is* a metaphysical opinion.
<br />
If you really want to avoid &quot;useless *metaphysics*&quot; then you should be 
<br />
more open to the possibility of progress in theological matters. 
<br />
Indeed, in *any* matter.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -&gt;Also, if you assume the computationalist hypothesis, like David 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Deutsch,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have earlier noted that this would more accurately be called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;Matrix&quot; hypothesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -&gt; then there is a case that Physics emerges from Mathematics and Logic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I earlier convincingly (IMHO) showed, this can be rejected on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; categorical grounds alone, apart from any other consideration.
</em><br />
<br /><br />So you confess that you think there is no need to look at my argument 
<br />
because you find the conclusion already inconsistent. At least you are 
<br />
frank. Yet I would appreciate a more constructive critics. If you are 
<br />
so sure you could play the game of finding the error in the 
<br />
argumentation you refer to.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -&gt; so that it is clearly testable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is not.     In the same sense that solipsism is not testable.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You don't get it at all. Apology for pointing to my work: I have given 
<br />
two things. First a deductive argument showing that if we make a 
<br />
precise hypothesis in the &quot;cognitive theoretical science&quot; it follows 
<br />
necessarily that physics is derivable from computer science. The 
<br />
&quot;simplicity&quot; of the argument is provided by the high non-constructivity 
<br />
of the proof. But then I translate that argument in the language of a 
<br />
sound universal turing machine (with enough &quot;introspective ability&quot;) 
<br />
from which I derive the logic of the &quot;observable propositions&quot;.  To put 
<br />
it bluntly I can sum up the main technical result by the shape of the 
<br />
arithmetical translation of the argument:
<br />
PHYSICS = SOL ° THEAE ° COMP (G),
<br />
where SOL, THEAE, and COMP are the main components of the translation 
<br />
of the &quot;reversal&quot; arguments. Mathematically they are well defined modal 
<br />
logic transforms, so that we can test the result. Unfortunately, 
<br />
although the propositional physics is decidable, even &quot;easy question&quot; 
<br />
like Bell's inequality, symmetry of nature, no-cloning theorem, etc. 
<br />
are still intractable. Yet I got intermediary result showing that only 
<br />
an arithmetical conspiracy would make those questions in principle 
<br />
intractable, and I did actually derive a sort of curious &quot;quantum 
<br />
logic&quot;.
<br />
I train myself often to explain more and more the technics on the 
<br />
everything-list where people have similar approaches. You are welcome. 
<br />
You could even help perhaps. Actually I have just finish a paper which 
<br />
I find rather better than the preceding one. I progress toward a paper 
<br />
which would correspond to an english revised version of my PhD thesis. 
<br />
I am slow, but the subject is tricky, and is confronted with many 
<br />
deep-engrained philosophical prejudices. I do have under-estimate the 
<br />
tabu features of the questions I am interested in.
<br />
Note the FOR book *is* an excellent introduction to those questions and 
<br />
I do share many important views on the nature of science with David 
<br />
Deutsch (and Rafe Champion).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -&gt; but then as he said himself he must disagree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -&gt; with all mathematicians and computer scientist on Church's thesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Very true, very true.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I know we agree on this. Given that Church Thesis is a key part of the 
<br />
hypothesis I mention above I am sure you  could  understand what I try 
<br />
(at least) to convey. I just say that the computationalist hypothesis 
<br />
leads to mathematically and experimentally verifiable statements. And 
<br />
this constructively (after making first the main point in a 
<br />
non-constructive way).
<br />
<br />By the way, with the comp hyp, by &quot;theology&quot; you could &quot;just&quot; mean the 
<br />
search of all what is true *about* machines, including what is true but 
<br />
non justifiable by them.
<br />
Theoretical computer science permits then to study &quot;toy&quot; machine 
<br />
theologies, and it is already interesting to discover how infinitely 
<br />
complex the related mathematical questions are, making you perhaps more 
<br />
modest, and thus ... &quot;more scientific&quot;.
