Hi Günther,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice post! Coments soon.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of Svozil's work, please see: Cristian S. Calude, Peter H. 
<br />
Hertling and Karl Svozil, ``Embedding Quantum Universes in Classical Ones'', 
<br />
Foundations of Physics 29(3), 349-390 (1999) [abstract], [CrossRef 
<br />
DOI:10.1023/A:1018862730956], [pdf], [pdf], [tex], [ps].
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we derive quantum logics from purely integer (or even real 
<br />
number) based logics? This paper seems to yeild a no-go theorem!
<br />
<br />Onward!

<br />
<br /><br /><br />Hi Bruno,
<br />
<br />first of all thanks for the long answer, and yes, it was very helpful.
<br />
<br />You described the production of all reals with a very vivid imagery; it
<br />
showed a glimpse of the vastness of the UD. And, I agree, _in the limit_
<br />
there will be an infinite number of histories. So, as we have to also
<br />
take into account infinite delay, we must take this limit into account
<br />
and have infinite histories going through a &quot;state&quot; (do I understand you
<br />
correctly?).
<br />
<br />As to the interacting programs: do you consider them purely because they
<br />
are part of UD or do you think this is a possible way to share histories?
<br />
<br />(I am interested in this because I find COMP very convincing, though I
<br />
am still a bit worried about solipsism).
<br />
<br />I am also preparing a few thoughts (in a later post, but see hints
<br />
below) on how consciousness might supervene on large parts of past
<br />
causal histories, thereby also steering a bit away from solipsism
<br />
(arguing via the concept of external realism from analytic philosophy,
<br />
summarized by Putnam's &quot;meaning is not in the head&quot;).
<br />
<br />I also have another question (related to the above issue of solipsism):
<br />
<br />We have considered COMP and MAT and seen that the two are not really
<br />
compatible.
<br />
<br />But you also say that with COMP, the universe itself is not computable
<br />
(I understand why, and I agree with your reasoning as you have presented
<br />
it).
<br />
<br />But I have one &quot;worry&quot;: what if the subsitution level is &quot;at the bottom&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the universe - (for a moment drawing on materialist intuitions, the
<br />
universe in the &quot;normal&quot; sense and not considering infinite histories
<br />
for the moment).
<br />
<br />If the universe is a computation, then also an individual in the
<br />
universe is part of this computation. But this individual can't be
<br />
&quot;duplicated&quot; because of the quantum no-cloning theorem (that is what I
<br />
mean with &quot;at the bottom&quot; - not above the quantum level).
<br />
<br />Svozil for instance refers in a number of papers to the work of Moore
<br />
and Finkelstein that show, assuming we have an automaton, we would
<br />
witness complementarity.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~svozil/publ/publ.html">http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~svozil/publ/publ.html</a>
<br />
<br />(see for instance these overview papers:
<br />
<br />Svozil, K. ``How real are virtual realities, how virtual is reality? The
<br />
constructive re-interpretation of physical undecidability'', Complexity,
<br />
1, 43-54 (1996).
<br />
<br />Svozil, K. Computational Universes Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals, 2005, 25,
<br />
845-859
<br />
<br />Svozil, K. Physical Unknowables physics/0701163, 2007)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />The results of course would also apply if we were &quot;solipsist&quot; automatons
<br />
and &quot;the whole&quot; not (so the arguments are quite compatible with varying
<br />
versions of machine conception (universe/person) ).
<br />
<br />I am just saying that we can't know if we are &quot;separable&quot; from the universe.
<br />
<br />To state it differently (and to make the connection with complementarity
<br />
and duplication):
<br />
<br />If we assume the whole universe to be an automaton, also it's
<br />
inhabitants would be &quot;mechanical&quot; =effectively computable of course -
<br />
but maybe they could then not be duplicated, because, when person A were
<br />
trying to make a scan of the properties of person B, the universe as a
<br />
whole would move into different states and make complementary
<br />
observables - which _could_ be necessary for a duplication - unavailable.
<br />
<br />This may only work if consciousness supervenes not on &quot;isolated&quot;
<br />
computations, but only if it is embedded in computations constructing
<br />
whole universes - but then again, we can't exclude this a priori.
<br />
<br />And we would still have to consider many worlds, but these would then
<br />
indeed be _worlds_ and not only OMs with incoming/outgoing histories (of
<br />
course it would still seem this way from the concrete OM, but with
<br />
greatly reduced danger of white rabbits) - the laws of physics would not
<br />
emerge for OM's stranded in the UD deployment but for OM's embedded
<br />
already in highly structured computational environments - we would only
<br />
have to take into account duplications of OM's where also whole
<br />
universes are duplicated.
<br />
<br />So, what I am getting at, wouldn't you have to modify your argument -
<br />
the reversal physics/machine psychology - insofar that not only a
<br />
substitution level exists (COMP), but that this level is &quot;separable&quot;
<br />
from a possible universe-machine (the possibility of which we can't
<br />
exclude at the beginning of the argument). A kind of qualified COMP, QCOMP?
<br />
<br />Of course, the variant where the whole universe is necessary for
<br />
duplication would still be machine psychology, but at a different level
<br />
- at the universe level (classical sense again) and not at the level of
<br />
everday conception of persons. Maybe COMP with the assumption that
<br />
consciousness needs whole universes to supervene on (I don't mean that a
<br />
universe is conscious; persons, brains would be conscious, but they
<br />
would need the surrounding computations supplied by the universe to
<br />
provide &quot;meaning&quot;) is even preferable to the view that one can duplicate
<br />
a person from _within_ a universe (because of the white rabbit problem).
<br />
<br />Reading through my post above again, I believe that your COMP argument
<br />
also works with the above conception.
<br />
<br />QCOMP and UNIVERSE-COMP would just be different as to what would be
<br />
possible for us in _this_ universe: for instance, QCOMP would allow
<br />
mind-uploading and teleportation and other such things in _this
<br />
universe_ (materialist intuition again); while UNIVERSE-COMP would only
<br />
allow this in Platonia, in the Universal deployment, which is
<br />
inaccessible for manipulation for us inhabitants of the rather small
<br />
(considered against Platonia) visible universe.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Best Wishes,
<br />
Günther
