<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; All I can say is that I don't understand your distinction. You have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; introduced a new term &quot;necessary primitive&quot; - what on earth is that? But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'll let this pass, it probably isn't important.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; COLIN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Oh no you don't!! It matters. Bigtime...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Take away the necessary primitive: no 'qualititative novelty'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Take away the water molecules: No lake.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Take away the bricks, no building
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Take away the atoms: no molecules
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Take away the cells: no human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Take away the humans: no humanity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Take away the planets: no solar system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Take away the X: No emergent Y
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Take away the QUALE: No qualia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Magical emergence is when but claim Y exists but you can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; identify an X. Such as:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, so by necessary primitive, you mean the syntactic or microscopic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; layer. But take this away, and you no longer have emergence. See
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; endless discussions on emergence - my paper, or Jochen Fromm's book for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instance. Does this mean &quot;magical emergence&quot; is oxymoronic?
</em><br />
<br />I do not think I mean what you suggest. To make it almost tediously
<br />
obvious I could rephrase it &quot; NECESSARY PRIMITIVE ORGANISATIONAL LAYER.
<br />
Necessary in that if you take it away the 'emergent' is gone.PRIMITIVE
<br />
ORGANISATIONAL LAYER = one of the layers of the hierarchy of the natural
<br />
world (from strings to atoms to cells and beyond): real observable
<br />
-on-the-benchtop-in-the-lab - layers..... Not some arm waving &quot;syntactic&quot;
<br />
or &quot;information&quot; or &quot;complexity&quot; or &quot;Computaton&quot; or &quot;function_atom&quot; or
<br />
&quot;representon&quot;. Magical emergence is real, specious and exactly what I have
<br />
said all along:
<br />
<br />You claim consciousness arises as a result of  [&quot;syntactic&quot; or
<br />
&quot;information&quot; or &quot;complexity&quot; or &quot;Computational&quot; or &quot;function_atom&quot;] =
<br />
necessary primitive, but it has no scientifically verifiable correlation
<br />
with any real natural world phenomenon that you can stand next to and have
<br />
your picture taken.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You can't use an object derived using the contents of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness(observation) to explain why there are any contents of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness(observation) at all. It is illogical. (see the wigner quote
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; below). I find the general failure to recognise this brute reality very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exasperating.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; People used to think that about life. How can you construct (eg an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; animal) without having a complete discription of that animal. So how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can an animal self-reproduce without having a complete description of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself. But this then leads to an infinite regress.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The solution to this conundrum was found in the early 20th century -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first with such theoretical constructs as combinators and lambda
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculus, then later the actual genetic machinery of life. If it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible in the case of self-reproduction, the  it will also likely to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be possible in the case of self-awareness and consciousness. Stating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this to illogical doesn't help. That's what people from the time of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Descartes thought about self-reproduction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; COLIN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; So this means that in a computer abstraction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; d(KNOWLEDGE(t))
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ---------------  is already part of KNOWLEDGE(t)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       dt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; RUSSEL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; No its not. dK/dt is generated by the interaction of the rules with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No. No. No. There is the old assumption thing again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; How, exactly, are you assuming that the agent 'interacts' with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; environment? This is the world external to the agent, yes?. Do not say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;through sensory measurement&quot;, because that will not do. There are an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; infinite number of universes that could give rise to the same sensory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; measurements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All true, but how does that differ in the case of humans?
</em><br />
<br />The extreme uniqueness of the circumstance alone....We ARE the thing we
<br />
describe. We are more entitled to any such claims .....notwithstanding
<br />
that...
<br />
<br />Because, as I have said over and over... and will say again: We must live
<br />
in the kind of universe that delivers or allows access to, in ways as yet
<br />
unexplained, some aspects of the distal world, so which sensory I/O can be
<br />
attached, and thus conjoined, be used to form the qualia
<br />
representation/fields we experience in our heads.
<br />
<br />Forget about HOW....that this is necessarily the case is unavoidable.
<br />
Maxwell's equations prove it QED - style...Without it, the sensory I/O
<br />
(ultimately 100% electromagnetic phenomena) could never resolve the distal
<br />
world in any unambiguous way. Such disambiguation physically
<br />
happens.....such qualia representations exist, hence brains must have
<br />
direct access to the distal world. QED.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We are elctromagnetic objects. Basic EM theory. Proven
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical theorems. The solutions are not unique for an isolated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Circularity.Circularity.Circularity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; There is _no interaction with the environment_ except for that provided by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the qualia as an 'as-if' proxy for the environment. The origins of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ability to access the distal external world in support of such a proxy is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mysterious but moot. It can and does happen, and that ability must come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; about because we live in the kind of universe that supports that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; possibility. The mysteriousness of it is OUR problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You've lost me completely here.
</em><br />
<br />Here you are trying to say that an explanation of consciousness lies &quot;in
<br />
that direction&quot; (magical emergence flavour X&quot;), ........when you appear to
<br />
never have fully  intraspected and explored the brute reality of what your
<br />
own neurons deliver to you moment to moment...see the above para.... you
<br />
therefore must harbour some sort of as yet undisclosed (even to
<br />
yourself...?) metaphysics.
<br />
<br />I'll try again.....We necessarily live in a universe that supports the
<br />
existence of the internal life qualia delivers...yes?  The 'contents'
<br />
delivered by this radically sophisticated &quot;set of experienced
<br />
reality-metaphors&quot; cannot be literally what the universe is made of.... is
<br />
indisputable. Physiological and plain_old_logical evidence seems
<br />
blindingly clear to me. Whatever the reality-metaphors are made of, it is
<br />
the same as what everything else is made of.....OK... some evidence worth
<br />
considering.......I quote the SCIENCE mag 2005 &quot;125 Questions.....&quot;
<br />
article yet again......Top question: #1, from the cosmologists.
<br />
<br />&quot;WHAT IS THE UNIVERSE MADE OF?&quot;
<br />
<br />Look at the question from a META-LEVEL standpoint..... It means
<br />
<br />&quot;We currently do not know what the universe is made of&quot;
<br />
&quot;The universe is not made of anything in any of the standard particle
<br />
model. It's not made of electrons, protons, neurons or any'thing' else.
<br />
......All these things are made of something and we do NOT KNOW what that
<br />
is&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;The universe is NOT MADE OF ATOMS or their constituents&quot;... nor photons
<br />
...not quarks...NONE of it.
<br />
<br />And of course you must take on board the blizzard of critical argument
<br />
that led the entire scientific community as a group in the world's
<br />
preeminent science journal to make such a statement... and that there are
<br />
good reaosns EMPIRICAL reasosns why that stateent can be made....
<br />
<br />............. we then are forced to entertain that the universe is MADE OF
<br />
SOMETHING and that something is not any of the things that QUALIA have
<br />
ever delivered to us as observations....(QUALIA are the ultimate source of
<br />
all scientific evidence used to construct all the empirically verified
<br />
depictions of the natural world we have BAR NONE.)....
<br />
<br />BUT.....
<br />
<br />At the same time we can plausibly and defensibly justify the claim that
<br />
whatever the universe is really made of , QUALIA are made of it too, and
<br />
that the qualia process and the rest of the process (that appear like
<br />
atoms etc in the qualia....are all of the same KIND or CLASS of natural
<br />
phenomenon...a perfectly natural phenomenon innate to whatever it is that
<br />
it is actually made of.
<br />
<br />That is what I mean by &quot;we must live in the kind of universe.....&quot; and I
<br />
mean 'must' in the sense of formal necessitation of the most stringent
<br />
kind.
