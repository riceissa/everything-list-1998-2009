<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (almost) beyond my mental endurance. 
</em><br />
<br />I understand that but the point is highly unusual
<br />
and unintuitive and I felt that a &quot;critical mass&quot;
<br />
was necessary for it to make is way.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I try to pick some of your remarks as non-conform to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how I feel. Consider please the rest as agreed. (At
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least for now - ha ha - which means the &lt;G&gt; I wrote, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; usual WEB-abbreviation for &lt;Grin&gt;.
</em><br />
<br />Sorry, I dont even know &lt;Grin&gt;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for taking so much time to respond.
</em><br />
<br />It helps me too to formalize things and indentify
<br />
weaknesses and limitations. Thank to ypou too.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think I have the same kind of feeble thinking tool
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as you have. However I am not sure that common sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is of much help for questions like &quot;why is there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something?&quot;. Rather it is likely that it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confuse &gt;us on such topics. It simply did not evolved
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for that. &gt;Our common sense is more a handicap than a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good guide &gt;to understand quantum mechanics. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situation is even &gt;worse here. My common sense also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; says that to me. Of &gt;course it does not follows that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing (or everythng) &gt;makes sense.
</em><br />
<br />Strange hashing of text here. ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; QM is not for me: it is a linear way to perpetrate the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reductionist model of physical sciences in ways not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too approachable for common sense - as you said.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Q-science:  IMO (=in my opinion) an extension of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; QM-nightmare.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. But this is not only QM as a human mind activity.
<br />
It really seems that the world in which we live is just
<br />
like that (Who can be cruel enough to design a world
<br />
like that and have sensible creatures living into it?).
<br />
<br />Yes also and indeed, the way of thinking I presented
<br />
fits within a reductionist framework. Nobody is required
<br />
to adhere to such a framework (and therefore to the way
<br />
of thinking I presented). If one rejects the reductionist
<br />
approach, all I can say isn't even worth reading it for
<br />
him. And, again, all of this is pure speculation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A physicist once retorted: &quot;I can live with paradoxes&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well, I cannot. I rather rely on MY common sense, even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if it is &quot;not on the level&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />You are free to rely on whatever you want. However, it
<br />
seems that we have no choice about the world we live in.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would not say that. I don't believe that numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are &quot;there&quot; for any purpose. They just are there (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exist). But their existence might be all that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; need to explain the (perceived) existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; everything else.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Right you are: not the 'numbers' are there for any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purpose, we use the idea of numbers in our logic for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanations substituting paradoxes with other ones. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My question: &quot;Are they (numbers) really there?&quot; 0r
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they only exist in our sophistication and usage?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course they exist: we invented them so they exist. 
</em><br />
<br />I would say that we discovered them. The argument (a
<br />
weak one I concede) is that we did not have so much
<br />
freedom while doing so. We find and proved that the
<br />
Fermat's conjecture was true and we *could not* find
<br />
that is was false. This constraint is intemporal and
<br />
it exists whether there are men or not and even
<br />
whether there is something or not (but there cannot
<br />
be nothing because there is least this constraint).
<br />
The set of such constraints is likely to include or
<br />
define that natural numbers themselves.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not only natural numbers but also real numbers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hilbert spaces and all the &quot;higher level objects&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that &quot;comes with&quot;. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As you said above: &quot;this is speculation indeed&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Indeed, I identified at least four speculations on
<br />
which the explanation rely upon. I don't see for
<br />
any of them any way to rationally make an opinion.
<br />
I did not find for any of them any decisive argument
<br />
for or against and I can't even imagine on what such
<br />
an argument could rely upon (indeed, common sense is
<br />
excluded). Furthermore, it happens that many people
<br />
sharing the same biology and even the same culture
<br />
have very different opinions about them.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Let's also consider the possibility that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe in which we live strictly follows some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;mathematical rules&quot; and that it is completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; determined by them (this is another speculation).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think this is attributable to English: in all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; languages people speak in reverse: The universe (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever Bruno may call it) does not FOLLOW any rules
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that humans derive from their ways of thinking -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explaining the (easily misunderstood) observations. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observe, evaluate (right or wrong) and deduct &quot;rules&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (again right or wrong). As long as they do not bounce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into contradiction, we pride ourselves by &quot;nature is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; following our rules&quot;. When the tachyons showed higher
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speed than 'c' the verdict was &quot;wrong observation&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not a speed exceeding Einstein's assumed limit for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nature.
</em><br />
<br />This is a speculation. It might be that the universe
<br />
in which we live is completely ruled by mathematical
<br />
laws. Indeed one can doubt of that or believe it but I
<br />
can't see how this can be either proved or refuted.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is equivalent to say that this universe is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; isomorphic to one of the above mentionned &quot;higher
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level objects&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nice words. Do they mean something? 
</em><br />
<br />This means something to me. I would say that meaning
<br />
is relative to individuals or group of individuals.
<br />
I understand that this might not mean anything to
<br />
other people just as what other people sometimes
<br />
refer to has no precsie meaning to me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The last and hard point is that, from a mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; point of view, all the objects that are isomorphic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one to another are the same mathematical object (just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as there is only one set of natural numbers, no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; matter how is is built) and, if the universe is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; isomorphic to a mathematical object, it could just be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this mathematical object.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think I can decipher what you wrote (?), firstly:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;from a mathematical point of view&quot;  (if not, not).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Isomorphic requires the ONE set of characteristics we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are 'allolwed' to use, while 'nature' is unrestricted.
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand you here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then do not miss your &quot;IF&quot; - and 'if not'? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still do not understand &quot;mathematical object&quot; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is the feebleness of my common sense mind.
</em><br />
<br />This a bit strange. Usually common sense tends to
<br />
have people believe in such things as mathematical
<br />
objects (like natural numbers or Hilbert spaces for
<br />
instance). Mine do so for me. Commen sense is a
<br />
strange thing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Let's consider an outrageously simplified view of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the universe as particles interacting with each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; others according to a set of mathematical laws. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical structure of the universe is likely to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be &gt;much more complex than that but the following
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might &gt;still be correct when applied to a more complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know about 'particles', they are the figments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the explanations for ununderstood phenomena. Try to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reduce them into their ingreients: no particle is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; left, unless you call a (hypothetical?) quark a particle.
</em><br />
<br />That was the idea. That particles might not exist
<br />
as such does not prevent the universe to have a
<br />
mathematical structure and I mentionned that this
<br />
was a (possibly very) simplified view.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I &quot;made&quot; macromolecules for 50 years: now I see that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are no such 'things' - only we assume them for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effects (phenomena?) we think to perceive. No atoms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either. But they have their mathematics.
</em><br />
<br />I agree on that. But that do not prevent the universe
<br />
as a whole to have its own mathematics too (and even
<br />
a mathematics that would be &quot;reflected&quot; in many
<br />
&quot;phenomenons&quot; that can be observed/conceived by us).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The problem with the idea that the universe could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simply be a mathematical object is that our common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sense strongly suggest that a physical universe has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to be different from a mathematical object because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; there is to be &quot;something in the particles&quot; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;make them real&quot;. ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I skip the rest, this is NOT my way of thinking, so I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do not discuss it here. 
</em><br />
<br />OK. Is this because you reject a reductionist view?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ...why should there be some &quot;magical substance&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; inside the particles? Isn't that enough that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; follow the rules? What more could bring the presence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of &quot;something else&quot; inside the particles? What the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; idea of an &quot;internal substance&quot; could add to any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explanation? Isn't this idea just irrational and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; similar to the concept of &quot;soul&quot; in a dualist view? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Isn't even that a kind of dualism?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I like that a lot, thank you Georges.
</em><br />
<br />Thanks to you too.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unfortunately my mailbox did not take more and wrote:

<br />Strange. I forward the remaining in another post.
