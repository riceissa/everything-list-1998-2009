<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I can see what you mean, but I still think it would work.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of locality.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you're getting too abstract.  How would the problem arise
<br />
in a practical situation?  I have a decision to make, and I can calculate
<br />
the consequences of each possibility.  It is true that I know that
<br />
overall, me-like beings choose option A 99% of the time, and option B 1%
<br />
of the time.  But suppose my utility function is proportional to the
<br />
fraction of times A is chosen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then maybe I should choose option A even though it won't alter the
<br />
overall statistics; this means I am considering the subsystem to be me and
<br />
the things I know to be causally affected by me, knowing that I have a 1% 
<br />
chance to try to choose option A but fail. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is, does that mean by choosing option A this time, am
<br />
I thereby forcing another me-like being to choose option B in order to
<br />
conserve the overall statistics?  If I am, then it would seem that I
<br />
indeed have no basis to make the decision.  This is the problem you have.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I suspect is that it would not be the case.  For my
<br />
ability to forcast the fraction that choose A is inexact; and part of the
<br />
uncertainty is related to not knowing what I will choose this time.
<br />
Indeed if there were only one me-like being in the whole theory, there is
<br />
no way I could forcast what decision I will make until I make the
<br />
decision.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put another way, a true forecast of how many times me-like beings
<br />
choose A would have to take into account the decision I make in the case
<br />
at hand.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what decision I make in this case *does still alter the global
<br />
utility function*.  This is possible because, remember, my mental
<br />
processes are not in competition with the laws of physics; they *are an
<br />
example of the laws of physics in action*.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't say to myself 'there are 100 me-like beings, 99 of them
<br />
choose A, 1 chooses B, so I might as well choose B' because if me-like
<br />
beings did tend to think that way, at least half would have chosen B.
<br />
Achieving that 99% requires me to try to choose A.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course for all practical purposes I can not calculate any such
<br />
thing as what fraction chooses A, which is another reason I can't say that
<br />
to myself.  All I can say in most cases is that if I choose A now, it is
<br />
probably a good assumption that most me-like beings also chose A.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting back to your statement:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is a physical theory making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same (global) predictions for every possible course of action.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global predictions are partially determined by which course of
<br />
action I take, and can't be fully predicted without knowing my choice; 
<br />
they are determined by the laws of physics; that is not a contradiction
<br />
because my choices are the laws in action, which is no different from the
<br />
usual case.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the answer: use the usual decisions, they do make a
<br />
difference.  But why can't I calculate the global predictions a priori,
<br />
then truthfully tell myself it's already determined, and falsely tell 
<br />
myself the direct consequence that my decisions don't matter = the global 
<br />
utility function will not be affected?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose what it amounts to is that even if the physical theory
<br />
has no free parameters, my knowledge of its predictions for me-like
<br />
beings (and thus its overall predictions) is limited and must be
<br />
calculated with a model that does, allowing me to use a nontrivial
<br />
estimated utility function for my decisions.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this may have some relation to Godel's theorem, which I
<br />
think implies that a computer can not fully model itself in a subprogram.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I can not use a physical theory to calculate what
<br />
decisions I will make until I can input those decisions into the model.
<br />
(I might know the true theory, but couldn't solve for that quantity with 
<br />
a computer.)  If I could, it would be a paradox because if the theory
<br />
predicts I do A, I could then try to defy it by doing B.  The MWI might
<br />
remove that paradox by only predicting statistics, but I doubt if it would
<br />
qualitatively change the fact that my prediction power is limited, and my
<br />
attempts to defy it could ruin the predicted statistics.  If my
<br />
calculation only applies to me-similar beings who make no such attempts
<br />
or don't know what the predicted statistics are, it clearly does not deal
<br />
with a sufficiently me-like case to tell me truly me-like statistics.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be pretty cool if Godel's theorem could thus be made to
<br />
serve as a basis of tradition and non-weirdness.  (Not that I believe in a
<br />
theory with no free parameters anyway).
