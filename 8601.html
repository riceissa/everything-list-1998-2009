Naming this field is difficult. This is why I made several suggestions 
<br />
none of which I thought were excellent.

<br />It is only a question of vocabulary if you intend to communicate with 
<br />
other people. And this is where the difficulty lies. If you make the 
<br />
name too esoteric they will not even understand what the field is about.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and actually I am not sure we are not in, well *perfect* perhaps not, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but at least in an a larger matching area than you think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps, like so many, you have not yet really understand the impact 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the discovery by Turing and its relation with Godel's theorem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When I talk on Platonia, it is really &quot;Platonia&quot; updated by Godel's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Lob's theorem. I hope you are open to the idea I could perhaps 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; progress in my way of communicating that. It really concerns machines 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and even many non-machines. I think about abandoning comp for ind, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where ind is for indexical, given that G and G* applies to almost 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything self-referentially correct.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I knew this for long, the comp hyp just makes the reasoning and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; verification easier.  
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can already say that I disagree the word &quot;quantum&quot; should be in it. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The name should not issue what will or should be derived by the theory. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />I do not fully understand the full ramification of how indexical relates 
<br />
to this field. However, I think that to use Indexical now is like 
<br />
Heisenberg using Entanglement instead of Quantum. Nobody would have 
<br />
understood what he was talking about. It was hard enough already to 
<br />
understand Quantum.
<br />
<br />BTW, COMP is not very good, because you have to explain what it is. At 
<br />
first glance it appears to be the Mechanist Philosophy and this is what 
<br />
I originally thought.
<br />
<br />I think the best approach is to use a compound expression to bridge the 
<br />
gap between different fields. (i.e., Quantum electro-chromo dynamics, 
<br />
electro-magnetism, physical chemistry)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is nothing surprising that quantum physics could be derived from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum psycho mechanics. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course it is surprising...not to you or me or others on the list 
<br />
because we have been talking about it for so long... but to the average 
<br />
scientist in the street... or the university. And these are the people 
<br />
you intend to communicate with.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Plato is the one who introduced the word &quot;theology&quot; with the meaning 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of &quot;Science of Gods&quot;, and by extension I take it as the science of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what we can hope or bet upon.  It is just the truth *about* machine, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and we can talk and reason about it without ever knowing that truth, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given that no scientist at all can *know* the truth, at least as knowed.
</em><br />
<br />I think this science relates primarily to the &quot;self.&quot; As I said before, 
<br />
I think that it it the &quot;I&quot; that creates the (orderliness in the) world. 
<br />
This is not a new idea. Some philosophers have asserted this idea 
<br />
before.  Does this makes &quot;I&quot; a god? Not in the traditional sense of 
<br />
&quot;Theology&quot; which carries too much baggage.  This is my own emphasis 
<br />
which may not be shared by everyone on this list.
<br />
I am aware of the popular meaning of &quot;psycho&quot; = crazy as John mentioned. 
<br />
We could draw from other language than the Greek (auto, psyche) or Latin 
<br />
(anima, spiritus) but we lose the ability to be widely understood: 
<br />
Hebrew: nefesh, neshamah Japanese: tamashii.  Neshamah Mechanics is not 
<br />
going to fly. Tamashii Mechanics sounds like sushi to the average westerner.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To talk on immortality issues (cf: quantum immortality or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp-immortality) without accepting we are doing theology is perhaps a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form of lack of modesty. Nobody would dare to try to help me making a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case for the use of the word &quot;theology&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />Of course we are doing theology but don't say it too loud or you'll get 
<br />
involved in a religious war. I think theology has too much baggage and 
<br />
is populated by people with faith - a virtue for them, a vice for us. :-)
