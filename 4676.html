<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for the Hardy quote: it still reads well, indeed,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I am afraid I can't agree with your reading of it or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your version of mathematical realism (and physical realism)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which strikes me as quite orthogonal to Hardy's. Nowhere does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he claim or suggest  that &quot;physical reality could be mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality seen from the inside&quot;!  What he stresses is that &quot;mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality&quot; is something entirely more precisely known and accessed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than &quot;physical reality&quot; and he is surely correct as the whole EPR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; debacle clearly demonstrates. One may add that what little we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know about &quot;physical reality&quot; is what we manage to map to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical reality! In truly Platonic terms &quot;Reality&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purely mathematical and what Physics is about is better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; named &quot;appearance&quot; (or corrupted reality).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Greetings,
<br />
<br />I would tend to agree with Chaitin that your apparent confidence in the
<br />
&quot;precise accessibility&quot; of Mathematics as opposed to that of physics may be
<br />
misplaced; I would also agree that Leibniz's insights are probably more
<br />
useful than Plato's on the ultimate &quot;nature&quot; of reality:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From &quot;Should Mathematics Be More Like Physics? Must Mathematical Axioms Be
</em><br />
Self-Evident?&quot;
<br />
<br />Gregory Chaitin, IBM Research Division
<br />
<br />&quot;A deep but easily understandable problem about prime numbers is used in the
<br />
following to illustrate the parallelism between the heuristic reasoning of
<br />
the mathematician and the inductive reasoning of the physicist...
<br />
[M]athematicians and physicists think alike; they are led, and sometimes
<br />
misled, by the same patterns of plausible reasoning.&quot;
<br />
-George Pólya, &quot;Heuristic Reasoning in the Theory of Numbers&quot;, 1959,
<br />
reprinted in Alexanderson, The Random Walks of George Pólya, 2000.
<br />
&quot;The role of heuristic arguments has not been acknowledged in the philosophy
<br />
of mathematics, despite the crucial role that they play in mathematical
<br />
discovery. The mathematical notion of proof is strikingly at variance with
<br />
the notion of proof in other areas... Proofs given by physicists do admit
<br />
degrees: of two proofs given of the same assertion of physics, one may be
<br />
judged to be more correct than the other.&quot;
<br />
-Gian-Carlo Rota, &quot;The Phenomenology of Mathematical Proof&quot;, 1997, reprinted
<br />
in Jacquette, Philosophy of Mathematics, 2002, and in Rota, Indiscrete
<br />
Thoughts, 1997.
<br />
&quot;There are two kinds of ways of looking at mathematics... the Babylonian
<br />
tradition and the Greek tradition... Euclid discovered that there was a way
<br />
in which all the theorems of geometry could be ordered from a set of axioms
<br />
that were particularly simple... The Babylonian attitude... is that you know
<br />
all of the various theorems and many of the connections in between, but you
<br />
have never fully realized that it could all come up from a bunch of
<br />
axioms... [E]ven in mathematics you can start in different places... In
<br />
physics we need the Babylonian method, and not the Euclidian or Greek
<br />
method.&quot;
<br />
-Richard Feynman, The Character of Physical Law, 1965, Chapter 2, &quot;The
<br />
Relation of Mathematics to Physics&quot;.
<br />
&quot;The physicist rightly dreads precise argument, since an argument which is
<br />
only convincing if precise loses all its force if the assumptions upon which
<br />
it is based are slightly changed, while an argument which is convincing
<br />
though imprecise may well be stable under small perturbations of its
<br />
underlying axioms.&quot;
<br />
-Jacob Schwartz, &quot;The Pernicious Influence of Mathematics on Science&quot;, 1960,
<br />
reprinted in Kac, Rota, Schwartz, Discrete Thoughts, 1992.
<br />
&quot;It is impossible to discuss realism in logic without drawing in the
<br />
empirical sciences... A truly realistic mathematics should be conceived, in
<br />
line with physics, as a branch of the theoretical construction of the one
<br />
real world and should adopt the same sober and cautious attitude toward
<br />
hypothetic extensions of its foundation as is exhibited by physics.&quot;
<br />
-Hermann Weyl, Philosophy of Mathematics and Natural Science, 1949, Appendix
<br />
A, &quot;Structure of Mathematics&quot;, p. 235.
<br />
<br />The above quotations are eloquent testimonials to the fact that although
<br />
mathematics and physics are different, maybe they are not that different!
<br />
Admittedly, math organizes our mathematical experience, which is mental or
<br />
computational, and physics organizes our physical experience. [And in
<br />
physics everything is an approximation, no equation is exact.] They are
<br />
certainly not exactly the same, but maybe it's a matter of degree, a
<br />
continuum of possibilities, and not an absolute, black and white difference.
<br />
Certainly, as both fields are currently practiced, there is a definite
<br />
difference in style. But that could change, and is to a certain extent a
<br />
matter of fashion, not a fundamental difference.
<br />
A good source of essays that I-but perhaps not the authors!-regard as
<br />
generally supportive of the position that math be considered a branch of
<br />
physics is Tymoczko, New Directions in the Philosophy of Mathematics, 1998.
<br />
In particular there you will find an essay by Lakatos giving the name
<br />
&quot;quasi-empirical&quot; to this view of the nature of the mathematical enterprise.
<br />
Why is my position on math &quot;quasi-empirical&quot;? Because, as far as I can see,
<br />
this is the only way to accommodate the existence of irreducible
<br />
mathematical facts gracefully. Physical postulates are never self-evident,
<br />
they are justified pragmatically, and so are close relatives of the not at
<br />
all self-evident irreducible mathematical facts that I exhibited in Section
<br />
VI.
<br />
I'm not proposing that math is a branch of physics just to be controversial.
<br />
I was forced to do this against my will! This happened in spite of the fact
<br />
that I'm a mathematician and I love mathematics, and in spite of the fact
<br />
that I started with the traditional Platonist position shared by most
<br />
working mathematicians. I'm proposing this because I want mathematics to
<br />
work better and be more productive. Proofs are fine, but if you can't find a
<br />
proof, you should go ahead using heuristic arguments and conjectures.
<br />
Wolfram's A New Kind of Science also supports an experimental,
<br />
quasi-empirical way of doing mathematics. This is partly because Wolfram is
<br />
a physicist, partly because he believes that unprovable truths are the rule,
<br />
not the exception, and partly because he believes that our current
<br />
mathematical theories are highly arbitrary and contingent. Indeed, his book
<br />
may be regarded as a very large chapter in experimental math. In fact, he
<br />
had to develop his own programming language, Mathematica, to be able to do
<br />
the massive computations that led him to his conjectures.
<br />
See also Tasic, Mathematics and the Roots of Postmodern Thought, 2001, for
<br />
an interesting perspective on intuition versus formalism. This is a key
<br />
question-indeed in my opinion it's an inescapable issue-in any discussion of
<br />
how the game of mathematics should be played. And it's a question with which
<br />
I, as a working mathematician, am passionately concerned, because, as we
<br />
discussed in Section VI, formalism has severe limitations. Only intuition
<br />
can enable us to go forward and create new ideas and more powerful
<br />
formalisms.
<br />
And what are the wellsprings of mathematical intuition and creativity? In
<br />
his important forthcoming book on creativity, Tor Nørretranders makes the
<br />
case that a peacock, an elegant, graceful woman, and a beautiful
<br />
mathematical theory, are all shaped by the same forces, namely what Darwin
<br />
referred to as &quot;sexual selection&quot;. Hopefully this book will be available
<br />
soon in a language other than Danish! Meanwhile, see my dialogue with him in
<br />
my book Conversations with a Mathematician.
