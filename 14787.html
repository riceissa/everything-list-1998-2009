<br />One thing I would avoid is presenting the multiverse (of any level) as the 
<br />
latest &quot;gee-whiz, science has discovered that...&quot;  It is interesting 
<br />
speculative metaphysics.  Good fodder for SciFi fans but not yet science. I 
<br />
cringe when Scientific American or the L.A. Times or some other popular 
<br />
publication takes scientific speculation and hypes it as though it were a 
<br />
new revelation of science.  It happens most often in medical stories, but 
<br />
also in physics and astronomy pieces.  In the end I think it debases 
<br />
science in the popular mind as just more advertising hype and spin noise.
<br />
<br />ISTM there were several independent threads that lead to different ideas of 
<br />
the multiverse:
<br />
<br />1) The apparent inherent randomness of QM inconsistent with &quot;hidden 
<br />
variables&quot; which made the &quot;collapse of the wave function&quot; mysterious and ad 
<br />
hoc.  The led Everett to argue for a relative-state interpretation which 
<br />
implied  the QM-multiverse.  However, theories of einselection based on 
<br />
decoherence and perhaps weak anthropic selection may undermine the 
<br />
QM-multiverse.  In this theory there is really only one universe but each 
<br />
of us consists of multiple branches on which different values are projected.
<br />
<br />2) Completely independent of (1), development of theories of cosmogony 
<br />
based on quasi-classical quantum gravity showed the universe could arise 
<br />
from &quot;nothing&quot;.  These theories naturally have the consequence that 
<br />
arbitrarily many other universes could also have arisen.  Any natural 
<br />
process is repeatable.  This theory of multiverses allows that universes 
<br />
exist with different values of those physical constants that seem arbitrary 
<br />
in our current theories (a set that could change).  These universes all 
<br />
exist in the same sense this universe exists, they may even have common 
<br />
points (e.g. in singularities).  Again some anthropic selection principle 
<br />
must be invoke to explain *this* universe.
<br />
<br />3) The extremely abstract nature of physics has led naturally to the 
<br />
speculation that only the mathematics matters.  We seem to know nothing 
<br />
about elementary particles and the interior of black holes beyond the 
<br />
mathematics they satisfy. So perhaps it is only the relational properties 
<br />
of information coded into the mathematics that is the ur-stuff of the 
<br />
world.  In that case all possible information structures may be considered 
<br />
equally &quot;existent&quot;.  This also fits with the idea that reality can be 
<br />
simulated.  If reality consists in the relation of information, it doesn't 
<br />
matter how that information is embodied or maybe that it is embodied at 
<br />
all.  Therefore reality may *be* a simulation - as on the holodeck of the 
<br />
Enterprise.
<br />
<br />4) Finally, what seems to have motivated Tegmark and also perhaps Bruno and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;others is Wheeler's question, &quot;What makes them fly?&quot;  Why is one set 
<br />
equations instantiated in the world and others are not?  Why is there some 
<br />
special property of &quot;existing&quot; that some possibilities have and others 
<br />
don't.  Tegmark sidesteps the question by answering that they are all 
<br />
instantiated; so &quot;to exist&quot; is simply to be the subject of propositions 
<br />
that form a non-self contradictory set.  Starting from this he then must 
<br />
try to recover some explanatory power by limiting what we experience by 
<br />
appealing to some anthropic principle.
