<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am postulating that it *is* the same sequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of code bytes, the *same* program. Do you know what I mean when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I say that program A is the same program as program B?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An instantiated program is much more than a sequence of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bytes -- it also has state. Most programs do not have much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state, but some (AI, specifically) are completely dominated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by state.
</em><br />
<br />Well, so are people. I am actually in a state of bewilderment at
<br />
the present moment at how you are using some words  :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is this same, identical program that is running in two different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; places at &quot;the same time&quot; (pace relativity). Program A at location
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one is receiving input X and program A at position two is receiving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; input Y. I can't make it any clearer than that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understood you perfectly. No, it is not the same program. A chess computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; playing two different games are two distinct individuals.
</em><br />
<br />Very unusual choice for meanings of words. On your usage, the 
<br />
chess program... oops, there isn't a single chess program! I
<br />
mean to say that on your usage of terms, after the chess 
<br />
software (if I may) plays 1. e4 it becomes a different program
<br />
after I reply 2. Nf3.  I better avoid using the word &quot;program&quot;
<br />
if we are to communicate!
<br />
<br />Hopefully, I can refer to what I want as a Turing Machine, and
<br />
you won't pull the rug out from under me by saying that each 
<br />
time it goes into a new state, it's a different Turing Machine.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ...the Eugen program is quite different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from the Lee program. Now, the Eugen 2004 (March 23, 12:00:00)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; program is also somewhat different from the Eugen 2002 program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (March 23, 12:00:00), but they are *very* similar in many, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; many ways. So many ways that we are justified in asserting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that they are for all practical purposes the same person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (and the same basic program).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Biology doesn't make a clean distinction between software and hardware.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree there is similarity/homology between me-former and me-today,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but that similarity is difficult to measure at a low level. Synchronizing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spatially separate discrete systems and make measurements on bit vectors is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something relatively simple, at least in gedanken.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. So what do you think about the possibility of uploading?
<br />
That is, transferring your entire intelligence and values from
<br />
its present biological substrate to a silicon-based one. Do you
<br />
consider it possible that technology from the year 3000 (were it
<br />
somehow applied to where you are at this moment) could transform
<br />
you into a robot who didn't know that the transformation had
<br />
taken place, and yet you would then consist of a system where
<br />
there was a clean distinction between hardware and software?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; P.S. I had great, great difficulty in understanding anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that you had to say. I was not able to make most of it out.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Perhaps you could add some redundancy to your tight prose?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry to be so dense, sometimes I have to post under time constraints, in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distracting environment. Will try to mend in future.
</em><br />
<br />Thanks. I often find what you write to be valuable and advanced,
<br />
in the best sense of the term (i.e. totally up to speed), but
<br />
often I have to read each sentence twice :-)  and sometimes I'm
<br />
not sure if I've unconsciously added something or not.
<br />
Appreciate it.
<br />
<br />Lee
