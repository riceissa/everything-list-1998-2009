<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Do you concede that many aspects of mind -- cognition, memory and so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are not part of any Hard Problem?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, absolutely.  But I think our basic divergence is that I say you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can't end up at these destinations unless you buy the ticket at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point of departure - the ticket being what I've called self-access
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (i.e. as a characteristic of the situation as a whole, not of parts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taken in isolation).
</em><br />
<br />I don't think self-access is part of the Hard Problem either. It isn't
<br />
difficult to get a computer to report on its internal state.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Look, when I asked you &quot;how far down in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analysis of the material do we have to go before the entities are no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; longer material?&quot; your reply was in effect &quot;all the way down&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Note that in these discussions there is a distinction between Primary
<br />
Matter and Emprirical
<br />
Matter.  Empirical Matter is known through its properties and
<br />
behaviour.  PM isn't,
<br />
hence the suspicion that it is redundant.  The link between PM an
<br />
contingency itself is the
<br />
response to that, and it ensures that no contingent discvoery can
<br />
elimnate PM.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think physicalism has been generally succesful and as much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of it should be retained as possible. hence the need to focus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on the key issues in the MBP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I wouldn't disagree with the spirit of that.  But I also say we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must continue to be alert to the possibility of gaps in some of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basic assumptions.  I think part of the trouble is that to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successful at anything, one has to push like mad, and this inevitably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads - most especially when a particular approach has been very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successful - to the tendency to push it beyond usefulness. It probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can't be avoided.  All I'm saying is that there is a long-standing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphysical corrective that has always stood to one side of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physicalism, and from time to time it's worth carefully reconsidering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it.
</em><br />
<br />And what is this corrective? You think a small amount
<br />
of anti-relaism can be mixed in with materialism? You think
<br />
a small amount of idealism can be mixed in?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, but my view is that mind-body shows us that to consider the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; referent of a theoretical statement to be something 'external' is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; fact the category error - i.e. the view from nowhere again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Referents are external by definition. So you must be sayign that no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; theory ever has a referent. But you have not said why.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm drawing attention to the fact that 'external' and 'internal' are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemic polarisations
</em><br />
<br />Well, when the terms are taken literally they are spatial...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;which, in terms of any consistent monism, must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be seen as aspects of a unique ontic continuum.   When we carefully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; examine what is entailed in conscious 'observation' we find that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very act of qualitatively reifying or embodying local representations
</em><br />
<br />This is most unclear. Is a “local representation” meant to
<br />
be a mental representation? Is reifying it supposed to be
<br />
taking it to have  referent?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; entails the draining of proper ('internal') qualities from their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; putative referents, thus 'externalising' them and abandoning them to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the realm of the 'non-conscious'.  So the 'red apple' is embodied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'redly' in my consciousness, but the qualitative embodiment of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; referent is not thereby locally realised.  This is the fons et origo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the MBP, IMO.  More below.
</em><br />
<br />I couln't make any sense of that at all.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (can't remember who) put it like this: &quot;what is the external world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; supposed to be external to?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My head
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but try to see that in the context of what I said above.  What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm saying requires a shift in viewpoint.  If you don't make it - even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experimentally - what I'm saying will inevitably sound like gibberish.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  OTOH, trying it for size doesn't commit you to the purchase.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe it requires me to make a shift in viewpoint, maybe it
<br />
requires you to use more normal vocabulary.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; YOu still haven't said about how you got into contact with the inner--
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or at least any &quot;inner&quot; other than your own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I'm not arguing for solipsism, so I reason on the basis that my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inner isn't that much different to yours.
</em><br />
<br />That just gives you more than one noumenal self. What about
<br />
the noumena of chairs and tables?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As for getting into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contact, perhaps this is the crux.  I think that your view of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is that it is mere epistemology,
</em><br />
<br />No. (I don't even use “epistemology” that way. Nothing “is”
<br />
epstemology
<br />
except discussions of truth and knowledgeamongst philosophers).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and hence that it can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in and of itself tell us anything fundamental about ontology.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think it revelas it sown ontology. OTOH, it must somehow
<br />
be taken accounto fi in any succesful ontology because everything
<br />
must.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you know of course that this is disputed - Bishop Berkeley, Vedanta,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the perennial philosophy, etc - and on what I think are good logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grounds.  If I assume that my experience is a matter *merely* of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observation, I can't help getting into an infinite regress of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observation - i.e. of epistemology.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see why that would follo
<br />
at all.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently I'm forced to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view that my fundamental relation to the qualitative is ontological,
</em><br />
<br />By ontological do you mean fundamental?
<br />
Do you think the qualitative is the only fundamental thing?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that the analysis of the qualitative into context and content is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what actually constitutes the apparent epistemological-ontological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'divide'.
</em><br />
<br />Between what and what? Note that there are no fundamental
<br />
divides in any monism, including the materialist.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Further, since I'm a monist, I must believe that if this applies to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, it must also apply to whatever it is that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemological content refers to, and consequently it is this that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must make sense of in any comprehensible account of the 'mental' and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 'material'.  Now, it's at this point that, adopting a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'materialist' stance, I might say to myself &quot;well, all this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obviously untrue because the universe would be a mass of qualities -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which it clearly isn't - and things wouldn't merely manifest and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behave objectively and materially - which they obviously do&quot;.  But on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reflection, there's no contradiction here, because the very nature of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the epistemic-ontic split lies in the abstraction of quality from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observable - it's represented qualitatively, but what-it-represents -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i.e. its referent - is what's left over relationally when the quality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is abstracted.  And this is why any account constructed entirely from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relational properties must be incomplete.
</em><br />
<br />Errrmmm, yes. You seem to have sidestepped the set of solutions where
<br />
the qualitative –qualia—are irreducible featrues of ontology
<br />
AND located in the head. Ie property dualism a la Chalmers.
<br />
<br />Locating qualia in external objects is very problematic because
<br />
the objects then have to seem one way ot a humna, another way
<br />
to a bat and so on. Locating them in the head, OTOH, allows uus t
<br />
rescue
<br />
a plank of physicalism, the supervenience principle.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now clearly, if we can't agree on something reasonably close to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foregoing as our point of departure on the way to what would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acceptable as RITSIAR, it's hardly surprising that we find ourselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in conflict further down the line.  Nonetheless, I'm interested to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know, even though you clearly disagree with the analysis, if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reject this out-of-hand as a coherent point of view.  Do you think it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is demonstrably wrong, or simply an  unnecessary assumption?  If the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; former, what specifically is wrong with it?
</em><br />
<br />Well, I've mentioned one problem above, and another elsewhere:
<br />
since redness is a scienticially detectable quality. The information
<br />
that
<br />
an object is red is already there in it's relational structure, and if
<br />
it
<br />
has red qualia too, the information is duplicated, and if it has red-
<br />
human-qualia
<br />
and red-bat-qualia and red-cat-qualia and red-bee-qualia, the same
<br />
information is
<br />
being duplicated over and over...
<br />
<br />That doesn't mean materialism has or is a better answer.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Theories represent the limit of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the world can *tell* us, not the limit of what it *is*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Theories don't necessarily tell us the whole story. However
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you seem to have decided they necessarily don't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If you can't peak over the horizon. how do you know there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is anything there?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, really, this isn't it.  The horizon is still there, and one seeks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to peek beyond it.  I'm just saying that there's a gap that can't be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bridged by any quantitative-relational theory.
</em><br />
<br />And I'm saying that where you are saying it, you should be showing
<br />
it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It takes a shift in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; viewpoint - or rather, a proper appreciation of what our 'viewpoint'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really implies - to acknowledge the gap.  Without the shift, one ends
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up either explaining it away, or vaguely hoping that it will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bridged by more or different relationships.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;  Do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; really suppose that you are limited in any such way?  That your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; existence as it is known to you by acquaintance is entirely exhausted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; by what I can glean by interacting with you or bouncing signals off
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; you?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Do you think that if you scanned my brain right down to the atomic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; level,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you still wouldn't have captured all the information?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, that's exactly what I think.  I realise, as I've said, that it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguing against the 'causal closure of the physical', but I think that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's quite reasonable so to argue, as this assumption itself is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; central to the MBP - see Chalmers for a review.  There's often a weird
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort of self-abnegation that creeps into attitudes at this point, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though to say &quot;why should we suppose that mere human experience itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sheds any light on the workings of the mighty and terrible universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that glides on serenely without us?&quot;  But on reflection this is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carry modesty beyond sense, because we're just a part of all this and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consequently what is true for us must be true - mutatis mutandis - for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the rest of it.  In fact the whole of science - nay the whole of life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - rests on a version of this statement of faith.
</em><br />
<br />Well, we already can scan brains and extract information, so this is
<br />
a hiding to nothing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And all that's required conceptually, I think, is to realise that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causality can't be 'closed' in the absence of mutual accessibility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the interacting entities.  The metaphysical intuition here is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a self-accessible continuum nonetheless differentiated by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-encounter ('self' because the differentiation doesn't really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; create 'separate entities').  The fundamental justification here is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that any other assumption just makes the whole universe disappear -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i.e. without it, any conjectured universe, and everything in it, would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be zombified - i.e. beside the point, Occamistically speaking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Furthermore, we have absolutely no reason to suppose that this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contradicted by physical theory - there's nothing whatsoever in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observable or theorised behaviour of fundamental explanatory entities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that implies that mutual accessibility isn't a prerequisite (i.e. not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; merely an accompaniment) for the mutual 'activity' that is the limit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of what is entailed by 'observation'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently the qualitative basis of ontology is simply never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observed, because it is the unobservable *context* of observation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's not just the fish not seeing the water, it's the fish not seeing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fish.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; What we know by indubitable acquaintance is something absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; qualitatively different to what is described theoretically - it has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; be - and whereas of course I'm not implying that this acquaintance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; gives us the ante on the whole nature of existence, I do believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; it should be a salutory corrective to any notion of the 'completeness'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; of our theories of observation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And the corrective to that corrective is that it must all be the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information -- just somehow presented differntly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I agree,
</em><br />
<br />You disagree above!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;but with the caveat that you mustn't leave anything out,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as I've said above.  We're not that far apart, actually, once you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adjust for language and the status of the notorious 'gap'.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That has not been demonstrated at all. At best you have an argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that they are not necessarily RITSIAR. Which is straightforwardly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; by the observation that theories are less than certain. All you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; writen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; boils down to the fallacy that &quot;no necessarily true&quot; implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;necessarily untrue&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; No, I think it boils down to the fact that no theoretical entity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; should ever be seen as RITSIAR - only in some relation to it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That is the very fallacy I was complaining about. You are taking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;not necessarily real&quot; to imply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;necessarily unreal&quot;. (NB: RITSIAR is not intended as a claim of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; certainty. If you are just saying nothing is certain, you are nto
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; saying much).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I should sympathise with your complaint if in fact I was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claiming that, but I'm not.  I'm just saying that *any* theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entity - which is the limit of can what we possess epistemologically -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is necessarily an incomplete representation of what we take it to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refer to, for the reasons I've given.
</em><br />
<br />I haven't seen any reasons, you just seem to keep re-asserting it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; difference between physics and comp is that in terms of the former
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; there's virtually no way of expressing this thought coherently,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; whereas in terms of the latter it's a key aspect of the theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Since the thought is unfounded, I don't see why that is an issue.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, if that is your view, I can see why you would think that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The unique feature of consciousness is not - as you claim - its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 'epistemic' certainty, but its status as what is *ontologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; certain*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Whatever that means.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; It means its status as evidence by acquaintance of at least some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; indubitable aspects of 'what it is to be' something.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; All that is delivered induibably is how things seem. Consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; does not offer any gold-plated insight into what things are. including
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is perhaps an example of the 'self abnegation' I refer to above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whilst there clearly is nothing 'gold plated' about any particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insight available *through* consciousness, we must nonetheless keep
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tight hold of the fact that it is consciousness that is the unique
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *vehicle* for such insights - and indeed for any hold on reality that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we possess.
</em><br />
<br />Now you are taking my claim that cosnciousness
<br />
doesn't deliver a reliable and unproblematic ontology to mean
<br />
osnciosuness doesn't tell us
<br />
anything about anything.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And one cannot coherently claim that this vehicle is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; essentially radically other than it *appears*, because in this case to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appear is to *be* - and of course vice versa.  So the extrapolation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from this is that the fundamental intuition of 'existence' on which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all - and I do mean *all* - the others parasitise, is that 'to be is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to appear'.
</em><br />
<br />Appearances can have underpinnings, and in this case
<br />
they are not revealed.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course this is hardly a new idea, but I feel that it is usually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (though by no means always) somewhat thoughtllessly dismissed, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hence its consequences don't get fully worked out.  There appears to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a sort of 'embarrassment issue' connected with it in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'professionally respectable' circles!  It is assumed - on no evidence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - that it must somehow contradict the known facts without adding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything to understanding, because nothing was missing before.  But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neither of these assumptions is the case IMO.  Consequently I regard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this approach as a needful metaphysical illumination of - not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; replacement for - relational theories be they comp, PM, or whatsoever.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;To regard consciousness itself (or in Bruno's terms the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ontological first person) as merely the object of 'knowledge' is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; commit the fallacy of taking 'observation' in a naively literal sense:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; i.e. to require there to be an 'observer'.  But this, self-evidently,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; can only lead to infinite regress.  Consequently, consciousness does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not consist in the 'observation' of epistemic entities, but in their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; instantiation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Whatever that means. Surely if soemthign is insantiated, it exist and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is therefore ontological.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, that's what I'm saying of course.  Epistemic entities are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiated in consciousness - it is their ontic context.
</em><br />
<br />If it is “ontic” at all. We should not conclude that Middle
<br />
Earth is “ontic” because Hobbits are instantiated there...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Further,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as I've said above, it is the *unique* ontic context.  Of course this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is what is claimed by Plotinus, the Vedantic literature etc, and I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying it bears careful scrutiny.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I mean that consciousness isn't what we observe in others - or in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; functioning of our brains - it's what they experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Consciousness doesn't seem to be the funcitoning of brains. But then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; diamond doesn;t seem to be the same as graphite.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now we're back with the first-person / third-person distinction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Surely you see the difference?  Sometimes you seem to argue for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elimination, sometimes for dual-aspect.  Which is it to be?
</em><br />
<br />I have never been arguing for elimination. There is a problem in
<br />
ignoring the appearance aspect of consciousness, and there is a
<br />
problem
<br />
in treating it as a free-floating appearance
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; But this view relies on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the denial (in an unavoidably Freudian sense) that the physical is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; known exclusively in terms of conscious representations on which all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; extrapolation to an 'observable' reality rests.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No it doesn't. Why shouldn;t consciousness know the non-conscious?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You are blurring epistemology and ontoloy again. I can paint
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the Taj Mahal in oils, that doesn't mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; here is anything oil-painting-ish abotu the Taj Mahal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well I hope you can see now that I'm not in the least claiming that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the conscious can't know the non-conscious.  Rather, I'm trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clarify their relation.  If I'm claiming that 'consciousness' (for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want of a less contentious term) is the unique ontic context, then it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would appear that to ascribe non-consciousness to anything is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; longer tenable.  But this is not so - rather, we need to think in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms of what is relevant in context.  So it is relevant in context
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that, for example, I possess a conscious representation of the Taj
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mahal, but what isn't relevant in context is what that representation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is conscious-of - i.e. it has become in effect non-conscious.
</em><br />
<br />If eveything is conscious, the Taj Mahal is conscious. Saying it
<br />
isn't “relevant” puts that fact under the carpet, it doesn't make it
<br />
vanish.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Since such representations are not in themselves observable (though of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; course not unknowable) it is unreasonable to suppose that any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; putatively 'final' ontology known entirely on the basis of observation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; could ever be considered a complete account of the situation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Who says they are unobsrvable? We can introspect them qua
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness, and observe their neurological basis to boot.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah.  It's the regress.
</em><br />
<br />What regress?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;They're not fundamentally 'observed', because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the regress. They're fundamentally be'ed (you see - we don't have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; word for it).  IOW, to observe is to *be* the representation.  That's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what makes it an ontic category, and that's what makes epistemology a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *functional* (what-it's-for) aspect of the ontic .  What-it's-for is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to function as a reference to a more inclusive generalised context
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'external' to the representation, but within the same ontic category.
</em><br />
<br />??????
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You are assuming that consciousness is unobserved. But as I pointed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; out in the brain-scannign argument, there is good reason to think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that all the *information* in phenomenal cosnciousness is in fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physically available. What is missing in physical descriptions is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the mode of presentation of that informaiton  to the first person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A red quale doesn't convey information over and above &quot;that is red&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We're getting into the third-person / first person confusion here.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume you mean by consciousness in &quot;consciousness is unobserved&quot; its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; putative observable correlates - which of course are ex hypothesi
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observable.  Your brain scanning point is similarly circular - IOW if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you take consciousness to be exhausted by its physical correlates then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obviously a complete account of these is equivalent to &quot;all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *information* in phenomenal consciousness is in fact physically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; available&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />I am not making a circular argument. We can take the brain-scan
<br />
to be all the information because the quale red does not convey any
<br />
information beyond “this is red”
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The bit you choose to gloss over is &quot;the mode of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presentation of that information to the first person&quot;, as though it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were self-evident that this could be exhausted by third-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description, and all that is missing is some processual account of its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'mode of presentation'.
</em><br />
<br />Not at all. The mode of presentation *does* differ between  seeming
<br />
red
<br />
and “this is red”. But they are different presentations of the same
<br />
informartion.
<br />
It is only the mode of presentaiton that is different.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree of course that  &quot;a red quale doesn't convey information over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and above &quot;that is red&quot;, but this is because information - i.e. what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be taken out-of-context - can only ever be ostensive in this way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's how it operates - it relies on *pointing* towards (i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; referring to) something that is instantiated qualitatively.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; redness consists in *being redly* - the abstractable content consists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in pointing and saying &quot;like that&quot;.  It's like a set of instructions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for *reproducing the experience in context*.  And that - for perfectly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sound logical reasons - is why it can never be captured as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information.  It's at this point that some people panic and become
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eliminativists.  I know you're not one of those, but then the problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that if you don't claim ontic primacy for qualitative existence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you've backed yourself into unacknowledged dualism.
</em><br />
<br />Tha depends what else I am taking to be primary.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW, essentially similar issues are at the heart of my &quot;little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theological divergence&quot; with Bruno.  I'm biding my time to see how the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seven-step math plays out before re-engaging on this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The 'arbitrariness' is inherent in the burden of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the term 'functionalism', which is intrinsically neutral as to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; details of physical implementation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; No, there are two quite differnt claim here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1. A function can have multiple instantions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2. Anything can instantiate any function.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It's a pity you didn't comment on that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well I wasn't sure what you meant.  Does 2) refer to the 'rock'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument?  Well, if a rock consistently output the results of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculations I tapped into its surface, I might be convinced it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiated the relevant functions.  Actually, a calculator is a sort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of rock that does precisely that, so maybe that says something about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the difference between 1) and 2).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But my complaint doesn't consist in the denial of 1), but rather in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its consequences for CTM+PM.  IOW, if CTM+PM consists in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conjunction of the two claims that a) specific physical processes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiate an (invariant) conscious state and b) any one of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (variable) collection of physical processes functionally equivalent to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a specific computation instantiates the same (invariant) conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state, then c) I find this claim to be incoherent in virtue of its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sweeping the incompatibility of 'invariant' and 'variable' under the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rug.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It highlights the invariance of computational outcome of a class
</em><br />
&nbsp;of processes whilst ignoring the physical variability of each
<br />
process;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since it is the latter that is postulated as responsible for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, the former is irrelevant to the case.  Gedanken
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments like MGA and Olympia seek to make this more explicit by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reductio, but personally I find the contention prima facie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implausible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David
</em><br />
<br />I  can't make much sense of that,. Are you using “variant” to mean
<br />
“varying over time”?
<br />
<br />The actual claim is that there are N physical process that map onto
<br />
any 01 computaional
<br />
process, and M computaional process that map onto consciousness, so
<br />
that consciousness
<br />
has N*M possible physical realisations. I don't see the inconsistency
<br />
there.
