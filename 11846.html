OK.  I follow all of your logic (propositional calculus) once we get
<br />
into it.  There are two problems with going too far in this.  One has
<br />
been noted before, that this is pretty technical stuff, although I
<br />
enjoy it and would like to hear it out.  The other problem is how all
<br />
of this logic connects to Everything.  That is why I am trying to
<br />
understand the 0-person.  I think questioning the 0-person might be the
<br />
same thing as questioning the assumption of Arithmetic Realism (AR),
<br />
but I'm not sure.  In the past it may have sounded like I was
<br />
supporting AR, but actually I was just arguing that physicalism is not
<br />
any more well founded than AR.  What I am worried about is that all of
<br />
the fancy calculus might end up being something like string theory,
<br />
beautiful but how can it be proven that it is the key to understanding
<br />
and living in the world around us?

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2. This 0-person cannot be the basis for saying that the scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; discourse (and allegedly the Everything List discussions) has to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; an impersonal basis.  As you say, this 0-person has no discourse.  And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the hypothetical existence of a 0-person does not rule out the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; existence of person at the deepest level to which we can relate (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; persons).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The trick is that a lobian machine as rich as ZF is able to prove the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole (provable and unprovable by PA) theology of a simpler lobian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine like PA. There is nothing hypothetical in the notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;arithmetical truth&quot; from the pov of a rich (set theoretically based)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lobian machine. Faith arrives only when a machine begins to bet on its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *own* correct theology, i.e. its *own* G* if you want (or G* minus G).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
Here you talk as if the 0-person is always relative to a given limited
<br />
G.  But above you say that the 0-person is viewed from outside
<br />
everywhere (nowhere), i.e. an absolute notion.  Which is it?

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I believe the reasoning behind an impersonal basis is based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on the desire to get away from the personal at the core level of being.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think so. It comes only from the scientist desire to get away
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of first person truth in the scientific discourse. Actually, the cute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing here is that we get a extremely powerful defense of the existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the first person, at the core level of being (despite the need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restrict the scientific discourse in the third person discourse).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
Doesn't the 3rd person provide the discourse of 1st person?  Again, why
<br />
is the 0-person needed?  You didn't answer that question above; you
<br />
simply restated what the 0-person is.

<br />
So the 3rd person is the discourse of the 1st person.  OK.  That's
<br />
simply labeling what's there.  It isn't trying to get away from 1st
<br />
person truth.  We don't have to *try* to get away from 1st person
<br />
truth.  When we say anything about 1st person we *automatically* are in
<br />
the 3rd person by definition.

<br />
What I am calling into question is the need for 0-person, and the
<br />
motive for saying we need it.  As I stated before, I think it is an
<br />
attempt to elevate the impersonal to the &quot;god&quot; level.  That way we
<br />
don't have to worry about the personal at the core of being because
<br />
we've artifically stuck the impersonal at the core.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exercice: show that the UD is not a Universal Machine (at all). It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough to show that the UD cannot crash. Indeed it has no inputs! (Now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a sense in which we could say that the UD is &quot;borned crashed&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given that it is programmed for non stopping (my usual definition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; crashed). So there is a sense to say that the UD is a &quot;crashed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal machine&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
The other definition of crashing is that the machine takes an input for
<br />
which the output is not defined.  So since the UD does not have an
<br />
input, crashing is not possible.

<br />
I also see your reasoning about the &quot;crashed UM&quot; based on your usual
<br />
definition of crashed.  But this makes me think that I should not trust
<br />
the output of the UD, if it is &quot;crashed&quot;.  So would you call a machine
<br />
that generates the natural numbers a crashed machine?  Probably just a
<br />
linguistic curiosity.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Weyl quote is interesting though in that it cites the infinite in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; first half in reference to good, and it cites our finiteness in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; second half in reference to evil.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I would say that our finiteness (or other limitations such as a need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for a particular reference frame) is not sufficient for the existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of evil.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, evil belongs intrinsically to the realm of the ideally correct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-observing universal machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...

</em><br />
Again, simply realizing our own limitations is not cause for doing
<br />
evil.  It is when we are dissatified with our own limitations, and we
<br />
want to elevate ourselves above where we are, that we are tempted to do
<br />
evil.  We are finite, so there will always be a level at which it will
<br />
be impossible for us to see truth and operate in it.  Elevating our
<br />
understanding inside of our capabilities is good, I am not discounting
<br />
that.  But it is a simple mathematical problem that we will always find
<br />
a limit to what we can do.  This is fine.  No evil yet.  But it is when
<br />
we try to go above that limit at all costs, taking &quot;more is better&quot; as
<br />
our ultimate motto, that we end up stepping on others to do it.

<br />
So what is the answer?  What is the &quot;balance&quot; (not a good word) between
<br />
a) staying within our limits and b) the expanding our knowledge by a
<br />
combination of leaps of intuition and logical inference?  I have a view
<br />
of this, but it will be good to get others' views also.  Hint: I think
<br />
this is connected to Stathis' post, that this is where faith comes in.
<br />
More later.

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is my point.  We go too far when we let our view of the &quot;natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; order&quot; (or &quot;god&quot;!) be the dictator of what can happen.  Indeed this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; actually making ourselves the center of the universe (multiverse).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is against the true essence of spirituality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with you. &quot;Naturalism&quot; as implicit metaphysics or theology is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as fake as any form of authoritative dogma. Of course a *doubting*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; naturalist can remain scientific. But a naturalist who says that when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we die, we will not born again (like many materialist believes) is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;religious&quot; in the worst sense of the word. The truth is that we don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know, but can propose theories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With comp, it is easy to kill oneself ... locally. It is harder  ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; globally.  With comp it remains possible that consciousness is a sort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of prison, as Otto Rossler extracts from Descartes (I agree with him on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
It is interesting that strict naturalism is a prison, and yet with comp
<br />
you also end up in a prison.  Anything that is based on us being at the
<br />
center is a prison.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If God is the one who does miracles, then from his Gods-eye view a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; miracle is simply a rare event, not inconsistent at all.  But from our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; view a miracle is something that punctuates the equilibrium of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computable &quot;natural order&quot; that we have deduced from the relative calm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in which we live.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps. I have only extracted the logic of &quot;probability/credibility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one&quot;. I will cautiously not venture myself on the very hard notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;historical rare event&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;future&quot; white rabbits,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which must be explained away if the comp idea has to survive).
