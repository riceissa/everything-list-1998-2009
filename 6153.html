I have somewhat arbitrarily defined &quot;free will&quot; as voluntary actions that 
<br />
are both &quot;self-determined&quot; by a Self-Aware Object, and are not predictable. 
<br />
My reasoning is that if something is completely predictable, then there is 
<br />
no option for change, hence no free will..
<br />
<br />On this issue, Jonathan Colvin apparently disagrees, since he states that 
<br />
&quot;There is no contradiction between determinism / predictability and free 
<br />
will, so long as free will is viewed as self-determinism.&quot;
<br />
<br />But free will would be a meaningless concept in a deterministic universe. 
<br />
If the future were completely predictable then how could there be free will? 
<br />
Everything would be pre-ordained.
<br />
<br />But, as Heisenberg shows us, the future cannot be predicted.  Unpredictable 
<br />
choices are made by SAO's, therefore free will exists.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If &quot;free will&quot; simply means &quot;self-determination&quot; then Jonathan is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; says, &quot;the only relevant question as to whether our will is free is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether our conscious minds (our selves) determine our actions.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But what about the sufferers of schizophrenia who Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; referred to?  They exercise self-determination, and their mental state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is such that their actions, at least in some cases, are completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predictable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do they have free will?
</em><br />
<br />I don't see that the actions of schizophrenia patients are any more
<br />
predictable than yours or mine. In fact, people suffering from this disease
<br />
are often *less* predictable (which is why schizophrenia can sometimes be
<br />
dangerous). To the extent that their actions are controlled by their
<br />
conscious minds, they have free will. If they feel they are being &quot;forced&quot;
<br />
to act contrary to their will (speculatively, perhaps by *random* excitation
<br />
of parts of their brain), I would suggest that they do *not* have free will
<br />
in such cases, because their actions are not willed by their conscious
<br />
minds. In this case randomness is contrary to free will, illustrating why
<br />
basing free will on unpredictability is a fallacy.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another example might be a self-aware computer of the future that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be programmed to have predictable actions as well as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-determination.  Would it have free will?
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br />Although what do you mean by &quot;predictable&quot;? Its actions might be predictable
<br />
only insofar as an identical program subjected to identical stimulus would
<br />
give identical actions (its actions might be predictable / deterministic but
<br />
computationally irreducible).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In both cases, the actions of the Self-Aware Organism are predictable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hence their will is not free.  They are bound by their destiny.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see how mere predictability is incompatible with free will. Your
<br />
actions too are predictable. If I set you in the middle of a highway with a
<br />
large bus heading for you, I predict you will move out of the way, unless
<br />
you are suicidal. Does that mean *you* do not have free will?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To have free will, the actions of a SAO cannot be completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predictable.
</em><br />
<br />Why not? There is no contradiction between determinism / predictability and
<br />
free will, so long as free will is viewed as self-determinism.
