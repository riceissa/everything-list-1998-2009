<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...I think we may basically agree, but there are some differences. If you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; look at it from a third person perspective, continuity of personal identity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over time is not only a delusion but a rather strange and inconsistent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delusion.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not quite sure I understand why you say this.  Do you only
<br />
mean that *continuity* can be manipulated, e.g., on the one hand
<br />
we suffer a discontinuity every night when we fall asleep;  on 
<br />
the other, in the future it will be possible to record your
<br />
Monday experience, your Tuesday experience, etc., and then
<br />
a few months later play them back in reverse sequence? (We might
<br />
even give the latter replays tremendous measure, so that so far
<br />
as the parameter *time* is concerned, almost all of your Mondays
<br />
occurred after your Wednesdays.
<br />
<br />Or do you mean more?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nevertheless, in the manner of delusions, realising this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intellectually does not make the delusion any less real at the &quot;gut&quot; level 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of first person experience. Using my example where I am to be copied 10 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times tomorrow and one copy tortured, I view this as a 10% chance that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be tortured tomorrow. You point out that this is not really correct: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a 100% chance that one copy of me will be tortured and a 0% chance 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the other 9 copies will be tortured, and all 10 copies have an equal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim to being &quot;me&quot;. This is the objective truth, but that doesn't make me 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feel any differently about the matter.
</em><br />
<br />I agree completely.  It's just that we have now advanced conceptually
<br />
so that our feelings no longer match what we know to be the truth.
<br />
We still feel that the Earth is stationary and the sun moves, but now
<br />
we know better. Likewise this feeling that you have a 10% chance of
<br />
experiencing X is not anything that we are going to be able to shake soon.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still feel that there is a 10% 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chance I will be tortured, and I still feel relieved that I am one of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lucky copies when tomorrow comes and I am not tortured. There is an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistency here in that today I identify with all the copies and tomorrow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I identify with only one, but so what? As you say, that is how our minds 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have evolved.
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the experiences of the copy who is to be tortured will eventually be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; merged with those of the non-tortured copies, that changes the situation, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because then it is *guaranteed* that I will eventually experience the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; torture.
</em><br />
<br />Good point. To be precise let's say that tomorrow you will split into
<br />
the ten copies, one of which will be tortured. Then one *year* from
<br />
now merging is scheduled to occur. Therefore you behave differently?
<br />
I don't think you should.  (You may *have* to because that's how we
<br />
are built, but you still shouldn't.)
<br />
<br />As I like to say &quot;just because you are not (locally) experiencing
<br />
something, doesn't mean it isn't happening to you&quot;. Suppose that
<br />
you don't know whether any merging is to ever happen. How should
<br />
that change the way you feel about your copy being tortured? Now,
<br />
I grant that you don't get the sweaty palms if there won't be
<br />
any merging, but to me that's just a base animalistic reflex action.
<br />
The truth is that *you* are in two places at the same time, and in
<br />
the other place you are hurting a lot.
<br />
<br />The point is that *now* your duplicate is in pain. For purely
<br />
selfish reasons, this should be a big deal to you, I contend.
<br />
Whether or not eons from now some merging does or does not
<br />
take place shouldn't change your approval or disapproval of
<br />
physical events taking place now.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would worry similarly if I were to inherit the experiences of any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unrelated third person; the fact that it is other copies of me who are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suffering does not in itself make any selfish difference.
</em><br />
<br />Two points. First, if it's an &quot;unrelated third person&quot;, it becomes
<br />
very unclear what merging would mean. We ran into a little of that
<br />
with trying to obtain memories of having been a bat.
<br />
<br />Second, I don't think that the sudden acquisition of memories is
<br />
nearly as big a deal as the actual, first-time-though gaining of
<br />
an experience. I would vastly rather be given the memories of
<br />
having been tortured than to actually experience it (and retain
<br />
the memory).  (Some very nice thought experiments obtain when
<br />
one plays off experience vs. memory-acquisition.)
