<br /><br /><br />David, you are still too mild  IMO. You wrote:
<br />
&quot;... &quot;there is a mathematical formalism in which interaction is modelled in
<br />
terms of 'fields'&quot;.
<br />
I would say: we call 'fields' what seems to be callable 'interaction' upon
<br />
the outcome of certain mathematical transformations - or something similar.
<br />
The similarity of math formulas does not justify implication  of some
<br />
&quot;physical reality&quot; - whatever that may mean.
<br />
What 'SPINS'? What undulates into Waves? Russell's &quot;... emergent effects
<br />
from virtual boson exchange. ...&quot; are indeed virtually (imaginary?) emergent
<br />
VIRTUAL effects from a virtual exchange of virtual bosons. I agree: that
<br />
would not match your &quot;Fair enough&quot;.
<br />
I like your quest for &quot;de-formalized participants&quot; (like e.g. energy?)
<br />
<br />H and other atoms are ingenius representatives serving explanation for
<br />
things observed scimpily in ages of epistemic insufficiency by
<br />
'age'-adjusted instrumentation.
<br />
And with new epistemic enrichment science does not 'reconsider' what was
<br />
'believed', but modifies it to maintain the 'earlier' adjusted to the later
<br />
information (e.g. entropy in its 15th or so variation). Molecules were
<br />
rod-connected atom-figments, then turned into electric connections, then
<br />
secondary attraction-agglomerates, more functional than were the orig.
<br />
primitive bindings. It still does not fit for biology, this embryonic state
<br />
limited model- science as applied for the elusive &quot;life&quot; processes.
<br />
<br />Something happens and we 'think' what. Those ingenius(ly applied) math
<br />
equations based on previous cut-model quantization (disregarding the
<br />
influence of the 'beyond model' total
<br />
world) are 'matched' by constants, new math, or even for such purpose
<br />
invented concepts which, however, in the 274th consecutive application are
<br />
considered &quot;facts&quot;.
<br />
The 'matches' are considered WITHIN the aspects included into the model,
<br />
other aspect unmatches form 'paradoxes', or necessitate axioms. &quot;MY&quot;
<br />
synthesized macromolecules(?) were successfully applicable in practical
<br />
technology - in the same realm they were made for. The mass of an electron
<br />
matches miraculously to other results within the same wing of the edifice of
<br />
scientific branch.
<br />
<br />And how about your mentioned 'agency'? it is all figured in our human
<br />
patterns, what and how WE should do to get to an effect (maybe poorly
<br />
observed!). Nature does not have to follow our logic or mechanism. We know
<br />
only a part of it, understand it by our logic, make it pars pro toto and
<br />
describe nature in our actual human ways.
<br />
That is conventional science in which I made a good living, successful
<br />
practical results, publications and reputation in my branch. Then I started
<br />
to think.
<br />
We live on misconceptions and a &quot;new&quot; paradigm is still in those.
<br />
<br />It is always a joy to read your posts.
<br />
<br />John

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (Other than sensing being a particular subclass of interaction)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please, spare me the physico-mathematical imperialism!  You say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;interaction is in terms of fields'&quot;.  I think what you might claim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more modestly is something like &quot;there is a mathematical formalism in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which interaction is modelled in terms of 'fields'&quot;.  Fair enough. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implicitly the formalism is a projection from (and reference to) a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *participatory* actuality which isn't simply 'mathematical' (pace
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno - and anyway, not in the sense he deploys it for the purposes of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP).  And I'm not of course imputing 'sensing' to the formalism, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the 'de-formalised participants' from which it is projected.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Participatory' here means that you must situate yourself at the point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of reference of your formalism, and intuit that 'thou-art-that' from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which the projection originates.  If you do this, does the term
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'sensing' still seem so 'soft'?  The formalisms are projections from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the participatory semantics of a 'modulated continuum' that embraces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you, me and everything we know.  When you situate yourself here, do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you really not 'get' the intuitive self-relation between continuum and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modulation? Even when you know that Russell's 1-person world - an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'emergent' from this - indeed self-relates in both sense and action?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If not, then as Colin is arguing, you'd have to erect a sign with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'then magic happens' between 'emergent' and 'reductive' accounts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Sensing to me implies some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; form of agency at one end of the interaction. I don't attribute any sort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of agency to the interaction between two hydrogen atoms making up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a hydrogen molecule for instance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Same illustration. 'Hydrogen atoms' are again just projective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formalisms to which of course nobody would impute 'agency'.  But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situate yourself where I suggest, and intuit the actions of any 'de-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formalised participants' referenced by the term 'hydrogen atoms' that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are implicated in Russell's 1-person world.  From this perspective,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any 'agency' that Russell displays is indeed inherent in such lower-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level 'entities' in 'reduced' form.  This is a perfectly standard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aspect of any 'reductive-emergent' scheme.  For some reason you seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prepared to grant it in a 3-person account, but not in a participatory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The customary 'liquidity' and 'life' counter-arguments are simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misconceived here, because these attributions emerge from, and hence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are applicable to, formal descriptions, independent of their 'de-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formalised' participatory referents.  But you can't apply the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; semantics of 'sensing' and 'agency' in the same way, because these are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ineluctably participatory, and are coherent only when intuited as such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'all the way down' (e.g. as attributes of 1-person worlds and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; participatory 'sense-action' hierarchies on which they supervene).

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; locate', 'knows it's there', etc.) is already inescapably present in

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the notion of 'interaction' between fundamental 'entities' in any
