</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see why it should be. It does not conform to our

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  because everything is 'just there' - superposed, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it were. So, sure there's a 'layer' at which the individual 1st-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'emerges', but it's taking everything else 'working together' to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; manifest it. So in this sense, for me, it's all 'personal'. But maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not for you.
</em><br />
<br />This business of what 'conforms to our experience' I think is fairly
<br />
deep. I used to be adamant that, whether or not 'timeless' theories
<br />
could be shown to be true or false on any other grounds, that they
<br />
simply didn't 'conform to our experience'. I was, however, also
<br />
suspicious of my own doubts: after all, we can't feel the earth moving,
<br />
and everyone knows you need to keep pushing things or otherwise they
<br />
grind to a halt. So I tried to go on an imaginative journey that might
<br />
take me into this apparently static realm but nevertheless preserve
<br />
something like 'what we experience'.
<br />
<br />In my mind's eye I placed myself in the various 'points of view' that
<br />
'timelessly' exist within these structures. What would I see? Well,
<br />
whatever was manifested to me in virtue of 'my' local capabilities and
<br />
the perceptual information available to this 'me'. Would these
<br />
experiences be discrete, or would they be overlaid or 'smeared' with
<br />
information from other perspectives? Well, it seemed to me that what is
<br />
characteristic about our experience, what makes it seem 'sequential',
<br />
is precisely what we *can no longer* or *can't yet* see, the
<br />
information we *don't* have access to. And so despite the 'superposed'
<br />
existence of these other states, delimitations of access to information
<br />
would act to make each capsule discrete. All the capsules capable of it
<br />
are 'conscious', but the localisation of information prevents there
<br />
being a 'totalising' point of view.
<br />
<br />The next puzzle for me was why any of this would 'feel' dynamic. This
<br />
IMO is a subset of the qualia issue - i.e. why does anything feel
<br />
anyhow? Now, given that the arena under consideration consists in a
<br />
both a 'substrate' and the structures within it, it has both
<br />
distributed and all-at-once aspects. Could it not be the the dynamic
<br />
temporal 'feel' is the tension between these two? All dynamism derives
<br />
from contrast, and this seems to offer it. Putting these elements
<br />
together (over a period of time involving many 'thought voyages') has
<br />
re-aligned my intuition to make the scenario seem more plausible, at
<br />
least experientially.
<br />
<br />Finally we come to the question of all these 'mes'. They all exist, and
<br />
they're all conscious (the ones that are, that is). What's different
<br />
about the other parts of the structure? Why aren't *they* conscious?
<br />
They're just organised differently, just like the parts *within*
<br />
persons that aren't conscious (ever), or the part that just went to
<br />
sleep, or died. So the whole structure, reflexively, *to itself*, is
<br />
manifesting consciously, unconsciously, and no doubt every nuance in
<br />
between and beyond. That's my capital-P Personal. I strongly suspect
<br />
that you find this way of thinking uncongenial, which is absolutely
<br />
fine by me. But I've tried to describe it as clearly as I can, and
<br />
perhaps we can do no better than leave it at that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That isn't at all clear to me - mainly because you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are nto makign the all-improtant distinction between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures-structures and qualia-structures.
</em><br />
<br />The qualia-structures are the fact of *being* the differentiated
<br />
substrate, and they manifest as 'feel', as distinct from 'possessing
<br />
properties'. The structure-structures are the observed relations
<br />
derived from these experiences, which also give us our relational or
<br />
'property' view of things.
<br />
<br />Why is it not possible that *being* a substrate differentiated in a
<br />
particular way just *feels like* a particular existential/ experiential
<br />
quality to the differentiated substrate in question? I find the choice
<br />
of vocabulary here almost impossible, because it's not the sort of
<br />
thing we're used to trying to communicate. But we're trying to
<br />
comprehend a sort of reflexivity, a 'seeming-to-itself'. How would you
<br />
prefer to characterise it? Is it critical to your conception that
<br />
qualia are individual irreducible 'feels' and are subjectively neither
<br />
analysable or synthesisable even to the 'feeler'? I feel that we're
<br />
getting to the point here where the problem stems from interpreting our
<br />
personal experience in characteristically different ways, and this may
<br />
simply be irreconcilable. As you say:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I disagree. I can discern no structure *within* the taste
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of lemon or the colour red. There are relations between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tastes, colours and so on, but they underdiefine the tastes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and colurs themselves.
</em><br />
<br />I agree about the underdefinition, but beyond this can one really
<br />
debate something so personal as what one can 'discern'? I can't think
<br />
of any further argument to advance this here, so &quot;Wovon man nicht
<br />
sprechen kann, darüber muß man schweigen&quot;.
<br />
<br />At this stage, and attempting to recall our various points of
<br />
departure, are you able to summarise what substantive areas of dispute
<br />
may remain that do not boil down to imaginative or linguistic
<br />
preference? I mean this genuinely, not rhetorically. I have discovered
<br />
many points of agreement in thinking about your interesting
<br />
presentation of your views, and your pointed questions to this juncture
<br />
have been most helpful in getting me to formulate justifications with
<br />
as much precision as I can. I'm only sorry I don't do better, but words
<br />
often fail me (or do I fail them?)

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I disagree. I can discern no structure *within* the taste

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If I attempt to imagine what the 'bare
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; substrate' would *feel* like, I am frankly at a loss because it *seems*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to be devoid of content - what would there be to be 'felt'? But beyond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the substrate we have the equally fundamental IMO notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; differentiation (a neutral term I'm using because it isn't committed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a purely 'physical' view) and it seems to me that the intersection of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; substrate and differentiation could well *be* the direct experience of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; content.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The substrate could be differnentiated into properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that have no further reducible structure -- ie qualities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  I also call such content 'structure' because it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; differentiated but if you'd rather reserve this for the relational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; idea, so be it.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Correlation is not identity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Precisely. But the correlation of qualia with structurally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; differentiated 'physical' phenomena leads to the intuition that qualia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; themselves may be an *experiential synthesis* based on structural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; differentiation of the same bare ('property-less' in your own terms)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; substrate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is an  experiential synthesis ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The substrate, as you say elsewhere, provides enduring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; existence within which the properties manifest and change. I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; suggesting that the *existence* of the differentiated substrate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *synthesises* the qualia (i.e. they entail multiple differentiations)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and the mutual *relations* of the differentiated substrate *are* the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'properties'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; BTW, when I meditate on a substrate whose differentiation resolves into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'me' 'you' and other persons, I tend to 'take it personally'.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'impersonal' gaps between persons are IMO no different in kind than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; gaps between my own experiences at different times, places, branches of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; MW, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have no idea why you would think that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The substrate is in these terms a single 'potential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiencer'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's a potential everything. Why an experiencer in particular ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The actual experiences it possesses are then a function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of an infinite network of differentiation. I've said something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; elsewhere about the implications of this for the perception of time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; both as discrete, rather than totalised, experiences, and as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'dynamic' quale, mediated by discrete 'capsules' of locally-delimited
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Mutual relations are not internal relations. Purple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; lies between red and blue, but being told that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; doens't tell you what purple looks like unless you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; already know what red and blue look like. Realtional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; information about colours does not convey the colours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Nothing can 'tell you what purple looks like'. Purple is a medium that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; carries information, not information itself. However, the *feel* of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; purple may seem related to the *feel* of blue. Isn't this ultimately a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; matter for each 'seemer' to meditate on?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; If that were the case, there would be no HP, and threfore no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; need for any first-personness worth arguing about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't think that the HP is a useful idea.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's hardly relevant! Problems are problems. They
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't slink away if you accuse them of uselessness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  I think there is existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and this is something I 'take personally' because it *seems* to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; manifest as me, and other mes, all of whom I find it intuitive to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conceive as subsets of a much Vaster me, with 'conscious regions' (e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'me yesterday', 'me on the branch where I didn't have that last beer',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'Peter five minutes ago') and 'unconscious regions' (e.g. 'me after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that last beer', interstellar space, a rock).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ontology is all about what you take as fundamental,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and why. Your grounds for taking the me/not-me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction as fundamental seem subjective and inutitive rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than logical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  The EP is the observable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; behaviour (information content) of all this, insofar as we have access
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to and can make sense of it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There must be a reason why the Ep is easy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; That is still pure Chalmers -- natural supervenience is not identity,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; after all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well, if 'experience' is the fact of *being* differentiable existence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and 'the physical' is the observable relations thereof, then both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ultimately 'supervene' on there being something rather than nothing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No. There being something rather than nothing is only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1 buit of  information: not enough for a universe to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervene on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A set of complex, changing  properrties can only supervene on another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of complex, changing properties.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Further correlation is IMO an empirical issue from which might stem a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; more robust theoretical model embracing both. If this is the substance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of Chalmers' claim then I suppose I would go along with it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How - by relational modulation of the 0-personal substrate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; If you modulate a bunch of relations , you get another bunch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of relations. That is no departure from reductive physicalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes, but that's not what I meant. You experience as the fact of *being*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the 'modulated' (differentiated) substrate, not *observing* it (i.e. as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information). You do of course observe it, but that then is 2nd-order,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the relational level of information, not the substrate level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am beginning to think your substrate is one level above my substrate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is why I insist that differentiation is as 'primitive'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as the substrate, in the sense that there is nothing in the notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'substrate' as a semantic container for 'bare enduring existence' that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would lead you to suppose that it was differentiable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But you cna't hav edifferentiation without something to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be differentiated. So the substrate is more basic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There's no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reducible 'process of differentiation' at this semantic level, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rather having introduced the notion of difference, you can then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; synthesise this into whatever sort of differentiation/ structure/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relation/ content you need for your theoretical ends.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; If you are going to continue being unable to specify what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; personal about your primordial 1st peson, then that would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; be better, yes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't really want to go back into the word dispute, but as I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; implied above, this may just be an aspect of explanatory style. Of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; course I never meant to claim that the substrate is a 'person' as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conventionally conceived,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's just the problem I have. How can you have personality without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persons ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but as I say, I can't help 'taking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; personally' the existent thing from which I and all persons are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emanating. I think, imaginatvely, that if one pictures a 'block
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universe', Platonia, MW, or any non-process conception of reality, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is more intuitive,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see why it should be. It does not conform to our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  because everything is 'just there' - superposed, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it were. So, sure there's a 'layer' at which the individual 1st-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'emerges', but it's taking everything else 'working together' to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; manifest it. So in this sense, for me, it's all 'personal'. But maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not for you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; It all depends on what you mean by physical. For me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; what physicalism means beyond materialism is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; all properties are quantitiative and relational. A consequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; is that there is no layering of any significant kind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You're on to something here, I think. Of course you're right that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physical description renders the other 'chemical', 'biological' etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; schemas redundant. However, this is clearly not the case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experientially, and this seems a very fundamental distinction. 'Form'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for example exists experientially where it is a redundant concept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physically (though not Platonically). So there is something that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; producing a 'layering' that is shaping what we experience and in what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; way. I've already suggested that experience is the fact of *being* the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; structured substrate, and when we start to conceive the structure in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; terms of behaviour (i.e. treat it dynamically) what emerges may well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; display the characteristics of a  perceiver+perceptual model system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That isn't at all clear to me - mainly because you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are nto makign the all-improtant distinction between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures-structures and qualia-structures.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; These characteristics would include the 'forms' of its perceptions and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the modalities of their qualia, including the 'dynamic' quale of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; temporal experience. This would yield a relational treatment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience which would could be correlated to whatever degree with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physical description. The results of this would be an empirical test of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conjectured 'supervenience' relations.
