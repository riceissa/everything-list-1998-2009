Well this is fascinating! I tend to think that Brent's 'simplistic' 
<br />
approach of setting up oscillating EM fields of specific frequencies at 
<br />
specific locations is more likely to be good evidence of EM involvement 
<br />
in qualia, because the victim, I mean experimental subject, can relate 
<br />
what is happening. Do it to enough naive subjects and, if their accounts 
<br />
of the changes wrought in their experience agree with your predictions, 
<br />
you will have provisional verification. Just make sure you have a 
<br />
falsifiable prediction first.
<br />
<br />On the other hand Colin's project seems out of reach to me. This is 
<br />
probably because I don't really understand it. I do not, for example, 
<br />
understand how Colin seems to think that we can dispense with the 
<br />
concept of representation. I am however very sceptical of all 'quantum' 
<br />
mechanical/entanglement theories of consciousness. As far as I can see 
<br />
humans are 'classical' in nature, built out of fundamental particles 
<br />
like everything else in the universe of course, but we can live and move 
<br />
and have our being BECAUSE each one of us, and the major parts which 
<br />
compose us, are all big enough to endure over and above the quantum 
<br />
uncertainty. So we don't 'flit in and out of existence' like some people 
<br />
say. We wake up, go to sleep, dose off at the wrong time, forget what we 
<br />
are doing, live through social/cultural descriptions of the world, dream 
<br />
and aspire, and sometimes experience amazing insights which can turn our 
<br />
lives around. We survive and endure by doing mostly the tried and true 
<br />
things we have learned so well that they are deeply ingrained habits. 
<br />
Most of what we do, perceive, and think is so stolidly habitual and 
<br />
'built-in' that we are almost completely unaware of it; it is fixtures 
<br />
and fittings of the mind if you like. It all works for us, and the whole 
<br />
social and cultural milieu of economic and personal transactions, 
<br />
accounting, appointments, whatever, can happen so successfully BECAUSE 
<br />
so much of what we are and do is solidly habitual and predictable. In my 
<br />
simplistic view, consciousness is the registration of discrepancy 
<br />
between what the brain has predicted compared to what actually happened. 
<br />
Everything else, the bulk of what constitutes the mind in effect, is the 
<br />
ceaseless evoking, selecting, ignoring or suppressing, storing, 
<br />
amalgamating or splitting of the dynamic logical structures which 
<br />
represent our world, and without which we are just lumps of meat. These 
<br />
dynamic logical structures actually EXIST during their evocation. [And 
<br />
this is why there is 'something it is like to be ...']
<br />
<br />This may seem like a very boring view of things but I think now there is 
<br />
an amazing amount of explanation already available concerning human 
<br />
experience. I am not saying there is nothing new to discover, far from 
<br />
it, just that the continuous denial that most of the pieces of the 
<br />
puzzle are already exposed and arranged in the right order is not helpful.
<br />
<br />What ought to be clear to everybody is that our awareness of being here, 
<br />
of being anything in fact, entails a continuous process of 
<br />
self-referencing. It entails a continuous process of locating self in 
<br />
one's world. This self-referencing is always inherently partial and 
<br />
incomplete, but unless this incompleteness itself is explicitly 
<br />
represented, we are not aware of it. We are only ever aware of 
<br />
relationships explicitly represented and being explicitly represented 
<br />
entails inclusion of representation of at least some aspects of how 
<br />
whatever it is, is, was, will be, or might become, causally connected to 
<br />
oneself. When we perceive or imagine things, it is always from a view 
<br />
point, listening point, or at a point of contact. The 'location' of 
<br />
something or someone is an intrinsic part of its or their identity, and 
<br />
the key element of location as such is in relation to oneself or in 
<br />
relation to someone who we ourselves identify with; they are extensions 
<br />
of ourselves.
<br />
<br />I'll leave that there for the moment. I just want to add that I believe 
<br />
Colin Hales is right in focussing on the ability of humans to do 
<br />
science. I look at that more from the point of view that being able to 
<br />
do science, and being able to perceive and understand entropy - even if 
<br />
it is only grasping where crumbs and fluff balls come from -  are what 
<br />
allow us to know that we are NOT in some kind of computer generated 
<br />
matrix. We live in a real, open universe that exists independently of 
<br />
each of us but yet is incomplete without us.

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I understand your conclusion, that a model of a brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; won't be able to handle novelty like a real brain,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but I am trying to understand the nuts and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bolts of how the model is going to fail. For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; example, you can say that perpetual motion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; machines are impossible because they disobey
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the first or second law of thermodynamics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but you can also look at a particular design of such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; machine &gt; and point out where the moving parts are going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to slow down due to friction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, you have the brain and the model of the brain,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and you present them both with the same novel situation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; say an auditory stimulus. They both process the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stimulus and produce a response in the form of efferent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; impulses which move the vocal cords and produce speech;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but the brain says something clever while  the computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; declares that it is lost for words. The obvious explanation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is that the computer model is not good enough, and maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a better model would  perform better, but I think you would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; say that *no* model, no matter how good, could match the brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, we agree that the brain contains matter which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; follows the laws of physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Before the novel stimulus is applied the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is in configuration x. The stimulus essentially adds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; energy to the brain in a very specific way, and as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; result of this the brain undergoes a very complex sequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of physical changes, ending up in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; configuration y, in the process outputting energy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a very specific way which causes the vocal cords to move.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The important point is, in the transformations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; x-&gt;y the various parts of the brain are just working
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like parts of an elaborate Rube Goldberg mechanism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There can be no surprises, because that would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; magic: two positively charged entities suddenly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; start attracting each other, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the hammer hits the pendulum and no momentum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is transferred. If there is magic -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually worse than that, unpredictable magic -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then it won't be possible to model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the brain or the Rube Goldberg machine. But, barring magic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it should be possible to predict the physical state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; transitions x-&gt;y and hence you will know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what the motor output to the vocal cords will be and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what the vocal response to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; novel  stimulus will be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Classical chaos and quantum uncertainty may make it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult or impossible to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; predict what a particular brain will do on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; particular day, but they should not be  a theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; impediment to modelling a generic brain which behaves in an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; acceptably brain-like manner. Only unpredictable magical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; effects would prevent that.

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I get where you're coming from. The problem is, what I am going to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; will, in your eyes, put the reason into the class of 'magic'. I am quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; used to it, and don't find it magical at all....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem is that the distal objects that are the subject about which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the brain is informing itself, are literally, physically involved in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; process. You can't model them, because you don't know what they are. All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; you have is sensory measurements and they are local and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; ambiguous....that's why you are doing the 'qualia dance' with EM fields -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to 'cohere' with the external world. This non-locality is the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; non-locality observed in QM and makes gravity 'action at a distance'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; possible. ..... I've been thinking about this for so long I actually have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the reverse problem now...I find 'locality' really weird! I find 'extent'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; really hard to fathom. The non-locality is also predicted as the solution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to the 'unity' issue.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; The empirical testing to verify this non-locality is the real target of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; eventual experimentation. My model and the real chips will behave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; differently, it is predicted, because of the involvement of the 'external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; world' that is not available to the model.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope to be able to 'switch off' the qualia whilst holding eveything else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the same. The effects on subsequent learning will be indicative of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; involvement of the qualia in learning. What the external world 'looks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; like' in the brain is 'virtual circuits' - average EM channels (regions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; low potential that are like a temporary 'wire') down which chemistry can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; flow to alter synaptic weights and rearrange channel positions/rafting in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the membrane and so on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; So I guess my proclaimations about models are all contingent on my own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; view of things...and I could be wrong. Only time will tell. I have good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; physical grounds to doubt that modelling can work and I have a way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; testing it. So at least it can be resolved some day.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;       
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm not sure of the details of your experiments, but wouldn't the most direct 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; way to prove what you are saying be to isolate just that physical process 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which cannot be modelled? For example, if it is EM fields, set up an appropriately 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; brain-like configuration of EM fields, introduce some environmental input, then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; show that the response of the fields deviates from what Maxwell's equations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would predict.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think Colin is claiming the fields deviate from Maxwell's equations - he says they are good descriptions, they just miss the qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Seems to me it would be a lot simpler to set up some EM fields of various spatial and frequency variation and see if they change your qualia.
