Stathis -
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would have guessed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that as the universe expands, chemical and nuclear reactions are less likely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to occur, in the same way as chemical reaction rates are proportional to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concentration the reagents. On the other hand, it is not clear to me how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more exotic processes such as spontaneous appearance of particles out of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vacuum are affected by the expansion, which after all results in &quot;more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vacuum&quot; - doesn't it?
</em><br />
<br />We had some discussion a while back about a paper which proposed some
<br />
similar ideas, <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0208013">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0208013</a>, Disturbing
<br />
implications of a cosmological constant.  If you want to look in the
<br />
archives, the thread was called &quot;Doomsday-like argument in cosmology&quot;
<br />
and was in August 2002.
<br />
<br />According to this paper, if there is a cosmological constant then
<br />
the expansion of the universe will accelerate and eventually reach
<br />
what is called a de Sitter state, where it is expanding exponentially.
<br />
However the authors suggest that we could simply imagine our yardsticks
<br />
also expanding exponentially, and the universe would then be in a
<br />
steady state.  In a steady state universe, fluctuations such as you
<br />
describe will occur and all possible universes will eventually exist,
<br />
in fact they will come into existence an infinite number of times.
<br />
<br />Now, I never really understood the physics involved here.  I tried
<br />
to learn about de Sitter universes and the data I got was somewhat
<br />
contradictory.  Some writers suggested that the mass density was zero in
<br />
such a universe.  It certainly seems odd to suggest that the yardsticks
<br />
can expand without realizing that this would cause particles to appear to
<br />
contract, presumably with physical implications similar to the questions
<br />
you raise.
<br />
<br />However the authors were physicists and supposedly know their stuff.
<br />
So maybe it is true that even in our current cosmological models, random
<br />
fluctuations will be able to bring future universes into existence.
<br />
<br />The point of this paper was that in that case, since such universes occur
<br />
an infinite number of times, it is infinitely unlikely that we should
<br />
find ourselves in the first one, the &quot;original&quot; universe which is evolving
<br />
from the Big Bang and just transitioning into the de Sitter expansion.
<br />
Hence, on anthropic principles, this is a contradiction.
<br />
<br />One might propose to resolve it by suggesting that in fact we don't live
<br />
in the primordial universe, but are in one of the fluctuations.  However
<br />
this doesn't work, because fluctuation universes are overwhelmingly
<br />
likely to look very different from our universe.  The chance that an
<br />
observer in a fluctuation universe would see a past that was consistent
<br />
with a Big Bang is essentially zero.  So again, the anthropic principle
<br />
seems to indicate that our observations are inconsistent.  We can't
<br />
both observe a universe with an infinite number of (eventual) observers,
<br />
and see ourselves in such a unique position.
<br />
<br />I still wonder about the physical assumptions that treat the de Sitter
<br />
state as a steady state.  That little coordinate transform seemed pretty
<br />
fishy to me.  I don't know if this paper ever got peer reviewed but I'd
<br />
take it a lot more seriously if or when that happens.
<br />
