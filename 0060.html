<em class="quotelev1">&gt; selectively eliminating &quot;poverty-branches&quot; (or at least making them

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observerless) by linking them to suicide mechanisms. That will have

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the effect of increasing the consentration of wealthy brances. This

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is somewhat analogous to killing the poor people in the world in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order to thereby raise the average standard of living.
</em><br />
<br />I think this is a good way to think about the situation. But regardless of
<br />
how you think about it, there is something wrong with a theory that says
<br />
playing Russian roulette is rational. If nothing else the number of people
<br />
who believe the theory will dwindle very quickly. (Note that this is a
<br />
different paradox from the one we've been talking about. Here the
<br />
experiment itself is a choice, not just the bet.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What, more exactly, do X and Y stand for? A perception is an object, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but strictly speeking, so far as I can see at least, probabilities 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apply only to propositions. Saying that these propositions are of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form &quot;There will be an experience of type A.&quot; might not be enough; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for that proposition would be true whether there is one or several 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instances of experiences of type A, and you seem to want to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguish these cases. &quot;I will have an experience of type A.&quot; might 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not do either, since at t=0 there is no fact of the matter as to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which future instance of your mind will actually be &quot;you&quot;. &quot;There 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be n instances of experiences of type A.&quot; might be the right way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to go.
</em><br />
<br />The P(X|Y) notation comes from Tegmark's TOE paper. It means the
<br />
probability that I will perceive X after subjective time t, given that
<br />
I've perceived Y so far. A problem with the AUH is that it is not at all
<br />
clear how to define probabilities for general propositions, or that such
<br />
probabilities would mean anything. This is especially true for my more
<br />
radical AUH which says binary strings are the fundamental objects that
<br />
have independent existence, and universes are interpretations of certain
<br />
collections of strings. How would you define the probability for &quot;There
<br />
will be n instances of experiences of type A.&quot;? 
<br />
<br />I am uncomfortable with the definition of probability that I proposed
<br />
since it seems very radical to have probabilities that are greater than 1.
<br />
I would love to see an alternative if it also solves the problems I've
<br />
mentioned with Tegmark's definition.
