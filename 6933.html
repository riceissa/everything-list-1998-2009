<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Could someone please explain what will happen to the hapless transhumanists 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in their computer when their measure falls to alarmingly low levels? Will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they develop severe headaches, turn transparent like ghosts, or what?
</em><br />
<br />This is a kind of transformation that hasn't been possible in the world
<br />
before, so no normal phenomenon will exactly capture what happens.
<br />
<br />To a first approximation, if their measure were reduced by 90%, what
<br />
would happen subjectively would be the same as if they took steps that
<br />
had a 90% chance of killing them, in this model.
<br />
<br />Now, objectively this is different because it would require other people
<br />
to deal with their deaths.  But subjectively it would be pretty much
<br />
the same.
<br />
<br />Perhaps a closer approximation could be achieved if they were not only
<br />
killed, but somehow everyone else's memory was changed so that no one
<br />
remembered them or noticed that they were gone.
<br />
<br />Imagine instead the question, what would it be like, subjectively,
<br />
to die instantly and without warning?  It's a hard question to answer.
<br />
But it is related to the question, what would it be it like to have your
<br />
measure suddenly reduced?  You could imagine your larger before-measure
<br />
as being represented by your mind being instantiated as many copies.
<br />
Then a certain percentage of those copies are instantly killed.  What is
<br />
it like subjectively?
<br />
<br />To the copies which remain, there is no subjective change.  To the
<br />
copies which were killed, perhaps it is like nothing subjectively,
<br />
because there is no longer any subject there.  But it is still a change.
<br />
<br />I think a reduction of measure would be like a certain percentage of
<br />
my instances being instantly killed.  When I imagine what it is like,
<br />
I picture myself being one of the unlucky instances.  I stop and never
<br />
know I stopped, while other copies go on.
<br />
<br />The other night I had a strange dream.  I came into a room and met someone
<br />
whom I came to understand was myself.  I was a copy who had been created
<br />
a few moments earlier, and he was the original.  There was a switch on
<br />
the wall which would instantly destroy the copy, and I was supposed to
<br />
push it.  But I hesitated.  My own consciousness would be destroyed.
<br />
On the other hand I was supposedly a copy made just moments earlier,
<br />
so only a few seconds of memories would be lost, hardly consequential.
<br />
Still I had to face that dilemma: what would it feel like to just stop,
<br />
instantly?
<br />
<br />Nervously, I went ahead and pushed the button, squeezing my eyes shut
<br />
and making a kind of mental &quot;flinch&quot; or jerk.  To my surprise, I was
<br />
still there, and when I opened my eyes, the other person was gone.
<br />
It turned out that he was the copy and I was the original.
<br />
<br />Imagine facing your copy, perhaps an exact copy whose mind is synchronized
<br />
with yours, and seeing a coin flip which will determine which one is
<br />
destroyed.  Your measure will be halved.  In a sense it will have no
<br />
subjective effect, your thoughts and memories will be preserved in one
<br />
of you.  But in another sense you face a 50-50 chance of experiencing that
<br />
mysterous effect of instant death.  I think it would be scary.  Logically,
<br />
similar reductions of measure should be viewed in the same light.
