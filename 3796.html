<br />
I want to give a solid example of a time-varying set and how it relates 
<br />
to possible worlds (and even to MWI).
<br />
<br />Consider that cat being chased by the dog.
<br />
<br />Is the cat in the world in which he will escape the dog or is in the 
<br />
world in which the dog catches him?
<br />
<br />One answer is &quot;That lies in the future. We don't know yet.&quot;
<br />
<br />Another is: &quot;All knowledge is Bayesian. Based on his running in the 
<br />
past, I'll lay odds of 5 to 2 that he'll escape the dog.&quot;
<br />
<br />A MWI-flavored version is: &quot;There are many worlds in which he escapes, 
<br />
many where he doesn't. We'll only see one of the possible worlds.&quot;
<br />
<br />And then there's the strictly Boolean, determinist point of view:
<br />
<br />&quot;The cat is in one of the two possible worlds you describe. A 
<br />
sufficiently powerful being or computer able to calculate all of the 
<br />
factors, including the wind speeds, the slipperiness of the stairs, and 
<br />
so on, knows which world we are in.&quot;
<br />
<br />I think the last point is actually the most naive of all of the views, 
<br />
as it simply &quot;punts&quot; the question and asserts that some omiscient, 
<br />
omnicomputing entity knows the future...or, regardless of any such 
<br />
being, that the future is determined. (This gets into free will issues, 
<br />
obviously.)
<br />
<br />In the other approaches, the Boolean &quot;cat is in one world or in other 
<br />
world&quot; is replaced by a time-varying set:
<br />
<br />-- &quot;We don't yet know which world the cat is in, or which world we are 
<br />
in along with the cat, but in a few minutes we'll know for sure.&quot; (And 
<br />
everyone will agree on this...there will be no disagreement amongst 
<br />
honest observers as to whether got away or got caught by the dog.)
<br />
<br />I give this example to show that we don't need quantum weirdness to show 
<br />
how useful/important time-varying sets are, and how the logic of reality 
<br />
can be &quot;non-Boolean becoming Boolean,&quot; how the time morphism (passage of 
<br />
time) results in assignment of an event to one of N possible worlds.
<br />
<br />In other words, the naturalness of Heyting logic instead of Boolean 
<br />
logic. In other words, topos logic.
<br />
<br />(Aside: I don't claim that more and more powerful computes and analysis 
<br />
tools don't help us to either determine which universe we are in--by 
<br />
making predictions of stock movements, or weather, or wars, or the 
<br />
escape of that cat--or even by helping us to make our own changes which 
<br />
change the future. My ideas are not firm on this, but I think 
<br />
computational and cognitive power relates to how far forward in time 
<br />
this &quot;knowability&quot; extends. In the case of a billiard table, knowability 
<br />
may extend a few seconds into the future, for accuracy within some 
<br />
range. In the case of planetary motions, many millennia, for some 
<br />
accuracy. In the case of the cat....? My point about the &quot;omniscient&quot; 
<br />
model being a &quot;punt&quot; is that it simply defines omniscience as being 
<br />
enough to have complete knowledge. There is no evidence that such 
<br />
omniscience is possible, not even with all the computer power in the 
<br />
universe.)
