<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So you believe that the Qur'an is the literal word of God? What I was hoping is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you would say Muhammed was deluded or lying, so that the Qur'an is at best an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impressive piece of literature with some interesting moral teachings: i.e., what atheists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say about the Bible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stathis Papioannou
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; No, I was just answering your question.  I'm going out on a limb (not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; referring to Shirley McLane ;) but I think that the belief in Islam
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; about the Qur'an is that it fulfills the role of the 2nd/3rd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; hypostates, instead of the person of Jesus.  It is eternal and spans
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the infinite gap between God and man.  For the Christian, Jesus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; fulfills this role.  (Also, Jesus, being a person, solves the problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of the infinite relationship gap between us and God in a from-God-to-us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; direction rather than the from-us-to-God direction of good works. Good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; works are only finite.)  So as I see it the Christian has a different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; belief about the Bible than does the Muslim about the Qur'an.  There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; are plenty of good sources about the Christian's belief about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Bible, and evidence to support those beliefs, so I don't want to get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; into a long discussion about it on this List.  I'll just say that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; believe that a non-Christian can read the Bible, and about the Bible,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; to try to find out something in a rational way, just like reading any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; other book.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Sure, the Bible contains some historical facts, some moral teachings, some great literature,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as does the Qur'an. But there are literal conflicts between the Bible and the Qur'an, eg.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Muslims believe that Jesus was just another prophet, not God in human form [if that concept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is even coherent], while Christians do not believe that Muhammed actually took dictation from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; God. But in terms of empirical evidence, general plausibility, or even strength of conviction in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; believers, there isn't much to choose between the two faiths. Why do Christians and Muslims
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; agree on certain incredible-sounding things of which they generally have no direct experience,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; such as the Earth being spherical, but strongly disagree on other things such as the status of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Jesus and whether he really rose from the dead?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; People disagree on lots of things, especially if it touches on ultimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions, for instance as I mentioned about the Christians' belief
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that Jesus is the solution to the problem of evil (from-God-to-us) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Muslims' (and all other belief systems that recognize the problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evil) belief that the solution depends on our good works (or something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar, from-us-to-God/Good).  Do you recognize the problem of evil,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and if so, what do you believe is the solution?  Do you think that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MWI is the key to the solution?
</em><br />
<br />People disagree on lots of things, but they also agree on lots of things, many of which are on the face 
<br />
of it either incredible or unpleasant - because the evidence leaves them no choice. On matters of values and 
<br />
religion, however, they disagree far more frequently. In the case of values this is because they are not 
<br />
actually disgreeing about any empirical or logical fact: they are just saying this is the way I wish to live my 
<br />
life, this is what I hold to be good or important, this is what I would like other people to hold good or important. 
<br />
<br />In the case of religion, people disagree because they are selective in the evidence they accept because they 
<br />
want to believe something. Jews believe that God spoke to Moses, but they don't believe that God spoke to 
<br />
Muhammed. I don't think there is evidence that God spoke to either of them, but if your standards of evidence 
<br />
are much lower than mine and you accept one, you are being inconsistent if you don't accept the other. That is, 
<br />
if you think the sort of evidence presented in holy books, reports of miracles, religious experience, strength of 
<br />
faith in followers etc. is convincing, then pretty well every religion is equally convincing. That is not the case if 
<br />
you compare the evidence for a flat Earth versus a spherical Earth, for example.
<br />
<br />As for the Problem of Evil, that's easy: there is no evidence that there is a God; if there is a God, there is no 
<br />
evidence that he cares what happens to us; if he does care what happens to us there is no evidence that he 
<br />
intervenes in our lives; if he does intervene there is no evidence that things are any better than they would be 
<br />
if he didn't intervene.
