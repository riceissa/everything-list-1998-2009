<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (True, we can also extend sympathy by believing it to be utterly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; true that he is experiencing pain, but I think that John and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (and many) are simply not comfortable with introducing a &quot;reality&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; namely, &quot;subjective reality&quot; to cover this simple situation.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This amounts to dismissing the first person.
</em><br />
<br />As anything scientific, yes. I agreed with John's statement:
<br />
&quot;Interpreted used as subjectivised. There is a fine line separating
<br />
solipsism from craziness...&quot;  at least insofar as I may read that
<br />
to mean that our subjective impressions actually turn out to be
<br />
less reliable than our efforts to understand things objectively
<br />
(3rd person).
<br />
<br />So I dismiss the 1st person, remarking that it's &quot;existence&quot; is
<br />
but only to be expected. If an ape or a parrot could talk, it
<br />
could yak on about it's impressions. And they'd be of little
<br />
but therapeutic value.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am sure you did have known to be living some &quot;subjective reality&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Well, by that you mean what I'd call my own 1st person impressions
<br />
of the world. Yes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What exactly makes you not comfortable with the &quot;other mind&quot; reality?
</em><br />
<br />I don't want to ascribe &quot;reality&quot; either to *my* 1st person whacked
<br />
out drug-mediated experiences, or anyone else's.  I prefer to reserve
<br />
&quot;reality&quot; for 3rd person accounts.  &quot;the highest mountain in the world
<br />
is located in Tibet&quot; or some similar conjecture.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it the fact that it is not verifiable?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In that case again, incompleteness theorem can be used as a cure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because it makes utterly clear that for the sound machine there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many truth which are guess-able but unprovable.
</em><br />
<br />So you say.  And I confess I haven't the energy (and probably not
<br />
the preparation) to study your thesis. So I'll wait for the experts
<br />
to acclaim you.  No one will cheer louder:  &quot;I knew him *before*
<br />
the world saw the truth to COMP!  He even knows who I am!&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it the fact that once you accept the reality of the first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences, then we are led to that first person indeterminacy from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which the physical laws emerges, assuming comp (which you accept)?
</em><br />
<br />This might be a good time to ask what is meant by that word you
<br />
just used.  Hal explained &quot;computationalist hypothesis&quot; as used
<br />
by philosophers, e.g., that a robot (that was just CPU driven)
<br />
could be conscious.  I have believed that since 1966 when I used
<br />
to argue about it with people in high school. *Lots* of people
<br />
believe that.  I have taken &quot;COMP&quot; to be Bruno's Thesis, in which
<br />
practically everything can be derived fundamentally from the
<br />
integers alone, using Gödel's results, and other rather recently
<br />
discovered truths.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are neither a zombie, nor a solipsist, so what is the origin of you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dismissing the reality of first person experiences. I am very curious,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because, as you say, you are not the only one.
</em><br />
<br />Well, maybe some of the above helped to explain it. Basing stuff
<br />
on &quot;1st person&quot; has a long history. That's what everyone, it seems
<br />
to me, did before the scientific era (about 1600?). Even William
<br />
James, I think, did some of that.  So far as I know, nothing
<br />
has ever come of it.
<br />
<br />My friends and I (and probably Daniel Dennett and so on) believe
<br />
that people who demand a 1st person &quot;account of the world&quot; (e.g.
<br />
Chalmers) will never get anywhere. That the &quot;hard problem&quot; or
<br />
whatever is just a horrible consequence of the way sense impressions
<br />
traveling on neurons give rise to people thinking that their
<br />
own perceptions are a sort of reality independent of the physical
<br />
reality.  We think that this is a sort of delusion, although the
<br />
very #?!&amp;$-AT_SYMBOL-! structure of our language hideously leads from that
<br />
to &quot;who or what is being deluded?&quot;.
<br />
<br />That's it in a nutshell.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it because you do feel some inconsistency with your physicalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptions, once we take seriously the &quot;assumption&quot; that others can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feel genuine pleasures and pains.
</em><br />
<br />Hmm? Well, what you write here doesn't seem at all wrong to me.
<br />
I regard the &quot;assumption&quot; (as you call it) that others can feel
<br />
pain and pleasure to be about as accurate as a statement as &quot;less
<br />
light gets to the ground during the night&quot;.  That is, pretty basic.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway. We are not supposed to search comfort, but to reason from facts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and assumptions, isn't it?
</em><br />
<br />It was just a figure of speech.  You are free, of course, to use
<br />
the word &quot;reality&quot; any way you want.  I'm not comfortable for using
<br />
it to describes one's subjective impressions, feelings, etc.
<br />
