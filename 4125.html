<br />
Here is a thought experiment illustrating a paradox involving the first 
<br />
and third person point of views.
<br />
<br /><br />Romeo and Juliet, being very unhappy with their families, the Montague 
<br />
and the Capulet, decide to engage in QS. (By QS, I do not mean Quantum 
<br />
Sex, even though such an activity has intriguing possibilities indeed. 
<br />
This topic is beyond the subject addressed here so I will postpone it 
<br />
for a later posting)
<br />
<br />After discussing the idea of QS with their dear friend Mercutio, Romeo 
<br />
and Juliet decide to go ahead with the project. Mercutio design the 
<br />
machine and under his instruction, Balthasar, Romeo's loyal servant,  
<br />
builds a QS contraption capable of operating on two persons 
<br />
simultaneously. The QS machine is specifically designed not to operate 
<br />
if the feud between the Montague and Capulet families comes to an end. 
<br />
Otherwise the machine terminates itself with both persons inside it in a 
<br />
microsecond. Anyone within a radius of 20 feet of the machine is also 
<br />
terminated. A few days later, after a series of successful tests 
<br />
demonstrating the non-operation of the machine, (otherwise the tests 
<br />
would destroy the machine) the device is ready to operate.  Tearfully, 
<br />
Romeo and Juliet say their goodbyes to their dear friends. They kiss 
<br />
passionately, and slowly step into the machine. Balthasar moves away in 
<br />
a hurry afraid for his life. Romeo is sitting in front of the command 
<br />
panel. One last time, he looks at Juliet who gives him a nod. Romeo 
<br />
pushes the ignition button....
<br />
<br />... and nothing happens, Romeo and Juliet step out of the machine, and 
<br />
full of joy, run to their families to announce thier engagement and 
<br />
prepare their wedding...
<br />
...and a huge exposion shakes the ground... Balthasar is at a safe 
<br />
distance and is not hurt. However, Mercutio, who could not bear to lose 
<br />
his friends, had decided at the last minute to share their fate. He had 
<br />
moved within one foot of the machine when Romeo hit the iginition switch.
<br />
<br />Now here are a few questions involving first and third person points of 
<br />
views :
<br />
<br />Q1. What is the first person point of view of Juliet by Balthasar?
<br />
A1. He saw the machine explode. No more Juliet.
<br />
<br />Q2. What is the first person point of view of Juliet by Romeo?
<br />
A2. He sees his dear Juliet alive and well.
<br />
<br />Q3. What is the first person point of view of Juliet by Mercutio?
<br />
A3. He sees Juliet alive and well.
<br />
<br />Q4. What is the first person experience of Juliet by Juliet?
<br />
A4 She is happy to be alive and in love with Romeo.
<br />
<br />Now here is the trick question
<br />
Q5. What is the third person point of view of Juliet?
<br />
A5. Balthasar sees Juliet dead, but both Romeo and Mercutio see her 
<br />
alive and well.
<br />
<br />There lies the paradox.
<br />
<br />The question should be rephrased as:
<br />
1) What is the third person point of view of Juliet by Romeo,
<br />
2) What is the third person point of view of Juliet by Mercutio, and
<br />
3)What is the third person point of view of Juliet by Balthasar.
<br />
<br />This rephrasing however defeats the whole point of having a &quot;third&quot; 
<br />
objective person.
<br />
There is no such a thing as a third person.
<br />
The concept of third person should be rephrased in terms of persons 
<br />
sharing the same experience because they share the same frame of 
<br />
reference. In this thought experiment, both Romeo and Mercutio share the 
<br />
same frame of reference and therefore perceive Juliet in the same way.
<br />
<br />George
