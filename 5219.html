<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more sense than the alternative view (which I'll call &quot;Instantiationism&quot;):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here's my definition of &quot;Computational Realism&quot;, which is sort of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;restricted version of Mathematical Realism. (I'm not sure if my definition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is equivalent to what others call &quot;Arithmetic Realism&quot;, so I'm using a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different term.)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />OK. Just to cut the hair a little bit: with Church thesis &quot;computational 
<br />
realism&quot; is equivalent to
<br />
a restricted form of arithmetical realism. Comp. realism is equivalent to 
<br />
Arith. realism restricted
<br />
to the Sigma_1 sentences, i.e. those sentence which are provably equivalent 
<br />
(in Peano arithmetic, say) to sentences of the form &quot;it exists x such that 
<br />
p(x)&quot; with p(x) a decidable (recursive) predicate.
<br />
This is equivalent to say that either a machine (on any argument) will stop 
<br />
or will not stop, and this
<br />
independently of any actual running.  Indeed, sometimes I say that 
<br />
(Sigma_1) arithmetical realism
<br />
is equivalent to the belief in the excluded middle principe (that is &quot;A or 
<br />
not A) applied to
<br />
(Sigma_1) arithmetical sentences. (Sigma_1 sentences plays a prominant role 
<br />
in the derivation
<br />
of the logic of the physical propositions from the logic of the 
<br />
self-referential propositions). Actually
<br />
the Universal Dovetailing is arithmetically equivalent with an enumeration 
<br />
of all true Sigma_1 sentences. The key feature of those sentences is that 
<br />
their truth entails their provability (unlike
<br />
arbitrary sentences which can be true and not provable (by Peano 
<br />
arithmetic, for exemple).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let's say that you're about to physically implement some computation, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lets say that there are only three possible things that this computation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can do: return 0, return 1, or never halt. Computational Realism is simply 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the belief that *there is a fact of the matter* about what this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computation will do when you implement it, and that this fact is true 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*right now*, before you even begin the implementation. Furthermore, CR is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the belief that there is fact of the matter about what the result of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computation *would be*, even if it's never actually implemented. CR 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implies that there is such a fact of the matter about every conceivable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's from this perspective that I can begin to explain why I feel that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implementation is not a fundamental concept. In my view, implementing a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computation is a way of &quot;viewing&quot; a structure that already exists in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mathspace (or Platonia, or whatever you want to call it). Implementation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is clearly something that occurs within computational structures - for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instance, we can imagine creatures in a cellular automata implementing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computations on their computers, and they will have all the same concerns 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about &quot;physical resources&quot; that we do - computational complexity, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;NP-complete problems, etc. However, the entire infinite structure of their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;CA world exists *right now*, in Mathspace. If we consider the rules to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their CA, and consider an initial state (even an infinite one - say, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;digits of pi), then there is *a fact of the matter* about what the state 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the infinite lattice would be in ten ticks of the clock - or ten 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thousand, or ten million. And the key point is that the existence of these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;facts doesn't require &quot;resources&quot; - there's really no concept of resources 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at all at that level. Every single fact about every single possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computation is simply a fact, right now. Every conceivable NP-complete 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problem has an answer, and it doesn't require any &quot;computational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;resources&quot; for these answers to exist. But of course, computational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;creatures like us require computational resources to &quot;view&quot; these answers. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Since our resources are severely limited, we don't have access to most of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the truths in Mathspace.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't think that this form of realism automatically leads to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conclusion that ME == PE, but it certainly points in that direction. ME == 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;PE becomes especially appealing when we consider the infinite regress 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problem that the alternative position generates. You ask if your question 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is equivalent to the old &quot;first cause&quot; question. I propose that it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exactly equivalent, and brings with it all of the attendant paradoxes and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problems. If you believe that implementation is a fundamental concept - if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you believe that, somehow, our universe must be &quot;instantiated&quot;, or must 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have some other special quality that gives it its true reality - then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you've got an infinite regress problem. Certainly, I can imagine that our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe is instantiated in some larger computation, but then that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computation will have to be instantiated in something else to make *it* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;real... and where does it all end? Or is it turtles all the way down? Or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does our universe simply have the elusive quality of &quot;physical existence&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;while other mathematical structures lack it? In my opinion, the idea that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ME == PE points to a solution to these problems.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I agree, although I would say that &quot;physical existence&quot; is only a 
<br />
particular case of mathematical
<br />
existence, even a modal sort of existence. But that is another point, and 
<br />
actually I find your answer to Stephen quite clear and sufficient. Isn't it 
<br />
Stephen?
<br />
<br />About the question of applying &quot;probability&quot; to integers: there are more 
<br />
than one way to work
<br />
that problem, and technically this could lead us far away, and I have not 
<br />
the time to really say more.
<br />
Well I can give you a classical exercise in Number Theory: what is the 
<br />
probability that
<br />
two integers are coprime (= their biggest common divisor is 1). Answer: 
<br />
6/pi^2. Astonishing and
<br />
counter-intuitive. The meaning is that if you build an urn with N balls on 
<br />
which you put the N first integers, then, as N is bigger and bigger, the 
<br />
&quot;usual&quot; probability of taking two coprime &quot;balls&quot; will converge toward 6/pi^2.
<br />
What is the probability that k integers are coprime? Answer 1/zeta(k); 
<br />
where zeta is the famous Riemann Zeta function. The notion of Probability 
<br />
applied on infinite discrete sets or combinatorial structures often
<br />
invokes Zeta or related functions. Generalisation of zeta function (notably 
<br />
the multi-zeta functions) appears
<br />
also in the renormalisation problem in quantum field theory, and I guess 
<br />
they will find application in the last definitive steps of our white 
<br />
rabbits elimination ..., i.e. in our search for the measure on 
<br />
computational histories.
