<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now, even if you were enough clear so that I could find a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; discrepancy between your talk and the machine's one, it would not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessarily mean you are wrong: it could mean you are not a lobian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine or entity. My point is just that the comp hyp leads to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assertions about the physical &quot;world&quot; which are enough precise to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the comp hyp refutable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I realise that I'm not clear about exactly what you mean by saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I might not be a lobian machine or entity.  Do you mean this to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apply to me alone, or that the discrepancy might indicate that humans
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in general might not in fact be lobian?  Would my being 'right' in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'non-lobian' way amount to a proof that my reasoning could not be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationally based?  What are the principal assertions of comp that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be refutable in this regard, and how precisely?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually you could be lobian, but unsound, or worst, inconsistent. But  
<br />
I have no evidence.
<br />
You could be an &quot;angel&quot; ? (Like the PI-1 complete Anomega?): no,  
<br />
because they are lobian too (despite being not turing emulable).
<br />
You could be a &quot;supergod&quot; (non computational entities so close to the  
<br />
ONE that they are no more lobian). In that case the reasoning I do  
<br />
would not work for you, and in the case you can supply me with an  
<br />
argument which convince me that you are indeed a &quot;supergod&quot;, I would  
<br />
conclude indeed that all human are supergod, But this is academic: not  
<br />
only the &quot;supergod hypothesis&quot; is just not my working hypothesis, but I  
<br />
do think that we have no evidence at all for it. Still, my way of  
<br />
deriving physics works also for that (ridiculous) hypothesis, so  
<br />
&quot;supergodness&quot; like &quot;comp&quot; are refutable by deriving the physics and  
<br />
compare with observation. Of course if comp really implies an inflation  
<br />
of white rabbit provably bigger than the &quot;observed quantum one&quot;, that  
<br />
would be a case that we are supergods, perhaps.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Sometimes two different persons discussing in the list seems to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; different ideas where I can see that they are both correct, but just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; doesn't not look at things from the same angle or perspective. All  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is obviously related with the very intrinsical difficulty of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; subject itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Difficult indeed.  It would be very helpful if we could all find a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shared method to make the perspectives commensurable.  I suspect for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you this would be comp.
</em><br />
<br />OK, or just the numbers (with their additive and multiplication  
<br />
structures). The mimit discourse (John would say &quot;narrative&quot;) can be  
<br />
studied mathematically (thanks to Goel, Lob, Solovay, ...). &quot;comp&quot;  
<br />
points obviously to computer science (and mathematical logic)..
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Have you understand that the UDA literally gives no choice about what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; has to be taken as primitive element for any TOE once we assume the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; comp hyp?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think so, although my personal expressions of the intuition have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been different.  For example I was thinking recently of arguments of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the sort that seek to refute computationalism as a theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness by contrasting, say, a (however 'complete')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational model of digestion with a 'real' stomach digesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'real' food.  No one could mistake one for the other, runs the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument.  This seems true.  But it occurred to me that it wouldn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily be a mistake if 'real' stomachs and 'real' food were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'computational' too.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course. Imagine that the comp substitution level is so low that the  
<br />
opnly way to &quot;restore&quot; your consciousness artificially consts in  
<br />
duplicating at the level of elementary fermions and bosons the entire  
<br />
quantum state of the milky way. You can easily see (I think, just tell  
<br />
me if not) that the simulation of you in that galaxy simulation will  
<br />
call &quot;real stomach&quot; what we, from outside know to be parts of a very  
<br />
detailled computations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  IOW, if computation is to be the basis for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'reality', it must be 'computations all the way down'.
</em><br />
<br />Not if you are realistic on numbers with + and *. You can stop there.  
<br />
Of course you can take combinators or n-categories or whatever  
<br />
universal system you like. Ontically they are all equivalent. And  
<br />
epistemologically, well there are many differences, but those should  
<br />
emerge from any ontic reality (like the N,+,*) from inside.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ISTM that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA demonstrates rigorously the consequences of assuming otherwise,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and hence is a reductio of 'materialistic computationalism'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is true for the last (8 steps version) of the UDA. To be sure, in  
<br />
my theses I separate the UDA and the movie graph. UDA(+Movie-graph)  
<br />
shows the absurdity in believing in both primitive matter and  
<br />
computationalism indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Concerning the math, do you know the book by Torkel Franzen on the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; uses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and misuses of Godel theorems? Despite some big mistake I will talk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; about, it is a quite excellent book which I would recommend the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reading.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know it, and having perused the Davis book, I suspect it may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be beyond me without a lot of steering in the right direction.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You have to have the &quot;ah ah&quot; tilt. You have to understand that those  
<br />
matter are simpler than what your prejudice (about yourself probably)  
<br />
makes you think. Somehow, Godel original papers is the simpler and best  
<br />
presentation of his results.
<br />
Now the Franzen book can certainly give a big help. A good treatise is  
<br />
Mendelson book. Of course I know that if you are isolated, the &quot;ah ah&quot;  
<br />
can take time. perhaps in august we can come back at least on the proof  
<br />
of incompleteness based directly on Church thesis?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do you have a (passive) knowledge of first order logic? Do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; see that (with x, y ... belonging to the natural numbers).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (x div y) &lt;-&gt; Ez(x * z = y)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; prime(x) &lt;-&gt; (~(x = 1) &amp; Ay((y div x) -&gt; (y = 1 V y = x)))
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have a wiki-aided ('just-in-time') understanding, from which I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appreciate the validity of these propositions.
</em><br />
<br />So the real difficulty now consists in understanding that we can  
<br />
provide rules for transforming those strings in a truth preserving way,  
<br />
without any understanding of those strings. This is the difficulty of  
<br />
logic: to understand where you have to not try to understand strings.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do you have an idea how Godel manages to define in a similar way the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; provability predicate in the arithmetical language (= first order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; logical language + the symbols =, 0, +, *, s).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would really help to have the precise steps pointed out.
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps you could search and peruse the archive with key words like  
<br />
&quot;godel number&quot;, for example quickly:
<br />
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/browse_frm/thread/">http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/browse_frm/thread/</a> 
<br />
f5c02229299f1a02/e135df20765c927d? 
<br />
lnk=gst&amp;q=godel+number&amp;rnum=8&amp;hl=en#e135df20765c927d
<br />
<br />Or buy the book by Mendelson or the last (fourth) edition of Boolos and  
<br />
Jeffrey (and Burguess now).
<br />
before buying those books (or searching them in a library) try to know  
<br />
if you are willing to do the effort to understand the real technic. If  
<br />
not, try to force me to explain in english the main idea.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Perhaps you could think of making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some short summary of your points. Your last posts, imo,  were a bit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fuzzy by over-determination, I said even close to the 1004 fallacy ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll try - it may not be until I return from Scotland where I will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all of next week.
</em><br />
<br />Have a good trip :)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What could go possibly wrong in your approach, with respect of comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (and/or the lobian interview) is that sometimes I understand that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; want that your most primitive element belongs to the first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; realm. My problem here is that this is consistent with the comp hyp,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but this consistency is irrelevant as far as we are trying to make a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; communicable and refutable theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that Plotinus' theology has been helpful for me here in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguishing the 'primitive' as the 'solipsism of the One' rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the 'first person'.  The point here is that there is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ineliminable identification of the individual self with the One, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the sense of a part being identified with, and deriving its primitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characteristics from, the whole of which it is an aspect.  However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; although the One is (0) 'personal', it is not 'a person': only the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'parts' are.
</em><br />
<br />Exactly. From the point of view of the unameable self (alias the third  
<br />
hypostasis, the first person, S4Grz, the third God, etc.) there is  
<br />
indeed no difference between the One and itself. But, us, who are  
<br />
studying in a third person way the theology of a simpler lobian machine  
<br />
(simpler than us), and who know, by hypothesis, we are taliking on a  
<br />
ciorrect (sound) Lobian machine, we can see the gigantic difference  
<br />
between the one and the self. But, astonishingly the self does not see  
<br />
that difference, cannot even describe it, and is 100% correct about  
<br />
that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This one has to have communicable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (or at lest axiomatizable) third person primitive element. The lobian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;soul&quot; (alias first person or third hypostase) disagrees somehow with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this, but that lobian soul is not completely willing to make science  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the start!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since communicability and refutability must indeed occur exclusively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in terms of the third person, this places severe limits on what can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'relevant' in this sense.The disagreement, I think, comes from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'soul's' intuition that no amount of such third person discourse seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to yield an explanation of first person experience as such - only a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible justification of the belief in it.  Is it 'unscientific' to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be dissatisfied with this?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Not at all. Because it is a first person statement. What would be  
<br />
unscientific, would be to conclude from that first person  
<br />
dissatisfaction that such lack of explanation refutes the comp hyp,  
<br />
when precisely the comp hyp makes it possible to explain why each first  
<br />
person associated to any (correct) machine has to live with that  
<br />
frustration. We cannot explain qualia, but we can explain why, in case  
<br />
the comp hyp is true, qualia cannot be completely explained in a purely  
<br />
third person way.
<br />
In a sense, it is not funny to be a lobian machine. That consists in  
<br />
being a universal machine with all the cognitive abilities necessary to  
<br />
worry about the length of its &quot;tape&quot;, and the poorness of what she can  
<br />
communicate through it, compared to what she can observe, feel, resent,  
<br />
etc.
<br />
But then Art will develop among such machine too, as a way to pint on  
<br />
the uncommunicable we are all living.
