<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP: Well that, in a nutshell, is how I understand it; with the proviso

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it is dynamic: that all representations of all salient features and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changes in the environment and self. In the natural world this occurs

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because all the creatures in the past who/which failed significantly in this

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respect got eaten by something that stalked its way in between the updates,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or the creature in effect did not pay enough attention to its environment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and in consequence lost out somehow in ever contributing to the continuation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of its specie's gene pool.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis [in another response to me in this thread]: 'You can't prove that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a machine will be conscious in the same way you are.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP: Well, that depends what you mean;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    1. to what extent does it matter what I can prove anyway?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    2. exactly what or, rather, what range of sufficiently complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    systems are you referring to as 'machines';
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    3. what do you mean by 'conscious in the same way you are'?;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm sure others can think of equally or more interesting questions than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these, but I can respond to these.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    1. I am sure I couldn't prove whether or not a machine was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    conscious, but it the 'machine' was, and it was smart enough and interested
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    enough IT could, by engaging us in conversation about its experiences, what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    it felt like to be what/who it is, and questioning us about what it is like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    to be us. Furthermore, as Colin Hales has pointed out, if the machine was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    doing real science it would be pretty much conclusive that it was conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    2. By the word machine I could refer to many of the biological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    entities that are significantly less complex than humans. What ever one says
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    in this respect, someone somewhere is going to disagree, but I think maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    insects and the like could be quite reasonably be classed as sentient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    machines with near Zombie status.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    3. If we accept a rough and ready type of physicalism, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    naturalism maybe the word I am looking for here, then it is pretty much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    axiomatic that the consciousness of a creature/machine will differ from mine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    in the same degree that its body, instinctive behaviour, and environmental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    niche differ from mine. I think this must be true of all sentient entities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Some of the people I know are 'colour blind'; about half the people I know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    are female; many of the people I know exhibit quite substantial differences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    in temperament and predispositions. I take it that these differences from me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    are real and entail various real differences in the quality of what it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    like to be them [or rather their brain's updating of the model of them in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    their worlds].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am interested in birds [and here is meant the feathered variety] and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; often speculate about why they are doing what they do and what it may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like to be them. They have very small heads compared to mine so their brains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can update their models of self in the world very much faster than mine can.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This must mean that their perceptions of time and changes are very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different. To them I must be a very slow and stupid seeming terrestrial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; giant. Also many birds can see by means of ultra violet light. This means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that many things such as flowers and other birds will look very different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compared to what I see. [Aside: I am psyching myself up slowly to start
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creating a flight simulator program that flies birds rather than aircraft.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One of the challenges - by no mean the hardest though -  will be to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; represent UV reflectance in a meaningful way.]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
1. If it behaved as if it were conscious *and* it did this using the same
<br />
sort of hardware as I am using (i.e. a human brain) then I would agree that
<br />
almost certainly it is conscious. If the hardware were on a different
<br />
substrate but a direct analogue of a human brain and the result was a
<br />
functionally equivalent machine then I would be almost as confident, but if
<br />
the configuration were completely different I would not be confident that it
<br />
was conscious and I would bet that at least it was differently conscious. As
<br />
for scientific research, I never managed to understand why Colin thought
<br />
this was more than just a version of the Turing test.
<br />
<br />2. I don't consider biological machines to be fundamentally different to
<br />
other machines.
<br />
<br />3. Sure, different entities with (at least) functionally different brains
<br />
will be differently conscious. But I like to use &quot;conscious in the way I am&quot;
<br />
in order to avoid having to explain or define consciousness in general, or
<br />
my consciousness in particular. I can meaningfully talk about &quot;seeing red&quot;
<br />
to a blind person who has no idea what the experience is like: What
<br />
wavelengths of light lead me to see red? Can I still see red if my eyes are
<br />
closed or my optic nerve severed? What if I have a stroke in the visual
<br />
cortex? What if certain parts of my cortex are electrically stimulated? That
<br />
is, I can go a very long way with the definition &quot;that experience which i
<br />
have when a red coloured object enters my visual field&quot;.
<br />
<br />Stathis [from the other posting again]: 'There is good reason to believe
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the third person observable behaviour of the brain can be emulated,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the brain is just chemical reactions and chemistry is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well-understood field.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP: Once again it depends what you mean. Does 'Third person observable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour of the brain' include EEG recordings and the output of MRI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imaging? Or do you mean just the movements of muscles which is the main
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indicator of brain activity? If the former then I think that would be very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hard, perhaps impossible; if the latter however, that just might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; achievable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Huh? I think it would be a relatively trivial matter to emulate MRI and EEG
<br />
data, certainly compared to emulating behaviour as evidenced by muscle
<br />
activity (complex, intelligent behaviour such as doing science or writing
<br />
novels is after all just muscle activity, which is just chemical reactions
<br />
in the muscles triggered by chemical reactions in the brain).
<br />
<br />Stathis: 'I think it is very unlikely that something as elaborate as
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness could have developed with no evolutionary purpose (evolution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot distinguish between me and my zombie twin if zombies are possible),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it is a logical possibility.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP: I agree with the first bit, but I do not agree with the last bit. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you adopt what I call UMSITW [the Updating Model of Self In The World], then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything which impinges on consciousness, has a real effect on the brain. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effect the only feasible zombie like persons you will meet will either be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sleep walking or otherwise deficient as a consequence of drug use or brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trauma. I think Oliver Sachs's book The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gives many examples illustrating the point that all deficiencies in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness correlate strictly with lesions in the sufferer's brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />A human with an intact brain behaving like an awake human could not really
<br />
be a zombie unless you believe in magic. However, it is possible to conceive
<br />
of intelligently-behaving beings who do not have an internal life because
<br />
they lack the right sort of brains. I am not suggesting that this is the
<br />
case and there are reasons to think it is unlikely to be the case, but it is
<br />
not ruled out by any empirical observation.
