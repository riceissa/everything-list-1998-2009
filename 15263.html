<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. We may end up disagreeing about certain details (as any two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophers will), but we seem to both hold the same basic position.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have no position (just an argument). Years ago, in a moment of  
<br />
weakness I have mentionned my perpetually oscillating positions, from  
<br />
hoping comp true (false) and believing it is false (true), the bad  
<br />
days, and the goods days hoping it true (false) and wanting it true  
<br />
(false). I mean even my taste is oscillating. But I think nobody  
<br />
should really care about things like that. as a professional, if you  
<br />
want, I care only on the sharable deductive results which is mainly  
<br />
that you can't have both mind and matter both computable. And the  
<br />
related: If MECH is true, then MAT is false. NOT MAT or NOT MEC.
<br />
Read my post to John Mikes, which has been sent probably when you  
<br />
wrote your's. I am not a philosopher. If you really want to classify  
<br />
me, just say that I am a (neoneoplatonist) theologian (with or without  
<br />
grain of salt). I just take the opportunity of comp to transform  
<br />
philosophical problems into mathematical problems (nobody has to  
<br />
believe in the assumption, nor believe I believe them).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The question for the existence of mathematical physical universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (your mathematical physicalism) is an open one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm a little bit confused by this, coming on the heels of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; previous paragraph. Do you believe it's an open question whether or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not &quot;a person can be fully conscious like you or me, even when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directly implemented in arithmetic&quot;, or do you mean something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different when you say &quot;the existence of mathematical physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe&quot;? In any case, I take a strong stance on the former statement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - I think we have enough reason right now to conclude that it's  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I guess you mean, ASSUMING COMP, and after the UDA-MGA proof. Then,  
<br />
the use of word is delicate, and can be understood only through the  
<br />
understanding of the argument, really. I can make a cautious try.
<br />
<br />You cannot implement a person in arithmetic, because they are all  
<br />
already implemented in arithmetic. You can' do that for the same  
<br />
reason you cannot make, by yourself, 17 a prime number. 17 is already  
<br />
prime, and persons are already implemented.
<br />
<br />Now, you can apparently implement arithmetic in our most probable  
<br />
computational histories, note the &quot;s&quot;. I say &quot;apparently&quot; because it  
<br />
is an empirical fact. It is enough to implement a computer like the  
<br />
one in front of you right now. And you can implement a person, by  
<br />
yourself in a computer, except you have to solve the AI problem or to  
<br />
implement the universal dovetalier (and then be patient, and not to  
<br />
demanding because you will not been able to extract the people from  
<br />
the universal computation).
<br />
<br />Now, even in the lucky case you implement a person on a computer, the  
<br />
consciousness of that person will noy been exclusively related to the  
<br />
computer in front of view which executes the person. from the person  
<br />
point of view, she will feel executed by an infinity of programs,  
<br />
inddeed all those already implemented in arithmetic. Give me a bit of  
<br />
time, and I will try to make this clear in MGA 0. This should be  
<br />
understandbale if yopu really 1) grasp the seven steps, and 2) abandon  
<br />
materialism (through MGA or not). The UDA says something about  
<br />
physics, that simple mathematicalism does not say, and it is related  
<br />
to the fact that the UD existence relies on Church thesis, like  
<br />
physics (and more) will be related to incompleteness and the  
<br />
mathematical structure of universal machine ignorance.
<br />
<br />You seem to forget or to be unaware that, a priori, nowhere  in the  
<br />
deployment, does a physical structure arise. Physical structures arise  
<br />
in the &quot;memories&quot; of universal machine, and emerge, in a relative or  
<br />
conditional way, from a non computable (a priori) set of computable  
<br />
functions executions. Mathematical physicalism seems to invoke a  
<br />
program which would emulate somehow that sum on all computations; this  
<br />
seems impossible. But I agree that some facts are with you, it is a  
<br />
mystery (still too much non computable rabbits with comp). Yet if you  
<br />
are correct, then it means that your consciousness is defined by that  
<br />
the whole execution of that little programs. Comp is false, or is true  
<br />
but makes the whole universe my brain. Comp would be true in the  
<br />
weaker sense. Now, even if you are correct, it has to be justified  
<br />
completely from the comp hypothesis.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If it exists, we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to explain how it wins the &quot;measure of uncertainty&quot; battle on all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; other programs which reach also your mind computational state in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal deplyment. All right? (this follows from step seven).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you mean that if &quot;mathematical physicalism&quot; is true, we need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; offer a mathematical-physicalist solution to the &quot;white rabbit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />Any theory has to wash out its white rabbits.
<br />
Any modal realism has to wash out its inflation of inferable  
<br />
possibilities.
<br />
But I am saying a stronger things. Always assuming comp, of course.
<br />
I am saying that the question of the truth of &quot;mathematical  
<br />
physicalism&quot; has to be solved. Once you assume comp, it is an open  
<br />
problem. In with my insight I would say there is few chance it could  
<br />
be true. If by mathematicalism you mean that the big thing is a  
<br />
mathematical object, then I think mathematicalism is wrong. Assuming  
<br />
comp the big thing is, well, it has no name. If there is a theory of  
<br />
everything (and everyone), then its has to ba a [no-name]logist  
<br />
theory. despite this we can bet it is no more than arithmetical truth,  
<br />
but only by keeping in mind that this is equivalent to the &quot;yes  
<br />
doctor&quot; act of FAITH.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with that. And in fact, I don't claim to have a full
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solution to the white rabbit problem. However, I think the logical /
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical arguments against the materialist's conception of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;matter&quot; are so strong, and the replacement of that conception with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the concept of &quot;mathematical facts-of-the-matter&quot; is so fruitful, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the acceptance of mathematical physicalism is justified, even without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a full solution to the white rabbit problem.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Your intuition is similar to Tegmark. I think we can have even  
<br />
physical motivation for mathematicalism.
<br />
What I say, is that the comp hypothesis makes it possible to translate  
<br />
the mind-body problem into a mathematical measure problem. It does not  
<br />
mean comp is true. It means comp is sufficiently precise to translate  
<br />
philosophical problems into mathematical problems.
<br />
A bit like newton did with aristotle natural philosophy. With comp you  
<br />
get Plotinus theology, with matter described by a verifiable theory  
<br />
(of course here you need to translate effectively UDA in Arithmetic.  
<br />
This is AUDA, or the lobian machine interview, and that is really the  
<br />
advanced technical sequel of MGA. For that stage, you have not only to  
<br />
understand UDA+MGA, but you have to understand why any universal  
<br />
machine (believing in induction axioms) can understand UGA+MGA. This  
<br />
is a bit less simple, because it points of the fact that obvioulsy  
<br />
comp relies on computer science, and few people in the list does like  
<br />
I use it too much (the F_i and the W_i makes the people running  
<br />
away. ) But this is not needed for understanding the proof of the  
<br />
reversal.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Mathematical facts play the role that physical existence is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; supposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to play for materialists.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would say &quot;some mathematical facts&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I see your point, although someday later I might want to defend the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; position that I don't really need the word &quot;some&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />No I agree. If you see this, you have an idea that physics is a sum on  
<br />
all math. Then replace &quot;all math&quot; by &quot;all arithmetic&quot;, and you go near.
<br />
But the game for me is not to defend a position. It is to convince  
<br />
people by an argument.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; For that reason I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not sure you will appreciate the MGA, because you clearly seem to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; aware we don't need material stuff.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm interested to learn how similar the MGA is to my own reasons for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accepting what I'm calling &quot;mathematical physicalism&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If you have reasons, (other than taste), feel free to share them with  
<br />
us.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may turn out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be functionally identical to one of the arguments I've been using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (in my head). Or it may be a complementary argument that I've never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought of. Or it may turn out that I don't find the argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persuasive, which may in turn indicate that what I'm calling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical physicalism isn't actually identical to your position.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is certainly not my position, if you mean by my position &quot;what we  
<br />
have to believe if we say yes to the doctor and if (indeed) we survive  
<br />
the comp substitution&quot;.
<br />
<br />Then &quot;my position&quot; is &quot;mathematical physicalism&quot; (a bit à-la Tegmark)  
<br />
is wrong.
<br />
<br />I remain open that the process of hunting the white rabbits out would  
<br />
converge to mathematical physicalism, and this would be equivalent of  
<br />
making our substitution level lower and lower. If mathematical  
<br />
physicalism is 100% true, and if we still keep comp, then it means I  
<br />
can say yes to the doctor only if the doctor gives me a brain which  
<br />
simulates the entire universe. Well I am thinking here to a  
<br />
Sxhmidhuberian+Tegmarkian universe, and the &quot;truth&quot; is actually even  
<br />
more subtle.
<br />
<br />To sum up: mathematical physicalism, I just don't know, and I am sure  
<br />
it could depend how we choose to interpret the words physics and  
<br />
mathematics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I might just think there's an easier or better way to get the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusion. In any case, I think it would be fruitful.
</em><br />
<br />Write down your way. We just try to understand each other.
<br />
<br />In all what I say, the comp assumption plays the key role. My point is  
<br />
&quot;just&quot; that if we assume comp, then Physics has to be derived by  
<br />
gluing conditions on machine dreams. It is an open problem if that can  
<br />
lead to a physics capable of being described by a (computable?)  
<br />
mathematical object. I speculate (only) that it can't be.
<br />
<br />I could summarize my conclusion(s) in many ways. What I try to show is  
<br />
that the hypothesis COMP is testable. With comp, you have to extract  
<br />
physics from comp, in a precise unique way, then  do it (I show a way,  
<br />
there are others) and then compare the comp physics with empirical  
<br />
facts.
