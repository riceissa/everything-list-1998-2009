<br />
I was working on an essay on the nature of thought experiments about
<br />
copying, but it got bogged down, so I will make this short.  I am trying
<br />
to analyze it based on evolutionary considerations.  Copying is much like
<br />
biological reproduction and we can expect many of the same effects in
<br />
a society in which copying is a long-standing and widely used technology.
<br />
<br />The most important effect is that making copies will be desirable.
<br />
Just as genes try to reproduce themselves, so will people once that
<br />
becomes possible, and for the same reason: successful reproducers occupy
<br />
more of the universe's resources (i.e. have higher measure) and so these
<br />
habits tend to become more widespread.
<br />
<br />When we consider thought experiments involving copies, it is important to
<br />
understand these effects.  It is truly different to make a set of copies
<br />
than to experience a probabilistic event.  Making copies increases your
<br />
measure in the world; flipping a coin does not.  The decisions you will
<br />
make in the two cases are different as a result.
<br />
<br />One thought experiment was to consider two choices: flipping a coin and
<br />
being tortured if it came up a certain way; versus making several copies
<br />
and having one of them be tortured.  Assuming the copies are all going to
<br />
survive, clearly the latter would be the one selected by evolution.
<br />
<br />But note that this is still true if we reverse the probabilities: a
<br />
small probabilistic chance of being tortured, versus making one copy
<br />
(so there are two of you) and having one of them being tortured.  There,
<br />
too, I think the evolutionary approach would encourage making copies.
<br />
<br />Copying is such a bonus that it swamps consideration of quality of life.
<br />
In a world where people have adapted to copying, they would work as
<br />
hard to make a copy as they would in our world to avoid dying (each one
<br />
changes measure by plus or minus 100%).
<br />
<br />It might be objected that this approach does not shed much light on what
<br />
our expectations would be or should be about what we will experience when
<br />
we go through these transformations.  I agree with the perspective that
<br />
there is truly no &quot;fact of the matter&quot; about what it is like to have one
<br />
of these things happen.  All we can really do is look at the experiences
<br />
and memory of each person, at each moment.  No one will disagree about
<br />
what each person at each moment remembers and how many of them there are.
<br />
That is really all there is, factually.
<br />
<br />Our attempt to make these novel situations fit our conventional
<br />
expectations don't work because we currently have an implicit assumption
<br />
of mental continuity which is violated by copying experiments.  There
<br />
really is no meaningful and non-arbitrary way to map our current ways
<br />
of thinking about the future to a world where copying is possible.
<br />
<br />But what we can do is really just as good: we can predict how people
<br />
would and should behave.  Which preferences will they have in these
<br />
thought experiments?  How hard will they work to achieve one option versus
<br />
another?  Evolutionary theory provides guidelines and examples we can use
<br />
to understand how people will behave if and when copying becomes possible.
