<br />
ok, I guess I wasn't every clear about my theory.  I noticed that some 
<br />
people were misunderstanding what I was saying.  I find it hard sometimes to 
<br />
express my thoughts into written text.  Let me try to clear things up.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: Marchal &lt;marchal.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm not sure I understand your statement. Even if you take the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;moment&quot; as some primitive, I don't figure out what you mean by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;single moment&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />I started out by trying to understand conciousness.  I realized that it was 
<br />
impossible to understand unless you broke it down into many parts.  I 
<br />
visualized conciousness existing within a series of the smallest possible 
<br />
moments of time (plancke(sp?) time), with each moment following the other to 
<br />
form a smooth continuation of time.  Within each of these moments, our 
<br />
conciousness is in a certain state, with each conciousness state being a 
<br />
rational continuation of the previous state.  Keep in mind, there are two 
<br />
parts to our conciousness: a concious part and a subconcious part.  So, when 
<br />
I talk about a conciousness state, I am talking about both the concious and 
<br />
the subconcious - not just the concious.  The concious part of a 
<br />
'conciousness state' is a single moment of a thought.  Whatever happened to 
<br />
be filling your thoughts at that one single instant is the concious part of 
<br />
a conciousness state.  The subconcious part of a 'conciousness state' is 
<br />
your subconcious understanding of yourself and everything around you at that 
<br />
single moment.  For example, you always subconciously know who you are and 
<br />
what you are doing, without thinking about it.  I also use the term 
<br />
'observer moment' for 'conciousness state'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It seems you want put memories in that moment. Memories by whom and of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what ?
</em><br />
<br />ok.  After I defined conciousness, I was able to deduce some properties each 
<br />
observer moment must have.  I realized that in order for you to have a 
<br />
subconcious understanding of yourself and everything around you, you had to 
<br />
have an understanding of how everything around you was in previous observer 
<br />
moments.  If you are walking down the road, for example, you know, 
<br />
subconciously, that you are walking (and if you tell me you don't, well, 
<br />
then you are special).  And if, in a single observer moment while walking, 
<br />
you did not have an understanding of previous observer moments, then you 
<br />
would not know if you had just started walking or if you had been walking 
<br />
for a while.
<br />
<br />I also considered that subconcious understanding comes automatically when 
<br />
you stream many observer moments together through time.  However, that is 
<br />
not possible because if no single observer moment has an understanding of 
<br />
previous observer moments, then no matter how quickly observer moments pass 
<br />
by, you will never have an understanding of previous ones.  Each observer 
<br />
moment, therefore, must have an understanding of previous ones.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From that point, I logically deduced that the only way to have an 
</em><br />
understanding of previous observer moments is to remember them.  So, in each 
<br />
observer moment, in order to satisfy your subconcious understanding, you 
<br />
must remember previous observer moments (subconciously).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;A finite set of memories or an infinite set ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />The set of memories would be as large as the amount that you subconciously 
<br />
remember.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Are you saying there is a generic 'moment' from which all the others
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appear,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But then why and in which way ?
</em><br />
<br />Once I concluded that each observer moment must have a memory of previous 
<br />
observer moments, it was fairly obvious to realize that to have many 
<br />
observer moments, each remembering the previous ones, was redundant.  Each 
<br />
observer moment was in the same state, with a subconcious understanding of 
<br />
the past and everything, no matter what.  For each observer moment, the 
<br />
experience was the same whether or not the previous observer moments 
<br />
happened.  Effectively, whenever an observer moment passed by, it became 
<br />
obsolete.  So, in order to eliminate redundancy, I simply assumed that none 
<br />
of my memories, right up to this very moment, actually happened.  However, 
<br />
because of our perception of time, our conclusions about which observer 
<br />
moment really exists must constantly be renewed.  Because each observer 
<br />
moment becomes a memory the moment it is reached, it is impossible to 
<br />
experience any observer moment as reality.  It is easier to extrapolate that 
<br />
the real observer moment lies somewhere in the future.  The only reason it 
<br />
seems as though we are going through life is because that is the way it is 
<br />
remembered.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How would you link your single observer-moment and the everything idea or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the plenitude idea?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ok, you answer that in another post:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Yes, everything possible did happen - but none of it is linked in any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Just because another event COULD logically follow from a different one,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;doesn't mean it does.  It just simply isn't necessary, for reasons I gave 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;my original post.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hume said that a long time ago, about a putative 'real causality'. But if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do that again for a platonist kind of 'super-reality', then if your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;single moment has *any* power of explanation, the everything idea get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;disconnected from it and looses its power of explanation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This will lead to some form of dualism, or I misunderstand you completely.
</em><br />
<br />The everything idea, or the MWI, is used to explain the universal laws, just 
<br />
as they are used in the 'real world'.  The only difference is, rather than 
<br />
encapsulating the universe as the wave function as in MW, you encapsulate 
<br />
conciousness as the wave function, so that rather than having every possible 
<br />
parallel universe, you have every possible parallel observer moment.  Each 
<br />
branch in the wave function is really a branch in memory.  Because you only 
<br />
exist as a single observer moment, your path is predetermined, but still 
<br />
follows probability laws.
