<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Jesse Mazer&quot; &lt;lasermazer.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I don't understand your objection. It seems to me that it is perfectly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;coherent to imagine a TOE which includes both a universal &quot;objective&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;measure on the set of all observer-moments and also a relative conditional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;probability which tells me what the probability is I'll have experience B
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in the future if I'm having experience A right now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    &quot;You&quot; is just a matter of definition.  As for the conditional effective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability of an observation with characteristics A given that it includes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;characteristics B, p(A|B), that is automatically defined as p(A|B) = M(A 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;B) / M(B).  There is no room to have a rival &quot;relative conditional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability&quot;.  (E.g. A = &quot;I think I'm in the USA at 12:00 today&quot;, B=&quot;I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm Bob&quot;.)
</em><br />
<br />Well, I hope you'd agree that which observer-moment I am right now is not a 
<br />
&quot;matter of definition,&quot; but a matter of fact. My opinion is that the global 
<br />
measure on all observer-moments is not telling us something like the &quot;number 
<br />
of physical instantiations&quot; of each one, but rather the probability of 
<br />
*being* one particular observer-moment vs. some other one. I would be 
<br />
interested to hear what you think the measure means, though, since my 
<br />
version seems to require first-person facts which are separate from 
<br />
third-person facts (i.e., which observer-moment *I* am).
<br />
<br />In any case, I'm pretty sure there's room in a TOE for a &quot;conditional 
<br />
probability&quot; which would not be directly deducible from the global 
<br />
probability distribution. Suppose I have a large population of individuals, 
<br />
and I survey them on various personal characteristics, like height, IQ, age, 
<br />
etc. Using the survey results I can create a global probability function 
<br />
which tells me, for example, what the likelihood is that a random individual 
<br />
is more than 5 feet tall. But If I then want to find out the conditional 
<br />
probability that a given individual over 5 feet tall weighs more than 150 
<br />
pounds, there is no way to deduce this directly given only the global 
<br />
probability distribution. In this example it may be that p(A|B) = M(A and B) 
<br />
/ M(B), but the point is that M(A and B) cannot be found simply by knowing 
<br />
M(A) and M(B).
<br />
<br />And a TOE could conceivably work other ways too. Suppose we have a large 
<br />
number of interconnected bodies of water, each flowing into one another at a 
<br />
constant rate so that the total amoung of water in any part stays constant 
<br />
over time. In that case you could have something like a &quot;global measure&quot; 
<br />
which would tell you the probability that a randomly selected water molecule 
<br />
will be found in a given body of water at a given time, but also a kind of 
<br />
conditional probability that a water molecule currently in river A will 
<br />
later be found in any one of the various other rivers that river A branches 
<br />
into. This would approximate the idea that my consciousness is in some sense 
<br />
&quot;flowing&quot; between different experiences, splitting and merging as it goes. 
<br />
Just as the path of a given molecule is determined by the geographical 
<br />
relationships between the various bodies of water, so the path of my 
<br />
conscious experience might be determined by some measure of the &quot;continuity&quot; 
<br />
between different observer-moments...even though an observer-moment 
<br />
corresponding to my brain 5 seconds from now and another one corresponding 
<br />
to your own brain at this very moment might have equal *global* measure, I 
<br />
would presumably be much more likely to flow into a future observer-moment 
<br />
which is more similar to my current one.
<br />
<br />Most generally, we can imagine that a TOE defines both a global measure on 
<br />
individual observer-moments, but also a &quot;conditional measure&quot; on ordered 
<br />
pairs of observer-moments, or perhaps longer ordered chains. There would 
<br />
probably be some kind of mathematical relation between the two types of 
<br />
measure, but it wouldn't necessarily have to be of the form p(A|B) = M(A and 
<br />
B) / M(B) as you said. Do you see anything inherently contradictory about 
<br />
this idea?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;self-sampling assumption--what does it mean to say that &quot;I&quot; should reason
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;as if I had an equal probability of being any one of all possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;observer-moments?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    It means - and I admit it does take a little thought here - _I want to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;follow a guessing procedure that, in general, maximizes the fraction of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;those people (who use that procedure) who get the right guess_.  (Why would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I want a more error-prone method?)  So I use Bayesian reasoning with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;best prior available, the uniform one on observer-moments, which maximizes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the fraction of observer-moments who guess right.  No soul-hopping in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reasoning, I assure you.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure it's possible to take a third-person perspective on the 
<br />
self-sampling assumption. For one thing, the reasoning only works if I 
<br />
assume *my* observer-moment is randomly selected--I can't use anyone else's 
<br />
or I may get incorrect results, as if I reasoned from Adam and Eve's point 
<br />
of view in the doomsday argument. Then there is what Nick Bostrom calls the 
<br />
&quot;problem of the reference class,&quot; and I think there is a very good case to 
<br />
be made that the problem can only be solved by making reference to some sort 
<br />
of objective measure of  the &quot;consciousness level&quot; of a particular 
<br />
observer-moment. For example, suppose I find that I was created as one of 
<br />
two &quot;batches&quot; of humans, the first batch containing 950 members and the 
<br />
second containing only 50. One batch is all-male and the other is 
<br />
all-female, and I know that which batch is which sex was determined by a 
<br />
coinflip, so that a third-person observer would say there is a 50% chance 
<br />
that the large batch is the male batch. However, since I observe myself to 
<br />
be a male, I use the self-sampling assumption to reason that there is 
<br />
actually a 95% chance that the large batch was all-male, simply because I'm 
<br />
assuming that I'm as likely to be any human as any other, and 95% of the 
<br />
humans were members of the large batch.
<br />
<br />All right so far. But suppose I now find out that one of the two batches was 
<br />
genetically engineered to lack a brain, having no consciousness whatsoever? 
<br />
Or, if you prefer, suppose that one batch is not made of real humans at all, 
<br />
but just marble statues of them. Can I still assume I am as likely to be any 
<br />
individual as any other? I don't think so--I think some kind of &quot;anthropic 
<br />
principle&quot; must come into play here, guaranteeing that I will be a conscious 
<br />
individual rather than an unconscious one. So, even if the small-batch was 
<br />
the all-male one, I would still be guaranteed to find myself a male, simply 
<br />
because all the &quot;females&quot; in this experiment are going to totally lack 
<br />
consciousness. It's just the same as how I can't assume I'm &quot;randomly 
<br />
sampled&quot; from the set of all computations being implemented in the universe, 
<br />
because the vast majority of computations, associated with things like the 
<br />
random collisions of gas molecules in a nebula, will not lead to any 
<br />
high-level conscious experiences...only the very rare ones associated with 
<br />
biological brains which have evolved on planets with just the right 
<br />
conditions will have these sorts of experiences (or so I'd assume, anyway). 
<br />
Again, the anthropic principle must be taken into account.
<br />
<br />I think this should be a matter of degree, rather than an all-or-nothing 
<br />
affair. I think other animals, at least other mammals and birds, almost 
<br />
certainly have some kind of high-level conscious experience, so there is 
<br />
&quot;something it is like&quot; to be them, but I don't think I should reason as if I 
<br />
was randomly sampled from the set of all these animals, either. Indeed, I 
<br />
don't think it's just a lucky break that I find myself to be a member of 
<br />
what is probably the most intelligent species that has ever existed on 
<br />
planet earth, despite the fact that the number of animals who have ever 
<br />
lived probably vastly outweighs the number of homo sapiens who have ever 
<br />
lived. I think some sort of graded anthropic principle is likely to be 
<br />
responsible here...the usual self-sampling assumption perhaps needs to be 
<br />
replaced by some kind of weighted self-sampling assumption, with the 
<br />
&quot;weights&quot; on an observer-moment having something to do with the complexity 
<br />
of the consciousness involved. Indeed, I think it would be particularly 
<br />
elegant if the whole global measure function turned out to be nothing but 
<br />
this sort of weighted self-sampling assumption, although the weights would 
<br />
probably have to be determined by more than *just* the level of 
<br />
consciousness (after all, an observer-moment experiencing a white rabbit 
<br />
could be just as complex as a 'normal' one). In other words, I think a TOE 
<br />
should incorporate a &quot;theory of the anthropic principle&quot; rather than just 
<br />
adding it onto a sort of global &quot;physical&quot; measure as in theories like Max 
<br />
Tegmark's. The anthropic principle/physical measure distinction seems to me 
<br />
to be another version of the old mind/body duality, and it would be nice if 
<br />
a TOE could erase this distinction.
<br />
<br />So I guess I should repeat the question, when you talk about a global 
<br />
measure on all observer-moments, what do you think this measure means? Does 
<br />
it just represent the &quot;number of instantiations&quot; in the multiverse, so that 
<br />
if the vast majority of observer-moments/computations turned out to be of a 
<br />
very simple nature, we might need to make additional recourse to the 
<br />
anthropic principle to explain why we find ourselves to be experiencing 
<br />
these particularly complex type of observer-moments? Or do you think, as I 
<br />
do, that the global measure tells us the actual probability that &quot;my&quot; 
<br />
current experience will be a given observer-moment, and in that case do you 
<br />
agree that the global measure function must already take into account 
<br />
something along the lines of the anthropic principle?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;if I am about to step into a machine that will replicate one copy of me in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;heaven and one copy in hell, then as I step into the imaging chamber I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;be in suspense about where I will find myself a moment from now, and if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;conditional probability of each possible future observer-moment is 50%
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;given my current observer-moment, then I will interpret that as a 50/50
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;chance that I'm about to experience torture or bliss.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    That depends on the definition of &quot;you&quot;.  In any case, one copy will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happy (the one partying with the succubi in hell) and the other will be sad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(the one stuck hanging out with Christians).  So your utility function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;should be about even.  I assume you'd care about both future copies at that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point.
</em><br />
<br />Well, you're assuming that reality itself has no opinion on the definition 
<br />
of &quot;me,&quot; that it all depends on my own choice of utility function. Likewise, 
<br />
perhaps someone might have a TOE in which there is no &quot;objective&quot; global 
<br />
measure on the set of all observer-moments, that each observer-moment would 
<br />
have his own measure defined by what he believes to be real.
<br />
<br />But I think that in both cases the TOE should give me an answer which does 
<br />
not depend on my own preferences--as Phillip K. Dick once said, &quot;reality is 
<br />
that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.&quot; I don't think I 
<br />
could &quot;save myself&quot; from a hellish fate simply be redefining my utility 
<br />
function so that only those copies which go to heaven are defined as 
<br />
&quot;me&quot;--whether I find myself in heaven or hell seems to be something imposed 
<br />
on me by external reality, unless the flow of consciousness is a complete 
<br />
illusion. I talked about this question in an earlier post called &quot;3 possible 
<br />
views of consciousness:&quot;
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2358.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2358.html</a>
<br />
<br />These were the 3 I mentioned:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;1.  Consciousness is not &quot;real&quot;--our decision to call a system &quot;conscious&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or not is based only on subjective aesthetic criteria, like &quot;cuteness&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Daniel Dennett's example).  The only facts about reality are third-person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;facts, in this view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2.  Consciousness is real, but the feeling of continuity of consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;over time (the 'flow of related thoughts in time' above) is not.  In this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;view, only moments of experience exist, but nothing flows between these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;moments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;3.  Consciousness is real, and so is continuity of consciousness over time. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Proponents of this view may still believe that identity can split or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;merge though (think of many-worlds, or replicator experiments).
</em><br />
<br />Presumably you'd choose either 1 or 2, although I'm not quite sure which. 
<br />
But do you think view #3 is &quot;crazy,&quot; or is it just quantum immortality 
<br />
specifically that you find crazy? It would be possible to believe in #3 
<br />
without believing in quantum immortality, of course...I do think that once 
<br />
you accept #3, as well as the &quot;splitting&quot; and &quot;merging&quot; of 
<br />
consciousness-streams, then are some thought-experiments which make quantum 
<br />
immortality very plausible. But they're only plausible if you already find 
<br />
view #3 to be plausible in the first place.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Surely you agree that there is nothing *mathematically* incoherent about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;defining both absolute and conditional probability measures on the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;all observer-moments. So what's your basis for calling the idea &quot;crazy?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    I've explained that in other posts, but as you see, the idea is indeed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematically incoherent - unless you just mean the conditional effective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability which a measure distribution defines by definition.  And _that_
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one, of course, leads to a finite expectation value for ones's observed age
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(that is, no immortality).
</em><br />
<br />The &quot;expectation value&quot; is a problem, but as I said it's possible to accept 
<br />
#3 without accepting quantum immortality. For example, there could be a 
<br />
&quot;null observer-moment&quot; (death) which any given observer-moment has a small 
<br />
probability of becoming at any given time, and this probability could become 
<br />
large given enough time. Another interesting possibility is that whatever 
<br />
&quot;conditional probability&quot; we choose will be nonzero for *any* pair of 
<br />
observer-moments, so that there is some tiny probability that my next 
<br />
observer-moment will be completely unlike my current one--in situations 
<br />
where the probability of my physical death is large (like observing myself 
<br />
falling off a cliff), perhaps the combined conditional probability of my 
<br />
next moment being fairly similar to my current one is smaller than the 
<br />
combined conditional probability of a dissimilar next moment, so that I may 
<br />
suddenly find myself waking up from a dream of falling as a totally 
<br />
different person in a different region of the multiverse. In this way my 
<br />
conscious experience could be infinite even if at any given time I find 
<br />
myself as a finite organism with a finite memory.
<br />
<br />Finally, if conditional measure and global measure mutually determine each 
<br />
other in some way, there might be a way in which &quot;young&quot; observer-moments 
<br />
could have greater global measure than &quot;old&quot; ones. Imagine an experiment 
<br />
where I am duplicated, as in Bruno Marchal's example, once in Moscow and 
<br />
once in Washington. Then a year later, if a democrat wins the U.S. 
<br />
presidency, the Washington twin will be duplicated 1000 times; if a 
<br />
republican wins the presidency, the Moscow twin will be duplicated 1000 
<br />
times. Even though this subsequent duplication happens a year after the 
<br />
original Moscow/Washington split, I think it could have an effect on my 
<br />
original first-person probability of finding myself in Moscow vs. Washington 
<br />
(since after all this is done, 1000 out of 1001 descendants of the original 
<br />
person will remember having ended up in the city corresponding to the future 
<br />
president)...we might then have the strange effect that I would have a 
<br />
pretty good idea of who was going to win the presidency a year from now 
<br />
based on whether I found myself in Washington or Moscow, even though this 
<br />
prophecy would be useless to everyone else since they'd have no way of 
<br />
knowing which twin has a lower measure/probability of being experienced. 
<br />
What this might mean is that the global measure on a particular-observer 
<br />
moment would be found by doing some sort of &quot;path integral&quot; over all 
<br />
possible future histories, which would perhaps be weighed both by their 
<br />
internal consistency (determined by the conditional measure--a history where 
<br />
my experience leaps around between radically different observer-moments 
<br />
might contribute less than a more 'seamless one') and by their objective 
<br />
probability (determined by the global measure of all the constintuent 
<br />
observer-moments, which would hopefully make white rabbit experiences very 
<br />
unlikely). Now, there's obviously something a bit circular about this, since 
<br />
it would involve finding the &quot;objective probability&quot; of experiencing a 
<br />
particular observer-moment by doing something like an integral over all 
<br />
possible first-person histories containing that observer-moment, and these 
<br />
histories would be weighted by internal consistency *and* the &quot;objective 
<br />
probability&quot; of all the other experiences in all these possible histories. 
<br />
But perhaps this would allow you to bootstrap a unique global probability 
<br />
distribution into existence, like solving a large set of simultaneous 
<br />
equations to get unique values for each variable.
<br />
<br />If the global probability distribution depends on the possible future 
<br />
histories of each observer-moment, then it might change how we should think 
<br />
of quantum immortality. For instance, instead of the immortality guarantee 
<br />
only &quot;kicking in&quot; at the last possible moment (as the guillotine is 
<br />
dropping, say), we might have a situation where the most likely 
<br />
observer-moments are precisely those that can most &quot;reasonably&quot; be expected 
<br />
to survive long periods of time (so that I'd be less likely to go to the 
<br />
guillotine in the first place). Just as there may be a whiff of the 
<br />
anthropic principle in the fact that I find myself to be a human rather than 
<br />
one of the many other animals which has ever lived on earth, I think 
<br />
something like the anthropic principle may also be involved in the fact that 
<br />
I find myself at this particular point in human history, on the verge of a 
<br />
possible &quot;technological singularity&quot; which could make my indefinite survival 
<br />
seem entirely natural (see <a href="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Singularity/">http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Singularity/</a> ). 
<br />
And beings who are among the first to upload having their memories most 
<br />
widely distributed in the future evolution of a cybercivilization spreading 
<br />
throughout the universe, since they will have the most time to &quot;expand their 
<br />
minds&quot;, make large numbers of copies of themselves, etc. Thus, &quot;young&quot; 
<br />
observer-moments on the cusp of the singularity might have much higher 
<br />
global measure, just as the twin about to be duplicated 1000 times might 
<br />
have had higher global measure than any of his subsequent &quot;descendents.&quot; 
<br />
Alternately, even if you ignore the possibility of such a singularity, if 
<br />
you think of the MWI in terms of &quot;splitting histories&quot; then young 
<br />
observer-moments might be more likely for similar reasons.
<br />
<br />So, there are a variety of ways I can imagine solving the &quot;expected age&quot; 
<br />
problem without having to throw out quantum immortality. I expect you'll 
<br />
find them all somewhat crazy...that's why, for now, I'd rather focus on the 
<br />
more general question of whether you think it's completely impossible that 
<br />
the correct TOE would make continuity of consciousness into something 
<br />
&quot;objective&quot; rather than something defined only by our own choices about 
<br />
utility functions. I don't entirely rule out the possibility that continuity 
<br />
of consciousness is a kind of illusion, but I still don't see how you can 
<br />
have grounds to be sure that it is.
