</em><br />
<br /><br />The &quot;Math Logic &quot;is just the &quot;Philosophy&quot; made a bit more communicable.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;...that you give

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;however prove it with another is something else unless there are other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;links or clues?
</em><br />
<br /><br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now I am not saying that Pauli was right but I am showing that your idea

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mainly comes from this and possibly thorugh other books or thing you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have taken in over the years.Now you say it not direclty about QT,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;however without this you would not have the link of Comp and Physics in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the first place,so it must be about QT.In fact it would be hard without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Quanta.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not at all, I make public the idea in 1963.  I started from the question
<br />
&quot;what is the life time of the amoeba?&quot; well before I knew about chemistry
<br />
or even Plato. In 1971 I discover the little book by Nagel &amp; Newman on Godel
<br />
theorem (Foyles for Books Charring Cross Road London, at a scholar trip)
<br />
which decides me to do the math and to translate the amoeba reasoning in
<br />
arithmetics. Only much later will I discover EPR and the weirdness of the
<br />
quantum.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some poetical strongness in both Young and Pauli which
<br />
I can appreciate, but with modern philophical rigor standard they quite miss
<br />
the &quot;communicable&quot; point.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And with this is bring us back to the misconception about Mind and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Reality QT question and the socalled Eigenstate-Value link which has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;never been proved either yet through this we assume lot or wrong
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;questions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You mean we assume lot or wrong &quot;propositions&quot;. We never assume &quot;questions&quot;,
<br />
we just ask, hoping being clear. You miss me completely if you believe
<br />
my approach to mind has something to do with Copenhague. I mean my
<br />
approach is a mechanist one like Everett, Zeh, or  Deutsch.
<br />
Mind has the type of Information, memory, communication. Neither 
<br />
spirit nor substance, but organised bits.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ok let put it this way lets say that Quanta has not been discovered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;yetlike the begin of the 19th century and you have this idea of Comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mind reality stuff well how did you come around to this way of thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and how did you find the linkes with Reality Comp and Mind???
</em><br />
<br /><br />After Leeuwhenhoek, the inventor-discoverer of the microscope.
<br />
You can get the whole thing just by imagining yourself duplicable like
<br />
an amoeba or bacteria ...
<br />
Look at the uda you will see I don't use QT.
<br />
(by the way don't wait I write an english paper, consult the everything list
<br />
instead, but, like Wei Dai (everything list owner) said, you better study
<br />
Boolos 1993 book before, or read at
<br />
least the simpler &quot;Forever Undecided&quot; by Raymong Smullyan which
<br />
introduced recreatively the
<br />
modal logic G which is the basic tool for the arithmetical version of the
<br />
Universal dovetailer argument (auda).  All references, including those
<br />
pointing to the everything mailing list, are in my URL below).
<br />
<br />In a nutshell if we are machine (comp) we cannot know in which computation
<br />
we belong and to predict the (immediate) future we must extract a measure
<br />
on all computations going through the &quot;actual&quot; state. Church thesis makes
<br />
the notion of &quot;all computations&quot; machine independent.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You can pretend that Mind and Comp knowledge is the same as today for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;arguments sake ;) but NOT the Physics parts!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Indeed and that is what I have done. Of course at the stage of
<br />
verification let me look at nature cause I would like to know if comp
<br />
is wrong.
<br />
What I say  is that the dreamy aspect of reality is testable.
<br />
If mathematically comp gives QM then verification of QM leads to verification
<br />
of comp.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Nowwhat has been missed is that Math dont mirror reality totally and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;istead is like what Duetsch calls a rule of thumb I call quick and dirty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;solutions which we have formed mainly from simple more primitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thoughts to survive.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Which reality?
<br />
Math = rules of Thumbs? No. Like Deutsch I aknowledge math reality
<br />
kicks back. There is an objective reality with math. Even in math,
<br />
*theories* are always simplification. Rule of thumbs are only tools for
<br />
seing more in the math realm, not the math ream itself.
<br />
<br />You mean &quot;physical reality&quot;?  That's a mystical concept I respect but cannot
<br />
use in my context where I ask, among other things, for an explanation of the
<br />
physicalness or the belief in physicalness.
<br />
<br />In any case, there are no mathematical *theories* which mirror even just
<br />
arithmetical reality totally.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also I said there are other structure in physica dn math which go beyond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other Logic structures and help solve problem that the presant stuff
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cant, you say no becuase the stuff now works, well that what they said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the past untill some one dar to break the mold.Bohm and Hegl logic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;get over certain Logic paradox Like Russell's simply by changing primary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;roles
</em><br />
<br /><br />*I* am the guy with the &quot;new theory&quot; here :-)  Except it is not a
<br />
theory I *propose*, it is a theory I isolate from the cartesian comp
<br />
postulates. Z1* is not &quot;my&quot; theory, it is the theory by any sound
<br />
universal machine.
<br />
Z1* looks like Quantum Probability + terrible renormalisation problem.
<br />
I currently hope Hopf Algebra can help here ...I've perhaps make some piece
<br />
of progress in the puzzle but still too much with formal similarities
<br />
instead of conceptual clues ...
<br />
<br />I should perhaps add that there are other pieces of evidence that physics
<br />
is part of pure number theory which are quite independent from the
<br />
self-referential approach I try to develop. I have not the references
<br />
here but I think about the work of Caroline Series, ...
<br />
Look also Dirk Kreimer's book on Knots and Feynman diagram.
<br />
<br />You know D. Dennett insists (rightly imo) that an explanation of intelligence
<br />
should not rely on anything considered as intelligent. I think the same
<br />
for terms like &quot;empirical&quot;, &quot;physical&quot; or &quot;material&quot;. We should explain
<br />
those terms without any reference to empiry, physics or matter.
<br />
<br />Plato did understand this point. Aristotle didn't, apparently.
<br />
