<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we've realized that was all the explanation available.
</em><br />
<br />Hmmm.  I'm not familiar enough with the history of this to argue one
<br />
way or the other.  A quick read through the wikipedia article on
<br />
vitalism, and some light googling, left me with the impression that
<br />
most of the argument centered around function.  And also the
<br />
difference between organic and inorganic chemical compounds.
<br />
<br />Though to the extent that there was something being debated beyond
<br />
structure and function, I think that Chalmers makes a good point here:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is not even a plausible candidate for a further sort of property of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life that needs explaining (leaving aside consciousness itself), and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed there never was.
</em><br />
<br />I'm highlighting the parenthetical &quot;leaving aside consciousness itself&quot;.
<br />
<br />SO.  Dennett makes one claim.  Chalmers makes what I thought was a
<br />
pretty good rebuttal.  I've never seen a counter-response from Dennett
<br />
on this point, and it's not a historical topic that I know much about.
<br />
&nbsp;Do you have some special expertise, or a good source that overturns
<br />
Chalmers rebuttal?
<br />
<br />Though, comparing what people thought about an entirely different
<br />
topic 150 years ago to this topic now seems like a clever debating
<br />
point, but otherwise of iffy relevance.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We will eventually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be able to make robots that behave as humans do and we will infer, from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their behavior, that they are conscious.
</em><br />
<br />What about robots (or non-embodied computer programs) that are equally
<br />
complex but (for whatever design reasons) don't exhibit any
<br />
&quot;human-like&quot; behaviors?  Will we &quot;infer&quot; that they are conscious?  How
<br />
will we know which types of complex systems are conscious and which
<br />
aren't?  What is the marker?
<br />
<br />We'll just &quot;know it when we see it&quot;?  If so, it's only because we have
<br />
definite knowledge of our own conscious experience, and we're looking
<br />
for behaviors that we can &quot;empathize&quot; with.  But is empathy reliable?
<br />
It's certainly exploitable...Kismet for example.  So it can generate
<br />
false positives, but what might it also miss?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And we, being their designers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be able to analyze them and say, &quot;Here's what makes R2D2 have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious experiences of visual perception and here's what makes 3CPO
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have self awareness relative to humans.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />I would agree that we could say something definite about the
<br />
functional aspects, but not about any experiential aspects.  Those
<br />
would have to be taken on faith.  For all we know, R2D2 might have a
<br />
case of blindsight AND Anton-Babinski syndrome...in which case he
<br />
would react to visual data but have no conscious experience of what he
<br />
saw (blindsight), BUT would claim that he did experience it
<br />
(Anton-Babinksi)!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We will find that there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many different kinds of &quot;conscious&quot; and we will be able to invent new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones.
</em><br />
<br />How would we know that we had actually invented new ones?  What is it
<br />
like to be a robo-Bat?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We will never &quot;solve&quot; Chalmers hard problem, we'll just realize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's a non-question.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe.  Time will tell.  But even if we all agree that it's a
<br />
non-question, that wouldn't necessarily mean that we'd be correct in
<br />
doing so.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Well, here's where it gets tricky.  Conscious experience is associated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that's the point in question.  However, we all agree that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is associated with, can be identified by, certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behavior.  So to say that physical systems are too representationally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ambiguous seems to me to beg the question.  It is based on assuming that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is information and since the physical representation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information is ambiguous it is inferred that physical representations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aren't enough for consciousness.  But  going back to the basis: Is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behavior ambiguous?  Sure it is - yet we rely in it to identify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness (at least if you don't believe in philosophical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zombies).   I think the significant point is that consciousness is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attribute of behavior that is relative to an environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />So I think the possibility (conceivability?) of conscious computer
<br />
simulations is what throws a kink into this line of thought.
<br />
<br />I'll quote Hans Moravec here:
<br />
<br />&quot;A simulated world hosting a simulated person can be a closed
<br />
self-contained entity. It might exist as a program on a computer
<br />
processing data quietly in some dark corner, giving no external hint
<br />
of the joys and pains, successes and frustrations of the person
<br />
inside. Inside the simulation events unfold according to the strict
<br />
logic of the program, which defines the ``laws of physics'' of the
<br />
simulation. The inhabitant might, by patient experimentation and
<br />
inference, deduce some representation of the simulation laws, but not
<br />
the nature or even existence of the simulating computer. The
<br />
simulation's internal relationships would be the same if the program
<br />
were running correctly on any of an endless variety of possible
<br />
computers, slowly, quickly, intermittently, or even backwards and
<br />
forwards in time, with the data stored as charges on chips, marks on a
<br />
tape, or pulses in a delay line, with the simulation's numbers
<br />
represented in binary, decimal, or Roman numerals, compactly or spread
<br />
widely across the machine. There is no limit, in principle, on how
<br />
indirect the relationship between simulation and simulated can be.&quot;
