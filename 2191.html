Saibal asks,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Question: Does the AUH exclude universes in which a RAC can be built?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The following text explaining the RAC is from the website: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  <a href="http://www.ix.de/tp/english/inhalt/kolu/2414/1.html">http://www.ix.de/tp/english/inhalt/kolu/2414/1.html</a> 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ``Just to see how extreme the Turing-Church Thesis actually is, a few
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years ago mathematician Ian Stewart half-jokingly suggested the idea of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what he called, The Rapidly-Accelerating Computer (RAC). His goal was to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; show what it is exactly about computing machines that gives rise to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things like the unsolvability of the Halting Problem and uncomputable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers. Basically, the problem is the assumption that it takes a fixed,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finite amount of time to carry out a single step in a computation. For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his idealized computer, Turing assumed an infinite amount of memory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stewart, on the other hand, considers the RAC, whose clock accelerates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exponentially fast, with pulses separated by intervals of 1/2, 1/4, 1/8
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...seconds. So the RAC can cram an infinite number of computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; steps into a single second. Such a machine would be a sight to behold as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it would be totally indifferent to the algorithmic complexity of any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem presented to it. On the RAC, everything runs in bounded time. 
</em><br />
<br />That's an interesting question.  It gets into the question of whether
<br />
transfinite numbers &quot;really&quot; exist in some abstract mathematical sense.
<br />
<br />The question is, under the AUH could you have a universe where there was
<br />
one subsystem which did an infinite amount of computation while another
<br />
subsystem did only a finite amount.
<br />
<br />Obviously it would be possible to simulate the infinite calculation at
<br />
least in the limit.  The universal simulator chugs along, and any given
<br />
step in the infinite computer (RAC) eventually gets hit by the simulator.
<br />
<br />Then, would an observer in the non-infinite subsystem ever observe the
<br />
results of the RAC?  That is, would the universal simulator ever finish
<br />
the calculation of the infinite result and be able to start simulating
<br />
events in the non-infinite subsystem which took place later?
<br />
<br />In the field of transfinites, there is the concept of ordinal numbers
<br />
greater than infinity.  The counting infinity is written as omega,
<br />
we can write it as w.  The numbers go 1, 2, 3, ...  w, w+1, w+2, w+3,
<br />
... 2w, 2w+1, ... and so on.  So there is a notation to represent counting
<br />
numbers after infinity, and you can do math with them.
<br />
<br />If we imagine that such numbers have a degree of abstract reality, and if
<br />
the AUH universal simulator is also abstract (assuming platonic realism),
<br />
then it could be said that the simulator is able to go through more than
<br />
w steps.  It takes w steps to simulate the RAC, but then at steps w+1,
<br />
w+2, ... we would be able to simulate the non-infinite subsystems which
<br />
could contain observers who would witness the result of the infinite
<br />
calculation.
<br />
<br />Normally in our probabilistic estimates we assume that the measure of a
<br />
universe is entirely due to the complexity of the program that runs it.
<br />
By this judgement, a universe containing an infinite subsystem (RAC)
<br />
would not be inherently of low measure.  Therefore there would be no
<br />
reason to expect that observers who have witnessed the result of an
<br />
RAC would have low measure.  Hence universes containing RACs could
<br />
exist and be reasonably probable.  (Apparently not our universe though
<br />
because our particular physics don't seen to provide any mechanism for
<br />
infinite computation.  Interestingly, an idealized Newtonian universe
<br />
with point masses can contain an RAC, I believe.)
<br />
<br />Another perspective on the problem would be to abandon platonic realism
<br />
and say that the multiverse is actually being simulated by a real computer
<br />
somewhere, a Turing machine.  This raises the philosophical question of
<br />
how the TM universe came into existence (it's turtles all the way down,
<br />
sonny).  Awkward as this approach is, it suggests that no universe could
<br />
ever actually achieve an infinite amount of computation, that this could
<br />
only be approached in the limit.  In that case the results of the RAC
<br />
could never be observed in any universe.
<br />
