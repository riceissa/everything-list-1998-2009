<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;Of course on THIS list 'thinking' people gathered and

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;such thoughts are not unusual. We are the exception.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;An example is the Big Bang. Many scientists almost put
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;it into their evening prayer. Doubting is heresy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;This is why I scrutinize what we 'believe in' and try

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;alternate narratives: do they hold water? Are the new

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm sure all the Big Bang theorists would say that they would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; change their views if new evidence came to light. Of course,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there are thousands of ideas out there and most of them are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; pretty crazy, pushed by people who don't understand even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the basics of what they are criticizing, so it is understandable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that these ideas would sometimes be dismissed out of hand by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; people working in the field. It is also understandable that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; scientists are only human and get quite attached to the theories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on which they base their careers, so they may not change as

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact there are serious theories of the universe in which there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; originating big bang.  For example Paul Steinhardt has published papers on
</em><br />
a
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model in which the universe we see is one of two 3-branes in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 10-dimensional space.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0403020">http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0403020</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The origin of particles and energy and their flying apart as we see them
</em><br />
is
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; due to collision of our 3-brane with the other 3-brane.  He shows that
</em><br />
this
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be a cyclic process in which the universe empties out due to expansion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and then another collision can occur.  While a few individual scientists
</em><br />
may
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider the big bang origin of the universe dogma, every scientist
</em><br />
working
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a field like cosmogony wants to make his name by showing that current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories are wrong.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

Of course the &quot;Big Bang&quot; caught the attention. What I asked about
<br />
considering our 'visualization' of &quot;a&quot; reality-percept as provisional - to
<br />
work with, until a better one shows up :
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;When did you last learn that the tenets of ongoing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;physics are only &quot;provisionally&quot; accepted as 'real'?
</em><br />
and mentioned the BB as a (side?) example.
<br />
BTW - speaking about 'the' Big Bang: Hubble (1922) detected a redshift in
<br />
the spectra of distant (and greater in even more distant) heavenly bodies
<br />
and was ingenious enough to connotate this with the Doppler effect,
<br />
concluding, that this shift into lower frequencies of distant bodies MAY
<br />
HAVE BEEN the result of a receding movement of the light-source, similar
<br />
to the 'lowering voice' in a Doppler - type auditive phenomenon.
<br />
Consequently:  the universe MAY expand, producing those (alleged) receding
<br />
movements from us.
<br />
This is the 'provisionally(!)' accepted reality-percept as of the early
<br />
1920s:
<br />
The idea was logical. - &quot;IF&quot; - this is a fact, we may apply a retrograde
<br />
line
<br />
backwards and arrive to the zero-point, when the universe was started -
<br />
gradually
<br />
collapsing into an extensionless point - from which it erose &quot;in a big
<br />
bang&quot;.
<br />
<br />Then came the first (and biggest) mistake: &quot;scientists&quot; took our present
<br />
physical science circumstances and applied them (equationally) to all those
<br />
changing systems of concentration with incomparably higher density of
<br />
everything (energy? temperature? gravity? if someone ha an idea what these
<br />
are). They assigned the fractions of the hypothetical 1st sec (^-40 etc.) to
<br />
storytelling of features just &quot;freezing out&quot;.  It still did not make sense
<br />
with our equations derived in the present 'cool' and dilated physical
<br />
system, so an inflation was invented to correct 'some' of the compressed
<br />
state which made the equations  fully paradoxical.
<br />
IF the Hubble proposal is right (and I give credit to assume it) the
<br />
calculations and their conclusions must be false - e.g. the age of the
<br />
universe. A linear retro-math
<br />
for a chaotic development cannot match, unknown intermittent events are all
<br />
neglected, the relationships of THIS system are applied for a totally
<br />
different one.
<br />
No experimental proof, not even asymptotically: those many orders of magn.
<br />
make speculation into science fiction. (This is why I composed my
<br />
narrative).
<br />
<br />After that - sorry, Brent - not those, who wanted to deny the theory, rather
<br />
those, who wanted to show 'experimental' simulations assignable to the
<br />
'truth'
<br />
of the theory - designed and performed thousands and thousands of
<br />
experiments all slanted towards 'evidencing' the idea (E.g. Wilson's
<br />
background radiation,
<br />
presented as the 'remnant' of the Big Bang energy-level - earning him a
<br />
Nobel).
<br />
So the 'proving' became the way to grants, tenure, acceptance into the
<br />
science
<br />
establishment. Finding evidence against it? In who's acceptance? Disproving
<br />
it?
<br />
Dare swim against the flood? Become a scientific leper?
<br />
The shift in light-frequency can be altered in several other ways, but
<br />
attempts to
<br />
even mentioning such  (e.g. compartmentalized universe, gravitational fields
<br />
changes) were rejected before any serious consideration as 'hoax' (sic).
<br />
(I have a personal experience to that by a prestigious New England
<br />
professor).
<br />
Expanding Universe with Big Bang Startup is the bible in conventional
<br />
science.
<br />
&quot;Not one experiment to counter-evidence it!&quot; also: &quot;Not one penny to spend&quot;.
<br />
...And of course there is Fred Hoyle's harmonic theory with no beginning,
<br />
etc.
<br />
So the (provisional?) reality-percept stays and generation after generation
<br />
it
<br />
gains more and more 'belief' as a real-reality-view.
<br />
*
<br />
This is a recent example, with a knowledge-base close to our present level
<br />
of the cognitive inventory in our epistemological enrichment. I did not go
<br />
further back into eras with much less information about the world and much
<br />
more speculation
<br />
&quot;how it COULD be&quot;, like e.g. 2500 years ago and way before that.
<br />
That old ape must have been a genius to start thinking!
