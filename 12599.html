<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; When you ask your computer to print a document, the computer typically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; does not search the meaning of the words &quot;print&quot; or &quot;document&quot; in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dictionary. Other more subtile self-reference are handled by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; diagonalization technic which makes it possible to cut the infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; regresses. IF and when I come back on the Fi and Wi, I will give you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Kleene second recursion theorem which solves all those infinite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; regress
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; appearing in computer self-reference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An association has been made between &quot;print&quot; and &quot;document&quot; with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the real world. You can work out what the print command is on an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unknown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer by experimenting with different inputs and observing outputs. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if the real world is internalised, even if you could work out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regularities in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; syntax of an unknown computer (and I don't know if this is necessarily 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it might be a military computer with syntax deliberately scrambled 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with a one-time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pad) you would be unable to work out what it originally meant - what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is thinking. It is like finding an unknown language without a Rosetta 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stone or any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cultural background which might help you with a translation. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reminds me of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossibility of sharing 1st person experience: you can only do so if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you share some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3rd person quality allowing at least some interaction.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />First, I do agree we cannot extract semantics from syntax, or behavior 
<br />
of a program from their codes. There is a well know theorem (Rice 
<br />
theorem) explaining why, and I could come back on this when I come back 
<br />
on the Fi and Wi. But so we agree. This does not depend on &quot;cultural 
<br />
background&quot; unless you define &quot;cultural background&quot; by &quot;most probable 
<br />
universal neighborhood history&quot;.
<br />
Now I am not sure this is directly related to the 1-3 distinction.
<br />
Also, I have no clue of what you mean by &quot;real world&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  From Pythagoras to Proclus, &quot;intellectuals&quot; were proud not making 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; error. Aristotle is in part responsible for having made &quot;appearance&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reality, coming back to the (provably wrong assuming comp) common 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in those matters.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (of course as you know we have to rely on common sense to go beyond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; common sense).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, but we have to start with some basic observation. It looks like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are pulled to the Earth by a force - that is a basic observation, with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a minimal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implicit theory.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. I call that sometimes &quot;grandmother physics&quot;. Even physicists 
<br />
use it in everyday life.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; General Relativity explains this differently, but it takes a rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complex series of arguments to arrive at GR.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Already Galilee makes grandmother's physics globally wrong. Now 
<br />
Galilee, Newton and GR works because they does not contradict 
<br />
grandmother physics, and recast it in frame compatible with larger set 
<br />
of data.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can't call Newton stupid because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of this.
</em><br />
<br />Not at all. Especially not Newton, who wrote some text showing that he 
<br />
was aware on the lack of serious metaphysical foundations for his 
<br />
physics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Similarly, your conclusion that there is no separate physical reality 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follows
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from a number of carefully argued steps, and at the start of the chain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there does appear to be a physical world... if there did not, we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would not be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having this or any other discussion.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think we agree. I have never doubted the appearances of a physical 
<br />
reality, even assuming comp.
<br />
What I do pretend, is that IF we assume the comp hyp, then the 
<br />
appearance of a physical reality does not reflect the existence of a 
<br />
*primary* physical reality. It is simpler to describe the 
<br />
epistemological consequences (albeit probably looking more 
<br />
provocative), which is that physics cannot be the fundamental science.
<br />
It really means that the laws of physics, not only can be derived from 
<br />
computer science/number theory, but has to be derived from computer 
<br />
science number theory if we are asssuming comp. All stable appearances 
<br />
must emerge through a notion of first person plural observation.
<br />
Now such &quot;first person plural observation&quot; can be described in the 
<br />
language of a Universal Machine, and this gives a way to test the comp 
<br />
hypothesis.
<br />
I am before all an empiricist. True, I'm saying that if comp is true 
<br />
then the &quot;laws of physics&quot; are in your head (actually in any universal 
<br />
machine's &quot;head&quot;). So let us test comp by 1) deriving the 
<br />
&quot;comp-physics&quot; (the physics in the head), 2) let us compare it with the 
<br />
usual observations. If the empirical data contradict comp: comp is 
<br />
refuted. If the data are coherent with comp, comp is not refuted. If 
<br />
comp is correct, the data will never be contradicted, and we will never 
<br />
know if comp is correct, but may be we will bet on it according to 
<br />
possible circumstances.
<br />
Note that in the UDA I do start, not only from the appearances of a 
<br />
physical world, but from its primary existence. But this assumption is 
<br />
eliminated in the course of the reasoning (by the movie graph/maudlin).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You seemed to be disputing the idea that a serial computation cannot 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be broken
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up arbitrarily into parallel components, or suggesting that they need 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be glued
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; together in some way if they are. This seems to contradict most of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teleportation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought experiments we have discussed, in which it is sufficient for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious that I vanish at A and a copy with close enough brain be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; created at B:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there need be no glue, no causal connection (although of course it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would help to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make the copy if you had the right information, the result would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same if the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copy just came about by random processes), no regard for temporal or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spatial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; displacement.
</em><br />
<br />Let us call S my digital (generalized) brain state here and now, in 
<br />
Brussels for example.
<br />
Let us call S' the state of &quot;consistent extension&quot; of that state &quot;me in 
<br />
Moscow&quot; or &quot;me in Washington&quot; to take those examples.
<br />
What the thought experiments show indeed is that we don't need (and 
<br />
even cannot use) a causal or physical connection between those states S 
<br />
and S'. But S' has to be a state &quot;near S&quot; for me having a feeling like 
<br />
&quot;I am in Washington, and I come from Brussels&quot;, so as to say yes to the 
<br />
doctor and continue to say yes to the doctor. This works if S-S' 
<br />
belongs to a &quot;normal&quot; computational history, that is a third person 
<br />
computation having the &quot;right&quot; probability (if that exists, if not comp 
<br />
is already incorrect). But then, by definition of computation S and S' 
<br />
have to be mathematically related, even arithmetically related. If not 
<br />
there would be too much white rabbits at the start.
<br />
In UD*, i.e. the entire (countably infinite) dovetailing work of the 
<br />
Universal Dovetailer UD, we must distinguish third person computations 
<br />
and all possible first person data, which can indeed, from a first 
<br />
person perspective (which abstracts all delays in the running of the 
<br />
UD) contained all arbitrary sequences. But almost all such sequences 
<br />
are NOT computable. They are never generated by the UD, except by local 
<br />
dovetaling on the finite initial segment of (all) real numbers, but 
<br />
this perturbs only the measure (which we are searching)  in the limit. 
<br />
This limit makes a first person sense only in the limit.
<br />
Consciousness supervenes on computational histories which are immune 
<br />
for that &quot;real&quot; unavoidable first person (plural) randomization.
<br />
The UDA (UD Argument) illustrates that we have to take into account 
<br />
only the arithmetical gluing. But we have to take account of that 
<br />
gluing. If not, everything is a computation, and this would make Church 
<br />
thesis false (among many things ...).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If there are more arbitrary sequences than third person computations, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does it follow that arbitrary sequences are not computations?
</em><br />
<br />Stathis, I must go now, I will answer this later. I will comment the 
<br />
rest of your post + a commentary on your kind reference to Searle. We 
<br />
agree on many things. I am afraid we have to dig in slightly more 
<br />
technical stuff for making the remaining posts understandable. I have 
<br />
to explain those &quot;arithmetical (first person/third person) glues&quot;.
