<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The guy on death row should be looking for ways to causally influence

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a reprieve. The quantum suicide strategy is without content.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As you see, suicide is not necessary for QS decisions.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, I don't see this. I don't see _any_ of this. Whether one supports

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of &quot;quantum suicide&quot; to the theory of decision-making.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would help if you gave some concrete examples of what a belief in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum suicide means for several obvious examples:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -- the death row case you cited
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -- the airplane example you also cited
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -- Newcomb's Paradox (discussed in Pearl, Joyce, Nozick, etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -- stock market investments/speculations 
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />OK. Let's consider the case of the guy dying of cancer and playing the 
<br />
stock market simultaneously.. In real life, the hard part is to get 
<br />
meaningful probability data. For the sake of the argument let's assume 
<br />
the following scenario:
<br />
<br />Given:
<br />
1) Alice is dying of cancer. The probability that she dies after six 
<br />
months but within the year is 80%. According to data compiled by 
<br />
doctors, she is highly unlikely to die outside this time window. Before 
<br />
the six monts, she is not sick enough and after the six months she is 
<br />
highly likely to get into remission. Alice has no family that she may 
<br />
worry about if she dies. In other words, she does not care about 
<br />
branches in the manyworld where she does not exist.
<br />
<br />2) Bob is perfectly healthy. The probability he dies of cancer is 0.
<br />
<br />3) Charles is a young biologist fresh out of school but who has lots of 
<br />
ideas. He has just started a company, Oncocure, and has declared to the 
<br />
press that he intends to come up with a cure for cancer within six 
<br />
months. He is about to make his company public through an IPO offering.
<br />
<br />4) A reputable market analysis firm has declared that the Oncocure stock 
<br />
will increase in value by a factor of 1000 if the cure that Charles is 
<br />
promising is working, and Charles is a genius. Otherwise, the stock will 
<br />
drop to zero and Charles is a quack.
<br />
<br />5) A reputable academic has declared that the probability of Charles 
<br />
coming up with a cure is 0.1%.
<br />
<br />6) If Charles has a medicine that works, then Alice intends to take it 
<br />
and she will be cured.
<br />
<br />Question:
<br />
Assuming that the market analysis data and that the probabilistic 
<br />
evaluation by the academic are correct
<br />
1) should Alice buy the stock from company? What is her expected rate of 
<br />
return?
<br />
2) should Bob buy the stock from the compay? What is his expected rate 
<br />
of return?
<br />
<br />Solution:
<br />
There are four scenarios:
<br />
A) Charles does not come up with a cure, AND Alice lives.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probability = (1-0.001) x ( 1- 0.8) = 0.1998
<br />
<br />B) Charles does not come up with a cure AND Alice dies.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probability = (1-0.001) x (0.8) = 0.7992
<br />
<br />C) Charles does come up with a cure AND Alice lives using the cure.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probability = (0.001) x (1) = 0.001
<br />
<br />D) Charles does come up with a cure AND Alice dies. This scenario is 
<br />
impossible since Alice intends to take the medicine.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probability = (0.001) x (0) = 0
<br />
<br />The third person (as seen by Bob)  probabilities must add to 1 which 
<br />
they do: P(A) + P(B) + P(C) + P(D) = 1 
<br />
The following step is important and is probably the most controversial: 
<br />
The events that Alice can perceive are only A and C. Hence the 
<br />
probability distribution which is applicable to her must be normalized 
<br />
to make her probabilities add up to one.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P'(A) = P(A) /(P(A) + P(C)) = 0.1998 / (0.1998 + 0.001) = 0.99502
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P'(C) = P(B) /(P(A) + P(C)) = 0.001  / (0.1998 + 0.001) = 0.00498
<br />
<br />Where the prime indicate the probabilities seen through Alice's eyes. 
<br />
This normalization is just an application of Bayes theorem:
<br />
<br />P'(A) = P(a|b) = P(b|a)P(a)  / (P(b|a)P(a)   +   P(b|not a) P(not a))  = 
<br />
P(a AND b) / (P(a AND b)  + P(not a AND b))
<br />
<br />where a = cure works and b = Alice lives
<br />
<br />In our case P(A) = P(No Cure AND Alice lives)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(B) = P(No Cure AND Alice dies)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(C) = P(Cure AND Alice lives)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(D) = P(Cures AND Alice dies)
<br />
<br />Notice that as expected P'(A)  + P'(B) = 1
<br />
<br />Now let's calculate the expected value for $100 par value of stock for 
<br />
Alice and Bob after the medicine is tested:
<br />
1) Alice. If Alice buys the stock, the rate of return that she will 
<br />
perceive will be controlled by scenarios A and C.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected value of the stock = P'(A) x (value of stock with no 
<br />
cure)  + P'(C) x (value of stock with working cure)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 0.9952 x 0 + 
<br />
0.00498 x (100 x 1000) = 498
<br />
<br />2) Bob. Since Bob is not affected by Alice's health, the controlling 
<br />
scenarios are A,B,C,D. Hence
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected value of the stock for Bob = P(A) x (value of stock with 
<br />
no cure) + P(B) x (value of stock with no cure) + P(C) x (value of stock 
<br />
with working cure) + P(D) x (value of stock with working cure)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 0.1998 x 0 + 0.7992 x 0 + 0.001 x (100 x 1000) + 0 x (100 x 
<br />
1000) = 100
<br />
<br />As we can see, the rate of return for Alice is 4.8 times that of Bob. 
<br />
Alice will make a profit, but not Bob.
<br />
<br />Conclusions:
<br />
All this involves really basic probability theory.
<br />
The first person perspective probability is identical to the probability 
<br />
conditional to the person staying alive.
<br />
The probability of the event in question (stock going up) must be tied 
<br />
to the person staying alive ( a cure for cancer). In the case of a 
<br />
&quot;conventional&quot; QS suicide to world conditions matching the requested 
<br />
state: ie. winning one million dollars. In the deathrow case one could 
<br />
imagine a scenario in which the event in question (DNA test discovery) 
<br />
is tied to a reprieve from the governor coming because of a DNA test 
<br />
exhonerating the prisoner. The prisoner could bet on DNA testing as a 
<br />
good investment.  The airline case is similar. The hard part is figuring 
<br />
the probability of very unlikely saving events such as a scientific 
<br />
discovery,  ET landing on earth or the coming of the messiah :-)
<br />
<br />I have discussed the Newcomb paradox on a previous post (one or two 
<br />
years ago)  arguing that consciousness is &quot;relative&quot; to the (subjective 
<br />
or mental) frame of reference of the observer in a Turing-type test.
