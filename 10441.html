<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what you mean by a &quot;science of qualia&quot; - why we would need one?
</em><br />
<br />You think we don't need a science of qualia? It's the single biggest problem
<br />
there is: we don't have one! Science cannot make any justified,
<br />
authoritative prediction as to the phenomenal life of a rock, a computer,
<br />
the internet or the plumbing in Beijing or, especially, a scientist. Take a
<br />
look at Science magazine's July 2005 issue where 125 questions were posed
<br />
that face scientific inquiry over the next quarter century. The top two
<br />
questions:
<br />
<br />1. What is the universe made of? 
<br />
2. What is the biological basis of consciousness?
<br />
<br />Q2 = &quot;what is the physics of qualia?&quot;, is delivered by the answer to Q1, in
<br />
the behaviour of whatever the universe is made of, of which brain material
<br />
is constructed. This is one question, not 2.
<br />
<br />'Seeming' =  is a) directly the experiences bestowed upon us by qualia and
<br />
b) inductions(models) we make from the behaviour of the appearances thus
<br />
provided.
<br />
<br />The latter assembled as empirical laws or just 'intuited' from qualia...
<br />
does not matter. Result is the same....which is great...works
<br />
fine....until....
<br />
<br />....you turn the qualia (the evidence making system) on itself in a
<br />
scientific study of the evidence making system (qualia) to try and get a
<br />
science of qualia. Then the system breaks down: you can't see it. All you
<br />
see is the brain delivering it to a 3rd person. This is the anomaly.
<br />
<br />This means that we have literal screaming proof that the universe is not
<br />
made of 'seemings'. It's made of a separate 'something' and we have license
<br />
to scientifically consider potential 'somethings' and any underlying
<br />
fundamentals that may apply to the generation of qualia.
<br />
<br />It doesn't make any existing law of science invalid. It just means we
<br />
haven't got the complete picture (set of laws) yet. 
<br />
============================================
<br />
Here's another way to see it:
<br />
<br />Every scientific question ever posed about any 'thing' X has two questions
<br />
to ask, not one. These are:
<br />
<br />Q1. What is X?				A1. That which behaves Xly
<br />
Q2. What is it like to be X?		A2. It is like Xness
<br />
<br />The physical sciences have neglected the second question for every
<br />
scientific exploration done to date. &quot;What is it like to be X?&quot;, as a piece
<br />
of anomalous data is _only_ visible when X = &quot;the brain&quot;, where we even have
<br />
a special word for the answer to Q2 Xness = &quot;the mind&quot;.
<br />
<br />This has been culturally neglected in relation to all other X, such as X =
<br />
'an atom' and X = 'a coffee cup'. It may not be 'like anything' to be these
<br />
things. That is not the point. The point is we can make no scientific
<br />
assertion about it ......yet.
<br />
<br />We get a definite answer to Q2 only in brain material. This, I hold, is the
<br />
route to answering it for everything else. Like what is it like to be a cold
<br />
rock cf a hot rock? And so on...
<br />
==========================================
<br />
Here's yet another version of the anomaly:
<br />
<br />To illustrate the absurdity of the position of saying that 'models are
<br />
it'... consider qualia speaking Xness into your head directly. This is
<br />
equivalent to another human(an utterer) _pretending_ to be X. This is
<br />
yelling &quot;X is true&quot; at a scientist. As a result the scientist creates a
<br />
model for something behaving X-ly. It's quite predictive. Successful.
<br />
<br />But look what happens if you now do a science of qualia...behold there's an
<br />
UTTERER in there pretending! Look what it did...it did an &quot;X is true&quot; dance!
<br />
And underneath it looks nothing like Xness at all! We have found a separate
<br />
causal basis (the utterer) for qualia! Eureka. Lets tear this pretender
<br />
apart and see what makes it tick.
<br />
<br />Now go back to brain material. Xness is experienced. We look for the utterer
<br />
but we can see no Xness. Just brain material. Accepting (demanding!) qualia
<br />
as scientific evidence whilst denying that qualia are scientifically tenable
<br />
is like accepting the statement 'X is true' and whilst denying that
<br />
anyone/thing said it! 
<br />
<br />To make qualia scientifically tenable you have to be allowed to look at 'the
<br />
utterer'...structures delivering qualia... this is implicit evidence, as
<br />
opposed to explicit evidence.... but no less compelling. The fact that we
<br />
can't see qualia when we open up a brain is OUR problem, not the universe's.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;the way things seem&quot; is a model, i.e. a construct.  The model is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what we assume and that's what we investigate.  I can't tell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether you're agreeing with me in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different words or trying to point to some correction?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brent Meeker
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />What I'm saying is that a policy, a cultural attitude, preference or habit
<br />
in scientists that....
<br />
<br />'things &quot;are&quot; what they seem as described by a model that correlates with
<br />
appearances'
<br />
<br />...is perfectly fine for every case but one. When you try and do science
<br />
(the regularities of qualia as 'seemings') on the 'seeming system'(qualia).
<br />
Then it breaks down...not wrong... just completely impotent (circular) as an
<br />
explanation. You can't explain appearances with appearances.
<br />
<br />Qualia, the biggest problem,  are a cultural problem first, then a technical
<br />
problem. 
<br />
<br />So I suppose if I'm 'correcting' anything, all I'm doing is pointing to an
<br />
instance of that very cultural assumption at work in a dialogue on an email
<br />
forum......A whopping great hole in the form of a assumption that models
<br />
'are' it....which persists in spite of blatant evidence to the contrary in
<br />
brain material.
<br />
<br />The answer to Q1 'what is it all made of' is within biology because qualia
<br />
are the one and only pure expression of the deepest/complete possible
<br />
structure of whatever it is the universe is made of...
<br />
<br />Does that make sense?
<br />
<br />I have had to dream up so many different ways of saying the same thing....
<br />
it all amounts to the one overall message though: Science being
<br />
misconfigured.
<br />
<br />Cheers
