</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Stephen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Yes, that's what I am suggesting.  The rates may remain constant---i.e. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;less than a few milliseconds (as Patrick L. earlier noted) however, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;suspect there is a topology where regions of decoherence coexist and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;border regions of coherence.  An optics experiment might be able to test 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;this (if it hasn't been done already), and it might be experimentally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;testable as a psychology experiment.\\
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;More to the point---Optical experiments in QM often return counterintuitive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;results, but they support the QM math (of course).  No one has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;satisfactorily resolved the issue of measurement to everyone's liking, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;most would agree that in some brands of QM consciousness plays a role.  On 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one side we have Fred Alan Wolf and Sarfatti who seem to take the &quot;qualia&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;approach
</em><br />
<br />What do you mean by &quot;the qualia approach&quot;? Do you mean a sort of dualistic 
<br />
view of the relationship between mind and matter? From the discussion at 
<br />
<a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/rhett.html">http://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/rhett.html</a> it seems that Sarfatti suggests some 
<br />
combination of Bohm's interpretation of QM (where particles are guided by a 
<br />
'pilot wave') with the idea of adding a nonlinear term to the Schrodinger 
<br />
equation (contradicting the existing 'QM math', which is entirely linear), 
<br />
and he identifies the pilot wave with &quot;the mind&quot; and has some hand-wavey 
<br />
notion that life involves some kind of self-organizing feedback loop between 
<br />
the pilot wave and the configuration of particles (normally Bohm's 
<br />
interpretation says the configuration of particles has no effect on the 
<br />
pilot wave, but that's where the nonlinear term comes in I guess). Since 
<br />
Bohm's interpretation is wholly deterministic, I'd think Sarfatti's altered 
<br />
version would be too, the nonlinear term shouldn't change this.
<br />
<br />while on the other
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;side we have those like Roger Penrose who (I think) take a mechanical view 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(microtubules in the brain harbor Bose-Einstein condensates.)
</em><br />
<br />Penrose's proposal has nothing to do with consciousness collapsing the 
<br />
wavefunction, he just proposes that when a system in superposition crosses a 
<br />
certain threshold of *mass* (probably the Planck mass), then it collapses 
<br />
automatically. The microtubule idea is more speculative, but he's just 
<br />
suggesting that the brain somehow takes advantage of not-yet-understood 
<br />
quantum gravity effects to go beyond what computers can do, but the collapse 
<br />
of superposed states in the brain would still be gravitationally-induced.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this model-building (and discussion) is fine, of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;course, but there are a number of psychological experiments out there that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consistently return counterintuitive and heretofore unexplainable results.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Among them, is Helmut Schmidt's &quot;retro pk&quot; experiment which consistently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;returns odd results.  The PEAR lab at Princeton has some startling &quot;remote 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;viewing&quot; results, and of course, there's Rupert Sheldrake's work.   As far 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as I know, Sheldrake is the only one who has tried to create a model 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(&quot;morphic resonance&quot;), and most QM folks typically avoid discussing the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiments--except to deride them as nonscientific.  I think it may be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time to revisit some of these &quot;ESP&quot; experiments to see if the results are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;telling us something in terms of QM, i.e. decoherence.   Changing our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumptions about decoherence, then applying the model to those strange 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiments may clarify things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;RM
</em><br />
<br />Here's a skeptical evaluation of some of the ESP experiments you mention:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040603153145/www.btinternet.com/~neuronaut/webtwo_features_psi_two.htm">http://web.archive.org/web/20040603153145/www.btinternet.com/~neuronaut/webtwo_features_psi_two.htm</a>
<br />
<br />Anyway, if it were possible for the mind to induce even a slight statistical 
<br />
bias in the probability of a bit flipping 1 or 0, then simply by picking a 
<br />
large enough number of trials it would be possible to very reliably insure 
<br />
that the majority would be the number the person was focusing on. So by 
<br />
doing multiple sets with some sufficiently large number N of trials in each 
<br />
set, it would be possible to actually send something like a 10-digit bit 
<br />
string (for example, if the majority of digits in the first N trials came up 
<br />
1, you'd have the first digit of your 10-digit string be a 1), something 
<br />
which would not require a lot of tricky statistical analysis to see was very 
<br />
unlikely to occur by chance. If the &quot;retro-PK&quot; effect you mentioned was 
<br />
real, this could even be used to reliably send information into the past! 
<br />
When these ESP researchers are able to do a straightforward demonstration 
<br />
like this, that's when I'll start taking these claims seriously, until then 
<br />
&quot;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&quot;.
<br />
