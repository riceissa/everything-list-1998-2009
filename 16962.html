<br />
With Bruno and his mighty handful engaged in the undodgeable (though
<br />
constantly dodged) task of working towards an elementary grasp of the
<br />
technical underpinnings of COMP, and patently lacking the fortitude of
<br />
these valorous Stakhanovites, I have been spending my time lurking,
<br />
reading and musing. My philosophical position on possible relations
<br />
between computation and mind has long (well before this list) been
<br />
that it would indeed require something like Bruno's reversal of the
<br />
'normal' relationship between computation and physics, so that mind
<br />
could emerge in some at least comprehensible manner; certainly not -
<br />
per impossibile - in the ghostly shrouds of the 'deus ex machina' of
<br />
'computational materialism'.  Consequently, parallel to the strenuous
<br />
effort ongoing in the other thread, I have been wrapping my mind more
<br />
loosely around 'interpretations of COMP-mechanics' in order to attempt
<br />
a better personal grasp of what it might mean as a metaphysics.  As
<br />
always, I need help, so here goes for starters.
<br />
<br />Bruno has sometimes remarked (if I'm not misrepresenting him) that
<br />
COMP introduces us to machines and their dreams and I find this
<br />
metaphor very cogent and suggestive.  Certainly it seems to me that my
<br />
present state could coherently be characterised as a peculiarly
<br />
consistent dream - one that I nonetheless assume to be correlated
<br />
systematically with features of some otherwise unreachable
<br />
'elsewhere'.  In COMP, the 'mechanism and language of dreams' is
<br />
posited to be those elements of the number realm and its operators
<br />
that are deemed necessary to instantiate a 'universal TM' (i.e. one
<br />
that - assuming CT to be true - is capable of computing any computable
<br />
function).  Given this point of departure, it follows that machines so
<br />
instantiated would be capable of implementing any computable 'dream'
<br />
whatsoever - including dreams instantiating yet further levels of
<br />
machines and their dreams.  With an additional dovetailing assumption,
<br />
we find ourselves in a position to construct a sort of hyper-threaded
<br />
layer-cake of dreaming where, from any arbitrary level, recursively
<br />
nested dreams disappear towards infinity both 'upwards' and
<br />
'downwards'.
<br />
<br />As we 'drill down' into this gateau, we are looking for emergent
<br />
patterns of invariance representing the self-referential viewpoints of
<br />
layers of 'dreaming machines' - their experience and their 'external
<br />
reality'.  The lowest level of recursion that any particular system of
<br />
dreaming requires for its instantiation is taken to constitute its
<br />
'substitution level'.  Since which layer of the cake this corresponds
<br />
to must be unknowable from the viewpoint of any level we currently
<br />
occupy, we ineluctably take a gamble if we say 'yes' to any doctor who
<br />
claims to know what he's about.  BTW, on this topic, I would refer you
<br />
to an interesting analogy that I append as a footnote below.
<br />
<br />So, what can we take 'reality' (i.e. real, as you will recall, &quot;in the
<br />
sense that I am real&quot;) to mean in this schema?  We cannot know, but we
<br />
do want to say that it corresponds self-referentially - in some sense
<br />
- to the number realm, and that the true language of the dreaming
<br />
machines therefore corresponds - also in some self-referential sense -
<br />
to numbers and their inter-relations.  This 'sense of correspondence'
<br />
can be defined in two ways: 'truth', which is taken to correspond
<br />
self-referentially to the unknowably 'real', and 'provability', which
<br />
is taken to correspond to what this reality can consistently claim,
<br />
express, or represent to itself.
<br />
<br />This is about as far as I've got, and broad as it is, it seems to
<br />
point more or less in the direction of a detailed research programme
<br />
such as Bruno has outlined.  I can see that stipulations on 'reality'
<br />
such as universal computability make implicit claims that are
<br />
empirically falsifiable in principle, which is most encouraging.
<br />
Also, this general approach seems to me to have striking resonances
<br />
with metaphysics such as Bohm's notions of implication and
<br />
explication, as well as MWI.  Anyway - Bruno, I would be grateful as
<br />
ever - when you have a moment - if you would tell me which end of what
<br />
wrong stick I've got hold of this time.

<br />
<br />One day a group of scientists got together and decided that man had
<br />
come a long way and no longer needed God. So they picked one scientist
<br />
to go and tell Him that they were done with Him. The scientist walked
<br />
up to God and said, &quot;God, we've decided that we no longer need you.
<br />
We're to the point that we can clone people and do many miraculous
<br />
things, so why don't you just go on and get lost.&quot;
<br />
<br />God listened very patiently and kindly to the man and after the
<br />
scientist was done talking, God said, &quot;Very well, how about this,
<br />
let's say we have a man making contest.&quot; To which the scientist
<br />
replied, &quot;OK, great!&quot; But God added, &quot;Now, we're going to do this just
<br />
like I did back in the old days with Adam.&quot; The scientist said, &quot;Sure,
<br />
no problem&quot; and bent down and grabbed himself a handful of dirt. God
<br />
just looked at him and said, &quot;No, no, no. You go get your own dirt!&quot;
