<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I suspect that the comp hypothesis would in fact favour the solution where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;there is actually no external world at all, but only your (for me, my!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;mind, because it is much shorter to describe ONLY a brain state than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;whole Universe surrounding it, although perfectly equivalent regarding our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;sensations. So no world, no friends and no physical laws. We would be back
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to some kind of solipsism, which has been known for a long time to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;unprovable and undisprovable- just desperately useless.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The comp hypothesis favour indeed a solution where there is no external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world at all, nor even any material (whatever it means) brains.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But that is exactly why I say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;We can find ourselves ONLY in those structures which are relatively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;numerous, not to survive but to REMAIN WITH OTHERS and a (relatively)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stable environment.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />If you admit that the others and the external environment do not really
<br />
exist, it is difficult to understand why &quot;they&quot; (more precisely, the
<br />
representation we have from them) should obey precise laws, even
<br />
statistical. That's what I tried to develop in the next paragraph.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Even if we are made of this matter, precise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;mathematical laws are not required to make an organized system work:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;civilizations are made of individuals, and they are well structured despite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the absence of a good mathematical description of each individual.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OK. What is the point ?
</em><br />
<br />The point is that I don't see what should oblige the matter to obey precise
<br />
laws, if we are not &quot;really&quot; made of it. In other words, why should a
<br />
&quot;conscious computation&quot; exist only if it implements some representation of
<br />
mathematical laws?
<br />
As a matter of fact, most of our conscious activity does NOT rely on
<br />
mathematical laws (or mathematical representations of physical laws). For
<br />
me it proves that the representation of physical laws is not NECESSARY to
<br />
consciousness. It could be then a question of probability, but I don't see
<br />
why the number of computations implementing precise physical laws should be
<br />
much greater than the number of computations not implementing then - in
<br />
fact I would think just the opposite.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In short the computationnalist (objective) idealism protect us from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;solipsism (subjective idealisme).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In fact it is not true that the description of ONLY one brain is much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shorter than than the description of the whole Universe surrounding it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because DeWitt-Wheeler equation, or any UD (universal dovetailer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;algorithm) are compressed description of all possible universes and all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible self-aware substructures in there.
</em><br />
<br />I would think that the &quot;UD&quot; is much larger than the DeWitt-Wheeler
<br />
equation, so it can describe also a huge number of universes without any
<br />
reasonable relationship within it.
<br />
<br />I'll try to put it in more quantitative form. I assume I can give a
<br />
&quot;measure&quot; of the set of possible Universes and separate it into three
<br />
classes:
<br />
A : the subset of universes without conscious beings
<br />
B : the subset of universes containing SAS apparently observing a
<br />
environment without physical laws.
<br />
C : the subset of universes containing SAS apparently observing a
<br />
environment with physical laws.
<br />
<br />It seems that we live in a C-Universe. Why?
<br />
<br />I guess (I may be wrong) that if you POSTULATE the existence of a reality
<br />
obeying physical laws, you could hope to demonstrate
<br />
m(A)&gt;&gt;m(C)&gt;&gt;m(B),
<br />
because it is very improbable that conscious beings doing repeated physical
<br />
experiments would be unable to unveil the existence of physical laws (for
<br />
example by finding systematically very improbable results where the
<br />
statistical distributions predicted by QM are never recovered).
<br />
The observation of A is excluded by the (generalized) anthropic principle,
<br />
so we explain satisfactorily why we see &quot;C&quot;.
<br />
<br />However, I think that the &quot;everything computable is realized&quot; hypothesis
<br />
would predict m(A)&gt;&gt;m(B)&gt;&gt;m(C), and so the reason why we are in C is much
<br />
more mysterious with this hypothesis. Of course if you think you can
<br />
justify also m(C)&gt;&gt;m(B) with comp, it would have the bonus to explain why
<br />
physical laws exist (which must be postulated in the first stage), but I am
<br />
really not convinced of that.
<br />
