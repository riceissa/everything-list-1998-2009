</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Come on Mirek: &quot;Theaetetical&quot; is an adjective I have forged from  
<br />
&quot;Theatetus&quot;.
<br />
&quot;Theatetus&quot; gives 195.000 results on Google.
<br />
&quot;Theatetus&quot; wiki 4310.
<br />
<br />By &quot;theatetical notion of knowledge&quot;, I mean the &quot;well known&quot; attempts  
<br />
to define &quot;knowledge&quot; by Theaetetus in Plato's Theaetetus. The most  
<br />
known definition is &quot;truye justified belief&quot;, that Bill taylor just  
<br />
mentionned on the FOR list recently as:
<br />
&quot;This old crock should have been given a decent burial long ago.&quot;
<br />
I guess I will have to make a comment ...
<br />
<br /><br />My work is, without doubt, very difficult to read because it crosses  
<br />
three or four fields: &quot;mathematical logic&quot;, &quot;philosophy of mind&quot; and  
<br />
&quot;computer science&quot;;  + quantum mechanics to evaluate the plausibility  
<br />
of the derived computationalist physics. This does not help in an  
<br />
epoch of hyper-specialization.
<br />
I am also using a deductive approach in the philosophy of mind. I am  
<br />
apparently the first to *postulate* &quot;mechanism&quot;.  Most philosophers of  
<br />
mind accept mechanism as the only rational theory, or reject it with  
<br />
some passion. Few, if any, use it as an hypothesis, in a deductive  
<br />
strategy. Then mathematical logic is virtually unknown, except by  
<br />
mathematical logicians, who, for historical reasons, do not want to  
<br />
come back to the earlier philosophical motivations: they want to be  
<br />
accepted as pure mathematicians. Except the philosophical logicians,  
<br />
who in majority criticized classical logic, and see philosphy as a  
<br />
mean to criticize classical philosophy. Mathematicians are so used to  
<br />
classical philosophy, that they consider it as science, and hate to be  
<br />
remind that this is still a philosophical.
<br />
<br />I have no feedback for purely contingent reason related to facts which  
<br />
have nothing to do with the startling feature of the conclusion of the  
<br />
reasoning. Up to now, I heard continuously about critics on an  
<br />
imaginary work I have never done. The price of the best PhD thesis  
<br />
that I got in France has eventually only spread those rumor from  
<br />
Brussels to elsewhere.
<br />
All real scientist who have studied my work and have accepted to meet  
<br />
me, or to write a real report on it, have understood it. True, some  
<br />
took a rather long time to understand, but that is normal: the subject  
<br />
matter is very complex, and still taboo, especially for the atheists,  
<br />
and other religious-based thinkers. But when they study it, they  
<br />
quickly discover that I use the scientific method, that is I am just  
<br />
asking a question, what is wrong with the following reasoning? ... The  
<br />
reasoning is decomposed in &quot;easy&quot; steps, so people accepting (for  
<br />
personal belief or for the sake of the argument) the hypotheses and  
<br />
wanting to reject the conclusion have a way to put their fingers on  
<br />
some problems.
<br />
<br />UDA has been judged to obvious and simple in Brussels, and that is why  
<br />
I have augmented the thesis with the AUDA, which unfortunately is  
<br />
considered as ... too much simple for logicians, and too much  
<br />
difficult for non logicians. But AUDA is not needed at all to  
<br />
understand the simple and clear result: if we are digitalisable  
<br />
machine, the laws of physics emerge from a statistics on computations,  
<br />
in a verifiable way (quantitatively and qualitatively). The result is  
<br />
very simple and clear: the reasoning which leads to that result is  
<br />
much more subtle and difficult.
<br />
<br />I am not at all pretending that reasoning is correct. Science progress  
<br />
when people do errors, but we have to find them, and sometimes, if we  
<br />
don't find them, we have to accept momentarily the conclusion, perhaps  
<br />
with the hope an error will be find later. But the attitude of a (tiny  
<br />
but influencing) part of the community consists in hiding the  
<br />
reasoning, or deforming it completely. This can't help.
<br />
<br />Some people, even here recently (see 1Z's post) and recently on the  
<br />
FOR list, attributes me a curious theory, where they confuse the  
<br />
conclusion with the postulate (which deprives the work of *any*  
<br />
meaning). But the theory I am studying is the old &quot;mechanist theory&quot;,  
<br />
in its modern digital version, and nothing else. So, if they have a  
<br />
genuine interest in the subject, we would begin to learn something if  
<br />
they can criticize some point in the reasoning, instead of ignoring  
<br />
it, or attributing it statements without ever referring to a relevant  
<br />
piece of text. Of course they can't point on such text, given that  
<br />
such information exists only in their mind. They repeat rumors, and  
<br />
have clearly not take time to read the papers.
<br />
<br />The fact that the result would contradict the current paradigm does  
<br />
not help, of course, but is not, yet, the source of the problem.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I let those interested to meditate on two questions (N is {0, 1, 2,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 3,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 4, ...}):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1) What is common between the set of all subsets of a set with n
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; elements, and the set of all finite sequences of &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; length
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; n.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2) What is common between the set of all subsets of N, and the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all infinite sequences of &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Just some (finite and infinite) bread for surviving the day :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am going to catch up with the thread ...
</em><br />
<br />Welcome back Mirek. Feel free to ask for any clarification, position  
<br />
adjustments, question, at any level ...Do you understand what is the  
<br />
comp hypothesis?
