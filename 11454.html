<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a) assume that there is an 'objective reality in the Bruno sense: a
</em><br />
reality exists. _any_ sort of reality will do.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; b) draw a purely notional boundary around any portion of it at any
</em><br />
spatiotemporal scale.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
[DAVID]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you think it's possible *not* to start with this assumption?
</em><br />
<br />[COLIN]
<br />
No. As a scientifically hypotheses you have a bunch of options, but for
<br />
this particular one:
<br />
<br />H1: &quot;There is a real world and our perceptions permit a level of
<br />
apprehension of it&quot;
<br />
<br />....you'd have to say that the existence and ongoing success of science
<br />
makes it perhaps one of the most empirically supported scientific theorems
<br />
of all time. Every experiment ever done is an emplicit experiment on this
<br />
hypothsesis. A philosophical argument questioning the existence of reality
<br />
would have to be an untestable/sophist waste of good words, no?
<br />
<br />[DAVID]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem with natural language is that it implicitly assumes the AIV is
</em><br />
'out there' as the primary reality, and it can be tough to work
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; back from this point of departure. I was trying to develop a language
</em><br />
that started from the APV and worked outwards, as it were, so that it was
<br />
easier to see how emergent information boundaries were shaping and
<br />
structuring the APV and the AIV while at the same time contingently
<br />
creating the 'not-X', without fundamentally creating novel ontic (as
<br />
opposed to epistemic) categories.
<br />
<br />[COLIN]
<br />
I'm not sure you need be so shy about creating the novel ontic categories
<br />
- after all, the set we have is entirely an organisation of appearances,
<br />
not the actual reality underneath. If there is ontic validity to be had,
<br />
the as yet unassailed ontology of the underlying reality is the only 'real
<br />
one'. However, the two are not in any real conflict - they are separate
<br />
ontologies.
<br />
<br />[DAVID]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Somehow it's like:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a) we mentally step outside of the APV to see what it's like in the
</em><br />
'external world'
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; b) we make models of what we see out there (the AIV), including our
</em><br />
'brains'
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; c) then we forget about step a), get stranded outside, and take the AIV
</em><br />
for 'reality'
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; d) leaving us in a panic about how to get back inside our 'brains'
</em><br />
<br />[COLIN]
<br />
This is an assumption of truth of the following hypothesis:
<br />
H2: &quot;There is a real world an we literally access it&quot;
<br />
<br />This, I think, conflicts with modern neuroscience and is therefore
<br />
refuted. It makes use of an assumption about perception that is not
<br />
proven. However, getting mainstream empirisism and consciousness studies
<br />
to realise it is another matter!
<br />
<br />[DAVID]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Somebody once asked &quot;what is the external world 'external' to?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you know?
</em><br />
<br />Damned good question! It seems that anything perceptually regarded as 'not
<br />
me' would do. I've found the terms by Derek Denton useful:
<br />
<br />'INTEROCEPTION' as those phenomenal percepts constructed of qualia
<br />
intentionality(aboutness) directed at physical self (situational emotions,
<br />
primordial emotions).  I would extend the definition to include internal
<br />
imagery of all kinds as a more complex form.
<br />
<br />'EXTEROCEPTION' as those phenomenal percepts constructed of qualia
<br />
representing (intentional content/aboutness in respect of) the external
<br />
world or our physical interface with it (touch, taste, vsision, aural
<br />
etc).
<br />
<br />So I guess the external world is &quot;that part of reality depicted by and
<br />
therefore apprehended through exteroception&quot; would be as good a starting
<br />
definition as any. It depends on whether the notion of 'self' includes
<br />
physical self (I think it does).
<br />
<br />[COLIN]
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some people here think the APV is '3-person'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some people here think the AIV is '3-person'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
[DAVID]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My view is that the *fact of * the APV is 1-person, and everything else
</em><br />
is 3-person. That is, the 1-person is the unmediated intuitive grasp of
<br />
3-person information by the 'underlying reality'. What lies within the
<br />
APV, the AIV, or the 'external world' to which they refer, then depends
<br />
solely on contingent boundaries emerging from 3-person
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information gradients and horizons.  Essentially this is categorising
</em><br />
the ontology as 1-person, and the epistemology as 3-person. However, I
<br />
realise that this is a minority approach, and has caused much
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confusion, so I've more or less given up trying to promote it.
</em><br />
<br />[COLIN]
<br />
How can this approach possibly be optional!
<br />
<br />[DAVID]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the general view is that the APV is 1-person, and the AIV is
</em><br />
3-person. But then, the AIV *model* of the APV is 3-person, and the
<br />
distinction between this and the 1-person APV is confusing (the 'hard
<br />
problem').
<br />
<br />[COLIN]
<br />
The mere idea of self referential model (the AIV *model* of the APV) is,
<br />
IMO, an oxymoron at the heart of the (hard) problem. This is a cultural
<br />
assumption several hundred years old - it's use-by date is soooooo
<br />
expired. How do you get the message out?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [COLIN]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The easiest way to think of it is to regard X as a finger puppet. The
</em><br />
'fingers' are behaving atomly in that the fingers are painted (appear -
<br />
APV) to deliver the appearance of 'atom-ly (AIV) behaviour'. The AIV says
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nothing about FINGERS. Then note that whatever the fingers are - you,
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; observer - are made of the SAME FINGERS and those fingers are painting
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; APV in your head. The reason no-one ever gets a physics of qualia is
</em><br />
that
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nobody EVER gets scientific about _fingers_ - the underling physics -
</em><br />
Everyone thinks the AIV generalisations ARE the fingers.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
[DAVID]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Conventional physics, I think, denies that the fingers exist - all that
</em><br />
can be said is what QM / string theory / model of the month describes, and
<br />
this is equivalent to saying that that's all there is folks. Comp,
<br />
however, would say that the fingers are something like mathematical ontic
<br />
/ epistemic categories (see some of Marc Geddes' posts), and that these
<br />
support the emergence of 3-person relata. Sets of these 1-person /
<br />
3-person relationships can be nested recursively, the whole resting on the
<br />
'turtle' of a tightly constrained
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'number reality' (e.g. AR+CT+UDA). The 'modest' assumption here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that not to force 'faith' in comp, but rather study and test it for
</em><br />
its interesting and surprising results and generative power. The most
<br />
powerful result would be to pin down the 'emergence direction' of
<br />
1-person &lt;--&gt; 3-person once and for all.
<br />
<br />[COLIN]
<br />
Yes. This denial really freaks me out. It makes cosmology a religion. As a
<br />
scientist I cannot tolerate it.
<br />
<br />RE: COMP
<br />
I have a calculus (a heuristic for one, really) called 'entropy calculus',
<br />
EC, which I think (not sure yet but confidence rising) might be able to be
<br />
thought of an actual instance of COMP based on the real occurrence (rough
<br />
coincidence) of an extravagently huge number of identical primitives
<br />
(which operate as axioms). Each axiom can be viewed as a 'mathematician'.
<br />
The calculus is massively parallel mathematics (not singular/serial, as
<br />
driven by a lone classical mathematician pushing a proof along). The
<br />
current state of the cooperative efforts of all the mathematicians
<br />
....whose relationships are iterative rules of
<br />
inference/transformation.... literally is reality. There is one massive
<br />
rolling 'proof' unfolding without end.
<br />
<br />My maths skills are not strong enough to deal with all the nuances of
<br />
Bruno's ideas, but I have picked up on key relata. The main point: There
<br />
is no abstraction/modelling going on. This is not a computation but a
<br />
COMPutation. At least I think it can be viewed this way. What Bruno's work
<br />
does is to explore the general features of it. The only problem I have
<br />
with it is if you say that COMP can happen as a result of
<br />
constructing a computational 'as-if' substrate made of our reality - then
<br />
every practically useful thing about COMP dissappears (there is no 'actual
<br />
being' in the analyses of COMP, only notional indicators of those aspect
<br />
that might correspond to 'being').
<br />
<br />So on that proviso - that reality is a literal instantation of _a_ COMP
<br />
then...
<br />
<br />If reality = state of the proof, then
<br />
(a) physical stuff = a proof in EC = matter. These are proven truths in EC.
<br />
(b) the unproven truths in EC are, in effect, 'virtual matter'
<br />
<br />The pactical view:
<br />
2 mathematicians A, B working together(coherent) prove 3 theorems.
<br />
(i) A (matter)
<br />
(ii) B (matter)
<br />
(iii) A with respect to B (virtual matter)
<br />
<br />neither mathematician A nor B physically 'proves' (iii), it is implicit in
<br />
the act of (i) and (ii) that their relationship (iii) is just as well
<br />
defined as (i) and (ii). It's just that no mathematician actually does the
<br />
proof. It's inherent in the parallelism of the situation.
<br />
so...
<br />
The relationship ME_AS_MATTER (proof) and NOT-ME (all the rest of matter
<br />
as other proofs) is a massive collection of unproven truths in EC. This is
<br />
the 'latent perspective view' of NOT_ME from ME that I speak of. This is
<br />
NOT 1-person as discussed above, but latent 1-person, actually used by the
<br />
brain to construct 1-person. Parallelism is intrinsic to the situation -
<br />
so if a COMP implementation enforces any loss of parallelism COMP will
<br />
never be able to claim that the resulting system has any consciousness.
<br />
That's I think is the essence of the only problem I have with COMP.
<br />
<br /><br />In other words:
<br />
<br />REALITY is a COMPUTATION on a natural axiom set?  YES.
<br />
COMPUTATION manfactured of an existing reality constructs a REALITY?  NO.
<br />
<br />btw...
<br />
<br />Ql. What if mathematician A, modifies (i) to 'act as-if' (ii) existed?
<br />
Voila QUALIA can be piggybacked off the 'latent view' = virtual matter = 
<br />
virtual proof (iii). Takes a while to get used to this.
<br />
<br />Q2. Does this not mean that &quot;associative memory&quot; is literally &quot;inductive
<br />
inference&quot; that creates a 'truth' in EC that could be regarded 'a useful
<br />
but unproven lie' about reality = empirical knowledge implemented in EC?
<br />
<br />There you have an ontolgy and a derivative empistemology implemented in EC.
<br />
<br />Also.. re 'turtles'
<br />
The turtles in EC are merely fluctuations. They are what would could be
<br />
called 'loops' in QM. Recursivity = nested loops. Anything with a result =
<br />
1 loop can combine with any other loop...thus with loops you can make
<br />
everything (including strings). The ultimate 'biggee' fluctuation = the
<br />
whole universe. Everything is the same at all scales.
<br />
<br />so...
<br />
<br />Maybe bruno can calibrate the terms in COMP jargon so we're all on the
<br />
same page. The EC, as an actual instance (or a class of instances) of
<br />
COMP, should be able to be expressed in COMP terms, but I don't know how.
<br />
I'd like to write it all up - as it is predictive of the behaviour of
<br />
brain material in the way that Bruno wants COMP to be empirically
<br />
testable. At least that's what I am beginning to think, having beaten my
<br />
head over his maths for a while (my brain hurts).
<br />
<br />so when you say:
<br />
&quot;&gt; is that not to force 'faith' in comp, but rather study and test it for
<br />
its interesting and surprising results and generative power. The most
<br />
powerful result would be to pin down the 'emergence direction' of
<br />
1-person &lt;--&gt; 3-person once and for all.&quot;
<br />
<br />This is how I would look at it: I got to EC just via Godel/Church/Turing
<br />
and thinking in real terms. Bruno has, I think, generalised the whole
<br />
process but not fully grasped the reification of it ...or more likely :-)
<br />
.... I have not fully grasped his notions of reification. Calulus based on
<br />
non-numerics must seem weird to a mathematician, but there are no
<br />
'numbers' in our EC reality, only fluctuations in aggregate that have
<br />
properties 'sufficiently like' numbers to create the local calculii we
<br />
identify as 'empiirical laws of nature'.
<br />
<br />If you could help me relate EC to COMP it'd be a big help. I think there
<br />
might be a TOE in here someplace via a reified COMP instantated as EC that
<br />
is empirically supported but ONLY testable in brain material. Just an
<br />
idea.
<br />
<br />How'd we get here from the original thread question? Whew! I blame that
<br />
person! :-)
<br />
