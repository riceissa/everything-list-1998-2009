<br /><br />Explanation.
<br />
Take the duplication W M. Suppose you will be duplicated
<br />
from here to two different places W and M. In computer jargon
<br />
you are cut here and paste in W and in M.
<br />
Comp indeterminacy comes from the fact that you cannot be sure
<br />
in advance where you will feel yourself being, from a
<br />
1-person point of view,.
<br />
At first, probabilities, perhaps in the frequency type approaches,
<br />
could be justified by iterating the procedure. If you repeat the
<br />
procedure 64 times, the majority of the 2^64 resulting person
<br />
would recognize their inability to predict their path (WWMWMMM....).
<br />
<br />Not all &quot;probabilist&quot; accept such sort of justification and some
<br />
objects that
<br />
the 1-person uncertainty has no operational meaning. Indeed, you
<br />
cannot apparently use the duplication to win or lose a bet in a fair
<br />
game with a third person. Two cases can be considered: the Candidate C
<br />
(the one who will undergo the duplication W M) put one dollar in a
<br />
bank. The third person bets one dollar that C will find himself in
<br />
W, against C who bets one dollar that he will find himself in M.
<br />
Of course C is transformed into C_M and C_W in the duplication process.
<br />
CW must
<br />
gives one dollar to the third person who must gives one dollar to the
<br />
C_M. The third person neither can win nor lose. The money is just
<br />
exchanged  between the &quot;doppelgangers&quot;. A similar exchange occurs
<br />
if the candidate have his money with him so that his account is
<br />
duplicated (except the bill loose his value ...).
<br />
<br />Now, the point I make is that betting strategies for handling
<br />
uncertainty can be re-established by ... duplicating the third
<br />
person too, sharing the W-M trips with the candidate. In some sense,
<br />
it is a way for the third person to entangle its story with the 
<br />
candidate's story. In that case the multiplied third person will 
<br />
recognize in each of his stories that he has win or lose the bet.
<br />
<br />This gives rise to a notion of first person plural discourse, which is
<br />
just sharable first person discourse, and which can make some of
<br />
the typical first person notions (like the 1-indeterminacy) into locally
<br />
third person notions (like the apparant quantum indeterminacy).
<br />
<br />This is what I happen in the description of multi-observer measurements
<br />
has explained by Everett. Looking to the up or down state of 64 photon
<br />
beam each in the superposition state (up + down), you will find
<br />
yourself multiplied in the 2^64 &quot;UP UP DOWN ...&quot;-like  stories, but if
<br />
you did decide to phone me for telling in which story you are you will
<br />
multiplied me in a coherent way.
<br />
<br />The strict coherence giving the right entanglement has not yet been derived
<br />
from comp. Nor has been proved comp give incorrect coherence conditions.
<br />
<br />The many world, or any modal realism, multiplies collection of observers.
<br />
If the multiplication is enough coherent, this entails first person
<br />
plural notions which appears to the observers inside each population as
<br />
third person. Technically, it is here that a &quot;nice&quot; tensorial product
<br />
should rise.
<br />
