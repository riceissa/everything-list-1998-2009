<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;YD is certainly speculative, but there is considerable evidence that

human experience is an epiphenomena of brain activity - from which is

follows that YD is possible. So far as I know there is nothing in QM 
<br />
that contradicts it. In fact Tegmark and others have shown that the 
<br />
operation of the human brain must be almost completely classical. So 
<br />
for YD to be inconsistent with physics it would have to inconsistent 
<br />
with classical physics.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Why do you think YD is inconsistent with QM?

<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Hi Brent,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage of the argument I feel like answering: because Bruno 
<br />
thinks so! But you deserve a better answer. I don't
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;quite think your statements above are quite accurate and one does not 
<br />
surely follow from the other. Human experience
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is surely NOT an epiphenomenon of brain activity though SOME of it 
<br />
very likely is. To me, at least human experience includes things like: 
<br />
we are born, we eat, we grow, we play, we work, we meet other people, 
<br />
we learn to dance, we drive cars, we get into accidents, we get sick, 
<br />
we go to war, we run into bullets, we get old, we forget, we die. It 
<br />
also includes things like, we
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;are happy, we are sad, we pain, we dream, we crave, we wonder, we 
<br />
prove theorems. See what I mean? Are all these
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;epiphenomena of barin activity? I don't think you can say that about 
<br />
the first set though I am sure you have experienced
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;some of what I describe. About the second set you may be more 
<br />
convinced but I am sure you have heard the word
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;intensionality&quot; associated to at least some of those. It reminds us 
<br />
that some of our so called &quot;mental states&quot; (brain configurations if you 
<br />
prefer&quot; have a certain directionality to them usually pointing to 
<br />
events that we take to be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;consensually external to us. So maybe you want to widen a bit your 
<br />
concept of 'human experience&quot; above.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated before I believe it is not difficult to imagine a 
<br />
situation in which you can falsify, by a non-local quantum
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;mechanical experiment the type of hypothesis that Bruno calls YD, 
<br />
meaning one scenario in which all your experience
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(by which I mean what I describe above) is, at some point in your 
<br />
life, replaced by a suitably programmed digital
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;computer. Bruno states that he actually knows this to be the case that 
<br />
is the reason I have not given myself the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;trouble to try and sharpen up the argument. But I am quite confident 
<br />
that this can be done with a bit of patience
<br />
&nbsp;and the help of the many wonders of quantum states.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can tell you are correct in that Classical Mechanics does 
<br />
not, a priori, forbid such &quot;operation&quot; if the brain
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is indeed a fully classical functional system and Tegmark's argument 
<br />
has obvious merit. On the other hand there may
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;be other &quot;technical&quot; impediments to this &quot;avatar&quot; that we don't know 
<br />
about since we do not really know much
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;about brain function and surely about how it really pins down human 
<br />
experience (in the narrow or wide sense).
