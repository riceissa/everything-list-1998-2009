Hi David,
<br />
<br />I comment your post with an apology to Kim and Marty, then I make a  
<br />
comment to Marty, and then I comment your (very nice) post.
<br />
<br /><br />Kim, Marty, I apologize for my bad sense of humor. Rereading some  
<br />
post, I realize some nuance in the tone does not go through mailings.  
<br />
Please indulge professional deformation of an old math teacher ...

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;            I appreciated this post because I'm more interested in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical implications (which I'm hoping to find at the end of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA bridge to Valhalla) of these goings-on  ...than in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones. Best,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Marty, I can understand you. At the same time, many discussion have  
<br />
been more philosophical, and the problem here, is that without some  
<br />
amount of math, and of computer science, things will look like a  
<br />
crackpot-like thing. It is almost in the nature of the subject. Big  
<br />
statements needs big arguments, and at least enough precise pointers  
<br />
toward the real thing.
<br />
<br />You can have a still more passive understanding of the UDA, if you  
<br />
understand the first sixth steps. Then for the seventh, it is enough  
<br />
to believe in the existence of universal dovetailer (itself a quasi  
<br />
direct consequence of the existence of a universal machine).
<br />
Then the 8th step alone can help you to have an idea why the Universal  
<br />
dovetailer is immaterial, so that physics has to be reduced to math  
<br />
and &quot;machine psuchology/theology&quot;.
<br />
But then, I will not been able to answer some remark which have been  
<br />
done by Stathis, Russell, Brent and some others, and which are  
<br />
relalted to the difference between a computation (be it mathematical  
<br />
or physical)  and a description of a computation (be it mathematical  
<br />
or physical), and this is the key for understanding that when we  
<br />
assume brain are digitalizable, eventually we have to abandon the idea  
<br />
that consciousness supervene on physical computations, and to accept  
<br />
that it supervenes on mathematical computations.
<br />
You know, the discovery of the universal machine is the real  
<br />
(creative) bomb here. I could say that &quot;nature&quot; has never stopped to  
<br />
invent it and reinvent it, like with the apparition of brain, of life  
<br />
and the possible other many big bangs.
<br />
Then, it is hard to explain, without learning a bit on numbers,  
<br />
functions, sets and mathematical structures, that arithmetic, simple  
<br />
elementary arithmetic, already describes that universal thing which  
<br />
can't help itself to reinvent hitself again and again and again, and  
<br />
this in an atemporal, aspatial frames.
<br />
<br />Sri Aurobindo made once a nice summary:
<br />
<br />What, you ask, was the beginning of it all?
<br />
And it is this ...
<br />
Existence that multiplied itself
<br />
For sheer delight of being
<br />
And plunged into numberless trillions of forms
<br />
So that it might
<br />
Find
<br />
Itself
<br />
Innumerably

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With Bruno and his mighty handful engaged in the undodgeable (though
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constantly dodged) task
</em><br />
<br />Well said!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; of working towards an elementary grasp of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technical underpinnings of COMP, and patently lacking the fortitude of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these valorous Stakhanovites, I have been spending my time lurking,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reading and musing. My philosophical position on possible relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between computation and mind has long (well before this list) been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it would indeed require something like Bruno's reversal of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'normal' relationship between computation and physics, so that mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could emerge in some at least comprehensible manner; certainly not -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; per impossibile - in the ghostly shrouds of the 'deus ex machina' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'computational materialism'. Consequently, parallel to the strenuous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effort ongoing in the other thread, I have been wrapping my mind more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; loosely around 'interpretations of COMP-mechanics' in order to attempt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a better personal grasp of what it might mean as a metaphysics. As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always, I need help, so here goes for starters.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This points to another problem I have. The UDA, and probably even more  
<br />
the AUDA, has deeply changed my &quot;philosophy&quot;, up to a point where I  
<br />
think that philosophy and metaphysics can be handled with the doubting  
<br />
attitude of the (ideal) scientist, and that this attitude is a vaccine  
<br />
against the most inhuman aspect of &quot;human science&quot;. But then I have  
<br />
reason to suggest that everything becomes far more clearer if we drop  
<br />
the expression &quot;fundamental science&quot;, philosophy&quot;,  
<br />
&quot;metaphysics&quot; (unless we use them in their original greek senses) and  
<br />
come back to the expression &quot;theology&quot;. If you want, assuming comp,  
<br />
metaphysics becomes a theology, with its communicable and non  
<br />
communicable parts. Assuming comp we can already listen to the course  
<br />
on machine theology provided by the machines.
<br />
But then I know that I look over-provocative.
<br />
At the same time, I feel that this is important, because, I don't see  
<br />
how we could ever win the war against authoritative arguments and  
<br />
fundamentalism of all kinds without bringing back modesty (that is  
<br />
science) in that field.
<br />
When you grasp comp, you can understand that those scientist who  
<br />
pretend not doing theology are those who take Aristotle theology for  
<br />
granted. (Actually even a simplification of Aristotle. Aristotle was  
<br />
more Platonist than we usually imagine).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno has sometimes remarked (if I'm not misrepresenting him) that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP introduces us to machines and their dreams and I find this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphor very cogent and suggestive.
</em><br />
<br />You don't misrepresent me ... too much. Just that dreams is no more  
<br />
really use as a metaphor, but as a literal thing. It is a point of  
<br />
using digital mechanism, and assuming it clearly, and not just a vague  
<br />
mechanist intuition, which is already at play in all rationalist  
<br />
approach to inquiry.
<br />
If someone accept an artificial heart, he/she does not got a metaphor  
<br />
in his/her thorax. It is the same for an artificial brain, and  
<br />
eventually for a purely arithmetical one.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Certainly it seems to me that my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present state could coherently be characterised as a peculiarly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent dream - one that I nonetheless assume to be correlated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systematically with features of some otherwise unreachable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'elsewhere'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />So you are a critical realist. A &quot;believer&quot; in the large open minded  
<br />
sense. Nice.
<br />
The key lesson of UDA here is that, although you are right to bet that  
<br />
your present state belongs to a consistent dream, the 'truth' (a  
<br />
theorem in comp) is that there is an infinity of consistent dreams  
<br />
matching your observations, and there is a sense in which you (first  
<br />
person you) actually belong to an infinity of them. It is the many  
<br />
dreams aspect of the comp theory, partially confirmed by the quantum  
<br />
empirical MW observations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In COMP, the 'mechanism and language of dreams' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; posited to be those elements of the number realm and its operators
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that are deemed necessary to instantiate a 'universal TM' (i.e. one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that - assuming CT to be true - is capable of computing any computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function). Given this point of departure,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well the point of departure is really that I can survive with an  
<br />
artificial &quot;physical&quot; brain. And the result is that &quot;physical&quot; can no  
<br />
more be a primitive notion, and that the physical appearance has to be  
<br />
explained from the numbers, and indeed from their relative self- 
<br />
reference modalities. This leads to the arithmetical 'hypostases'.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; it follows that machines so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiated would be capable of implementing any computable 'dream'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatsoever - including dreams instantiating yet further levels of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines and their dreams. With an additional dovetailing assumption,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we find ourselves in a position to construct a sort of hyper-threaded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; layer-cake of dreaming where, from any arbitrary level, recursively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nested dreams disappear towards infinity both 'upwards' and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'downwards'.
</em><br />
<br />All right. Except that the dovetailing is not an additional  
<br />
assumption. The dovetailing is already there, like the primes numbers  
<br />
are already there, once you posit the sixth first axioms of (Robinson)  
<br />
arithmetic. Sorry for being technical.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As we 'drill down' into this gateau, we are looking for emergent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; patterns of invariance representing the self-referential viewpoints of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; layers of 'dreaming machines' - their experience and their 'external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is good idea to put 'external reality' in quote. It is a very  
<br />
ambiguous notion. It can be the simple pure third person provable  
<br />
relations among the numbers, like it can be the first person plural  
<br />
emerging appearance of multiverse(s).
<br />
And it can be something in between, all that can depend, or not, of  
<br />
our substitution level, and of the meaning &quot;we&quot; can give to words  
<br />
&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, ...
<br />
Obviously we do share a long and rich history.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The lowest level of recursion that any particular system of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dreaming requires for its instantiation is taken to constitute its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'substitution level'.
</em><br />
<br />I guess that I agree with what you want to mean, but I would have said  
<br />
&quot;the highest level&quot; level required, in the sense that there is no  
<br />
lowest level. In case of doubt, the doctor can always bet on a lowest  
<br />
level of comp, just to diminish the probability that his patient  
<br />
become a zombie. Of course in practice this will cost more money.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since which layer of the cake this corresponds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to must be unknowable from the viewpoint of any level we currently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occupy, we ineluctably take a gamble if we say 'yes' to any doctor who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claims to know what he's about. BTW, on this topic, I would refer you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to an interesting analogy that I append as a footnote below.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, what can we take 'reality' (i.e. real, as you will recall, &quot;in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense that I am real&quot;) to mean in this schema? We cannot know, but we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do want to say that it corresponds self-referentially - in some sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - to the number realm, and that the true language of the dreaming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines therefore corresponds - also in some self-referential sense -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to numbers and their inter-relations. This 'sense of correspondence'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be defined in two ways: 'truth', which is taken to correspond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-referentially to the unknowably 'real', and 'provability', which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is taken to correspond to what this reality can consistently claim,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; express, or represent to itself.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Good summary!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is about as far as I've got, and broad as it is, it seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point more or less in the direction of a detailed research programme
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such as Bruno has outlined.
</em><br />
<br />Well, here I disagree in the probably looking immodest claim of mine  
<br />
that the research has already be done up to the sad point that now,  
<br />
only math and physics remains. My initial goal, unless mistakes (fatal  
<br />
or not) has been attained: now we know that the &quot;comp theology&quot; is  
<br />
science, in the Popper sense that the &quot;comp theology&quot; has been shown  
<br />
refutable.
<br />
What would be nice is that the Z1* logics leads to new quantum  
<br />
tautologies so that the digital quantum nature can be tested against  
<br />
the quantum empirical one.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can see that stipulations on 'reality'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such as universal computability make implicit claims that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirically falsifiable in principle, which is most encouraging.
</em><br />
<br />This is CT, and you are correct, that part of comp is also refutable.  
<br />
But this we already have good reason to believe that nature will not,  
<br />
and cannot really refute it, unless quantum mechanics is wrong in the  
<br />
large proportion.
<br />
Actually, I believe that Church thesis can be proved in higher order  
<br />
logic, but this is a point I prefer to range out of the topic, because  
<br />
it is not essential, and it can lead to confusions (and it needs even  
<br />
bigger familiarity with mathematical computer science).
<br />
The yes doctor is highly more doubtable, and the main goal consisted  
<br />
in showing that it leads to a refutable 'theology'. Indeed, like in  
<br />
Plotinus, both the sharable and non sharable part of physics is  
<br />
completely determined by that &quot;theology&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, this general approach seems to me to have striking resonances
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with metaphysics such as Bohm's notions of implication and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explication, as well as MWI.
</em><br />
<br />You may develop. I like very much Bohm, because he is an honest  
<br />
inquirer. I appreciate him as a respectable adversary.
<br />
To keep his materialist philosophy he honestly posit a non-comp  
<br />
assumption, and he is not attracted at all by the MWI. But many of its  
<br />
intuition fit nicely with the comp hyp, as we can see by taking  
<br />
computer science seriously. Bohm, like many, has still a &quot;pre- 
<br />
Godelian&quot; conception of comp, so to speak. Well I should perhaps  
<br />
reread him because I don't remember how far he is a (weak) materialist.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway - Bruno, I would be grateful as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ever - when you have a moment - if you would tell me which end of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong stick I've got hold of this time.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Very nice post, David. The only general but key point where I would  
<br />
like to add precision, if not insistence, is that &quot;metaphor&quot; thing.  
<br />
Einstein would not have been glad if people told him that energy is a  
<br />
good metaphor for matter, when all his work consists in a coherent  
<br />
theory (= clear refutable assumption) where the relations between  
<br />
matter and energy are described by testable/refutable facts. The whole  
<br />
point of saying yes to the doctor, qua computatio, is for helping the  
<br />
understanding that the comp assumption is not metaphorical and that it  
<br />
leads to a theory which implies the reversal that you are most  
<br />
correctly intuiting.
<br />
You are correct about truth and provability. You may have insisted a  
<br />
bit more on the first person/third person important , and still  
<br />
unsolved, to be sure, relationship, and the first person indeterminacy  
<br />
which follows. You certainly motivate me to explain better AUDA and  
<br />
its relation with UDA.
<br />
<br />I am glad that Marty enjoy your post. At the same time, the point of  
<br />
my work did consist in making this utterly clear (if not shocking for  
<br />
those Aristotelian fundamentalist). Clarity in an hot field has to be  
<br />
technical or it looks too much provocative.
<br />
<br />Thanks for this very clear post. You have a good intuition of the  
<br />
ultimate consequences of the comp hyp, I think.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One day a group of scientists got together and decided that man had

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to go and tell Him that they were done with Him. The scientist walked

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; let's say we have a man making contest.&quot; To which the scientist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; replied, &quot;OK, great!&quot; But God added, &quot;Now, we're going to do this just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like I did back in the old days with Adam.&quot; The scientist said, &quot;Sure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no problem&quot; and bent down and grabbed himself a handful of dirt. God
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just looked at him and said, &quot;No, no, no. You go get your own dirt!&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Cute simple story illustrating a key point that most forget.
