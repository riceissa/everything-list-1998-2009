<br />Maybe, but you might also say that it's a semantic difference to
<br />
say that they split.  I'm saying that, if you allow that they split,
<br />
then, in the same sense, they also fuse.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consider a photon which passes through a two slit interference experiment.
</em><br />
<br />Okay, yes, this is a good example.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One way of describing it is to say that there are two worlds, one where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the photon passes through one slit and one where it passes through the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other.  Then the worlds fuse when the photons hit the screen and this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the cause of the interference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another way of describing it is that there is no split of worlds,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there is only one world in which the photon takes both paths (in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some sense).  Only when there is a measurement which collapses the wave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function do we get a new world.  In this view, if we put a detector
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the slits which could tell which slit the photon passed through,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the worlds would split when the detector was triggered.  In one world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the detector would show the photon going through one slit, and in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other world it would show the photon going through the other slit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is the act of measurement, an irreversible act of amplification,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which causes worlds to split in this definition.
</em><br />
<br />This begs the question:  what is a &quot;world&quot;, anyway?  I use the word
<br />
to mean my &quot;thread&quot; -- the path that my conscious self weaves through
<br />
time.  *Everything else* is superposition.  I think that some people
<br />
don't appreciate the impact of superposition of worlds in MWI.
<br />
Everything that we observe, from
<br />
atoms to molecules to complex structures, owes it's stability to the
<br />
superposition of worlds.  Each electron attached to each atom is 
<br />
oscillating in some sense.  But what are the oscillations of?  Just
<br />
the wave function, which describes the probability density function
<br />
of the electron.  Thus the wave function is composed of the
<br />
superposition
<br />
of worlds.
<br />
<br />Now when I consider propogating backwards from the present moment,
<br />
I don't accept that there are any fine distinctions between the
<br />
microscopic and macroscopic scales.  So if it's valid to consider
<br />
two worlds in the past, one in which some kid in some god-forsaken 
<br />
town in Australia poisoned a cat with cyanic acid, and another where 
<br />
he didn't, then it's also valid to consider the photon going through
<br />
one slit as one world, and the other slit as another world.
<br />
<br />I'll admit that my conception of &quot;world&quot; is not fully clear to me.
<br />
It has always seemed kind of circular to me:  that particle wave
<br />
functions are superpositions of worlds, and worlds are collections
<br />
of particles.  But perhaps it's circularity is somehow fundamental.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Both pictures are consistent and both use the concept of many worlds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is just a matter of definition whether you want to say that parts of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the state function which still are coherently entangled are separate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds or not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you use the second definition, though, I think it is correct to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that worlds do not fuse.  Even a seemingly insignificant difference, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it occurs at the classical level, will produce a fundamentally different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum wave function.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  And in fact, given the chaotic nature of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classical world (where the flap of a butterfly's wings causes next year's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hurricane), it is likely that there are no insigificant differences.
</em><br />
<br />No, this is all wrong.  QM does not have this nonlinear chaotic
<br />
behavior.
<br />
If you take two quantum states in the past, w1 and w2, which differ by
<br />
a small amount, and then propogate them to the present, they will still
<br />
differ by a small amount.  But both will have gotten considerably 
<br />
&quot;smeared out&quot;, and will consist of linear superpositions of lots of
<br />
different &quot;worlds&quot;.  This smeared out state in each will contain a
<br />
non-zero
<br />
probability density for our &quot;world&quot;.  That is, they overlap.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From our vantage point, we can look backwards and say that there is a
</em><br />
branching tree of worlds in the past as well as the future.  It
<br />
doesn't have quite the same flavor as the future tree, however.
<br />
Past worlds where I was dead five minutes prior to now are
<br />
*extremely* unlikely, but not quite so unlikely in the future tree.
<br />
Any past world inconsistent with my memories is also unlikely.
