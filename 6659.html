<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likewise exist in a superpositional state.
</em><br />
<br />First, it looks like you are confusing the multiverse of QM with the 
<br />
plenitude of &quot;all theories&quot; or all UTM programs (Level 3 with Level 4 
<br />
multiverse in Tegmark's terminology). Different level 4 worlds do not 
<br />
superpose, they don't relate to each other in any way, by definition.
<br />
<br />Second, in QM you need to distinguish between two kinds of superposition: 
<br />
those which cause interference effects (e.g. 2-slit experiment), and those 
<br />
which don't (because the wave functions of the superposed &quot;worlds&quot; don't 
<br />
overlap or are incoherent). &quot;Behaviour systems&quot; are complicated enough 
<br />
that it is a mathematical certainty that they fall in the second class. In 
<br />
which case there is no way to detect that the superposition is happening; 
<br />
for all practical purposes each world goes its own sweet way.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If there are say, 10 possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;worlds&quot; available to the behavioral state (percipient) but each world 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differs from the other by elements that are not observed by the percipient, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then the behavior system is under the assumption that interaction is taking 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place with a single, unified environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Recalling the Copenhagen interpretation: does Chicago exist if you happen to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be by yourself in a hotel room in Des Plaines, IL?  The answer is irrelevant 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; until the behavior system begins to experience some aspect of Chicago.
</em><br />
<br />The superposition properties depend on the information available in the 
<br />
whole system (e.g. your hotel room), not just the mind of the observer. 
<br />
The world is constantly in close touch with itself. For instance, if 
<br />
Chicago vanished in a large quantum fluctuation, photons which would 
<br />
otherwise have been reflected from its streets to the clouds would be 
<br />
different.  Hence photons leaving the clouds that land in fields 40 miles 
<br />
away would be different and so on. Very soon (within microseconds) the 
<br />
photons comint through your hotel window are affected, and you become 100% 
<br />
correlated with the state of Chicago.  From your point of view, Chicago is 
<br />
either there or not.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What if Deutsch is incorrect about contact between the various worlds?
</em><br />
<br />i.e., what if quantum theory is wrong and a different theory applies?
<br />
But the only reason we have to believe this stuff is the evidence in 
<br />
favour of QM (which is pretty overwhelming).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose the behavior system normally exists across a manifold of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; closely-linked probabilities, with the similarities forming a central 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tendency and the differences existing at each edge of the distribution?
</em><br />
<br />Again, QM makes definitive (but difficult-to-understand) predictions about 
<br />
this.  Yes there is a manifold of possibilities, in fact an infinite 
<br />
number of them, for instance &quot;configuration space&quot; which is the manifold 
<br />
of all particle positions (3N dimensional for N particles), or &quot;momentum 
<br />
space&quot;, the manifold of all particle momenta (also 3N dim).  According to 
<br />
QM, the probability distributions in these manifolds are not independent, 
<br />
e.g. config and momentum wave functions are related by a Fourier 
<br />
transform.
<br />
<br />Your &quot;central tendency&quot; is just the wave function, which is peaked around 
<br />
some configuration of particles in any given branch. What people generally 
<br />
don't factor into this is just how *BIG* 3N dimensional spaces are, when N 
<br />
is macroscopic. Even apparently minor differences, such as the presence or 
<br />
absence of a speck of dust, correspond to enormously large separations in 
<br />
configuration space.  Although technically there is some (usually 
<br />
infinitesimal) amplitude for all configurations, the only way you can get 
<br />
a useful amplitude for two macroscopically different &quot;worlds&quot; is to 
<br />
amplify some quantum behaviour, in which case the wave function splits 
<br />
into 2 or more branches, each of which behaves more or less according to 
<br />
classical physics. The &quot;width&quot; of the distribution for a single branch 
<br />
corresponds to ordinary microscopic quantum fuzziness. Hence the branches 
<br />
don't overlap in configuration space (or in the space of any other 
<br />
macroscopic variable), and so can't communicate.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the behavior system can perceive only a small chunk of information at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a time, then it may be possible that each percipient really does live in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his or her own little world---a small island of similar probabilities 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made&quot;real&quot; from the larger cloud of probabilities.
</em><br />
<br />We are all in our own little worlds, but in an objective sense; the same 
<br />
is true for &quot;non-behavior&quot; systems, e.g. rocks.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we quantify a behavior system in terms of elements and interactions 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between elements, we arrive at a complex, but definable state.  If that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behavior system exists across multiple worlds that differ in minute details 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (i.e. a unobserved kitchen saucer moved an inch to the side) then the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behavior systems would exist as identical entities (or, as my friend Giu P. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would say, *shadows*) across the similar &quot;sections.&quot;   Employing a little 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; math, the behavior system could exist as an object in Z space--not too 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different than a fibre bundle in topology.    Differences among the realized 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilities among these &quot;shadow worlds&quot; might show up at each end of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normal distribution, but may be still be perceived by the behavior system as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guesses or hunches, depending upon where the primary centre of the behavioral 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bundle is at the time.  Psychology experiments in the 1980s suggest (to me 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyway) that a psychological mechanism has evolved that helps the behavioral 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system &quot;negotiate&quot; this territory.
</em><br />
<br />If this has anything to do with the basic laws of physics we have to 
<br />
replace QM.  Personally it sounds to me like great SF and very duff 
<br />
science.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bottom line, it may be useful to take a step back and challenge some of our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primary assumptions---namely, that we exist in a discrete world in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse and that we can never &quot;step&quot; into the one next door.   That is, we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may be wondering why we can't visit the next room, when in fact, we inhabit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the entire neighborhood.
</em><br />
<br />This is not so much an assumption as a fact. Schrodinger's cat is either 
<br />
alive or dead and once the experiment is done we can't change the outcome.
