Sorry I think an unedited version of this may have got out by mistake.  I

have not seen it get posted so perhaps it did not.  Again if it did I am sorry.

<br />That being said, how are you treating numbers?  The finiteness of a FAS is 
<br />
not just a description of its axioms but of all its components that

contribute to the complexity of the program describing its theorems which - 
<br />
as I understand it - is the complexity of which Chaitin speaks. [I will 
<br />
look for the reference in his books and post it.]
<br />
<br />If numbers are just various strings of two binary bits giving a small 
<br />
alphabet then I suspect Chaitin's work applies.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITIONS #1
<br />
<br />1) Pattern: A pattern is a geometric structure that could vary in at least 
<br />
one characteristic from location to location within
<br />
the pattern.  Patterns must be at least a set of more than two zero 
<br />
dimensional isolated discrete points.
<br />
<br />2) Information: There are two types Relative and Absolute:
<br />
<br />Relative information is the structure of a given pattern, bit string or 
<br />
other such structure both within the structure itself which
<br />
would be just the relative position and style of its elements, and between 
<br />
structures in a larger whole which would be the
<br />
relative styles, quantities, and positions of elements/patterns.
<br />
<br />Absolute information is based on mathematical structure and selection.  An 
<br />
example of mathematical structure absolute
<br />
information would be the resolution of : The Everything is stable; true or 
<br />
false.  An example of absolute information
<br />
based on selection would be the selection of a single pattern, bit string 
<br />
or other such structure out of a collection of such
<br />
structures.
<br />
<br />As an example of total information the selection of a particular bit string 
<br />
consisting of some count of all zero's would be a
<br />
maximum of selection based absolute information while the string selected 
<br />
contains no internal relative information.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION II
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE LOWEST LEVEL
<br />
<br />In this model the lower level of existence contains an expression of no 
<br />
information.  Rather like 345/345 is an expression
<br />
of an identity element.  There are two polar extremes at this lower level: 
<br />
the Everything and the Nothing.  The Everything
<br />
expresses pan-isomorphism, the Nothing expresses anisomorphism, hence 
<br />
neither is fully describable.  However,
<br />
selected pieces can be described.
<br />
<br />The Nothing, since it contains no information, can not resolve the question 
<br />
of its own stability which it must address.  The
<br />
only option is to test the issue with the only perturbation available - it 
<br />
becomes the Everything.
<br />
<br />The interesting thing is that the Everything being a perturbation from the 
<br />
Nothing does not contain the Nothing. Subtracting
<br />
the Nothing from &quot;all information&quot; to produce the Everything is the 
<br />
smallest selection [perturbation] I can think of.  The
<br />
idea being that no information and all information are identical but the 
<br />
Everything is not quite all information.  For this
<br />
reason I prefer the name Superverse.
<br />
<br />The Everything also having almost no information similarly can not resolve 
<br />
the question of its own stability and must also
<br />
test the issue by becoming the Nothing.  Both poles - being mutually 
<br />
exclusive - destroy history whenever manifest, thus
<br />
a random Everything/Nothing [E/N] alternation is established.  Existence at 
<br />
this level is sustained but has bipolar
<br />
expression.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION III
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE UPPER LEVEL
<br />
<br />Pan-isomorphism is the upper level of existence.  It is manifest only when 
<br />
the Everything is manifest so it is not
<br />
continuous.
<br />
<br />A portion of the pan-isomorphism expressing Everything is describable as a 
<br />
seething foamy fractal pattern of infinite
<br />
repeats of all patterns.  Part of the seething is due to the differences 
<br />
between successive Everything manifestations.
<br />
Since the E/N alternation destroys history, each Everything manifest has a 
<br />
randomly selected pattern of patterns.  Any
<br />
further seething that may be present during an Everything manifestation may 
<br />
be thought of as generating historic
<br />
information, but it is relative information and not absolute 
<br />
information.  It is not germane to the question of the Everything's
<br />
stability.  Thus it does not preclude the E/N alternation and is destroyed 
<br />
by the alternation.
<br />
<br />Individual patterns in this portion of the everything have multiple 
<br />
interpretations. Each such interpretation produces a pair:
<br />
[pattern;interpretation].  These pairs are linked to isomorphisms which can 
<br />
be states of universes.  These isomorphic
<br />
links can be self sequenced by rules internal to the individual 
<br />
isomorphism.  The links of a sequence are either past,
<br />
active, or possible.  Looking just at the present and successor links we 
<br />
shorten this to active and possible.  Speculation
<br />
as to past links may or may not be incorporated into the rules of a given 
<br />
isomorphism.  Thus we write these isomorphic
<br />
links as {[pattern;interpretation];[possible/actual isomorphism]}.  The 
<br />
sequencing is a migration of active isomorphic link
<br />
from one [pattern;interpretation] pair to another.
<br />
<br />The rules can have a non deterministic content.  Such rules define the 
<br />
family of viable link successors with a procedure
<br />
that can be partially &quot;do not care&quot;.  Since the Everything is in effect a 
<br />
seething pattern of patterns the first acceptable
<br />
&quot;possible&quot; link encountered by any search scheme is random for rules with a 
<br />
non deterministic content.  This link
<br />
becomes the next active one.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION IV
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION PART 1
<br />
<br />In order to focus on a particular class of these link shift rules which may 
<br />
contain our universe the model makes the
<br />
following associations:
<br />
<br />Some of these isomorphic links can be represented by strings Uj() 
<br />
consisting of at most a countable infinity of binary
<br />
bits.
<br />
<br />Every evolving universe Uj is isomorphic to a self sorting sequence Uj(i) 
<br />
of these links that, upon an encounter between
<br />
an active link and an acceptable &quot;possible&quot; link in the fractal, they 
<br />
switch states thus they self sequence according to
<br />
[written post shift]:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)  Pj(i) = {Rj(U'j(i - 1)) + PLj(i)} is the shortest program that 
<br />
computes Uj(i).
<br />
<br />Where:
<br />
<br />Rj is the current rule set of Uj and Rj(U'j(i - 1)) is Rj acting as a 
<br />
comparison filter based on U'j(i - 1).
<br />
<br />U'j(i - 1) is the previous link's representing string if Rj was fully 
<br />
deterministic. [See below]
<br />
<br />PLj(i) is the program length self delimiter.
<br />
<br />Uj(i) is the current link's representing string.
<br />
<br />The structure of U'j(i - 1) depends on the nature of Rj.  If Rj is fully 
<br />
deterministic then U'j(i - 1) is the same as Uj(i - 1).  This
<br />
causes the Algorithmic Information Theory [AIT] complexity [Note #1] of 
<br />
Uj(i) to increase as i counts up.  This can be
<br />
more clearly seen by rewriting (1) as:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)  Pj(i) = {Rj(Pj(i - 1)) + PLj(i)} is the shortest program that 
<br />
computes Uj(i).
<br />
<br />since Pj(i - 1) is the most compressed form of Uj(i - 1).  Pj(i) has more 
<br />
bits than Pj(i - 1) since it contains Pj(i - 1) as data.
<br />
If Rj is partly non deterministic but still needs all of Uj(i - 1) as data 
<br />
then U'j(i - 1) is more complex than Uj(i -1) and the AIT
<br />
complexity of Uj(i) increases even faster.  If Rj becomes even more random 
<br />
then not much can be said of the relation
<br />
between U'j(i - 1) and Uj(i - 1)
<br />
<br />The first link encountered while the fractal is seething that passes the Rj 
<br />
mediated compare becomes the successor to
<br />
Uj(i - 1)  i.e. Uj(i).
<br />
<br />Each Uj(i) is a stand alone isomorphism that contains a finite 
<br />
semi-consistent Formal Axiomatic System [fsc-FAS] that
<br />
defines Uj. The structure of the fsc-FAS is:
<br />
<br />a) It initially has a single axiom Aj unique to a particular family of 
<br />
universes which is in Pj(1) as the initial data provided to
<br />
Rj i.e. as Rj(Aj). It is Uj(0) and initiates the recursion.
<br />
<br />b) It has a set of rules = Rj which form the comparison filter.  Rj is a 
<br />
particular evolving universe's laws of physics.  The
<br />
rules as stated need not be fully deterministic.  This is the source of the 
<br />
&quot;semi&quot; modifer to &quot;consistent&quot;.  While Uj(i) is a
<br />
theorem of the FAS in the standard sense,  when the rules Rj act on Uj(i) 
<br />
to compute Uj(i + 1), Uj(i) may activate a &quot;do not
<br />
care&quot; operator in Rj.
<br />
<br />c) It has an alphabet = differently sequenced strings of bits in Uj that I 
<br />
call types of &quot;regions&quot;.  The axiom Aj contains the
<br />
entire initial alphabet of regions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION V
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITIONS #2
<br />
<br />3)  Granular-discrete space-time:  A discrete space in this thread a 
<br />
3-space in which isolated points are confined to fixed
<br />
regions [granules] that have a fixed relative location with respect to 
<br />
other regions in a space grid structure.  The grid
<br />
structure currently preferred in this thread is Face Centered Cubic [with 
<br />
spherical surfaced regions].  Within each region
<br />
the associated point can assume a finite number of discrete 
<br />
locations.  Each region with a particular point location can be
<br />
thought of as isomorphic to a particular alphabet element of a FAS such as 
<br />
an &quot;a&quot; region or a &quot;b&quot; region etc.  A finite
<br />
string of these alphabet elements [such as abcryopaabctgjk...abcfg] 
<br />
isomorphic to state of a finite physical universe.
<br />
Different such strings are then isomorphic to different states of that 
<br />
physical universe.  The dimensions within a region
<br />
may be continuous but a given FAS can only contain a finite number of 
<br />
alphabet elements i.e. regions.  A binary bit
<br />
string can be constructed which designates a region by a string of 0's with 
<br />
a single 1 buried in it some where.  The &quot;a&quot;
<br />
region might be &quot;00000000000000001000&quot; and the &quot;b&quot; region 
<br />
&quot;00000100000000000000&quot;.  This would allow a finite string to
<br />
locate each of the finite number of points in such a finite 
<br />
granular-discrete space-time with infinite precision without the
<br />
need to actually display the associated infinite strings.  Again time is 
<br />
quantified and subjective to a given universe.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION VI
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION PART 2
<br />
<br />Each &quot;region&quot; type is modeled as isomorphic to an interpretative structure 
<br />
that has physical meaning such that the
<br />
location of a discrete isolated space point u inside a small fixed portion 
<br />
of a space grid is coded by each region type.
<br />
[In our case I believe the grid to be 3D and most likely Face Centered 
<br />
Cubic.]  The points can not leave their own region
<br />
but can relocate within it.
<br />
<br />The isomorphism need not give rise to an actual physical existence of a 
<br />
universe within the Everything as this would be
<br />
redundant to the existence of the pattern itself.  Just the applicable 
<br />
interpretive isomorphism need exist as an overlay on
<br />
the pattern.  A given pattern can have many such overlays depending on 
<br />
which section of the pattern is considered to
<br />
be the rules of succession by the particular isomorphism.
<br />
<br />Uj(i) contains a theorem of this f-FAS giving a specific arrangement of 
<br />
&quot;regions&quot; - a configuration of a particular universe.
<br />
The structure of Uj(i) using English letters to represent different 
<br />
&quot;region&quot; types would look like the following.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Uj(i) = 
<br />
aaxcvsyplmnjhkkyufpoiiimjkhlyhhhhnkmlpmneidhsu...qaeeerwetgbfvvvdcsdxazjfirjnfjgkkeirejqzq 
<br />
<br /><br />To express this idea as an expanded binary string call each of these a type 
<br />
of sub string u.  In this limited example there
<br />
are 26 types of sub string u.  For example a = the u: 
<br />
00000010000000000000000000, and b = the u:
<br />
00000000000000100000000000.  The location within the string Uj(i) of a 
<br />
particular u identifies the particular grid region it
<br />
codes and the location of the 1 within each u codes the location of the 
<br />
discrete space point u within that region.
<br />
<br />The result is a granular-discrete space-time.  The granules are the regions 
<br />
and for starters have a spherical surface.  The
<br />
point within a region is discrete but may be located by continuous 
<br />
dimensions.  However, the finite complexity FAS can
<br />
only contain so many alphabet elements and thus the space-time is 
<br />
discrete.  Nevertheless the bit string scheme above
<br />
allows the FAS to locate points with infinite precision absent a need to 
<br />
display the actual dimensional coordinates of any
<br />
of the discrete points.  Time in any given universe is also discrete and 
<br />
runs at some ratio of the Nothing-Everything
<br />
oscillation rate.  This ratio need not be constant, the Nothing-Everything 
<br />
oscillation rate itself can not be constant or it
<br />
represents absolute information, and time is subjective to a particular 
<br />
universe.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION VII
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRUE NOISE
<br />
<br />If there were no &quot;true noise&quot; in the system due to the nature of Rj [a 
<br />
fully deterministic Rj] then (1) would be a recursive
<br />
enumeration or theorem cascade in an N-bit, fc-FAS.  Chaitin's 
<br />
incompleteness [The maximum AIT complexity of a
<br />
theorem of an N-bit, fc-FAS is (N + 1).] dictates that the cascade must 
<br />
stop since there are no more than 2^[N + c]
<br />
theorems in the FAS.  But as was shown above such cascades produce 
<br />
monotonically more AIT complex theorems.
<br />
For the cascade to stop it must end on a theorem that has no consequent 
<br />
under the rules of the cascade.  If region n is
<br />
the neutral region then all regions of the granular-discrete space-time 
<br />
would be the neutral one.  If this is region &quot;n&quot; in (3)
<br />
then Uj(i) becomes:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Uj(i) = 
<br />
nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn...nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= m repeats of n
<br />
<br />This is a very low AIT complexity theorem.  Thus we have a 
<br />
contradiction.  Call this the &quot;Halting Contradiction&quot;.  A random
<br />
oracle can provide new information to the FAS [say new alphabet elements - 
<br />
new types of regions] as necessary and
<br />
thus repeatedly increase N eliminating the contradiction. This is also 
<br />
equivalent to &quot;true noise&quot; as well as to starting the
<br />
sequence over with a new axiom which is now just Uj(i).
<br />
<br />The sequence may stop when N becomes countably infinite if this destroys 
<br />
the consistency of the FAS.
<br />
<br />Consequently Uj(i) must also grow in length as i counts up since there are 
<br />
only 2^N - N-bit strings.  Since Rj is a source
<br />
of &quot;true noise&quot; if not fully deterministic then this accumulation of 
<br />
information just accelerates as the sequence progresses
<br />
since Rj is applied to ever longer Uj(i).  This constitutes further use of 
<br />
the random oracle at theorem complexities below
<br />
that which triggers the &quot;Halting Contradiction&quot;.
<br />
<br />Further one must consider that those Rj [FAS] that form Godelian incomplete 
<br />
systems will be prone to the need to
<br />
resolve that type of undecidable which are seen as additional inputs from a 
<br />
random oracle.
<br />
<br />Thus there are so far three potential sources of &quot;true noise&quot; in the model.
<br />
<br />I happen to believe that all SAS require some true noise influx into their 
<br />
universe.  I have so far argued  the possible
<br />
presence of true noise from the perspective of Chaitin's and Godel's 
<br />
incompleteness and an added just plain &quot;do not
<br />
care&quot; component in the rules of link succession of a particular 
<br />
universe.  But is such noise built into any SAS?
<br />
<br />If we consider ourselves to be SAS do we allow that any SAS - to be a SAS - 
<br />
must be able to run any possible
<br />
experiment including thought experiments we can?  If we do then the idea 
<br />
that we perhaps can construct an isomorphism
<br />
between the S/N alternation and the scanner/transporter/duplicator [STD] 
<br />
thought experiment [see the everything list FAQ
<br />
and archive] may be another source of true noise.  Considering that the 
<br />
U'j(i - 1) to Uj(i) operation of the Rj is a
<br />
deterministic one [given the data on what just happened our current state 
<br />
is predictable but the data may not have been
<br />
deterministicly arrived at] the S/N alternation looks like the STD 
<br />
operating at the level of the Superverse itself.  However,
<br />
any SAS in any particular universe can not identify its actual 
<br />
operation.  Thus the SAS is faced with a fundamental
<br />
undecidable.
<br />
<br />How does the potential &quot;true noise&quot; impact the logic system during the 
<br />
sequencing process?  Relation (1) is really
<br />
saying that there is not necessarily enough data in Uj(i - 1).  The 
<br />
consequent then is that each new U'j(i - 1) would be a
<br />
new initiating axiom for the cascade whenever a true noise event takes place.
