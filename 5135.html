<br />
Okay,
<br />
<br />I apologize for diverting this list into a discussion of mind-body. 
<br />
I came onto  the list to explore Tegmark's thesis about our persons' 
<br />
being endlessly duplicated. It seems to me that this thesis depends 
<br />
not just on cosmology but also on what we know about persons.  It 
<br />
struck me that the discussion here assumed without question (i) 
<br />
reductionism and (ii) determinism.
<br />
<br />I don't think these assumptions hold even in physics.  You can all 
<br />
correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that the Pauli 
<br />
Exclusion Principle is not explainable by the properties of atomic 
<br />
parts.  It is an emergent property of an entire atom.  Similarly, 
<br />
there is good reason to think that determinism does not hold at the 
<br />
quantum level.
<br />
<br />Whatever is the case in physics, after long debate, (i) and (ii) 
<br />
above have been rejected at the human level by most current social 
<br />
scientists.  So the relevance of my line of questioning was what 
<br />
difference it makes to Tegmark's thesis if assumptions (i) and (ii) 
<br />
are relaxed.
<br />
<br />One difference it might make is that the whole universe is not 
<br />
computable because our own behavior is not computable.  Another 
<br />
difference is that without determinism, even in a universe with the 
<br />
same initial conditions, we might not show up again.
<br />
<br />And if reductionism fails, then what are called propositional 
<br />
attitudes (wants, beliefs, etc) are not identifiable with physical 
<br />
properties. So What?  That is the question Pete asks.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I don't see how &quot;reductionism fails&quot; entails &quot;thoughts are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;uncountably infinite&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is it because you are identifying thoughts with sentences and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sentences are infinite? But not every sentence is a thought.  Most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sentences are not thinkable or believable.  I'm not sure sentences 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are uncountably infinite, either.
</em><br />
<br />Well, thoughts encompass much more than sentences -- which is why 
<br />
human thought does not seem computable.  But it does seem that 
<br />
sentences are thoughts.  I don't know what you mean by most sentences 
<br />
are not thinkable or believable.  It seems for someone to produce a 
<br />
sentence, he or she must think it.
<br />
<br />We can get around this though by talking just about thinkable 
<br />
sentences.  Do you not agree that even thinkable sentences are 
<br />
infinite?  Would you have any idea how to count them?  Even thinkable 
<br />
sentences seem both infinite and uncountably infinite to me.  Hence 
<br />
thoughts are both infinite and uncountably infinite.
<br />
<br />Pete, you go onto ask:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To start off with, why should we commit ourselves to talking about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;beliefs as individuable entities in the first place?  I prefer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dennett's intentional stance theory of beliefs - beliefs are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;abstract things we posit that explain or predict behavior.
</em><br />
<br />Well I can go along with propositional attitudes being abstract 
<br />
properties we posit to explain or predict behavior.  For that 
<br />
purpose, though, propositional attitudes need to be attributed 
<br />
individually.
<br />
<br />You seem to imply in what follows that propositional attitudes are 
<br />
somehow not real but only in the mind of the observer.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
To relate this to Tegmark/Schmidhuber, look at it like this:  The 
<br />
physical (or Platonic/mathematical, it really doesn't matter) stuff 
<br />
is there; it's the underlying reality.  If sub-sections of the stuff 
<br />
(i.e., us) see patterns in it and talk about these patterns as 
<br />
&quot;individuals&quot; and &quot;beliefs&quot;, that's our business.  It doesn't have 
<br />
any bearing on the nature of the underlying stuff.   It's not a 
<br />
terribly important result that we can imagine infinite numbers of 
<br />
patterns (such as  beliefs) -- after all, you can imagine an 
<br />
uncountably infinite number of strings composed of just 0 and 1.
<br />
<br />Sure, some patterns are just in our minds without any consequence. 
<br />
What determines whether the &quot;stuff&quot; is actually there is whether it 
<br />
is consequential.  To the extent that propositional attitudes are 
<br />
both predictive and explanatory, they are consequential.
<br />
<br />I like Dennett's intentional stance, but in some cases -- as in 
<br />
dealing with other people, the stance works because intentionality is 
<br />
what actually causes the behavior.
<br />
<br />Next, beginning with a comment of mine to Norman, Eugen accuses me of 
<br />
not knowing mainstream science.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;  Okay, well here you have just asserted that human beings can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;  defined as the sum of discrete quantum states and the like and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;  thoughts are therefore not infinite.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;You make it sound like a fringe statement, the reverse is in fact the case.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Bekenstein's limit (and subsequent works based on that) is mainstream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;science.
</em><br />
<br />I admit that to the extent that humans are physical, they can be 
<br />
represented by quantum states.  But they are not entirely physical. 
<br />
As Pete suggests above, they also have states of being that, although 
<br />
not mystical, are abstract or at least non-physical.
<br />
<br />And, yes, I'm sorry but it is not too early to judge eliminative 
<br />
materialism and the identity theory as failures.  That is why most 
<br />
philosophers have now abandoned them.  Pete also suggests as much:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here I'm interpreting your &quot;reductionism fails&quot; as &quot;eliminative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;materialism and identity theory are false&quot;, which I tend to agree 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with; I notice you didn't mention functionalism however.)
</em><br />
<br />No, I did not mention functionalism in part because I was 
<br />
summarizing. Functionalism has its problems too, but I agree it is 
<br />
much stronger than the other two.  But it is stronger precisely 
<br />
because it has already moved beyond reductionism.  Many 
<br />
functionalists regard it as a form of nonreductive materialism.  It 
<br />
was functionalism that introduced the software / hardware analogy I 
<br />
mentioned.
<br />
<br />You ask me to explain what I mean by holistic and closure in relation 
<br />
to thought.
<br />
<br />In the philosophy of science, closure refers to whether a system has 
<br />
a delimited number of causal mechanisms operating.  Experiments, for 
<br />
example, are typically artificially closed systems in which only one 
<br />
mechanism operates without interference.  The real world outside the 
<br />
lab is typically open causally -- although it some case like 
<br />
planetary orbits perhaps -- the interference does not matter much.
<br />
<br />The point of this distinction is that Humean causal laws (linking 
<br />
events) are possible only in closed systems. In open systems, the 
<br />
putative laws will always be interfered with and hence fail to be 
<br />
lawlike.  This does not mean there is no causality, but it does 
<br />
indicate a problem with the conventional Humean conception of 
<br />
causality.
<br />
<br />The point I was making about ideas is that to the extent that they 
<br />
are effectively infinite, human decision-making is intrinsically open 
<br />
to new thought and hence not conformable to Humean laws, or, in other 
<br />
words, nondeterministic.
<br />
<br />In the context of thoughts, by holistic I meant context dependent. 
<br />
The effect of an idea is conditioned by what other ideas surround it. 
<br />
The import of ideas and their effects cannot be computed one by one. 
<br />
Jerry Fodor makes a similar point in his THE MIND DOES NOT WORK THAT 
<br />
WAY.
<br />
<br />Kevin, I don't know whether your post was a direct response to me.  I 
<br />
share your notion of increasing cosmic complexity.  That very notion 
<br />
seems to imply emergence rather than reductionism.  So, other than 
<br />
perhaps politically, I don't see a disagreement.
<br />
<br />Thanks.
