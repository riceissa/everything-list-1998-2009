<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In Tegmark's paper,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in section 2G, he makes a crucial point that the fewer axioms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you use to define your mathematical structure, the larger is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ensemble.  This provides a concrete justification for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle of Occam's Razor.  Similarly to the argument given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above, we would expect to find ourselves in worlds with fairly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; few laws of physics, since those admit the most SAS's.  You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can always add any bizarre behavior to the structure by adding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ad hoc axioms, but worlds in which that is the case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a smaller measure than those that do not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This line of reasoning also explains why, in a general sense,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we find that our universe behaves sensibly from moment to moment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Many philosophers have pondered the question of why everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't disintegrate into chaos in the next instant.  What holds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world together such that things persist and our memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; match our external reality?  The answer is that the structure(s)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are in obey physical laws, not because they were cast by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fiat from some omnipotent being, but simply because the structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that do obey physical laws are more numerous than those that do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not, and hence we are likely to find ourselves in those.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I would take issue with this last statement. It seems that the above
<br />
argument would imply that chaotic, unlawful universes should be more
<br />
numerous than those obeying laws. The usual justification given for us
<br />
finding ourselves in a universe with physical laws, is that such a
<br />
universe is a minimum requirement for concious beings (or SASes, to
<br />
use Tegmark's terminology) to exist. Unfortunately, because we don't
<br />
understand the nature of conciousness enough, we cannot predict what
<br />
the most general mathematical structure is to contain SASes.
<br />
<br />One approach I suggested earlier is to suggest that perhaps the
<br />
structure underlying QM (ie a Hilbert space over the complex numbers)
<br />
is the most general such structure, and work backwards, trying to find
<br />
the reasons behind the properties.
<br />
<br />A Hilbert space is a Vector Space (ie it elements have a linearity
<br />
property with respect to some field), and it has the additional
<br />
property of having an inner product &lt;x,y&gt;.  
<br />
<br />QM has an additional property of the universe being indexed by time
<br />
&quot;t&quot;. Schroedingers equation can be written as e^{iHt}, where H is a
<br />
Hermitian operator. This basically follows from some reasonable
<br />
assumption about probability (i.e. the probabilities of all
<br />
possibilities must remain equal to 1 through time). I think it
<br />
reasonable to assume that conciousness requires a time variable.
<br />
<br />The inner product is required to form &quot;projections&quot;, which are the
<br />
basis of observations: P(x is observed when A is measured)=&lt;x,Ay&gt;
<br />
where y is the state of the universe. Something of this nature is
<br />
required for conciousness.
<br />
<br />If one has a vector space, then the most general field possible is the
<br />
set of complex numbers, so that explains why C is used.
<br />
<br />The problem is - why linearity? Is it related to Bayesian laws of
<br />
probability - ie that probabilities of independent events are additive
<br />
( P(AuB) = P(a)+P(B) &amp; P(AnB) = P(A)P(B) )? Is it necessary to have
<br />
independent events for conciousness? Is it possible to get Bayesian
<br />
laws with some generalisation of linearity?
<br />
<br />NB. QM is in fact inconsistent with our other big 20C theory of
<br />
Physics, ie Relativity. One of the biggest problems is that in
<br />
Relativity, there is no well defined concept of &quot;now&quot; - the locus of
<br />
contemporary events depends on one's frame of reference. One of the
<br />
most interesting attempts to reconcile these theories replaces them
<br />
with motion on a fractal manifold, and time has a 2D character. It is
<br />
only in the macroscopic limit that time has a one-dimensional
<br />
nature. Perhaps the Anthropic Principle requires the universe only to
<br />
be approximately described by QM to some level of accuracy. (We
<br />
needn't worry about solutions that blow up over periods much longer
<br />
than the current age of the universe).
<br />
<br />Enough ranting for now.
