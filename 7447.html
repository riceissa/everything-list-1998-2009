<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have been on vacation so I have a large backlog of messages to read!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But they are very interesting and full of challenging ideas.  I find this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list to be one of the best I have ever been on in terms both of fearlessly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exploring difficult areas and also remaining cordial and polite.
</em><br />
<br />Welcome back! You are sorely missed.  (Actually, I think that
<br />
you are sorely missed on every email list I know of.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am trying to understand Lee Corbin's idea about duplicates as selves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better.  I can understand seeing exact, synchronized duplicates as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; selves (such as two computers running the same simulated individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in lock-step).  But when they begin to diverge I understand that Lee
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still sees them as (in some sense) &quot;himself&quot; and one copy would in fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sacrifice to benefit a diverged copy just as much(?) as to benefit its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own body.  Is this right?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I'd sacrifice (for entirely selfish reasons) for my
<br />
duplicate if it meant less suffering for me. For example,
<br />
if I and my duplicate are quietly talking in a room, and
<br />
the torturers come in and offer one instance of me ONE
<br />
MINUTE TORTURE so that the other instance is spared TWO
<br />
MINUTE TORTURE, then the one instance---perhaps a little
<br />
nervously---signs up for it.
<br />
<br />(This is clearly a case where we are not in lock step, and
<br />
let's say that it's a *close* duplicate, closer than the
<br />
person I'll be tomorrow or was yesterday.)
<br />
<br />The trouble is my animal self. After a few seconds of the
<br />
torture, the instance will cry out &quot;Do it to him!&quot;. And it
<br />
might be difficult to get an instance of me to sign up again.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I would ask is, is there a limit to this?  Is this common-self-ness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a matter of degree, or is it all-or-none?  Is there some degree of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; divergence after which a copy might be somewhat reluctant to continue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to view its brother copy as being exactly equivalent to itself?
</em><br />
<br />Definitely it's a matter of degree. There is a smooth transition
<br />
between me and, say, Hal Finney, a set of particular instances
<br />
that lie between you and me.  So at some point I say (selfishly
<br />
---we are only concerned with selfish behavior here) &quot;do it to
<br />
the intermediate for an HOUR instead of me for a MINUTE&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, what if someone were an identical twin?  In some sense they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are duplicates at the moment of conception who then begin to diverge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This seems to be different from the copies we discuss merely in degree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of divergence, not in kind.  Would it be reasonable to argue that an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identical twin &quot;should&quot; view his brother as himself?
</em><br />
<br />The interesting case of identical twins turns out to be not so
<br />
interesting, as I understand it. They're somewhat different at
<br />
birth, already headed out on slightly different personality
<br />
development paths, for example. I hear that people who know 
<br />
twins come to feel very quickly that they're different people.
<br />
This would *not* happen with your duplicate. Your wife, for
<br />
example, would *never* come to think of you as different people
<br />
---at least not until years had passed and differences had
<br />
built up.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And what about the possibility of creating non-identical copies?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps our copying machine is imperfect and the products are not quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same as the original.  They are very close, perhaps so close that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only extremely detailed inspection can detect the differences.  Or perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they are not really so close at all and the copies in fact bear little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resemblance to their originals.  How does the potential existence of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imperfect copying machines affect the notion that one should view copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as selves?
</em><br />
<br />I would say that the known or perceived fidelity of the copying
<br />
process *would* be a factor. After my duplicate and I talked for
<br />
a while, we might come to see that we weren't so similar as we
<br />
thought: we might find that we had slightly different memories,
<br />
or (more likely with any strictly mechanical copying process)
<br />
that one of us appeared damaged.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If imperfect or diverged copies are to be considered as lesser-degree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; selves, is there an absolute rule which applies, an objective reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which governs the extent to which two different individuals are the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same &quot;self&quot;, or is it ultimately a matter of taste and opinion for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individuals involved to make the determination?
</em><br />
<br />I *think* it's objective.  Take two bit strings, for example. We
<br />
sort of have a feeling about how similar they are after we study
<br />
them awhile. But we can resort to various objective measures. 
<br />
Sure there is no *one* particular supreme measure, but nonetheless
<br />
I believe that the degree to which two things resemble each other
<br />
is objective, and not just a matter of taste.
<br />
<br />Still, even if you were my identical twin brother, we might come
<br />
to disagree on how far back in time we identified with our younger
<br />
selves.  You might say that the twelve-year old was at the 50%
<br />
point, and I might say that the eighteen-year old was at the
<br />
50% point. Even when an advanced AI gives us some objective
<br />
instruments or measures for determining similarity, even my
<br />
twin and I might disagree somewhat---so probably taste does
<br />
enter into it.  But just a bit, I think.
<br />
<br />Lee
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this something that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasonable people can disagree on, or is there an objective truth about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it that they should ultimately come to agreement on if they work at it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long enough?
</em><br />
