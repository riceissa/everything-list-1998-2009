Notes from the Court Jester:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Math can describe the universe as it is - our most powerful mental  
<br />
ability; no question about it
<br />
<br />You have to be &quot;right&quot; at every step of the way when you use math -  
<br />
inconsistency points to a lack of logical connection between steps and  
<br />
is tantamount to error
<br />
<br />Why people spend so much time trying to be 'right' and checking each  
<br />
other's calculations, trying to catch each other out somehow
<br />
<br />It's a very absorbing game to play and does lead to genuine insights.  
<br />
Real science can be done in this way and mostly is
<br />
<br /><br />However
<br />
<br /><br />The universe is evolving and changing at all scales from moment to  
<br />
moment, just as the cells in our bodies are in the constant act of  
<br />
renewing themselves continually
<br />
<br />One observer moment is probably never going to be the same as another  
<br />
etc.
<br />
<br />Can mathematics describe an EVOLVING universe as accurately as it can  
<br />
describe a static one? Newton's laws and Einstein's relativity and all  
<br />
the subtle variants on these help to do so. Bruno's comp hyp seems to  
<br />
address an 'eternal' if not somewhat static reality that might even be  
<br />
taken as 'transcendental'.
<br />
<br />Who is dealing with the CHANGING nature of the universe?
<br />
<br /><br />I believe that human consciousness is probably a kind of time machine  
<br />
which, when fully cranked up, can visualise or simulate alternative  
<br />
futures
<br />
<br />We need to be able to do this as well as we can to avoid 'drift' or  
<br />
'vortex' by the most obviously gravitating future tugging our present  
<br />
into its flow
<br />
<br />'The past can be studied but the future can only be created' (Edward  
<br />
de Bono) - well, we might say on this list 'selected' - I won't dare  
<br />
to try and relate this to the &quot;Free Willy&quot; debate!!!
<br />
<br />Rather than describe &quot;What IS&quot;
<br />
<br />Isn't it time to talk about &quot;What COULD BE&quot;??? We have very little  
<br />
mental apparatus set up and well-rehearsed to do this
<br />
<br />This is also where Math and Logic (IMHO) fail to meet our (rather dire  
<br />
by now) needs
<br />
<br /><br />Lateral Thinking (&quot;possibility thinking&quot;) and Critical Thinking  
<br />
(&quot;vertical thinking&quot;)
<br />
<br />Critical thinking is primarily concerned with judging the truth value  
<br />
of statements and seeking errors. Lateral thinking is more concerned  
<br />
with the movement value of statements and ideas. A person would use  
<br />
lateral thinking when they want to move from one known idea to  
<br />
creating new ideas. It can also be put as, critical thinking is like a  
<br />
post-mortem while lateral thinking is like diagnosis
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Example 1 of Lateral Thinking (Full Perceptual Scan)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />It took two hours for two men to dig a hole five feet deep. How deep  
<br />
would it have been if ten men had dug the hole for two hours?
<br />
<br />A standard high-school arithmetic question; but who can be certain of  
<br />
the ultimate value of the right answer if the universe is changing  
<br />
between the time the problem was posed and the answer was arrived at?
<br />
<br />The &quot;right&quot; answer appears to be 25 feet deep. This answer assumes  
<br />
that the thinker has followed a simple mathematical relationship  
<br />
suggested by the description given. Vertical thinking quickly arrives  
<br />
at this academically correct, though potentially simplistic or crude  
<br />
result. Anyone proclaiming that &quot;25 feet is the only correct answer&quot;  
<br />
would not want to be in a job as an engineer or works foreman.
<br />
<br />Lateral Thinking (which can involve intentional humour or other  
<br />
provocative statements) involves a thorough perceptual scan of the  
<br />
situation BEFORE any attempt at an answer is made. Using this  
<br />
technique, we can generate the following highly pertinent observations  
<br />
that make the &quot;correct answer&quot; seem almost useless by comparison:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Time remaining the same, the answer (25 ft.) assumes a linear  
<br />
proportionality between the Number of men and the Work quantity, which  
<br />
is not necessarily true. There
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be quantitative/qualitative factors affecting the  
<br />
relation and thus the answer. The following points for instance may  
<br />
alter the relation:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• A hole may need to be of a certain size or shape so digging might  
<br />
stop early at a required depth.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The deeper a hole is, the more effort is required to dig it, since  
<br />
waste soil needs to be lifted higher to the ground level. There is a  
<br />
limit to how deep a hole can be dug by
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manpower without use of ladders or hoists for soil removal,  
<br />
and 25 feet is beyond this limit.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Similarly, the men need to be able to get out of the hole later -  
<br />
which depending on how steep the sides are. Normally, getting out of a  
<br />
25 foot deep hole requires
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ladders, rope or other equipment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Ten men would need more room to work side-by-side, and so may need  
<br />
to dig the hole wider rather than deeper. Each man digging needs space  
<br />
to use a shovel.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Deeper soil layers may be harder to dig out, or we may hit bedrock  
<br />
or the water table.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Digging in soil, clay, or sand each present their own special  
<br />
considerations.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Ten men are more likely to disagree on a digging method than two men.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Holes required to be dug beyond a certain depth may require  
<br />
structural reinforcement to prevent collapse of the hole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The shape of the hole may not be a prism: if it is a cone-shaped  
<br />
hole, which is wider at the top than the bottom, then even if the  
<br />
volume of the hole is five times that of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the first hole, it may not be five times as deep.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Digging in a forest becomes much easier once we have cut through  
<br />
the first several feet of roots.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• It is possible that with more people working on a project, each  
<br />
person may become less efficient due to increased opportunity for  
<br />
distraction, the assumption he can
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slack off, more people to talk to, etc.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• More men could work in shifts to dig faster for longer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• There might be fewer shovels than available men.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The two hours dug by ten men may be under different weather  
<br />
conditions than the two hours dug by two men.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Rain could flood the hole to prevent digging.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Temperature conditions may freeze the men before they finish.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• A wild bear may approach the hole and maul the men while they are  
<br />
up to their shoulders in said hole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Would we rather have 5 holes each 5 feet deep?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The two men may be an engineering crew with digging machinery.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Maybe one of the 10 men will die, less likely if only 2 men are  
<br />
working.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• One man in each group might be a manager who will not actually dig.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The extra eight men might not be strong enough to dig, or much  
<br />
stronger than the first two.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• There must be a reason for digging and ten men are more likely to  
<br />
hinder each other's progress, due to personal profit and  
<br />
expectations : competition, disagreement on
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the place where it would be better to dig, disagreement on who  
<br />
should use a shovel to dig and who should use a bucket to carry the  
<br />
soil out of the hole, ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• A greater number may induce a greater diversity and the babel tower  
<br />
syndrome may occur: incompatibility within the workers and failure to  
<br />
understand each other
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effectively.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• With ten men you are five times more likely to break a shovel.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Assuming that they will dig the hole five times faster, they first  
<br />
take a 96 minute break; however, at the end of their 24 minute shovel  
<br />
dance, they have only a three foot
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deep hole because the mathematical variables were far too  
<br />
complex for mere hole diggers to consider.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The men could begin digging horizontally after reaching their depth  
<br />
of five feet, leaving the 10 men with a wider, 5 foot deep hole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &quot;Digging holes&quot; may actually mean something extremely vulgar.
<br />
<br /><br />The most useful ideas listed above are outside the simple mathematics  
<br />
implied by the question.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Example 2 of Lateral Thinking (Provocation to induce idea movement)
<br />
<br />Consider the statement &quot;Cars should have square wheels.&quot;
<br />
<br />When considered with critical thinking, this would be evaluated as a  
<br />
poor suggestion and dismissed as impractical. The lateral thinking  
<br />
treatment of the same statement would be to speculate where it leads.  
<br />
Humour is taken intentionally with lateral thinking. A person would  
<br />
imagine &quot;as if&quot; this were the case, and describe the effects or  
<br />
qualities. Someone might observe: square wheels would produce very  
<br />
predictable bumps. If bumps can be predicted, then suspension can be  
<br />
designed to compensate. This leads to the idea of active suspension. A  
<br />
sensor connected to suspension could examine the road surface ahead on  
<br />
cars with round wheels too. A car could have a sensor for determining  
<br />
when it was going to hit a bump that feeds back to suspension that  
<br />
would know to compensate. The initial &quot;provocative&quot; statement has been  
<br />
left behind, but it has also been used to indirectly generate the new  
<br />
and potentially more useful idea.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Example 3 of Lateral Thinking (Changing the way a situation is viewed)
<br />
<br />A man and his son are in a car crash. The man is killed and the son is  
<br />
taken to hospital gravely injured. When he gets there, the surgeon  
<br />
says &quot;I can't operate on this boy - he is my son!&quot; (Surgeons are  
<br />
forbidden to operate on their own offspring) How is this possible?
<br />
<br />This is an example of a quick assumption blocking the mind's ability  
<br />
to explore alternatives. In this case the assumption is that the  
<br />
quintessential doctor is a male; this leads to the conclusion that  
<br />
either the surgeon or the &quot;father&quot; in the car crash was not the boy's  
<br />
real father.
<br />
<br />If you change your perception to allow for a female surgeon, then the  
<br />
answer is suddenly obvious, the surgeon is the boy's mother. Using  
<br />
lateral thinking, we can see the problem from a different view rather  
<br />
than operating on the immediate and more obvious assumptions.
<br />
<br />Other examples of lateral thinking: One assumes the surgeon is telling  
<br />
the truth. Maybe he was simply wrong (the son might have looked  
<br />
exactly like his own son) or maybe he was lying, because for some  
<br />
reason he didn't want to operate on him (he could have felt bad or  
<br />
drunk alcohol before).
<br />
<br />The son could have two fathers - one of them could have been his  
<br />
adoptive father. Or if the boy was one of two separated twins, with  
<br />
the other growing up with the surgeon for whatever reason, then the  
<br />
surgeon would have recognized the boy as his own son.
<br />
