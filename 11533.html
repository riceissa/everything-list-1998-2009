<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Matter is a bare substrate with no properties of its own. The question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; may well be asked at this point: what roles does it perform ? Why not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dispense with matter and just have bundles of properties -- what does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; matter add to a merely abstract set of properties? The answer is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not all bundles of posible properties are instantiated, that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What does it mean to say something exists ? &quot;..exists&quot; is a meaningful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; predicate of concepts rather than things. The thing must exist in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sense to be talked about. But if it existed full, a statement like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;Nessie doesn't exist&quot; would be a contradiction ...it would amount to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;the existing thing Nessie doesnt exist&quot;. However, if we take that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;some sense&quot; in which the subject of an &quot;...exists&quot; predicate exists is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; only initially as a concept, we can then say whether or not the concept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; has something to refer to. Thus &quot;Bigfoot exists&quot; would mean &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; concept 'Bigfoot' has a referent&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What matter adds to a bundle of properties is existence. A non-existent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bundle of properties is a mere concept, a mere possibility. Thus the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; concept of matter is very much tied to the idea of contingency or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;somethingism&quot; -- the idea that only certain possible things exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So on this basis alone are you opposed to a *physical* multiverse, in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every possibility is physically instantiated somewhere, but some possibilities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are more common/ have greater measure than others?
</em><br />
<br />No, a Physical multiverse is material and Somethingist.
<br />
The idea that HP/WR universes are not observed because they
<br />
have a low, but non-zero measure is an extension of the
<br />
single universe idea that they are no observed because they
<br />
have zero measure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The other issue matter is able to explain as a result of having no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; properties of its own is the issue of change and time. For change to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distinguishable from mere succession, it must be change in something.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It could be a contingent natural law that certain properties never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; change. However, with a propertiless substrate, it becomes a logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; necessity that the substrate endures through change; since all changes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are changes in properties, a propertiless substrate cannot itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; change and must endure through change. In more detail here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why must &quot;change... be change in something&quot;? It sort of sounds reasonable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it is our duty to question every assumption and weed out the superfluous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones. If there is an object with (space, time, colour) coordinates (x1, t1, red)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and another object (x1, t2, orange), then we say that the object has changed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from red to orange.
</em><br />
<br />If we already know what distinguishes the time co-ordinate
<br />
from the space co-ordinate. What is our usual
<br />
way of doing that? The time co-ordinate is the one that is always
<br />
changing...
<br />
<br />Time and Possibility
<br />
<br />Imagine a universe in which there was no change, nothing actually
<br />
occurs. In the absence of events, it would be imposssible to
<br />
distinguish any point in timw from any other point. There would be no
<br />
meaning to time -- such a universe would be timeless.
<br />
Now imagine a universe which is completely chaotic. Things change so
<br />
completely from one moment to the next that there are no conistent
<br />
things. This universe is made up solely of events, which can be
<br />
labelled with 4 coordinates . [ x,y,z,t]. But which coordinate is the
<br />
time coordinate ? One could just as well say [ y,t,z,x]. In the absence
<br />
of persistent ojects there is nothing to single out time as a
<br />
'direction' in a coordinate system. So again time is meaingless.
<br />
<br />In order to have a meaningful Time, you need a combination of sameness
<br />
(persisitent objects) and change (events). So time is posited on being
<br />
able to say:
<br />
<br />&quot;Object A changed from state S1 at time T1 to state S2 at time T2.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see how a physical multiverse would be distinguishable from a virtual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality or a mathematical reality (assuming the latter is possible, for the sake
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of this part of the argument). The successive moments of your conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience do not need to be explicitly linked together to &quot;flow&quot; and they do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not need to be explicitly separated, either in separate universes or in separate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rooms, to be separate.
</em><br />
<br />I've never seen an HP universe. Yet they *must* exist in a mathematical
<br />
reality, because there are no random gaps in Platonia. Since all
<br />
mathematical
<br />
structures are exemplified, the structure corresponging to (me up till
<br />
1 second ago)
<br />
+ (purple dragons) must exist. If there is nothing
<br />
mathematical to keep out of HP universe, the fact that I have never
<br />
seen one is
<br />
evidence against a mathematical multiverse.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you died today and just by accident a possible next
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment of consciousness was generated by a computer a trillion years in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future, then ipso facto you would find yourself a trillion years in the future.
</em><br />
<br />That's the whole problem. I could just as easily find myself in an HP
<br />
universe. But I never do.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But if you had the successive moments of your consciousness implemented
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in parallel, perhaps as a simulation on a powerful computer, it would be impossible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to tell that this was the case. For all you are aware, there may not *be* any past
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moments: your present experience may include false memories of your past, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole world may have been created a second ago.
</em><br />
<br />A simulation running on a computer is still a dynamic, temporal
<br />
process. The point is that the passage of
<br />
time tells me that I am not in Platonia.
<br />
<br /><br />Time Capsules: Getting Flow from Sequence.
<br />
<br />Proponents of the Block Universe view believe that there is only a
<br />
B-Series. Some think that alone is adequate to explain the subjective
<br />
Flow-of-Time. It is easy enough to see how there could be a sequence in
<br />
the B series. If we consider a series of 3 dimensional &quot;snapshots&quot; of
<br />
someone's brain, each subsequent snapshot iwll contain information
<br />
relating back to previous ones.
<br />
But is this chain or sequence enough to establish flow ? A B-series
<br />
without an A-series is like a spatial series. If you had a series of
<br />
clones arranged spatially so that clone 2 has all of clone 1's memories
<br />
(and more), clone 3 has all of clone 2's memories (and more) and so on,
<br />
you would not expect anything to be flowing from one clone to another.
<br />
The clones form a series of &quot;time capsules&quot;, and a such they have a
<br />
natural sequence, but that is all.
<br />
Without an A series, there is nothing to justify the idea that only one
<br />
time capsule is conscious &quot;at a time&quot;. Either they all are, or none
<br />
are. We know we are conscious, so we must reject the &quot;none are&quot; option.
<br />
The Block Universe therefore predicts that all time capsules are
<br />
conscious. This is in line with the way the Block Universe spatialises
<br />
Time. It predicts that consciousness is a single 4-dimensional entity.
<br />
I would not just be conscious now with memories of the past, I would
<br />
have a consciousness in the past overlaid on my present consciousness.
<br />
<br />The objection that being arrayed along the 4th dimension would split
<br />
consciousness up is week; we don't have a micro-conscousness associated
<br />
with each neuron, despite their spatial separation. Why should temporal
<br />
separation have ant atomising, fragmenting effect --when B-series time
<br />
is so similar to space anyway ?
<br />
<br /><br />What tells
<br />
me that I am not being computer-simulated is  another
<br />
question.
