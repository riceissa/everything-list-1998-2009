Bruno, I reviewed the archive and found no reply.
<br />
I will repeat it again, hoping for your thoughts:
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />from July 2, 2006 (lightly amended and then addended)
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno,
<br />
<br />I have found myself in this lifetime to be a staunch
<br />
OP-ponent and challenger to Godel's incompleteness theorems.   
<br />
<br />In the way that they are structured - with the premises
<br />
Godel preset: of initial boundaries for what he was
<br />
about to design by 'proof' - his theorems -are- both 
<br />
sufficiently closed and constituently -accurate- in 
<br />
their conclusion and notions.
<br />
<br />_But_ what I find disturbing about them is that they are
<br />
RELIANT on a more formative -presumption-, which presumption
<br />
enables an analyst to draw quite a -contrary result- to what
<br />
Godel announced. A self-discontinuity _within_ his theorems,
<br />
as it were.
<br />
<br />Clearly, this:
<br />
<br />He tacitly identifies any information resident -outside- any that 
<br />
current/known, as -eventually accessible, connectible, relatable-;  
<br />
even if it means restructuring known-information in regard to
<br />
alternative/new criteria and standards definitions, descriptions,
<br />
statements.   A presumption/definition of universal information
<br />
compatibility - of all information - whether known or unknown.
<br />
<br />It is through this process of &quot;add then re-evaluate&quot; that new
<br />
paradigms are achieved.  But, it is dependent on the compatibility
<br />
of the -whole- scope of all the information present at that moment of
<br />
evaluation; and the eventual capacity to coordinate statements with
<br />
all content addressable by statements.
<br />
<br />So, his thesis that at any given moment in time, not all information
<br />
is present or gathered, and that this makes for limited statement
<br />
making, where some evaluation statements in the data-set may instead
<br />
be reliant on future/other yet-to-be-included information .. is a 
<br />
worthy logical notion.   A closed system may not completely evaluate
<br />
itself -- some evaluations are indeterminant.
<br />
<br /><br />But, instead of focusing on the random evaluation moment, think
<br />
about what that presumption of 'eventual includability' dictates:
<br />
<br />It heavily defines that we -can- (right now) state -something specific 
<br />
and projective- about the qualia and nature of knowledge and information
<br />
-- currently -beyond- the bounds of actual experience and encounter and
<br />
access.
<br />
<br />It also asserts:   information 'unknown' is compatible with and
<br />
eventually relatable with information 'known'.
<br />
<br />The first foundation of Godel's '&quot;I can't decide about that&quot; Theorems'
<br />
is the contrary moot statement: 'I -can- decide about -everything- and
<br />
here's why';  -- which is a contradiction of logic.   That is: 
<br />
<br />The &quot;limited&quot; set can make true-false statement about the -totality-
<br />
of existence (internal and external to its bounded known-ness); but,
<br />
it cannot guarantee it's own true-false statements (without some
<br />
added 'external' information, made eventually internal to a boundary).
<br />
At which point, some/all old non-decidables would be rendered decidable,
<br />
and, -new- undecidables would arise, apparently.   
<br />
<br /><br />I would say, the logic of future science and knowledge is
<br />
-incorrectly- contrained and defined by current interpretion
<br />
of Godel's Incompleteness Theorems.  
<br />
<br /><br />Rather, the logic of future science and knowledge
<br />
is premised in Information and Performance Holism.
<br />
The unitary interactional and information accessible
<br />
quality of Existence.  Which fundamental notion is what
<br />
Godel ignores and rejects and tries to discredit.
<br />
<br /><br />Where, we CAN in fact make DECISIVE STATEMENTS -about that which-
<br />
the incompleteness theorems 'conclude': we should not be able
<br />
to say -anything- at all.  
<br />
<br />You can absolutely place me in the community of thinkers 
<br />
who do not &quot;swallow the incompleteness phenomena&quot;.  Because
<br />
my statements/logic are not incorrect and they do identify the
<br />
flaw/weakness/incorrectness in Godel.
<br />
<br />He used not a tautology but a self-contradictory tautology logic.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If A then not-A ; if not-A, then never an inclusive 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A &amp; not A) as long as not-A exists; and since not-A
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always exists then A is not accessible to evaluate 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not-A, or perfectly assess itself, (A); HOWEVER, A -can-
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assert (A&amp;notA) and assess (A&amp;notA) which includes (not-A).
<br />
<br />All Godel did was give a validation for information
<br />
hiding and manipulation -- something useful to politicians
<br />
and economic manipulators and spiritual advocates: You can 
<br />
keep people trapped and powerless by limiting their
<br />
access to added (ostensibly important) information,
<br />
that would otherwise allow them to make decisions, which
<br />
an outer-heirarchy might not want them to make. 
<br />
<br />Godel's Incompleteness Theorems didn't do Science or
<br />
Math or Logic any favors.
<br />
<br />Nor the societal future for that matter.
<br />
<br /><br />The first order rule of 'universality' is
<br />
requisite non-excludable compatibility and 
<br />
consistency.  Even if subset incompatibilities
<br />
are conditionally allowed, (say matter and
<br />
anti-matter mutual anihilation) the fact that 
<br />
they interact at all indicates they -share-
<br />
'reaction' parameters; they may not survive
<br />
interaction but they are 'interactionable'
<br />
due to shared scope of qualia.
<br />
<br />The most extreme form of universality is forms
<br />
that 'exist' but cannot even communicate (interact);
<br />
The possibility of co-existing in the same domain 
<br />
but perfectly non-interactive.  &quot;Universality&quot; allows
<br />
this -and- by doing so completes perfect self-definition.
<br />
Non-information transferability is umbrellaed in
<br />
'the universal' and affirms that there is an ultimate
<br />
holistic compatibility state for all extancy of any
<br />
sort or non-sort.
<br />
<br />The ultimate/absolute &quot;invariance rule&quot;.
<br />
<br />After this, partitioning gets you to
<br />
mini-rules (like the Godel Incmp Thms).
<br />
<br />But first and foremost: nothing exists absent
<br />
of co-existence or 'environment'. 
<br />
<br />With the corrolary: nothing is perfectly self-definied -
<br />
companion existence is included even if sufficiently
<br />
distanced to be functionally disregarded for local purposes.
<br />
<br />Which then leads to the logical deduction that no
<br />
'clone' or -seemingly- &quot;duplicate&quot; can ever be.
<br />
No 'perfect replicate' persona is possible -- without
<br />
the perfect replication (without ANY variance) of the
<br />
entire rest of the universe as well.  No matter how
<br />
uncannily close in replication, each individual must of
<br />
needs, be its -own persona-.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />But the first order of business is to clean
<br />
house and get out from under Godel's mis-leading
<br />
authority &amp; ideas.  !
