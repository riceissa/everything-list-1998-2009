From: Russell Standish &lt;R.Standish.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consider universes implemented by a UTM by way of concreteness. Then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our regular universe corresponds to finite length programs that do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; access the data beyond the finite bit position n. Now, the contrived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, presumably consists of a similar program, but with a bug in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it causing the program to process the &quot;don't care&quot; bits lying beyond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the string. Now this contrived universe will have the same measure as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the one we observe. (What is the ratio of correct programs to buggy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones that work well enough to support consciousness?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, what will we see when these &quot;don't care&quot; bits are processed -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flying rabbits, fairies, non-mendacious politicians, decaying protons,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever. Most of the time, we won't even recognise it as being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something wrong, it'll just be noise. When we do - eg the flying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rabbit incident, there will be a lot of information involved - special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bit patterns - that we recognise as being unusual.
</em><br />
<br />This is a slight variant on how I interpreted your original post, and I have
<br />
to say that I like it. When I have considered this variation before (which I
<br />
think of as the 'bolt-on' variation: flying rabbits are added to the
<br />
K-specification of our universe), I have tended to come up with the
<br />
conclusion that because different flying rabbits can be
<br />
multiply represented along the infinite bit strings, they should eventually
<br />
dominate in all possible bit string combinations, even though they are
<br />
individually extremely improbable. Consider a case where flying rabbits are
<br />
possible in one in every 10^100 bit string segments, where each equal-length
<br />
segment is of length 10^24 bits. For the first 10^124 bits of our infinite
<br />
string there will be 1 flying rabbit universe per 2^(10^124) universes. But
<br />
in the second 10^124 bits there will be a different flying rabbit universe
<br />
for each 2^(10^124) universes as well (even though there are now 2^20^124
<br />
different combinations), nearly all of which will not already have a flying
<br />
rabbit of the first type. In the limit of an infinite length string, flying
<br />
rabbits will ultimately dominate. But this is NOT the case if there is an
<br />
infinite number of 'don't care' bits and a finite number of different
<br />
possible (visible) flying rabbits (as now seems to me more likely) -
<br />
effectively the flying rabbit segments are infinitely dispersed along the
<br />
string. Even for some cases of an infinity of visible flying rabbits, I
<br />
think a good case can be made for the aleph number being lower than that of
<br />
the total bit string itself. (I personally am not worried about TM
<br />
limitations here, not being a TM enthusiast.) Moreover I have a feeling that
<br />
this basic reasoning also applies to the 'full contrived universe'
<br />
variation, which is how I interpreted your first post, and also how I
<br />
presented the flying rabbit argument in the 'devil's advocate' thread.
<br />
<br />Perhaps I could just briefly explain part of why I consider this problem
<br />
(and its resolution) important. I do not think we are justified in
<br />
automatically assuming that mathematical existence just *is* physical
<br />
existence (as Tegmark does), but the regularities in nature imply that at
<br />
least some of physical existence can be modelled by an abbreviated
<br />
mathematical structure (a TOE). If we then consider an all possible
<br />
universes approach (for well known reasons), then we can use Tegmark's
<br />
category 1b challenge to rule out all but a few candidates. The scheme I
<br />
prefer has loose connections with Kant's thing-in-itself, but applies
<br />
maximally to all possibilities. So our universe can be represented minimally
<br />
by the values of a set of parameters (equivalent to a K-specification), but
<br />
universes exist at least corresponding to all possible values of these and
<br />
other parameters (and it is not the case that they just *are* those
<br />
mathematical structures). Call this the mtii (maximalised thing-in-itself)
<br />
approach.
<br />
<br />Certainly we can say from this that any mathematical structure that *can*
<br />
specify a universe does in fact do so, but whether there are entities other
<br />
than those that are completely mathematically specifiable I wouldn't like to
<br />
say - though I would hazard a guess that we wouldn't tend to think of them
<br />
as universes, if they did exist. However a mathematical structure could be
<br />
represented more than once, or a difference in formulation of two
<br />
mathematical structures that are equivalent may not be reflected in the
<br />
quantity of the universes they represent. A reasonable case can be made for
<br />
mathematical structures being at the basis of any measure under the mtii
<br />
scheme, though, at least for universes containing any form of
<br />
intelligent life. So, as far as I am concerned, the only two everything
<br />
hypotheses that I know of that have a sufficiently generic and deep
<br />
philosophical ground  (that is, Tegmark's and mtii (apologies to UTM
<br />
enthusiasts here)) stand or fall by their response to the flying rabbit
<br />
challenge.
<br />
<br />Thanks again to all of you have responded on this topic, and in particular
<br />
to Russell, who may just have come up with the solution!
<br />
<br />Alastair
