<br />The view that Mathematical Existence == Physical Existence implies that 
<br />
&quot;physical resources&quot; is a secondary concept, and that the ultimate ground 
<br />
of any physical universe is Mathspace, which doesn't require resources of 
<br />
any kind. Clearly, you don't think the idea that ME == PE makes sense. 
<br />
That's understandable, but here's a brief sketch of why I think it makes 
<br />
more sense than the alternative view (which I'll call &quot;Instantiationism&quot;):
<br />
<br />Here's my definition of &quot;Computational Realism&quot;, which is sort of a 
<br />
restricted version of Mathematical Realism. (I'm not sure if my definition 
<br />
is equivalent to what others call &quot;Arithmetic Realism&quot;, so I'm using a 
<br />
different term.) Let's say that you're about to physically implement some 
<br />
computation, and lets say that there are only three possible things that 
<br />
this computation can do: return 0, return 1, or never halt. Computational 
<br />
Realism is simply the belief that *there is a fact of the matter* about 
<br />
what this computation will do when you implement it, and that this fact is 
<br />
true *right now*, before you even begin the implementation. Furthermore, CR 
<br />
is the belief that there is fact of the matter about what the result of the 
<br />
computation *would be*, even if it's never actually implemented. CR implies 
<br />
that there is such a fact of the matter about every conceivable computation.
<br />
<br />It's from this perspective that I can begin to explain why I feel that 
<br />
implementation is not a fundamental concept. In my view, implementing a 
<br />
computation is a way of &quot;viewing&quot; a structure that already exists in 
<br />
Mathspace (or Platonia, or whatever you want to call it). Implementation is 
<br />
clearly something that occurs within computational structures - for 
<br />
instance, we can imagine creatures in a cellular automata implementing 
<br />
computations on their computers, and they will have all the same concerns 
<br />
about &quot;physical resources&quot; that we do - computational complexity, 
<br />
NP-complete problems, etc. However, the entire infinite structure of their 
<br />
CA world exists *right now*, in Mathspace. If we consider the rules to 
<br />
their CA, and consider an initial state (even an infinite one - say, the 
<br />
digits of pi), then there is *a fact of the matter* about what the state of 
<br />
the infinite lattice would be in ten ticks of the clock - or ten thousand, 
<br />
or ten million. And the key point is that the existence of these facts 
<br />
doesn't require &quot;resources&quot; - there's really no concept of resources at all 
<br />
at that level. Every single fact about every single possible computation is 
<br />
simply a fact, right now. Every conceivable NP-complete problem has an 
<br />
answer, and it doesn't require any &quot;computational resources&quot; for these 
<br />
answers to exist. But of course, computational creatures like us require 
<br />
computational resources to &quot;view&quot; these answers. Since our resources are 
<br />
severely limited, we don't have access to most of the truths in Mathspace.
<br />
<br />I don't think that this form of realism automatically leads to the 
<br />
conclusion that ME == PE, but it certainly points in that direction. ME == 
<br />
PE becomes especially appealing when we consider the infinite regress 
<br />
problem that the alternative position generates. You ask if your question 
<br />
is equivalent to the old &quot;first cause&quot; question. I propose that it is 
<br />
exactly equivalent, and brings with it all of the attendant paradoxes and 
<br />
problems. If you believe that implementation is a fundamental concept - if 
<br />
you believe that, somehow, our universe must be &quot;instantiated&quot;, or must 
<br />
have some other special quality that gives it its true reality - then 
<br />
you've got an infinite regress problem. Certainly, I can imagine that our 
<br />
universe is instantiated in some larger computation, but then that 
<br />
computation will have to be instantiated in something else to make *it* 
<br />
real... and where does it all end? Or is it turtles all the way down? Or 
<br />
does our universe simply have the elusive quality of &quot;physical existence&quot;, 
<br />
while other mathematical structures lack it? In my opinion, the idea that 
<br />
ME == PE points to a solution to these problems.
<br />
