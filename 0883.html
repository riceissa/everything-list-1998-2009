Jacques writes
<br />
&lt;&lt;      The MWI is deterministic, so the standard idea of probability
<br />
does
<br />
&nbsp;not apply.  &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />GS Levy
<br />
Not true.
<br />
<br />A dice has six sides, and a dice throw will generate one number in the
<br />
range
<br />
from 1 to 6, exactly in that range, not more not less. This fact is
<br />
deterministic. However, the ACTUAL number that the dice will produce is
<br />
probabilistic.
<br />
<br />Similarly, all the possible links allowing consciousness to propagate
<br />
from
<br />
one frame in the MW to another are deterministic that is, constrained by
<br />
the
<br />
physical laws, and mirroring these laws, our rationality. However, the
<br />
actual
<br />
frame where one particular conscious PERSPECTIVE will find itself, is
<br />
probabilistic.  It's all in the eyes of the beholder. This is precisely
<br />
the
<br />
essence of quantum indeterminacy.
<br />
<br />Simple and clear. Well put.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;      Either it exists or it doesn't.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />I think the root of the difference between Jacques and the rest of us is
<br />
in
<br />
our perception of the world. Jacque believes in an absolute physical
<br />
world
<br />
and we believe in a relative one. Which is it? For sure I don't know.
<br />
However, let me make some analogies, and Jacques is welcome to say that
<br />
this
<br />
is like &lt;&lt;Given A, B ...Therefore everyone will believe C. &quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Does motion exist or is it in the eyes of the beholder? As Einstein said
<br />
&quot;in
<br />
the eyes of the observer?&quot;
<br />
<br />Does light require a substrate to propagate? Does consciousness require
<br />
a
<br />
physical implementation? And by the way, what is the meaning of
<br />
&quot;physical
<br />
implementation?&quot; and how is it related to our rationality?
<br />
<br />Is the measure of the Empire State Building increased because one or one
<br />
<br />thousand or one million people have seen it? Is the measure of a
<br />
conscious
<br />
experience increased because it's played back once or replayed many
<br />
times?
<br />
<br />I already know Jacques' answer. (If A and B then C).
<br />
<br />Why does Jacques believe in the absolute and we believe in the relative?
<br />
<br />(This is just my guess) Maybe it's in our perception of the size of the
<br />
MW.
<br />
Is it finite or infinite? Is it the same as c, the continuum. Or larger?
<br />
<br />The relativity of our experience is not exclusive to the world being
<br />
absolute. Relativity should never have been applied as if it referenced
<br />
absolute reality. Relativity is a feature of time as measured by clocks.
<br />
It is a consequence of our subjective experience. Its cause also relates
<br />
intimately to quantum mechanics. Given that we understand quantum
<br />
mechanics as you described it, there is no valid reason to assume
<br />
relativity describes reality. Rather the opposite is true. Relative or
<br />
not, the universe exists.
<br />
<br />Your quite right about the issue relating to the questions above. Is the
<br />
universe complete. There are so many different ways to be finite or
<br />
infinite, but the fundamental difference of opinion I have noticed in
<br />
this group concerns whether or not time moves into the future endlessly,
<br />
non-repeating, expanding continuously into unique configs, regardless of
<br />
how boring or creative, so that at any given moment, time does not
<br />
extend infinitely into the future. Infinity in the direction of the
<br />
future is never actualized. Or, is the MWs complete in an ultimate or
<br />
objective reality, in which case time either either ends, as I have
<br />
suggested at a common future, such as omega zero, or there is an
<br />
objective reality distinct from our subjective experience of time, in
<br />
which an infinite period of time is somehow completed, which simply
<br />
involves seeing infinity as an actuality rather than a process.
<br />
<br />You mentioned frames. That brings up the issue of how defined each frame
<br />
or moment of time is. Again, quantum mechanics. I expect most would
<br />
agree that even in the now, the world around us is defined (to us) no
<br />
farther than our observation of it. Its not difficult to imagine the set
<br />
of all other possible space-time worlds, all configs within the wave
<br />
function of possible todays, let's say exactly 15 billion years after
<br />
the Big Bang. Surely that set of other worlds is both definitive and
<br />
infinite.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From an absolute perspective, any given point within space is surrounded
</em><br />
by all possible frames. I don't understand not seeing all those worlds
<br />
as real, existing permanently, and ourselves, being a subjective
<br />
observer passing through frame-time, a time created literally by the
<br />
existence of many frames all existing simultaneously. To me, nothing
<br />
else does justice to the knowledge of MWs. This in contrast to the image
<br />
of each observer somehow having an influence on the measure of reality.
<br />
Isn't that just egocentrism? It appears so from a distance.
<br />
<br />Devin Harris
<br />
<br />Note: The world cannot be absolute within a greater relative reality
<br />
however relativity can  exist within an absolute world.
