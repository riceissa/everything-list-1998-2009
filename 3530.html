</em><br />
<br />I don't agree with this, because as I said earlier people expend effort to
<br />
obtain results that they'll never see, for example by writing wills.
<br />
Clearly what is a gain for a subject is not only based on first person
<br />
experiences. Suppose someone offered you $1000, but if you accepted Earth
<br />
would be destroyed and everyone on it killed as soon as you die. Would you
<br />
take that offer? Even if you did I'm sure most people wouldn't.
<br />
<br />While it's true that evolution has programmed us to make decisions mostly
<br />
on the basis of first person experiences, I think this is really because
<br />
we haven't had access to mind duplication or quantum suicide technology.
<br />
If you consider those techonologies, it should be clear that there are
<br />
some valid goals that can't be expressed in terms of expected first person
<br />
experiences.
<br />
<br />I admit the decision theory approach I gave in the last post has problems,
<br />
some of which you've pointed out. But what's the alternative? I've been
<br />
thinking about this issue for several years, starting with the
<br />
expected-first-person-experiences approach (if you read the earlier
<br />
archives you'll see many posts from me on this). I gave up on those when I
<br />
realized that some reasonable goals can't be expressed in terms of
<br />
expected first person experiences.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by the GTM (Great Turing Machine?).
</em><br />
<br />GTM means general Turing machine. It's defined in Jürgen
<br />
Schmidhuber's paper at <a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/</a>. Please read
<br />
it if you haven't already.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I partially agree with you in the sense that I know there is a Universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dovetailer capable of simulating all &quot;universes&quot; in parallel (+ all    
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dream of universes, etc...) and capable of generating all version of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;me-now&quot;, but I stop here, because no Turing machine can keep track
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the &quot;me-now&quot;, and besides, even if such machine could exist (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it cannot by a theorem of RICE) then for any UD you can build another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UD which will, on any finite portion of its execution, give
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different ratio between the me-now and their continuations (only in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite will the &quot;ratio&quot; be the same).
</em><br />
<br />Wait, even in the infinite the ratios will not be the same in general. Why
<br />
do you think they will be?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;From this position it appears that there is no need or room for an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;objective measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ??? This is exactly what I don't understand (and where I agree with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Finney's reply). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Once such or such person has some (subjective and personal) goals,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and has decided to put much weight on that goal, it seems to me that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is better for him/her to take into account the most objective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure she/he can calculate or bet on his/her continuations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exemple: 1) my goal is to drink a hot coffee. I put a recipient of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; water onto the stove (or cooker?). I use some implicite high measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the probable boiling water phenomenon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) I use teletransport everyday because I got a job on Mars.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now the channel has been made secure (thanks to some quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; protocol). My goal here is to make as little as possible the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability of being duplicate without my consent by some sadical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; channel-pirate in need of flesh (not chair!). So I decide to pay
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the bill for the quantum protocol.
</em><br />
<br />If you read Schmidhuber's paper, you'll see that he offers several
<br />
measures for consideration. He believes that the Speed Prior is the
<br />
correct objective measure, but I think it's a matter of subjective
<br />
preference. Adopting the Speed Prior basicly means you care more about
<br />
universes that are fast to compute then universes that are slow to
<br />
compute. Here's an example to illustrate what I mean. This is really key
<br />
so please let me know if you don't understand it.
<br />
<br />Suppose you want to crack a bank's encryption key, which is worth $4
<br />
million to you, and there are two ways to do it. You can spend $2 million
<br />
to build a quantum computer to crack the key, or you can spend $3 million
<br />
to build a classical computer to do this. Now if you believe the Speed
<br />
Prior is the correct measure, then you'll think that the quantum computer
<br />
will very likely fail, and therefore you should go with the classical
<br />
computer instead. But if you believe the Universal Prior is the correct
<br />
measure, then you'll think that both computers will work and you'll go
<br />
with the quantum computer because it's cheaper.
<br />
<br />However, there's another way to think about this situation that doesn't
<br />
involve an objective measure. The fast-to-compute and the slow-to-compute
<br />
universes both exist. (The fast-to-compute universes are the ones where
<br />
quantum computers fail.) So when you adopt the Speed Prior you're really
<br />
saying &quot;I know the slow-to-compute universes exist (and my actions affect
<br />
what happens in them), but I just don't care very much about those
<br />
universe.&quot; 
<br />
<br />To me the attraction of think about it the second way is that it allows us
<br />
to just say that all universes exist. We don't have to say that
<br />
objectively one universe has a higher measure than another. What does that
<br />
mean anyway? If all universes exist, how is it that some universes have
<br />
more of an existence than others? We don't have to answer those questions.
