<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  I argued this cannot be done a priori.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What Hal said is compatible with discriminating against big (but not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;against slow)  programs, if you consider infinite strings as programs,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;parts of which may never be read by the computer, and interpret &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number of computer programs which create a universe&quot; as the proportion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinite strings which output the universe, and the size of a program as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the number of bits of the infinite string which is read.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Programs and machines are generally considered as finite. I could
<br />
interpret an (perhaps arbitrary) infinite string as an oracle, but then
<br />
you should be more precise of what it means by &quot;create (output) a universe&quot; ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; I don't think we can look into an &quot;output&quot; in that way. For the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  reason we cannot look at your sleeping brain for seeing if you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  dreaming about a banana. This is again linked to the 1/3 distinction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You're right that we can't do this very well today. We can't look at a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brain from a third person perspective and determine exactly what it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiencing, but we should be able to do it in the future with better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;technology. Even today we can get some probabilistic information about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what the person might be experiencing. We can tell whether someone is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;awake or asleep, whether he is experiencing anger or calm, etc. If we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;allow looking at the environment around the brain and making probabilistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inferences, we can do even better. For example if we see a person facing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an apple with his eyes open, then we can infer that he is probably seeing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an apple. Similarly if I see an apple, I can infer that I'm probably in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe where I'm facing an apple with my eyes open.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are right.I am sure we will have machine capable of making the image
<br />
of a banana appearing when you are thinking into it. My use of this
<br />
analogy was incorrect, strictly speaking. What I say is that the experience
<br />
of the banana cannot be attached to the &quot;brain behavior alone&quot;, unless you
<br />
mean by brain the entire set of computational (quantum if you want) stories
<br />
going through that comp state. This was shown by the uda (but see below):
<br />
You can attribute a mind to a machine, but it is not possible to attribute a
<br />
singular machine to your own mind, except locally and relatively.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  I would say the flaws are both in the too much static view of a computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  output programs, where I think &quot;universe&quot; are first person emergent on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  running of all computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What is the motivation for defining &quot;universe&quot; this way?
</em><br />
<br />I give more than a motivation, I suggest (at least) an obligation!
<br />
First here, I could ask you how you define a universe. That's not obvious
<br />
at all. But the uda shows that my next experience is given by some average
<br />
on all possible experience in my computational neighborhoods. So that with
<br />
comp the universe, if any thing like that exists, must emerge from that
<br />
average. The difficult things is how to define that average, and eventually
<br />
this leads me to the interview of the UM.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The third person concept of a universe as the running of a computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;program (I agree that the running of it is a more useful concept than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;output considered statically) is useful in simplifying decision making. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It allows you to consider the consequences of an action in each universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;independently, knowing that they do not interact with each other.
</em><br />
<br />They do not interact, but they do interfere, by changing the relative
<br />
possible probabilities of occurence of that or this story. Quite similar
<br />
with what happens in Quantum Mechanics, where the many worlds interfere
<br />
without interacting.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But how do you make use of your first person concept of universe? (I'm not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sure what the concept is exactly yet, but perhaps your answer to this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question will help.)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Remember that the UD, or the Schroedinger Wave Equation (SWE), multiplies
<br />
you &quot;all the time&quot;. The difference between first and third person point of view
<br />
is the difference between an outside description, in which you can labelise
<br />
the multiplied observers, and the personal notes-book/memory of each observer,
<br />
who, if the multiplication has been done at the right level (existing by comp),
<br />
will not *feel* the existence of their counterparts. I use 1-person point
<br />
of view where Everett talks about subjective memory, and 3-person point of view
<br />
where Everett uses objective.
<br />
<br />If I am duplicate, I will experience first person indeterminacy (ignorance
<br />
of what I will write in my personal diary), although
<br />
everything is determined from a third person point of view. (Comp 
<br />
indeterminacy).
<br />
Do you agree with this?
<br />
<br />Bruno
