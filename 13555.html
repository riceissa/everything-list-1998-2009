Colin and partners:
<br />
<br />To the subject question: how do you know your own conscious state? (It all
<br />
comes back to my 'ceterum censeo': what are we talking about as
<br />
'consciousness'? -
<br />
if there is a concensus-ready definition for open-minded use at all).
<br />
<br />And a 2nd question: May I ask: what is 'novelty'?
<br />
usually it refers to something actually not 'registered' among known and
<br />
currently
<br />
&nbsp;listed things within the inventory of activated presently used cognitive
<br />
inventories.
<br />
Within the complexity inherently applied in the world, there is no novelty.
<br />
(First off: time is not included in complexity, so a 'later' finding is not
<br />
'new'. )
<br />
Secondly: our (limited) mindset works only with &quot;that much&quot; content and I
<br />
would be cautious to call 'novelty' the &quot;rest of the world&quot;.
<br />
I wonder about Bruno's (omniscient) Lob-machine, how it handles a novelty.
<br />
Now I can continue reading your very exciting discussion.
<br />
Thanks
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; STATHIS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your argument that only consciousness can give rise to technology loses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; validity if you include &quot;must be produced by a conscious being&quot; as part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the definition of technology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COLIN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There's obvious circularity in the above sentence and it is the same old
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circularity that endlessly haunts discussions like this (see the dialog
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with Russel).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In dealing with the thread....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Re: How would a computer know if it were conscious?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ....my proposition was that successful _novel_ technology....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i.e. a entity comprised of matter with a function not previously observed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that resulted from new - as in hitherto unknown - knowledge of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; .... can only result when sourced through agency inclusive of a phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness (specifically and currently only that that aspect of human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain function I have called 'cortical qualia'). Without the qualia,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generated based on literal connection with the world outside the agent,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the novelty upon which the new knowledge was based would be invisible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My proposition was that if the machine can do the science on exquisite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; novelty that subsequantly is in the causal ancestry of novel technology
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then that machine must include phenomenal scenes (qualia) that depict the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Scientists and science are the way to objectively attain an objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific position on subjective experience - that is just as valid as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any other scientific position AND that a machine could judge itself by. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the machine is willing to bet its existence on the novel technology's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ability to function when the machine is not there doing what it thinks is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'observing it'... and it survives - then it can call itself conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Humans do that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the machines have another option. They can physically battle it out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against humans. The humans will blitz machines without phenomenal scenes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every time and the machines without them won't even know it because they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never knew they were in a fight to start with. They wouldn't be able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; test a hypothesis that they were even in a fight.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and then this looks all circular again doesn't it?....this circularity is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the predictable result....see below...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; STATHIS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Well, why does your eye generate visual qualia and not your big toe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's because the big toe lacks the necessary machinery.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COLIN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I am afraid you have your physiology mixed up. The eye does NOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generate visual qualia. Your visual cortex  generates it based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measurements in the eye. The qualia are manufactured and simultaneously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; projected to appear to come from the eye (actually somewhere medial to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them). It's how you have 90degrees++ peripheral vison. The same visual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualia can be generated without an eye (hallucination/dream). Some blind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (no functioning retina) people have a visual field for numbers. Other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cross-modal mixups can occur in synesthesia (you can hear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; colours, taste words). You can have a &quot;phantom big toe&quot; without having any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; big toe at all....just because the cortex is still there making the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualia. If you swapped the sensory nerves in two fingers the motor cortex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would drive finger A and it would feel like finger B moved and you would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see finger A move. The sensation is in your head, not the periphery. It's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; merely projected at the periphery.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; STATHIS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Of course all that is true, but it doesn't explain why neurons in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cortex are the ones giving rise to qualia rather than other neurons or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed peripheral sense organs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COLIN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Was that what you were after?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hmmm.... firstly..... didactic mode....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; =====================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Qualia are not about 'knowledge'. Any old piece of junk can symbolically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; encode knowledge. Qualia, however, optimally serve _learning_ = _change_
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in knowledge but more specifically change in knowledge about the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OUTSIDE the agent. Mathematically: If KNOWLEDGE(t) is what we know at time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; t, then qualia give us an optimal (survivable):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; d(knowledge(t))
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -----------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    dt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where knowledge(t) is all about the world outside the agent. Without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualia you have the ultimate in circularity - what you know must be based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on what you know + sensory signals devoid of qualia and only interpretable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by your existing knowledge. Sensory signals are not uniquely related to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the external natural world behaviour (law of electromagnetics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Laplacian/Possions equation) and are intrinsically devoid of qualia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (physiological fact). Hence the science of sensory signals (capturing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regularity in them) is NOT the science of the external natural world in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any way that exposes novelty in the external natural world= a recipe for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolutionary shortlived-ness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; =========================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now... as to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Of course all that is true, but it doesn't explain why neurons in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cortex are the ones giving rise to qualia rather than other neurons or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed peripheral sense organs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your whole concept of explanation is causal of the problem! Objects of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense impressions (contents of consciousness) cannot predict the existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the sense impressions. All the 'cells' etc are objects of sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impressions! All description, no explanation. You will never explain them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that way by definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only way out of the circularity is to ask yourself  (as I suggested in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the first post)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;What kind of universe must I be in/made of would, in the form of observed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cells and cell behaviour, deliver observation of the kind that reveals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself as cells behaving as they do?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hold the huge and exquisitiely structured electromagnetic field in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normal human cranial excitable cells (neurons and astrocytes)to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; responsible for qualia. 'The word 'electromagnetic' is just a label for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense artefact. There is no such 'thing' as electromagnetism. There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only SOMETHING (stuff) behaving in a an electromagnetic fashion that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all agreed is deserved of the label..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ....The trick is to propose all manner of kinds of 'stuff' (nothing to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with any'thing' ever proposed by science) in a collection that has an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic capacity to deliver observation (the one thing totally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unexplained by science) and to recognise in that STUFF what the property
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delivering observation actually is. This sounds weird but it's quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practical and invaldates no existence science at all. Existing science can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be used to validate all such propositions for STUFF. It's what I am set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about to do - make a conscious chip - and prove it is conscious (has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualia happeneing in it) - by making it (actually several of them all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connected to each other) do science and get it right.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Science hasn't even begun to do this an any structured, explicit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fashion...which is a shame, for it causes all the circularity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So in order to tell you the answer to your question I have to tell you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what the universe is made of. And the answer consistent with brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; material's ability to deliver observation is simple: the fluctuation. End
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of story. Except you need a whole pile of them (largely but not perfectly)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; synchronised.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can never tell you &quot;it's X,Y,Z contents of consciousness-based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generalisation&quot; that delivers the contents of consiousness&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The circularity (dare I say symmetry!) argument is broken by breaking our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemology into 2 distinct halves, each valid depictions of the natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world. One half (a) scientifically says what it is made of and the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; half (b) scientifically says how it will appear when you are made of it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inside it _because_ it is made of (a) stuff.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am doing (b). I can't use sense objects like cells and molecules and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atoms to explain it because it is meaningless to do so. I can tell you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the delivery of sense impressions (qualia) is definitely as a result
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of specific bahaviours related to what we observe as neural cell firing,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but not entirely so. The model also scientifically says why your big toe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has no qualia and what a rock or a computer (current architectures) does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The boundary of the underlying natural world/universe and how it appears
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is literally in brain material. It's the only 'real' we can claim to have.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ignoring it as evidence of the underlying universe is just plain dumb.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Down the track we're all going to say &quot;geeze what WERE we thinking all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those centuries!!&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My formula for machine consciousness validation stands as a valid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientifically testable proposition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The real test will happen within 5 years - a nest of tiny little benchtop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; artificial scientists in the form of chips with a novel architecture -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that will scientifically demonstrate science to us and therefore be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; justifyably the possessors of qualia. Upon failure of the test the 'STUFF'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have chosen must be the wrong STUFF and that will be scientifically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refuted. In any event real science will be done.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gotta go.
