</em><br />
<br />Maudlin's Olympia shows that a computation can be realized with zero  
<br />
*computational* physical activity, and this means that if we keep  
<br />
associating the consciousness to the computation, the physical  
<br />
activity has no role there.
<br />
MGA shows that if we associate consciousness to the physical activity  
<br />
implementing a computation, then we have to associate that  
<br />
consciousness &quot;in real time&quot; to a description of that computation,  
<br />
which can be seen as absurd in different ways.
<br />
We can come back on this, but I think it is better I explain what  
<br />
mathematician means by computations.
<br />
<br />MGA and MGA-like argument can be seen as an extension of what is done  
<br />
in UDA1-6. It shows that a universal machine cannot see the difference  
<br />
between &quot;real&quot;, &quot;virtual&quot; and then &quot;arithmetical&quot;. But like the notion  
<br />
of virtual emulation has to be grasped for the step 6, the notion of  
<br />
arithmetical computation has to be grasped before, and that is why I  
<br />
am explaining the mathematician definition of universal machine and  
<br />
its computations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is an absurd conclusion, so the hypothesis that motivates it -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; i.e. CTM+PM - is thus shown to be contradictory and must be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; abandoned,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not merely in this case, but in general: i.e. the exception has  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; broken
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the rule.  This is forced unless you can show where the logic goes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, even if the conclusion is wrong that only shows that *some* step  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the argument is wrong NOT that the conjunction of the computationalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory of mind and primary matter is self contradictory.
</em><br />
<br />You can say this for any proof by reduction ad absurdo. But if someone  
<br />
pretend having done a reduction of absurdo of A+B, that is, pretend to  
<br />
have provide a proof, or argument, that A+B -&gt; false, then if you  
<br />
disagree that this leads to ~(A+B), you have to *find* at which step  
<br />
the error is. That's the very idea of proving. Of course in a  
<br />
difficult &quot;applied&quot; subject, you can always find some loophole of the  
<br />
kind &quot;invisible horses driving cars&quot;, and it is a matter of pedagogy  
<br />
to explains things spirit, instead of big set of formalities capable  
<br />
of satisfying everyone in the first strike.
<br />
In the present case, you can always develop a sufficiently ridiculous  
<br />
notion of matter and physical computation to block the proof, but it  
<br />
should be clear that a strong change of the meaning of the hypothesis  
<br />
is done.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I don't even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see where the argument uses PM to reach its conclusion.
</em><br />
<br />Note that &quot;PM&quot; is used in all UDA1-7, and at that stage, you can still  
<br />
argue that the supposedly existing physical universe is too little to  
<br />
run a big part of the UD, (but we have already the result that comp  
<br />
entails indeterminacy and non-locality). The step 08 just shows that  
<br />
the move toward a &quot;little physical universe&quot; does not really work, in  
<br />
the sense that the physical supervenience thesis, in the comp frame,  
<br />
entails that we can show the physical activity non relevant with  
<br />
respect to the computation. You have to believe that consciousness &quot;in  
<br />
real time&quot; is related to static description of such computation, which  
<br />
is perhaps not contradictory, but is non sensical. You can no more say  
<br />
yes to the doctor 'qua computatio'.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe CTM+UD is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a simpler explanation of the world, a return to Platonic idealism,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't see that its contrary is contrdictory.
</em><br />
<br />It is contradictory with the idea that consciousness is related to  
<br />
both the computation and the physical activity, in the PM sense of  
<br />
physical activity. A movie of a brain become conscious qua computation  
<br />
and without computation. It is not a mathematical contradiction, but a  
<br />
conceptual difficulty preventing saying &quot;yes to the doctor&quot; by  
<br />
appealing to the notion of computation. Like invisible horses pulling  
<br />
cars could throw doubt to the thermodynamical explanation of car  
<br />
motor. As I have always said, MGA does not eliminate completely some  
<br />
use of Occam; it minimizes it, but, like always in applied math, you  
<br />
can imagine a sufficiently bizarre notion of physical computation to  
<br />
stuck the logic of the applied proof, a bit like your own move of  
<br />
associating your consciousness to a non computable physical object  
<br />
outside your brain. But with the generalized brain, this is taking  
<br />
into account. If your consciousness, to exist, needs that uncomputable  
<br />
object, you are no more in the comp frame.
<br />
It is like the collapse of the wave packet. It shows that the many- 
<br />
worlds does not follow logically from the SWE, and the collapse is so  
<br />
badly defined, that you can hardy evacuate it (like the God-of-the-gap  
<br />
in physics), yet, I do think that the many-words follows directly from  
<br />
the SWE, because the collapse is just that, an ad hoc construction,  
<br />
undefinable in the theory, introduced to keep the consequence under  
<br />
the rug.
