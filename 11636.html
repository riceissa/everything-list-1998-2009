<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of continuity of consciousness. The OM t1t2 is exactly the same in each case, and falls

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we're in agreement, Stathis, but I'm trying to focus on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem, and what I think is a non-trivial aspect of evolved brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functionality that would be required to overcome it. Of course, I agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with you that each aspect of the experience '.....falls perfectly into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; position in each case by virtue of its content alone' - it's precisely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what I've been arguing.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think that is a necessary or obvious truth. If there
<br />
is an external time parameter, it might be possible to
<br />
return to the same state of mind (or the universe)
<br />
at different points in time, just as it is possible to
<br />
for identical duplicates to exist simultaneously at different
<br />
points in space).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But there's a subtler point here also, I think,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that leads to the problem. Let's take the 'cat sat on the mat': now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'cat' starts at t1 and 'mat' ends at t2. Let's subdivide t1t2 into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occasions o1-o1000, and let teleportation occur between each. Each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occasion o1-o1000 is as informationally closed
</em><br />
<br />What does &quot;informationally closed&quot; mean?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; as OMt1t2 (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'teleportation' is of course inserted precisely to make this point),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but now it has become implausible to believe that any individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occasion, say o492, is of sufficient extent to recover any coherent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; component whatsoever of the conscious thought 'the cat sat on the mat'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And yet, we know that we *are* in fact able to routinely recover such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; components, corresponding loosely to a 'specious present' of some 1.5
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seconds extent.
</em><br />
<br />Errmm.. if by &quot;recover&quot; we are able to replay them as
<br />
conscious (re)experiences. The memory-trace need
<br />
only contain time-stamps indicating the order
<br />
and timing of the contents of the experience. The
<br />
total structure of time-stamped-stored-experience
<br />
can co-exist simultaneously, just as a the frames
<br />
of a movie stored on a shelf co-exist simultaneously.
<br />
<br />The stored experience is not conscious in itself
<br />
any more than the stored movie involves any (ilusion of) motion.
<br />
<br />In both cases, that comes in with the recovery.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now comes the problem: how do we account for our manifest ability to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this without invoking some form of illicit 'continuity' between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; informationally separated occasions of arbitrarily fine granularity? No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual occasion apparently contains all the necessary information,
</em><br />
<br />That all depends on what you mean by &quot;individual occasion&quot;.
<br />
In physics that a purely 3d (0 time-dimensional)
<br />
doesn't contain enough information to recover
<br />
standard dynamics, and instead a kind of &quot;specious present&quot;
<br />
known as &quot;instantaneous velocity&quot; is used -- i.e.
<br />
the snapshot is of an infinitessimal slice, not a 0-width slice.
<br />
(Barbour's Machianism keeps the 0-slices and does without
<br />
some features of standard dynamics).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it seems that we almost can't stop ourselves imaginatively invoking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some sort of continuity over multiple occasions, in order that coherent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences can somehow be recovered by summing over the sequence.
</em><br />
<br />Hmmm. Well, sequence per se doesn't require continuity.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think, if true, this would be a real problem in reconciling our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience with the facts, and I think therefore that it requires a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real solution (actually an aspect of Barbour's time capsule theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which I'm extrapolating a bit further). Simply, if what I'm arguing is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; valid, it must follow that my assumption about individual occasions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'not containing the necessary information' *must be wrong*.
</em><br />
<br />Soo...what you are saying is that experiences of
<br />
(seemingly) continuous processes are incompatible with
<br />
&quot;presentism&quot;, the idea that everything must be recovered
<br />
from a 0-width (temporally) slice. Well, maybe,
<br />
but not even physics goes in for presentism in exactly *that* sense.
<br />
<br />(I think this is relevant to Maudlin. I don't
<br />
think the physical &quot;activity&quot; of a system can be
<br />
separated from its latent casual dispositions).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently, sufficient information to recover 'speciously present'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamic experiences *must* in fact be *simultaneously* represented by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the brain - be present on one occasion - and that this simultaneous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'dynamic' presentation must be the engine that renders both the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duration and the dynamism of the experience. And, to complete the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (evolutionary) circularity, this would be precisely *why* the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would possess this capability - because without it, extended, dynamic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environmental presentations would simply be *unavailable* to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organism.
