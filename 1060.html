<br />
I'd like to expose some arguments against computationalism - mainly
<br />
elaborated through the various discussions on this list, many thanks to all
<br />
contributors!
<br />
I think we should distinguish between two forms of computationalism, which
<br />
are unfortunately often confused in many discussions:
<br />
<br />comp1 : the brain is an EXACT implementation of some digital computation
<br />
equivalent to a TM. The running of this computation on any equivalent TM
<br />
would produce exactly the same output.
<br />
In other words, we are just running a very complicated digital program
<br />
(much like Word but still more complicated!) that could run on any platform
<br />
(complicated enough). Like our ordinary computers, the implementation must
<br />
be independant of the material structure of the platform, and thus the
<br />
information must lie at a (much) higher level than the molecular one, most
<br />
probably at the level of a neuron state, just like the bits of a computer.
<br />
<br />I think we will all agree that the experimental facts from neurobiology are
<br />
enough to conclude that comp1 is FALSE, because a neuron state can not be
<br />
defined in a discrete, deterministic way. The firing pattern depends also
<br />
on many analogic quantities (temperature, concentration of various
<br />
neurotransmettors,  possible drugs) and has a strong probabilistic
<br />
(pseudo-random) behaviour.
<br />
<br />Most of you seem to conclude : &quot;ok, no problem. We know that all these
<br />
analogic parameters can be modelized by deterministic equations; it's
<br />
enough to implement the solution of these equations to produce the same
<br />
output as the brain, and THUS consciousness, and that's it.&quot;.
<br />
Most of the (if not all) devices dicussed as &quot;artificial conscious
<br />
machines&quot;,(including Bruno's &quot;crackpot&quot; dreaming machine) are based on this
<br />
assumption.  As the brain is in fact interacting with the outer world (a
<br />
point that would deserve more discussions : I think that even dreams or
<br />
hallucinations would not be possible if the brain had NEVER interacted with
<br />
its environment), you soon realize that the equations must take into
<br />
account the whole Universe, a la Schmidhuber. To recall last Tegmark's
<br />
quote:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Let us imagine a hypothetical Universe much larger than our own,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   which contains a computer so powerful that it can simulate the time-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   evolution of our entire Universe.  BY HYPOTHESIS (*I emphasize*), the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;humans in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   simulated world would perceive their world as being as real as we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   perceive ours, so by definition, the simulated universe would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   PE [physical existence].
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So you are led to another hypothesis, that I will call comp2, which is in
<br />
fact Bruno's &quot;comp&quot; postulate.
<br />
<br />comp2 : all the physical world is EXACTLY equivalent to some computation of
<br />
its analogic properties at a finite level .
<br />
<br />As Bruno shows it magnificently, comp2 leads inevitably to the actual
<br />
disappearance of the physical world, replaced by a world of computations.
<br />
<br />However, I want to stress here that comp2 is indeed a huge jump: in fact it
<br />
does not COMPLEMENT but rather CONTRADICT comp1; it is the source of all
<br />
paradoxes and worst, it it completely useless to understand the origin of
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
<br />comp2 contradicts comp1 because the essence of comp1 is the independance of
<br />
the results with respect to the material implementation, whereas comp2
<br />
requires the precize definition of this implementation (of course the
<br />
simulation made in comp2 could be runned on any TM, but the object of the
<br />
simulation must be one precise physical system).
<br />
<br />One of the problem is to find the actual level at which this simulation
<br />
should be made. As I already stressed, the physical laws we are using do
<br />
not describe the REALITY, but only our REPRESENTATION of it. Although it is
<br />
plausible that there is SOMETHING objective, we have no idea what this
<br />
could be (&quot;das Ding an sich following Kant). So which representation to
<br />
choose ? The chemical description ? The QM state ? String theory  ?(with
<br />
the supplementary difficulty that beyond the QM level, no measurement of
<br />
the Q-state is possible). You could try to accept any level giving an
<br />
acceptable output, but then isn't Hans right when he assumes that even
<br />
Teddy bears and movies characters have &quot;acceptable enough&quot; outputs to be
<br />
considered as conscious?
<br />
Note that this first difficulty did not exist with comp1, but we are facing
<br />
it inevitably with comp2.
<br />
<br />Assume you have solved this difficulty, either by finding a known (e.g.
<br />
electro/chemical) level at which the brain evolution IS predictible, or by
<br />
finding a (subquantum) TOE reproducing exactly all know features of the
<br />
Universe. You may hope to describe your brain at this level and calculate
<br />
its evolution. You may think (with comp2) that a TM calculating the state
<br />
of your brain would actually be conscious LIKE YOU.
<br />
I will not recall all paradoxes associated with this hypothesis (for
<br />
example Olympia/Karas paradox) But taking again just the chinese room
<br />
example, let think of the case where your brain would be actually simulated
<br />
not by a machine but BY SOMEBODY ELSE ? Who or what would feel your
<br />
consciousness ? You could imagine a situation where the entirely state of
<br />
your brain at some instant is stored in a huge library, and somebody (for
<br />
example me) is put in charge to calculate its evolution (for example
<br />
applying id\psi/dt = H \psi to a quantum state). What do I have to do for
<br />
this device to actually think (like you, not me) ? Must I write the output
<br />
of my calculation somewhere? with a pen? on a magnetic tape? what if I read
<br />
a stored file of a previous calculation ? And if it is read by somebody
<br />
else that does not know what it represents? Please tell me ! I am paid for
<br />
this job and I don't want to be fired!
<br />
Of course I just point out again the contradictions between comp2 and
<br />
physical supervenience, but abandonning Phys-sup does not solve the first
<br />
point. It makes it still worse because abandoning the idea of physical
<br />
reality (Marchal) means also the impossibility of linking a computation
<br />
with a physical state, which is the starting point of comp2 and
<br />
Tegmark-Schmidhuber and co..theory!!!
<br />
<br />A third and last difficulty is that comp2 does not solve the problem of
<br />
consciousness. For if everything is assimilable to computations, what makes
<br />
some computations or parts of computations conscious or not (see Wei)? So
<br />
how to found Bruno's &quot;computational psychology&quot; ? What is the dream of a
<br />
string? Complexity is not enough, because for example the chemical
<br />
evolution of a thinking brain is not more complex to that of a dead brain
<br />
leading to putrefaction. At the analogic level of comp2, you have lost the
<br />
information level of comp1 ! I agree that the problem is the same with
<br />
materialism - I just point out that it is not easier with comp2.
<br />
<br />So I think that pure computationalism, either comp1 or comp2, is very hard
<br />
to maintain. Another comp3 proposition?
<br />
<br />One remark is that all &quot;thinking&quot; devices based on digital simulations of
<br />
the analogic state of the brain handle in fact much more (and too much)
<br />
information than the brain itself, which is totally unaware of its own
<br />
material structure. A very important fact is that they ALL require an
<br />
external structure able to store the relevant information and program them
<br />
adequately, which is NOT the case of actual brains (and I guess of possible
<br />
future thinking machines).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;So my guess is that consciousness requires not only a proper handling of
<br />
information, but that this handling must be a natural consequence of
<br />
physical evolution without ANY interaction with an external storage of
<br />
information about its own structure, even for its construction. This would
<br />
insure the proper handling of counterfactuals which is in fact nothing else
<br />
than the self-construction of consciousness. This is NOT to be taken as a
<br />
formal definition of consciousness but only a possible restriction to get
<br />
an actually conscious device. It would not be pure computationalism because
<br />
it would put restrictions on the kind of implementations it requires.
<br />
<br />Comments?
