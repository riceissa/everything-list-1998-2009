<br /><br />I think there is a &quot;definite (but necessarily partial) &quot; mathematical 
<br />
answer once we assume the comp hyp. It seems to me that the UD argument 
<br />
explains informally what shape this &quot;mathematical answer&quot; could have: a 
<br />
measure problem. Now I am not sure I understand why you don't see it. 
<br />
This is because I can infer by most of your posts that you handle well 
<br />
the relevant thought experiments. You certainly convince me I should 
<br />
explain more about the UDA in the roadmap-summary, before explaining 
<br />
the lobian interview.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or would you go the reductionist route
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of starting with basic physical laws, on which chemistry, biology, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychology
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc. are built, the more basic sciences supporting the less basic?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Except that the UDA is supposed to help to understand that the 
<br />
basic-ness of science could be the other way round: psychology/theology 
<br />
being more fundamental than physics. I hope I will be clear on that.
<br />
I have put a first version of the &quot;roadmap&quot; in the trash, because it 
<br />
was too long and at the same time it was not even addressing some 
<br />
difficulties which I am guessing many people have through your post. It 
<br />
is hard because I try to write a short text, and simultaneously I try 
<br />
to anticipate the sort of objections I find reasonable through my 
<br />
reading of the current many posts on the notion of persons.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I know it looks counterintuitive, but an AI can know which computer is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; running and how many they are. It is a consequence of comp, and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; UDA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; shows why. The answer is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the computer which is running are the relative universal number which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exist in arithmetical platonia (arithmetical truth is already a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal video game, if you want, and it is the simplest). How many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are they? 2^aleph_zero.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I have already explain it here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg05272.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg05272.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is a key point and we can come back on it if you have some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; difficulties.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well now I'm confused! I thought the whole point of the earlier part 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the UDA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as discussed in the cited post (and many others of yours) is that you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *can't*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know the details of your implementation, such as what type of computer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being run on, how fast it is running, if there are arbitrary delays in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the program,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and so on. Are you now saying that if I am being run on the 3rd of 100 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PC's in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the basement of the local university computer science department, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is keeping this a secret from me, there is a way I can figure out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what's going on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all by myself?!
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Did you read my old post to Brett Hall:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg05272.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg05272.html</a>
</em><br />
Perhaps you could comment it and tell me what does not convince you. It 
<br />
is indeed correct that the earlier parts of the UD Argument show that a 
<br />
machine cannot know about comp-delays, or about the real/virtual nature 
<br />
of a computer which would support the machine's computation until ... 
<br />
you realize that for exactly those reasons the machine first person 
<br />
expectations can only be computed (exactly and in principle) through a 
<br />
measure on all possible computations (reducing physics to searching 
<br />
such a measure). But then the first person can no more be associated 
<br />
with *any* particular computations. Read the Brett Hall post where I 
<br />
explain more, again in a &quot;steppy&quot; fashion (but the point is different 
<br />
from the UDA).
<br />
To sum up that point:
<br />
1) comp shows we cannot know which computations supported us.
<br />
2) digging deeper in comp, this means eventually we are supported by 
<br />
*all* (relative) computations (relative to some actual state; the 
<br />
&quot;actuality&quot; itself is handled in the traditional indexical way, and 
<br />
eventually &quot;indexicality&quot; is treated through the logic of 
<br />
self-reference (G and G*).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I think what you mean by &quot;relative probabilities&quot; is that if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; there were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; several possible versions of &quot;me next moment&quot;, then I would be more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to experience the one with higher measure. It is only relative to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; possibilities that measure makes a subjective difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Ah but you get the point now!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, as long as this *relative* measure does not come into play, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absolute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure makes no difference?
</em><br />
<br /><br />But physics arise (or should arise, with the comp hyp.) from the 
<br />
*relative* measure, and physics will be what makes possible for 
<br />
consciousness to be able to manifest itself. George asked me to explain 
<br />
this like if I was talking to some grandmother, but it is tricky to do 
<br />
that. The reason is that either what I say is understandable, but then 
<br />
it is unbelievable. And that is why I have never published the UDA 
<br />
alone, I always publish the UDA  together with its arithmetical 
<br />
translation. The reason is that only the math translation can help to 
<br />
understand how this &quot;paradox&quot; is resolved by distinguishing truth and 
<br />
provability, but also provability and true-provability, etc.
<br />
<br />Another difficulty with the UDA is that the consequences contradicts 
<br />
some supplementary hypotheses which start the reasoning. Those 
<br />
supplementary hypotheses are implicit in the 8-step version and 
<br />
explicit in the longer 15-step version (which explains then how those 
<br />
supplementary hypotheses are eliminated). For a logician this is not so 
<br />
difficult: the formula &quot;(~p -&gt; p)&quot; is not a contradiction: proving it 
<br />
gave just a proof of ~p, which explains why I don't need to go through 
<br />
those supplementary hypotheses at all, except, well, that non logician 
<br />
eventually discovered them, and feel then something is wrong ... 
<br />
Perhaps it is related to your difficulties, in which case I take the 
<br />
opportunity of Peter D. Jones' post who kindly recall the 15-steps 
<br />
version of the UDA to suggest to read it, perhaps that could help.
<br />
<br />I hope this does not discourage you. Obviously we are tackling very 
<br />
difficult questions. And I am still searching some better pedagogy 
<br />
(besides I can be wrong too of course).
