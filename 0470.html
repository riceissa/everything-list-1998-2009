I just rediscovered this mail from Hal that I forgot to read carefully!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;We also need to simulate the brain's input.  This is pretty hard since we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;didn't want to simulate the universe that was going to give it the input.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What we need to do is to hard-wire the input which the brain will receive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;over that 70 year period.  Everything the brain will see, hear, touch,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;smell and taste over 70 years is going to be sitting in a table that our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;program will provide.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How much information is this?  How much &quot;bandwidth&quot; does the brain consume?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;TV is about 1E7 bits per second.  If we increase this by a factor of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;10 it would roughly account for our visual input (we don't see as much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as it seems like; only a small part of our visual field is seen in high
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;resolution).  That gives 1E8 bits per second for vision.  Vision is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;primary sense modality for humans, but let's multiply it by a factor of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;5 to account for the other senses (handwaving madly here!).  That gives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;5E8 bits per second of input, over all modalities, for the human brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Over 70 years, which is 2E9 seconds, that gives a total of 1E18 bits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of input.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This falls between the estimates above of brain information.  When we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;encode this information in a table so that we can present it to our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simulated brain, we have to add it as part of the size of the input.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The result is to narrow our bracket, and put it from about 1E18 to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2E27 bits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That is the information for this method of simulating an entire human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lifetime, without trying to actually simulate the universe which the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;human appears to live in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />it's ok, but a brain would work properly only if it can observe a
<br />
physically coherent input. So the problem is not the number of bits, but
<br />
how to choose them. I see only two solutions:
<br />
* interfacing the simulated brain with a real I/O interface (CCD,
<br />
microphons, and output devices because you expect the environment to react
<br />
to your own outputs).
<br />
* simulating the whole Universe as proposed below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Simulating a universe which evolves a brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We then ask how hard it would be to simulate a brain the old fashioned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way, by setting up a universe which uses the laws of physics that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observe, and running it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We face a problem right at the beginning, here.  Our universe appears
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to have a random component.  So we have some choices.  We can simulate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the universe as it appears, and include some mechanism in the program to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;make random selections as specified by quantum mechanical measurements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This mechanism could either be a software random number generator, or a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;table of random bits which would be used to make the random choices.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Or, we could adopt a many-worlds approach, and simulate the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state without collapse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In any case, the physics involved is probably pretty simple.  We don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have a full theory, but our best shots at it, the superstring and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;membrane theories that try to marry QM and relativity, really aren't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very complicated.  I'm sure you could capture their essence in a few
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;megabytes or even kilobytes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The initial conditions, as far as we can tell, are also simple.  Matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appears to have been quite uniformly distributed in the Big Bang.  This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bodes well for us, as it takes little information to specify a uniform
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distribution, at least if we don't care about the details.
</em><br />
<br />Sorry, I may have missed something? First the Universe must have been
<br />
slightly inhomogeneous to generate galaxies, stars, planets and so on.
<br />
However simple gaussian fluctuations are enough *at the beginning* The
<br />
problem is that the subsequent evolution makes its state more and more
<br />
complicated *at all scales*. To have a chance to see life appear, you most
<br />
describe at least from a DNA molecule to a galaxy (stars can form only
<br />
under precise conditions of the intersteller meium!), and may be even with
<br />
a higher dynamics. Our galaxy contains maybe 10^67 atoms, whose position
<br />
must be given with a uncertainty of 10-10 m in about 10^20 m (10 kpc). So
<br />
you are facing a requirement of at least 10^70 bits ! ( I estimated this
<br />
number to raise to 10^400 if you want to describe the observable Universe
<br />
up to the Planck scale....)
<br />
<br />Clearly it is impossible to store this information in any machine smaller
<br />
than our galaxy! It is BTW logically and physically impossible to simulate
<br />
a *real* Universe with a  machine embedded in this Universe! Nothing to say
<br />
about a many-worlds wavefunction...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A trivial counting program, once it counts up to about 1E39, will produce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a number which encodes the entire 1E39 bits of a human brain's state all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;through its lifetime.  And there we have it, a fully simulated brain,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;70 years of human lifetime in living color, produced by a program which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is about 1E2 bits long.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Accounting for the costs to localize the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We can apply Wei's approach, which is to count the size of the program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;needed to locate the brain, and add it to the size of the program that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;produces the output.  With the counting program, it will take 1E39 bits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to specify where in the output that brain is located.  Add that to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1E2 bits of the counting program and the overall cost is 1E39 bits, very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;high, making this program give a small contribution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the case of many-worlds, then, the challenge is to estimate how hard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it would be to locate a human-like brain, or even more, a specific human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brain, among the 1E100+ universes it has created.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To find a human brain, without asking for a specific one, should not be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that hard.  We could create a pattern or template which we would use to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;look for a match.  It could perhaps be a specification for a generic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brain, perhaps a young person's brain.  The program to search through the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multiverse and look for matches to this would be easy to write.
</em><br />
<br />Here again either you or I missed something. If you know how to write a
<br />
pattern specifying a brain, you have solved your problem. You don't have to
<br />
enumerate stupidly up to 10^39 to recognize a pattern you already know!
<br />
Conversely, if you don't know the pattern, it is useless to count (just as
<br />
to let a UD run!), because you will be unable to recognize (and to prove to
<br />
other people!) the existence of a &quot;living&quot; entity. The problem is entirely
<br />
how is this pattern like?
<br />
<br />I think that nobody answered me satisfactorily on the problem of
<br />
&quot;interpreting&quot; or recognizing&quot; a string. I could compare this problem to
<br />
gauge invariance in physics. It's well known that all physical theories
<br />
admit many equivalent representations or gauge transformations. However, to
<br />
represent &quot;physically&quot; something, they must contain quantities invariant
<br />
upon these transformations, that allow to recognize intrinsic features :
<br />
e.g. proper interval in general relativity, curvature of space-time and
<br />
more generally the action in any known theory.
<br />
You seem to admit as obvious that a computation or a string can represent,
<br />
or better *be* a physical state of the Universe. However when you think  of
<br />
a real way to connect them, it seems obvious that you have to precize a way
<br />
of doing that. If you want to describe the positions of all atoms, or the
<br />
values of a field, you have to precise the coding of real numbers and so
<br />
on. When Bruno says that the UD will solve Wheeler-DeWitt equation, it
<br />
assumes some coding that allows to recognize the solution in a string. I
<br />
may be wrong, but I don't see how you can definie intrinsic physical
<br />
quantities (like the curvature of the space time for example) independantly
<br />
on these representations (same problem with the &quot;matching pattern&quot; of Hal).
<br />
It means also that the same string can represent (under different coding
<br />
schemes) different, and even quite different Universes. So it cannot posses
<br />
intrinsically all physical properties, and for example the presence of
<br />
living beings. Maybe I am wrong and you know works proving the contrary?
<br />
