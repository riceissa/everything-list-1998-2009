Hi George, Hi Hal, Hi All,
<br />
<br />I take opportunity of a remark by Hal Ruhl for giving you 
<br />
the crux of my arithmetical UDA in a nutshell.

<br /><br />To say that p is consistent is the same as saying that -p is not 
<br />
provable.
<br />
Your critics on the usefulness of the notion of consistency is 
<br />
similar to the critics by Schmidhuber on the use of provability.
<br />
<br />You still seem to believe that there is a particular evolving formal
<br />
systems capable of generating &quot;our (perhaps splitting) universe&quot;. 
<br />
In particular you seem to believe that a pure third person description
<br />
of that evolving system is enough.
<br />
<br />No problem. Perhaps you are right.
<br />
<br />But in that case comp is false. And you will need some strong non 
<br />
computationalist hypothesis. And you take the risk of hiding the
<br />
mind-body problem in the process. (This follows from UDA and/or the
<br />
movie-graph argument or Maudlin's one).
<br />
<br />With comp you have no choice, for isolating the laws of physics,
<br />
other than to compute the measure on your computational (DU-accessible)
<br />
consistent continuations as seen by some &quot;first person point of view&quot;.
<br />
That is what the UDA argument explicitely shows, isn'it?
<br />
<br />Some universal prior can still play a role (perhaps). I am not saying
<br />
that your approach, or Schmidhuber one, is *completely* foolish. Just
<br />
strongly incomplete. A Universal prior can play a role in the 
<br />
explanation of some aspect of our mean cosmological history, I think.
<br />
<br />Let us just look at the shape of the space of &quot;probability 1 
<br />
proposition&quot; on the DU accessible computational extensions/continuations.
<br />
<br />A naive idea would be to try to define &quot;Prob(p) = 1&quot; by &quot;p is 
<br />
provable&quot; which I write []p, p arithmetical or simply p representable
<br />
in the language of a sound machine. 
<br />
(Recall a machine is sound iff it proves only true sentences. Of
<br />
course a sound machine is consistent).
<br />
<br />But Godel-Lob-Solovay have succeed in finding the complete modal
<br />
axiomatisation of the provable &quot;provability sentence&quot;, and even 
<br />
the true (but unprovable) provability sentence; respectively by 
<br />
the system G and G*.
<br />
<br />And G proves &lt;&gt;p -&gt; -[]&lt;&gt;p. In Kripke terms, that means that from
<br />
each transitory world you can access to a terminal world. The basic
<br />
modal axioms for probability, which is  []p -&gt; &lt;&gt;p is not verified.
<br />
The Kripke semantics for []p -&gt; &lt;&gt;p needs ideal frames: frames without
<br />
any terminal worlds!
<br />
<br />And also, the provability [] is typically third person propositions.
<br />
<br />So a less naive idea would be to define &quot;Prob(p) = 1&quot; by &quot;p is provable 
<br />
and p is true&quot;. We define a new box [o] whith [o]p = []p &amp; p.
<br />
<br />Of course the machine is sound, so for each arithmetical p we have that
<br />
[o]p &lt;-&gt; []p. But the machine cannot know that! G does not prove 
<br />
[o]p &lt;-&gt; []p. Only G* proves it! So the nuance remains and that move is
<br />
quite interesting. It lead us to a knowledge theory formalised by S4Grz.
<br />
The Kripke frame of that theory is antisymmetrical and S4Grz, it can be,
<br />
argued, gives a theory of subjective temporal knowledge very close to 
<br />
the time-consciousness theory of Brouwer. And S4Grz makes possible to
<br />
isolate an arithmetical interpretation of intuitionist logic.
<br />
<br />But there is no probability theory attach to S4Grz. And worse! If we limit
<br />
ourself to the verifiable (DU-accessible) arithmetical propositions, then
<br />
the box and the diamond collapse and we get ... propositional calculus!
<br />
(Actually the &quot;first person&quot; we get with S4Grz is so solipsistic that
<br />
it cannot understand even the beginning of the UDA argument).
<br />
<br />So we need a still less naive move. Actually that moves is the one quite
<br />
in the spirit of the everything list. The probability need to be taken on
<br />
the *consistent* extensions. Why not just ask, for having &quot;Prob(p) = 1&quot;,
<br />
that p is provable *and* consistent. By incompleteness that is quite 
<br />
different than taking just p true. We define a new box [&#x20ac;]p by []p &amp; &lt;&gt;p. 
<br />
We consider all and only the consistent extension (p DU-accessible). 
<br />
This is really what the UDA argument forces us to do for getting the 
<br />
physical.
<br />
Note that G* still proves that [&#x20ac;]p is equivalent with []p. But still the
<br />
machine cannot know it, so that the machine perspective is quite 
<br />
different.
<br />
<br />Now it can be shown that this last move gives a logic having both []p-&gt;p 
<br />
and p-&gt;[]&lt;&gt;p. That is G* proves [&#x20ac;]p -&gt;p and G* proves p-&gt;[&#x20ac;]&lt;&#x20ac;&gt;p, with 
<br />
p \Sigma_1 (DU-accessible).
<br />
This is nothing but LASE (the little abstract Schroedinger equation).
<br />
It can be shown indeed that modal system axiomatised by []p-&gt;p and p-&gt;[]&lt;&gt;p
<br />
gives modal description of (minimal) quantum logic.
<br />
<br />That is, not only we get probabilities, but we get quantum probabilities.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, in the process, we loose the necessitation rule. So we
<br />
cannot use directly the result in the litterature for isolating an 
<br />
arithmetical interpretation of quantum logic. Open problem remains.
<br />
<br />I conjecture (and I argue technically) that we get the quasi-orthomodular
<br />
laws, the violation of Bell inequalities, the existence of incompatible
<br />
propositions, etc.
<br />
<br />So you see Hal, perhaps provability and consistency are not interesting
<br />
but now, you should realise that the incompleteness phenomena (as captured
<br />
by G and G*) force us to realise the non triviality of the conjonction
<br />
of provability and consistency. Applied to the UD-accessible propositions,
<br />
it gives us a sort of quantum probabilities, and this happens exactly where 
<br />
we expect a phenomenological account of the structure of the set of 
<br />
physical propositions (according to the UDA argument).
<br />
<br />If you define the quantization of p by [&#x20ac;]&lt;&#x20ac;&gt;p, like Rawling and 
<br />
Selesnick (Journal of the ACM, vol.47, 2000, page 737) then you get 
<br />
an arithmetical representation of quantum computing circuit.
<br />
<br />The difference between what does G* say, and what does G say, gives 
<br />
a mean to distinguish between the &quot;physical propositions&quot; which have 
<br />
probability one
<br />
and are communicable and those which have probability one and are not 
<br />
communicable. That is close to the difference between experiment
<br />
and experience.
<br />
<br />To sum up and putting the things in a more simple way, just remember
<br />
that the UDA shows that comp makes physics a branch of psychology, and
<br />
the simplest psychology of the ideally sound machine is just its
<br />
provability (consistency) logics including the intensional variants
<br />
(the new boxes) which are quite nuanced thanks to the incompleteness
<br />
phenomena. 
<br />
The machine cannot prove it has any consistent extension (by Godel'second
<br />
incompleteness theorem), but the machine can prove
<br />
that the logical structure of those consistent extension (if that exists)
<br />
is described by a quantum-sort of ortholattice.
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br />PS Now I have read Ziegler page on quantum logic. It is very good
<br />
and Ziegler explains the relation between quantum logic and quantum 
<br />
probability in a rather clear way. Only modal quantum logic is missing.
