<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ultimately match the &quot;laws of physics&quot; that we have discovered

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;empirically. One could accept points 1-8, but still remain agnostic about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whether or not the invariant actually does match the empirical laws of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics - that is, agnostic about whether or not comp is actually true. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Correct?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Correct.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The task of point 9 is to start showing mathematically what the invariant 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actually looks like. You make the tantalizing claim that the invariant 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actually looks like quantum physics, but for the moment I have to remain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;agnostic, because I don't know enough about the mathematics of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;provability, nor do I know enough about quantum physics. From your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspective, are your results strong enough to make you suspect that comp 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is true?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It makes me suspect indeed that comp is plausible, at least.
<br />
Actually that plausibility comes both for the 1-8 reasoning which forces
<br />
us to believe in some &quot;many world&quot;, so the fact that some physicists
<br />
begin to think seriously about the possibility of many-things is by itself
<br />
a sort of confirmation. Interviewing the machines should give more
<br />
quantitative information about the &quot;interference&quot; between the possibilities.
<br />
Here too I want to say I got a confirmation, but, as I will try to explain,
<br />
I got something weaker than quantum logic, and I am afraid only the future
<br />
will decide. The problem is that 1) physicists propose not *one* quantum logic,
<br />
but a labyrinth of QL (to quote van Fraassen), and my interview gives rise
<br />
also to different sorts of QL. But forget all that, I will really try to 
<br />
give (new)
<br />
flavors of the mathematical confirmation of comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;That would make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;a great part of quantum physics into physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;laws in the sense of comp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;It would be a pleasure to explain this with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;more details. Are you willing to hear a little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;bit about Godel's theorem and some of its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;generalisation by Lob and Solovay?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am certainly willing to hear about it - I know more about Godel's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Theorem and the theory of computation than I do about quantum physics - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but I doubt I know enough to make much sense of your explanations, so it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;might be a waste of your time.
</em><br />
<br /><br />We will see. Don't hesitate to tell me you don't
<br />
understand, or that you are bored. Strictly speaking the
<br />
math are much more simple
<br />
than people imagine, at least for a passive understanding.
<br />
But you should be frustated at the end, because
<br />
we will arrive at my &quot;incompetence point&quot;, that is, a set
<br />
of open questions.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps all I can pick up right now is the flavor of your results. For 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instance, does your position entail that the &quot;weirdness&quot; of quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics is deeply connected to the &quot;weirdness&quot; of provability theory?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. The &quot;flavor&quot; is that eventually physics is equal to
<br />
a sort of &quot;integral on machine's self-ignorance&quot;, that is on
<br />
machine's incompleteness. But today I still don't have,
<br />
for example, a proof of something as simple as
<br />
the violation of Bell's inequality, although
<br />
I can argue it would be a miracle if they are not violated
<br />
(in the comp physics I mean) due to the high non booleanity
<br />
of the Arithmetical QL we obtain.
<br />
Don't worry, I will try NOT to give a 120h course in
<br />
mathematical logic which is just impossible without chalk &amp;
<br />
black board. But I will try to give some insights. I must think
<br />
how to do it. It will help me, btw, to prepare my talk in Paris
<br />
and Amsterdam so that any critics is welcome.
<br />
<br />Bruno
