<br />
The following discusses observer properties under my model of the Everything.
<br />
<br />I take the list of observer properties I discuss below from what I 
<br />
have so far found in Russell's &quot;Theory of Nothing&quot;.  One property - 
<br />
Giving meaning to data [number 5 on the list] - does not seem to be 
<br />
supportable under a description of the Everything as containing all 
<br />
information.
<br />
<br />As indicated in earlier posts, within my model of the Everything is a 
<br />
dynamic which consists of incomplete Nothings and Somethings that 
<br />
progress towards completeness in a step by step fashion.  At each 
<br />
step they grow more complete by encompassing more of the information 
<br />
in the Everything.
<br />
<br />The incompleteness is not just that of mathematical systems but is 
<br />
more general.  It is the inability to resolve any question that is 
<br />
meaningful to the particular Nothing or Something.  Some such 
<br />
questions may be of a sort that they must be resolved.  The one I 
<br />
focus on in this regard is the duration of the current boundary of 
<br />
the particular Nothing or Something with the Everything.
<br />
<br />A Something will of course be divisible into subsets of the 
<br />
information it contains.  Many of these subsets will participate in 
<br />
the incompleteness of the Something of which it is a subset.  At each 
<br />
step wise increase in the information content of that Something many 
<br />
of its subsets will receive information relevant to the resolution of 
<br />
their &quot;local&quot; un-resolvable meaningful questions.
<br />
<br />Resultant observer properties:
<br />
<br />1) Prediction of the future behavior of the Something of which they 
<br />
are a subset [of their particular universe]:
<br />
The subsets share some of the incompleteness of their Something and 
<br />
participate in the progressive resolution of this 
<br />
incompleteness.  The current &quot;local&quot; incompleteness [part of the 
<br />
current state of an observer] can serve as a predictor of the 
<br />
Something's evolution since it is a target of the progressive influx 
<br />
of information.
<br />
<br />2) Communication between subsets:
<br />
There is no requirement that the subsets be disjoint or have fixed 
<br />
intersections.  There are no restrictions on the number of copies of 
<br />
a given packet of information contained within in a Something and no 
<br />
restrictions on the copy function.  A Something containing any number 
<br />
of copies of part or all of itself is just as incomplete as if it 
<br />
contained just one copy.
<br />
<br />3) Evolution:
<br />
The progressive resolution of the incompleteness is an evolution.
<br />
<br />4) Developing filters [re: white rabbit density]:
<br />
The shifting incompleteness of a subset constitutes a shifting filter 
<br />
that is founded in the history of the dynamic for that Something.  [I 
<br />
mentioned white rabbits in this regard in another post.]
<br />
<br />5) Giving meaning to data [symbol strings][generation of information?]:
<br />
The Everything is considered information.    A symbol string seems to 
<br />
be just a link between the set of all possible meanings that 
<br />
particular string can have.   It is just a boundary within the 
<br />
Everything enclosing the associated set of meanings.  It is a 
<br />
definition, definitions are information [meaning] and thus part of 
<br />
the Everything.  How can an evolving Something and its subsets give 
<br />
more meaning to a meaning?  This property seems unsupportable in an Everything.
<br />
<br />6) Necessity of &quot;Time&quot;:
<br />
As I mentioned in a earlier post the meaningful question I use 
<br />
bootstraps time and thus the dynamic.
<br />
<br />7) Life:
<br />
The characteristics of life [evolution, copy, variation] are just 
<br />
part of the ensemble of potential meaningful questions - some 
<br />
un-resolvable - that can apply to some subsets of a Something and 
<br />
seem covered by the other discussions herein.
<br />
<br />8) Randomness:
<br />
Each step in the progression towards completeness provides a 
<br />
resolution to a random set of the open meaningful questions.
<br />
<br />9) Self awareness, consciousness:
<br />
The Something subset boundary dynamics/allowances described above 
<br />
appear to cover these varieties of subset evolution.
<br />
<br />10 Creativity:
<br />
See #8 - randomness.
<br />
<br />Subsets of evolving Somethings in my model appear to have the 
<br />
properties of observers mentioned above that also seem supportable by 
<br />
an Everything - all but giving meaning to data.
<br />
<br />There is so far no subset based spontaneous influence on the 
<br />
progression of the dynamic.  All aspects of the information dynamic 
<br />
appear to originate from the history of the dynamic for a particular 
<br />
Something and its resultant current incompleteness.
