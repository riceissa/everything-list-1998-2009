<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My Searlean objection to the above brand of functionalism

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is, How can computation as such be sufficient to generate consciousness,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;when it obviously isn't an intrinsic process of any physical system?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;To clarify:  There is a distinction between intrinsic and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;observer-relative features of reality.  The former include all properties  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that are logically independent of the intentional attributions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;observers, such as the molecular structure of the object I am sitting on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The latter are properties that exist only relative to such attributions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;such as being a chair.  The problem here is that computation, to quote
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Searle, is &quot;not a machine process that like neuron firing or internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;combustion;  rather, computation is an abstract mathematic process that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;exists only relative to conscious observers and interpreters&quot;  (*The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Mystery of Consciousness*, 17).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure that the distinction between intrinsic and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-relative is not itself observer-relative. 
</em><br />
<br />I don't see how the distinction can _itself_ be observer-relative?
<br />
Let Observer Independence (OI) and Observer Relativity (OR) be
<br />
higher order properties of any property P of any substrate s. Then surely,
<br />
(-(p&amp;-p)) --&gt; (s(P)(OI)), for s(P) = OI/OR?  I.e, it can
<br />
hardly be in the eye of the beholder whether any given feature of the
<br />
world is in the eye of the beholder or not.  For instance, in a solipsist
<br />
world W, the fact of solipsism is an intrinsic (=OI) fact about W.  This
<br />
does not preclude that observer-relativity is a recursice property, of
<br />
course.  For example, semantics may be an OR feature of syntax, which is
<br />
itself an OR feature of the physical world.    
<br />
<br /><br />Do you mean that the correct *application* of this distinction is itself
<br />
observer-relative for some P,  where this observer-relativity is somehow
<br />
comparable to e.g. the relativity of simultaneity in Relativity theory?
<br />
Not that I really understand how this analogy might be possible.  But then
<br />
I make no claim to understand your metaphysics, which to me (a diehard
<br />
external realist) appears exotic in an interesting way.  Shall take a
<br />
look on your thesis soon.
<br />
<br /><br />Second thought:  Just possibly we need to distinguish the case of
<br />
(i) [s = reality as a whole] from (ii) those of [s = any element of
<br />
reality], so that for (ii) but not (i) it is in some sense OR whether s(P)
<br />
is OR or OI.  But I have no clear idea of what exactly this sense might
<br />
be.  This deserves some hard thought (*damn*).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You take &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecular structure&quot; as intrinsic and I will tell you below why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't. It seems you take the notion of &quot;physical things&quot; as granted,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I don't. 
</em><br />
<br />Right.  My point here is that even you must assume _some_ intrisic
<br />
features of reality.  The metaphysical bucket must stop somewhere. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But even if there were intrinsic features of physical reality, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hard for me to understand how consciousness would rely on it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What in the brain/body/universe do you think to be intrinsically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary for consciousness ?  Sodium ions? Carbon atoms? Quark?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quantum phenomena in microtubules?
</em><br />
<br />To the naturalist, this is a poorly understood empirical question:  The
<br />
inclusive disjunction of causal requirements simply isn't known by any
<br />
member of this species (and will probably never be, because of the limited
<br />
light cone).  All we know at present is that certain sorts of
<br />
electrochemical pulses in certain sorts of carbonbased neural tissue are
<br />
jointly sufficient for certain sorts of consciousness.  As I see it, the
<br />
case for the computationalist hypothesis is weaker then the case for, say,
<br />
the possibility of zero point propulsion, which seems at least predicted
<br />
by QM.  I.e.,  it makes good SciFi, which is no mean thing.  (It can't be
<br />
said about the microtubule speculations, for example).        
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Searle's comparison between aware-thinking and photosynthesis is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really a philosophical category mistake, I think).
</em><br />
<br />Yeah, so it would presumably seem to a computationalist;  but can it be
<br />
shown to be so on logical grounds?   
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Computation and all other syntax is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;observer-relative, and in one sense exists only from a 1. person point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computation has almost nothing to do with syntax, and is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-relative, at all.  To my knowledge it is even the less
</em><br />
&quot;observer-relative&quot; thing I can think about. 
<br />
<br />(1)  On syntax vs. computation:  Maybe I have been vague here:  By
<br />
'syntax' I meant not merely linguistic grammar but 
<br />
any manipulation of symbols according to a set of well-defined
<br />
procedures specifying legal and illegal operations.  But don't let us be   
<br />
bogged down in any terminological dispute:  I'll avoid the term hereafter.
<br />
<br /><br />(2)  On the observer-relativity of computation:  When a brain computes
<br />
some function or other, that process is observer-independent as
<br />
it does not depend on how anything _outside_ that physical system treats
<br />
or interprets it.  But if one somehow uses an electronic device, the
<br />
surface of a soap-bubble, or an elephants' trunk to the same end, then
<br />
there is only a brute physical process unless a computational
<br />
interpretation is assigned to it by some transformation function.  This
<br />
OR, however, does not imply what Searle would call epistemic
<br />
subjectivity (ES):  The truth value of a computational result R is not
<br />
determined by individual attitudes to R.  More on mathematical epistemic
<br />
objectivity (EO) below.  
<br />
<br />How, then, does the _brain_ compute anything?  Clearly there is no
<br />
conscious interpretation of non-intentional neuronics?  I guess the brain 
<br />
simulates a subset of the relations between a subset of abstract patterns
<br />
by means of its symbolic capability:  It uses its unique physical 
<br />
ability to treat certain physical objects (inks on paper, wrinkles on an
<br />
elephant's trunk, or even mental pics) *as* something else (patterns and
<br />
metapatterns).  A special case of this special case of toolusing is what
<br />
computation boils down to for the naturalist, I suppose.     
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps you confuse a computation with your own possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretations of that computation? or with a possible concrete 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implementation of that computation.
</em><br />
<br />If so, I am absolutely unaware of that...  
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; First I *assume* computationnalist as a working hypothesis. I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; open to the idea that comp is false. Perhaps biological naturalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the correct approach, despite Searle!
</em><br />
<br />OK, one can't quarrel with that, and it's openminded to (almost surely
<br />
more than, e.g., John Searle).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By comp I mean: 1) the idea that there is a level of substitution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such that I survive with a functionnal and digital substitution made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at that level. Unlike so-called functionnalist I don't put any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restriction on the level. My 'brain' could be the whole quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multi-universe, my reasoning will still go through;
</em><br />
<br />OK
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) the classical Church thesis. This is very important because it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Church thesis which make computations intrinsical and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  syntax independent; 
</em><br />
<br />OK.  I don't quite see how the Church-Turing thesis can make computations 
<br />
_intrinsic_ to anything, as opposed to merely intertransformable.  In
<br />
general, I understand few of the grand claims made on behalf of this
<br />
thesis.  But then I'm pretty far away from home here.  
<br />
<br /><br />3) a minimal amount of arithmetical platonism. I 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guess this is maybe unnatural for a biological naturalist. It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nevertheless the simple idea that arithmetical truth is independant of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me. For exemple the idea that the statement &quot;there is an infinite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of primes&quot; is true independently of me.
</em><br />
<br />It is indeed, and that is not so unnatural.  As suggested above, math
<br />
objects must be seen as the class of possible patterns and relations
<br />
between those, some of which are physically implemented (or all, according
<br />
to the everything idea.)  I don't think we disagree here.  As to the
<br />
location of non-implemented abstract patterns:  I don't agonize so much
<br />
over this, but I guess it adds to the attraction of the everything idea.   
<br />
<br /><br />That will have to do for now.
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
