<br /><br />This is because I include in the first person its possible

compassion feeling for what are possible others. (This is 
<br />
similar to what Brent Meeker said in its last post).
<br />
Compassion, although it bears on others, is a feeling, isn't it?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I admit the decision theory approach I gave in the last post has problems,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some of which you've pointed out. But what's the alternative? I've been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thinking about this issue for several years, starting with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;expected-first-person-experiences approach (if you read the earlier
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;archives you'll see many posts from me on this).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I did. (and it is why I try to understand your evolution).
<br />
The very beginning of this discussion-list by you and Hal Finney has been
<br />
very attractive to me at the start. I still don't understand your shift.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;GTM means general Turing machine. It's defined in Jürgen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Schmidhuber's paper at <a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/</a>. Please read
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it if you haven't already.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I red it. I prefer its first paper, although its philosophical
<br />
conclusions contradict what I found interesting in it. We discussed that.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Wait, even in the infinite the ratios will not be the same in general. Why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do you think they will be?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not so easy question indeed. But here the methodology I use forces me
<br />
to define the measure by the AUDA logic Z1*. The &quot;infinite ratios&quot; will be
<br />
the same thanks (hopefully) to the non trivial constraints given by
<br />
computational self-reference. Remember that our first person expectations
<br />
rely on *all* our consistent (self)-extensions.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you read Schmidhuber's paper, you'll see that he offers several
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measures for consideration. He believes that the Speed Prior is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;correct objective measure,
</em><br />
<br /><br />This cannot be. The UDA shows our first person experiences cannot be
<br />
aware of delays taken by any universal (classical or quantum, but
<br />
immaterial) machine accessing our current states. Classical real time
<br />
is definitely an emerging phenomena from UD* (all execution of UD).
<br />
UDA predict that &quot;we&quot; are (perhaps) quick to be computed but our
<br />
neighborhoods must be necessary much slow to be computed. (In that
<br />
sense it predicts the computing power superiority of our neighborhood).
<br />
You can interpret my work as saying that IF we are made of bits then 
<br />
we are necessarily embedded in a qubit &quot;made&quot; reality.
<br />
I have made some recent progress in that direction. Normally Z1* should
<br />
be equivalent to some sort of generic quantum computer.
<br />
The incredible progress in that field could lead more quickly than
<br />
I expected to a refutation or confirmation of comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose you want to crack a bank's encryption key, which is worth $4
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;million to you, and there are two ways to do it. You can spend $2 million
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to build a quantum computer to crack the key, or you can spend $3 million
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to build a classical computer to do this. Now if you believe the Speed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Prior is the correct measure, then you'll think that the quantum computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will very likely fail, and therefore you should go with the classical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computer instead.But if you believe the Universal Prior is the correct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure, then you'll think that both computers will work and you'll go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with the quantum computer because it's cheaper.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, there's another way to think about this situation that doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;involve an objective measure. The fast-to-compute and the slow-to-compute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes both exist.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are taking the expression &quot;universe&quot; too literaly. The &quot;slow-to-
<br />
compute &quot;multiverse&quot; is equivalent to the sheaf of locally quick to
<br />
compute &quot;single computations&quot;, but we belong to the mutiverse: we belong
<br />
to all universes. Objective measure are useful for taking into account
<br />
the &quot;proportion&quot; of histories and this is what makes decision worthly
<br />
senseful.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(The fast-to-compute universes are the ones where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quantum computers fail.) So when you adopt the Speed Prior you're really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;saying &quot;I know the slow-to-compute universes exist (and my actions affect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what happens in them), but I just don't care very much about those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />But (sorry for repetition) the UDA forces us to take those slow
<br />
universe/computation into account. That's exactly the point of question 
<br />
7 in the conversation with Joel Dobrzelewski.
<br />
(links at <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html</a>, step
<br />
7 is at <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2992.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2992.html</a>).
<br />
You must care about those slow universe because their slowness
<br />
just comes from the fact that their multiply you in important
<br />
proportion. It is the very base of my proof that comp entails the quantum,
<br />
and why if we are bit-describable then those bit are qubit made.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To me the attraction of think about it the second way is that it allows us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to just say that all universes exist. We don't have to say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objectively one universe has a higher measure than another. What does that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mean anyway? If all universes exist, how is it that some universes have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more of an existence than others? We don't have to answer those questions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All &quot;relative universe/computation&quot; exists and are on the same
<br />
ontological footing, but we must bet on those which are more likely
<br />
to be apparent for ourself, which are the one which provide
<br />
relatively more numerous consistent extensions with respect to our 
<br />
current state. That's what can make our decisions purposefull, I think.
<br />
In Schmidhuber term we need a &quot;high multiplication&quot; prior, which
<br />
makes our neighborhood consistent expectation very slow to compute.
