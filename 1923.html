<br />
I thank Alastair Malcolm for his clear exposition of the multi-verse
<br />
explanation of why induction is reliable.  As a defense of induction however
<br />
I'm not sure it avoids vicious circularity.  Without the technical concepts of
<br />
bit strings and algorithmic complexity (which I did find helpful) I think the
<br />
argument is as follows:
<br />
<br />1. There is an ensemble consisting of every describable universe.  Descriptions
<br />
must be logically consistent, since otherwise they fail to describe.
<br />
<br />2. Some of these are described by a set of laws; by which is meant a
<br />
mathematically consistent set of statements and inference rules from which
<br />
everything about the universe follows.
<br />
<br />3. Some universes will include being like ourselves, i.e. somewhat aware of the
<br />
world and ourselves.
<br />
<br />4. Among those that contain sentient beings, almost all will be of the kind
<br />
describable by laws - this follows from what we think we know of physics,
<br />
evolution, the brain and the mind.
<br />
<br />5. Among those containing sentient beings and describable by laws, those
<br />
describable by laws without exceptions, i.e. with reliable induction, will
<br />
predominate.  Note that exceptions are not logically inconsistent with the
<br />
laws, they are just additional axioms that specify exceptions.
<br />
<br />But how does 5 follow?  Malcolm claims it follows because he considers
<br />
the desriptions as bit strings and for a fixed length (and hence a fixed number
<br />
of possible strings) he notes that those that contain a simple, i.e.
<br />
short, description plus other stuff consistent with that description will
<br />
outnumber those that contain the same short description plus other stuff that
<br />
describes exceptions.
<br />
<br />This is not clear to me.  Is the other stuff on the bit string allowed to be
<br />
just noise, i.e. not describing anything?  In that case I think the conclusion
<br />
follows.  But this seems to turn on a certain interpretation of the ensemble of
<br />
all describable universes; namely that a description can include stuff (bits?)
<br />
that don't describe.  If instead we say that descriptions do not contain extra
<br />
stuff that doesn't describe anything; then it seems that the extra bits, over
<br />
and above the simple law-like description, must contain either describe things
<br />
that are consistent with the law-like part or describe exceptions.  But then it
<br />
is no longer clear that the possible extra stuff that is consistent is more
<br />
numerous than the possible extra stuff that describes exceptions.  In fact it
<br />
seems to be the other way around.
<br />
<br />In any case our reason for supposing the world to be law like is already
<br />
because we believe in induction; not the other way around.  Hence in using what
<br />
we know of science and life, which is all based on induction, in step 4 we already introduce circularity into the argument.  But maybe not vicious circularity
<br />
- that's what makes it interesting.
