Joel:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do you realise now that not only we have a form of 1-indeterminacy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but we have also a sort of 1-nonlocality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, from the first-person point of view.  Though I would try to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;argue that the third-person point of view must always remain local.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Note: If you find that remark controversial, feel free to defer that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discussion until later.  For now, I would just like to follow your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;argument.
</em><br />
<br />Actually I agree with you: the third-person point of view must 
<br />
always remain local. I talk sometimes of 3-locality. Note that MWI
<br />
(Many World Interpretation of QM) is really the necessary move
<br />
to conserve QM and 3-locality (and 3-determinacy btw).
<br />
Experimental confirmation of the violations of Bell's inequality is
<br />
either a confirmation of our 3-non-locality or of the existence of 
<br />
parallel histories. Bell supposes implicitely that quantum 
<br />
experience have a unique outcome, but both with COMP or with SE 
<br />
(Schrodinger Eq.) we must accept the idea of the realisation 
<br />
of multiple outcomes.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And so do you agree that the way of quantifying 1-indeterminacy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is invariant if we substitute real environment by virtual one, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; if we mix them ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, this is fine by me.  As I've said, I also believe our immediate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world IS virtual.  In fact I'm not sure there is any difference 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between real and virtual.  In my mind, everything is real.  Or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;everything is virtual.  It doesn't matter.  But maybe this isn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the place to discuss that.  So please continue...
</em><br />
<br /><br />No need to discuss that, I still agree with you. I have introduced
<br />
the &quot;real physical world&quot; (a quite mythical construct) only for the
<br />
sake of the argument. In fact you have answered question 11 (and
<br />
probably more other) which are needed to explain why we don't need
<br />
to really concretely run the UD. Like most people in this list
<br />
it seems you have no problem with that so I skip those questions.
<br />
We can go back to that &quot;step 11&quot; another time, but for now I will
<br />
assume you agree &quot;everything is soft, and even arithmetical (in
<br />
the sense that the UD is naturally embedded in plato heaven
<br />
arithmetics.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do you agree that, in that case, for any experience/experiment 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you intend to do, here and now, to predict your immediate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; personal futur (this includes the result you see when observing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the needle), you must take into account (i.e. the domain of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1-indeterminacy is given by) all the virtual reconstitutions (and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the computational stories going through it) of yourself generated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; by the UD?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, this sounds reasonable.  I would agree: In general, it's not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible to predict one's future.  Anything is possible... so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nothng is probable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But we can still *hope* for certain futures. ;-)
</em><br />
<br />But don't we have a contradiction, or something like an empirical
<br />
contradiction here. I can certainly hope for certain futures, and
<br />
honestly I think (at least from past experience) that some are
<br />
more probable than others. For exemple I am now preparing some
<br />
coffee. I would have the feeling of lying to myself if I was 
<br />
telling you that I do not believe &quot;drinking&quot; coffee is probable.
<br />
So &quot;something&quot; is probable. So, if we maintain comp, we must
<br />
explain why, after I have done coffee, drinking coffee got an
<br />
higher degree of probability. We must aknowledge that physicalist
<br />
do have an explanation here. There is coffee, there is a material
<br />
machine preparing it, etc. 
<br />
<br />For the computationalist that simple explanation is not available.
<br />
For an explanation that &quot;preparing coffee&quot; augment the degree of
<br />
plausibility  (probability, credibility) of the experience of 
<br />
drinking coffee, the only way is to isolate, from pure arithmetics,
<br />
a measure on the consistent computational extensions of my preparing 
<br />
coffee-state-history and to show that in most of them (in a sense
<br />
which need to be define also purely arithmeticaly) I will be
<br />
drinking coffee. Slurp. (I'm definitely drinking coffee now!).
<br />
<br />Put in another way, we must derive the laws of physics from
<br />
computer science. And, through the role of the notion of 1-pov,
<br />
we must derive physical belief from coherent discourse by machines,
<br />
or more simply derive physics from (machine) psychology.
<br />
<br />Do you agree?
<br />
<br />(Actually I have pave the way for doing that derivation of physics
<br />
and I've got some (technical) result which I have explain to George
<br />
in this list, except that I still must answer some question. 
<br />
The basic idea is to substitute the grandmother psychology by the 
<br />
Godel-Lob logic of provability. You can look in the archive,
<br />
but it is rather technical).
<br />
<br /><br />If you follow me perhaps you can understand why, in case your
<br />
MUCA is *the* bottom, then we should not postulate that!!!
<br />
We should prove it, for exemple by showing that the measure
<br />
behave well only thanks to the infinite MUCAs' work generated
<br />
in arithmetics (or by any DUs, or in Numberland, as I like to 
<br />
say.
<br />
<br />If you really take the comp 1-indeterminisme seriously, perhaps
<br />
you can guess also why our very finiteness makes us confronting
<br />
some continuum, and some random oracle, ...
<br />
<br />Bruno
