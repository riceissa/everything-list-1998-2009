<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is another example which makes this point. You arrive before two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adjacent closed doors, A and B. You know that behind one door is a room 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; containing 1000 people, while behind the other door is a room containing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only 10 people, but you don't know which door is which. You toss a coin to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decide which door you will open (heads=A, tails=B), and then enter into the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding room. The room is dark, so you don't know which room you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now in until you turn on the light. At the point just before the light goes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on, do you have any reason to think you are more likely to be in one room 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather than the other? By analogy with the Bostrom traffic lane example you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could argue that, in the absence of any empirical data, you are much more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely to now be a member of the large population than the small population. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, this cannot be right, because you tossed a coin, and you are thus 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equally likely to find yourself in either room when the light goes on.
</em><br />
<br />Again the problem is that you are not a typical member of the room unless
<br />
the mechanism you used to choose a room was the same as what everyone
<br />
else did.  And your description is not consistent with that.
<br />
<br />Suppose we modify it so that you are handed a biased coin, a coin which
<br />
will come up heads or tails with 99% vs 1% probability.  You know about
<br />
the bias but you don't know which way the bias is.  You flip the coin
<br />
and walk into the room.  Now, I think you will agree that you have a
<br />
good reason to expect that when you turn on the light, you will be in
<br />
the more crowded room.  You are now a typical member of the room so the
<br />
same considerations that make one room more crowded make it more likely
<br />
that you are in that room.
<br />
<br />This illustrates another problem with the lane-changing example, which
<br />
is that the described mechanism for choosing lanes (choose at random)
<br />
is not typical.  Most people don't flip a coin to choose the lane they
<br />
will drive in.  Instead, they have an expectation of which lane they will
<br />
start in based on their long experience of driving in various conditions.
<br />
It's pretty hard to think of yourself as a typical driver given the wide
<br />
range of personality, age and experience among drivers on the road.
