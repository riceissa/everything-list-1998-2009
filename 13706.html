<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'converge' on a common or consistent environmental interface as a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; result of any form of co-evolution. Such a notion would seem to imply

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that equivalent selection effects could be operating on both

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; environments despite their orthogonal orientation. It is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; immediately apparent why this should be so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As far as I understand, this is *the* problem. It seems insoluble
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; untill you take into account explicitly the incompleteness phenomenon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which put high constraint of what sound machines can believe, bet,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observe, feel ... (that what the hypostases are all about).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DN:  On reflection, I have something else to ask about this.  If I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have understood, the comp project is to give an account, as you say, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of what emerges from interviewing (computationally) sound machines 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about their beliefs, bets, observations, feelings etc. 
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />OK. I would insist that the &quot;comp project&quot; (extract physics from comp) 
<br />
is really just a comp obligation. This is what is supposed to be shown 
<br />
by the UDA (+ MOVIE-GRAPH). Are you OK with this. It *is* 
<br />
counterintuitive.
<br />
<br />Then, the interview of the universal machine is &quot;just&quot; a way to do the 
<br />
extraction of physics in a constructive way. It is really the 
<br />
subtleties of the incompleteness phenomena which makes this interview 
<br />
highly non trivial.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words, the maximal description of their mental and physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds that is possible under such constraints.  What would still be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeterminate would be exactly how a specific machine's account could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be correlated with a physical description of the machine itself: i.e. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the perennial 'mind-body problem'.  But do you believe that there can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a way of closing this question theoretically? Is comp agnostic to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this correlation being 'functional' or 'physical'? 
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think that the interview provides the best we can hope concerning the 
<br />
mind-body problem in the comp frame. This could still currently lead to 
<br />
a refutation of comp in case empirical facts contradicts the 
<br />
comp-physics (the physics extracted from comp). There is no direct 
<br />
(still less one-one) correlation between the mental and the physical, 
<br />
that is the physical supervenience thesis is incompatible with the comp 
<br />
hyp.
<br />
[A quale of a pain] felt at time t in place x, is not a product of the 
<br />
physical activity of a machine, at time t in place x. Rather, it is the 
<br />
whole quale of [a pain felt at time t in place x] which is associated 
<br />
with an (immaterial and necessarily unknown) computational state, 
<br />
itself related to its normal consistent computational continuations.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Or will 'yes doctor' remain always a gamble in the sense of &quot;you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; picks your theory and you takes your choice&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />Hmmm... It is hard to answer this. Comp makes the &quot;yes doctor&quot; a 
<br />
gamble, necessarily. That is: assuming the &quot;theory comp&quot; you have to 
<br />
understand that, by saying yes to the doctor, you are gambling on a 
<br />
level of substitution. At the same time you make a &quot;gamble&quot; on the 
<br />
theory comp itself. There is double gamble here.
<br />
Now, the first gamble, IF DONE AT THE RIGHT COMP SUBSTITUTION LEVEL, is 
<br />
comp-equivalent with the natural gamble everybody do when going to 
<br />
sleep, or just when waiting a nanosecond. In some sense &quot;nature&quot; do 
<br />
that gamble in our place all the time ... But this is somethjng we 
<br />
cannot know, still less assert in any scientific way, and that is why I 
<br />
insist so much on the &quot;theological&quot; aspect of comp. This is important 
<br />
in practice. It really justify that the truth of the &quot;yes doctor&quot; 
<br />
entails the absolute fundamental right to say NO to the doctor. The 
<br />
doctor has to admit he is gambling on a substitution level. If comp is 
<br />
true we cannot be sure on the choice of the subst. level.
<br />
<br />Comp predicts that machine will be more and more &quot;dizzy&quot; when either 
<br />
introspecting themsleves close enough, or by looking at nature close 
<br />
enough. The math predicts even thresholds and jumps in that endeavor.
<br />
<br />Does this help? I assert some propositions without justifying them, 
<br />
because the justification are both already on the list, or in my 
<br />
papers. But, please, don't hesitate to ask for more if interested. From 
<br />
what I understand about your intuition, you are quite close to the 
<br />
&quot;natural first person discourse&quot; of the lobian machine. And the closer 
<br />
you are, the more severe my comments will be on the details, so please 
<br />
indulge my critical way of talking ...
