<br />As an aside, the people who think of the world as generated by a Turing 
<br />
machine could presumably define a &quot;metaphysical time&quot; axis consisting of 
<br />
the discrete sequential operations of this world-generating Turing machine. 
<br />
This time would not necessarily be related to any internal time coordinates 
<br />
in the universes it creates. (E.g. you could have the Turing Machine create 
<br />
a finite universe from back to front, beginning by specifying the final 
<br />
conditions and working its way backward from there; the observers in such a 
<br />
world would not notice anything unusual.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This means that I do not view the ``birth rank'' problem as being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;well-posed for my theory.  Nevertheless, the broader problem of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;extent to which we should expect to see ourselves as being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;``typical'' observers is one which I think is both absolutely crucial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and very hard to deal with.
</em><br />
<br />Agreed. Birth ranks are relevant only if (1) they are well-defined, and (2) 
<br />
knowable. Neither seems to be the case in the actual world. (Or perhaps one 
<br />
should rather say that the evidence we have suggests that our birth ranks 
<br />
are infinite? I wonder if that is a well-defined claim to make. There are 
<br />
probably not infinitely many observers in our backward light cone, but if 
<br />
the universe is spatially infinite then there were infinitely many 
<br />
observers &quot;a moment&quot; after big bang. One could say, for instance, that 
<br />
there are infinitely many observers living in the sort of climate that on 
<br />
each world like characterizes the universe a short time after the big bang.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   I appreciate Bostrom's work because I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think that he is helping to clarify some of the issues involved in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I also think that whether we are typical observers and whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time is observer-dependent are questions which are relevant for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any ``theory of everything''.
</em><br />
<br />I would agree with that. Especially the former is an absolutely key 
<br />
question for any theory on which most possible types of observations are 
<br />
actually made.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I wrote

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  As I see it, *the question* is ``Given what I have learned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  from my life up to now, how should I predict my future?''
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bostrom replied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  I'm not sure whether we are really disagreeing on this point,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  although I  would insist that one sort of question we may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  meaningfully ask is not just  what my own future will be but also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  what the world is like (and was like in  the past) in general.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am afraid that we are disagreeing here, because I do not agree that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;``the world'' exists in anything like the way that Bostrom implies.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure what you think I was implying, but it seems that you are 
<br />
committed to the existence of objective facts about the world. We can 
<br />
define &quot;the world&quot; as the set of all propositions that are true for all 
<br />
observers, and your theory of everything is, I take it, an attempt to 
<br />
describe the world thus defined. In other words, a theory of everything 
<br />
specifies the overall structure of the world. Each observer would want to 
<br />
complement a theory of everything with a &quot;local theory&quot; describing their 
<br />
own position within this overall structure.
