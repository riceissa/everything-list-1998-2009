</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; Of course, it is not possible for a third person observer to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; certain about first person mental states, and this would apply to our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; teleportee: he may feel as if he is the same person as he was prior t 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; o 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the procedure, but he might be wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If he is a zombie, by definition he feels nothing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I am assuming here he is not a zombie, that he has a memory of what  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he felt like pre-teleportation, but that he may be wrong about this.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure any entity can be wrong about a (first) personal feeling.  
<br />
The person can only be wrong relatively to some (personal)  
<br />
interpretation of some (non personal) world (its most probable  
<br />
history/computation).
<br />
(Actually even a zombie cannot be wrong when he asserts, for example,  
<br />
that he has a headache. But this happens for a different reason: he is  
<br />
*not* interpreting at all its own words. Feelings have to be conscious  
<br />
by definition I would say).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When we remember our past, we are doing something analogous to what we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do when we look at someone else's account of their first person  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience and try to imagine what it must have been like to have that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right, but only partially so. We hardly succeed imagining the real  
<br />
things here, except perhaps twins or doppelgangers, but in both case,  
<br />
only serendipitously.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Memories of our past are generally more vivid and hold more  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information than writing, film etc., but there may come a time when  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people directly share memories with each other as easily as they now  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; share mp3 files.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Selling, buying, sharing memories belongs to the future of applied  
<br />
bio-information science, I guess. But still, despite infinite possible  
<br />
progress in that matter, what will always really be shared will be  
<br />
numbers and partially similar decoding and interpreting procedures. For  
<br />
example, the mp3 files contains binary digits, and people share indeed  
<br />
the same first level decoding machinery (a Mac, a PC, an ipod, etc.).  
<br />
They does not share the personal experience (ex: for one the music will  
<br />
makes him/she recall nice memories, for someone else: only bad  
<br />
memories). Now you make one step further and share the good/bad  
<br />
memories. This can only partially be done, and then it will be similar  
<br />
to number-mp3 sharing. To share the first person experience completely  
<br />
you will have to erase memories for maintaining enough (self-)  
<br />
consistency, and you will actually fuse the persons. The quantum analog  
<br />
is quantum erasure of information which allows interference effects  
<br />
(and thus history-fusion) to (re)appear.
<br />
The first person itself is not first person-self-definable (I will come  
<br />
back on this, but those following the diagonalization post can already  
<br />
smell this phenomenon: the collection of all computable functions from  
<br />
N to N cannot be enumerated by a computable function).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would agree if I was believing in Nature. As a scientist I am neutral 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about the existence of nature, but assuming comp &quot;Nature&quot;, like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;matter&quot; should not be reified.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Can you think of any findings in evolutionary biology which count as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence either for or against the existence of a material world? 
</em><br />
<br /><br />We must be very careful here. Evolutionary biology assumes a material  
<br />
world, and I would say (just apparently against comp) that evolutionary  
<br />
biology CORRECTLY assumes a material world.
<br />
Somehow like a chess player assumes some local chessboard and a car  
<br />
driver assumes some local car.
<br />
It just happen that evolutionary biologists are not so much interested  
<br />
in the very nature and origin of that material world. They either  
<br />
define it as a bunch of interacting fields and particles they heard  
<br />
about, or even more generally just as the object matter of physics,  
<br />
without looking to the conceptual problem of physics at all.
<br />
For example in &quot;consciousness explained&quot; Dennett explictly asserts that  
<br />
there is no more conceptual problem in physics: only technical problem  
<br />
would remain.
<br />
(This attitude evolves slightly thanks to quantum computation).
<br />
Note that this is also the reason why comp cannot threaten evolutionary  
<br />
biology, quite the contrary, it proceeds according to the same basic  
<br />
mechanist philosophy. A case can even been made that comp extends  
<br />
Darwinism by allowing the physical laws to evolve, in some logical or  
<br />
psycho or theo-arithmetical selection process.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, most scientists, like most people, assume there is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a material world out there, but this is not a premiss on the basis of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which scientific theories stand or fall.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The science or art of doing good pizza does not depend on atoms,  
<br />
quarks, or waves, still less on the interpretation of those terms. Any  
<br />
irrefutable (non scientific) fuzzy notion of matter will do.
<br />
Most scientist assume a material world, but none make this explicitly,  
<br />
and matter is just a background decor at least since about 500 after  
<br />
JC.
<br />
Biologists are almost all materialist, although nuances can already be  
<br />
made when comparing molecular biologists and biochemists (my initial  
<br />
doubt). James D. Watson is even a sort of ultra-atomist: he does  
<br />
already not believe in molecules, only in atoms (why not elementary  
<br />
particles? I don't know, ask him).
<br />
But metaphysician and theologian does put forward fundamental theories  
<br />
on the nature of matter and existence. Aristotle does it very  
<br />
cautiously with an effort for clarity, making most (if not all)  of his  
<br />
propositions about matter refutable (and thus scientific in the sense  
<br />
of Popper). It is known that his dynamics has been already refuted by  
<br />
Galileo. It is less known, I think, that his primary notion of,  
<br />
arguably boolean, material substance has been refuted only recently,  
<br />
either by experiment like EPR-Bell-Aspect, or by theory through  
<br />
QM-Kochen-Specker-GHZ (hopefully soon in the realm of experiments).
<br />
And then comp, either by UDA or by the lobian interview refutes such a  
<br />
notion right at the start. And this refutation is quite similar in  
<br />
spirit, to those provided by Plotinus and some other (neo)platonists.
<br />
Note that my work does not refute the existence of matter, but it makes  
<br />
it devoid of any explanation power (so with Occam ...).
<br />
Well, here we are at the crux of what I think comp forces use to revise  
<br />
in fundamental science and I guess we will have many opportunities to  
<br />
dig all this in a deeper way.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't understand why you say  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;if duplication (at any level) is a death sentence, then comp is wrong&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; . There must be a *minimal* level of duplication fidelity below which  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness/intelligence is not preserved, no? Or are you using  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;duplication&quot; to mean perfect duplication, in which case how can we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have different levels of perfection? 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sorry my quantifier was perhaps unclear. Comp means that there exists a  
<br />
level of digital substitution of my parts where I survive (or &quot;feel no  
<br />
difference&quot;) in a teleportation experiment (and thus digital brain  
<br />
graft, duplication ...) where the copy are exact at that (finite,  
<br />
digital) level.
<br />
<br />So comp can be false only if we don't survive any such digital  
<br />
substitution. This means that teleportation will fail for any level of  
<br />
substitution.
<br />
So if comp is false it means that even if I copy you at the level of  
<br />
the quantum quarks for example, you will not survive, nor if I copy you  
<br />
at the level of strings, etc. This means there is something genuine for  
<br />
our identity which is not turing emulable.
<br />
Of course, once the correct level is chosen, any level corresponding  
<br />
with a finer grained decomposition of me into parts will work also (but  
<br />
will be more expensive for nothing but psychological security).
<br />
We never can know &quot;scientifically&quot; what is our correct level. We can  
<br />
only bet on it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  This is an important point, perhaps *the* most important point in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Parfit's book. The problem lies with the pronouns, and with the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychology on which these pronouns are based. Evolution and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grammarians never anticipated the kind of duplication experiments we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have been discussing!
</em><br />
<br /><br />But theologians always have!  Before and after JC. In almost all big  
<br />
civilizations. Ideas similar to functional substitution appears in  
<br />
Nagarjuna's answer to Milinda first question (in the &quot;Question to King  
<br />
Milinda, ref in my thesis), in Plato, in Plotinus (arguably), in  
<br />
Augustine, in Descartes, and many others. I believe we don't consider  
<br />
those anticipations seriously because we are brainwashed somehow by  
<br />
1500 years of state appropriation of theology and the desire by some  
<br />
strong power (mainly the catholic church) to keep the &quot;fundamental&quot;  
<br />
question in their (mostly authoritatively defended) territory.
<br />
I am not even sure we could say that evolution did not anticipated  
<br />
this. Of course evolution did not really anticipate anythings, but our  
<br />
genetical apparatus obviously relies on self-duplication since the  
<br />
amoeba, so that duplication has been already exploited heavily at some  
<br />
(molecular) level.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I undergo destructive teleportation, how should I describe what  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens? If I say, &quot;I am destroyed in Brussels&quot; then how can I say  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I survive the procedure? If I don't say &quot;I am destroyed in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brussels&quot; then who *is* destroyed as part of the destructive scanning?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is here that I would say that the 1/3 person distinction is crucial.  
<br />
A computationalist wanting to be grammatically and semantically as  
<br />
clear as possible should just say: my previous body is destroyed in  
<br />
Brussels. He guesses that he (first person) will survive the procedure.  
<br />
And of course nobody (really meaning nosoul, or no-one) is destroyed as  
<br />
part of the destructive procedure.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So when I say, &quot;I am destroyed in Brussels and reconstituted in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Moscow&quot;,
</em><br />
<br /><br />The problem is that in such an expression &quot;I&quot; is ambiguous. Like you  
<br />
said, our everyday life (but not our speculative theology or science)  
<br />
does not prepare us for applied computationalism. &quot;I am destroyed in  
<br />
Brussels&quot; really means that my original third person describable body  
<br />
is destroyed, not
<br />
my first person &quot;I&quot;. The body, for a computationalist is really just a  
<br />
(third person description) of a local, current vehicle.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; what I really mean is, &quot;a certain instantiation, or token, identifying  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as Stathis-in-Brussels is destroyed, then another instantiation  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identifying as Stathis-in-Moscow is created, such that the two  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiations taken together identify as a single individual, or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; type, persisting through time, Stathis-in-Brussels-then-Moscow.&quot; 
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right. But I would not identify a token with an instantiation (for  
<br />
the sake of later nuances, it is not a key point here). Now with your  
<br />
description, a non-computationalist can take it as an argument against  
<br />
comp. Indeed, if you identify a single individual by taking together  
<br />
the two third person (non-overlapping) instantiations, you will have a  
<br />
problem with duplication which makes the instantiation overlapping. I  
<br />
would say that the only thing which can be qualified as a first person  
<br />
identity, is its own (uncommuncable) experiences. It is not something  
<br />
admitting any third person description, although here G* would add  
<br />
nuances ...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It can only be made unambiguous by introducing the third person POV  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the &quot;I&quot; refers to different tokens/instantiations depending on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the stage of the teleportation process: the idea that there is a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single &quot;I&quot; persisting through time is an illusion, involving looking  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at one's future or past as if from the 1st person POV when in fact the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1st person POV is necessarily tied to a single token/instantiation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right then. Except that I am not sure I really agree with the idea  
<br />
that the persisting &quot;I&quot;  is an illusion. Here, it is hard for me not  
<br />
taking account of the main UDA conclusion: th reversal  
<br />
physics/bio/compscience/theology/numbers. So let me tell you what I  
<br />
believe, accepting comp and the UDA reasoning: The persisting &quot;I&quot; is  
<br />
not an illusion, or is less an illusion than its body or time itself.  
<br />
What could also be an illusion is the feeling that &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot; are  
<br />
absolutely different, when the difference is only relative.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is why I say that &quot;I&quot; live only transiently when I am interested  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in being rigorous, while in everyday life I use the pronoun &quot;I&quot; to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean what most people mean by it, and what my human-standard  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychological makeup tells me it means.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is hard matter and I don't expect we will settle this in few  
<br />
posts. I think I see what you mean, and at the same time I believe comp  
<br />
forces us to believe in the contrary (but I know this is strongly  
<br />
counter-intuitive for those who thinks a lot on personal identity and  
<br />
does keep some form of naturalism). The reason is that eventually the  
<br />
first persons will appear to be the time and space constructors, and  
<br />
that the first person &quot;I&quot; does not even exists transiently (it needs at  
<br />
least two instants!). So here, comp could come back toward common  
<br />
sense: &quot;you&quot; are really defining partially and locally a past and a  
<br />
future (or many possible futures) like everyday life suggests. Identity  
<br />
is attached (partially) to connected memories, and all what matters  
<br />
consists in keeping that connection through the construction of time  
<br />
for consistency purpose. We are not allow to get others' experiences  
<br />
for the same consistency reason, so &quot;I&quot; remains invariant to &quot;my&quot;  
<br />
continuous or computable changes, and actually this is what allows us  
<br />
to be teleported or duplicated through comp, with giving the right for  
<br />
all my doppelgangers to say consistently that they are all &quot;me&quot;,  
<br />
persisting through those experience/experiments, and being just  
<br />
accidentally and relatively (in W or M for example) disconnected. I  
<br />
think that people, like Lee Corbin, who insists that the W and M  
<br />
doppelgangers are really himself, should accept the possibility, at  
<br />
least, that all of us are already the same self, produced by many many  
<br />
duplications and multiplications made through our biological history.  
<br />
We are unable to recognize ourself as our selves due to other  
<br />
evolutionary factors which apparently did bet on some competition among  
<br />
us. Another is some hidden part of oneself, in this setting. It is  
<br />
known that hiding information can be a key to learning behavior.
<br />
<br />Hope I am enough clear. Many things I want to make clearer here rely on  
<br />
many points in the UDA. It could perhaps help us to tell if you follow  
<br />
the UDA reasoning until its conclusion (?) or where would you stop? We  
<br />
could try to  isolate possible misunderstandings.
