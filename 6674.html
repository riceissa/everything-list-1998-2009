<br />Not sure why you say *computational* wrt Tegmark's theory. Nor do I 
<br />
understand exactly what you mean by a measure relating 1-person &amp; 
<br />
3-person.  Tegmark is certainly aware of the need for a measure to allow 
<br />
statements about the probability of finding oneself (1-person pov, OK?) in 
<br />
a universe with certain properties. This is listed in astro-ph/0302131 as 
<br />
a &quot;horrendous&quot; problem to which he tentatively offers what looks 
<br />
suspiciously like Schmidhuber's (or whoever's) Universal Prior as a 
<br />
solution.
<br />
<br />(Of course, this means he tacitly accepts the restriction to computable 
<br />
functions).
<br />
<br />So I don't agree that the problem can't be addressed by Tegmark, although 
<br />
it hasn't been. Unless by &quot;addressed&quot; you mean &quot;solved&quot;, in which case I 
<br />
agree!
<br />
<br />Let's suppose with Wei Dai that a measure can be applied to Tegmark's 
<br />
everything. It certainly can to the set of UTM programs as per Schmidhuber 
<br />
and related proposals.  Obviously it is possible to assign a measure which 
<br />
solves the White Rabbit problem, such as the UP.  But to me this procedure 
<br />
is very suspicious.  We can get whatever answer we like by picking the 
<br />
right measure.  While the UP and similar are presented by their proponents 
<br />
as &quot;natural&quot;, my strong suspicion is that if we lived in a universe that 
<br />
was obviously algorithmically very complex, we would see papers arguing 
<br />
for &quot;natural&quot; measures that reward algorithmic complexity. In fact the 
<br />
White Rabbit argument is basically an assertion that such measures *are* 
<br />
natural.  Why one measure rather than another? By the logic of Tegmark's 
<br />
original thesis, we should consider the set of all possible measures over 
<br />
everything. But then we need a measure on the measures, and so ad 
<br />
infinitum.
<br />
<br />One self-consistent approach is Lewis', i.e. to abandon all talk of 
<br />
measure, all anthropic predictions, and just to speak of possibilities 
<br />
rather than probabilities.  This suited Lewis fine, but greatly undermines 
<br />
the attractiveness of the everything thesis for physicists.
<br />
<br />&lt;SNIP&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more or less recently in the scientific american. I'm sure Tegmark's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach, which a priori does not presuppose the comp hyp, would benefit from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; category theory: this one put structure on the possible sets of mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures. Lawvere rediscovered the Grothendieck toposes by trying (without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; success) to get the category of all categories. Toposes (or Topoi) are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; categories formalizing first person universes of mathematical structures. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a North-holland book on &quot;Topoi&quot; by Goldblatt which is an excellent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introduction to toposes for ... logicians (mhhh ...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hope that helps,

<br />Not really. I know category theory is a potential route into this, but I 
<br />
havn't seen any definitive statements and from what I've read on this list 
<br />
I don't expect to any time soon. I'm certainly not going to learn category 
<br />
theory myself!
<br />
<br />You overlooked a couple of direct queries to you in my posting:
<br />
<br />* You still havn't explained why you say his system is &quot;too big 
<br />
(inconsistent)&quot;. Especially the inconsistent bit. I'm sure a level of 
<br />
explanation is possible which doesn't take the whole of category theory 
<br />
for granted.  Also, if you have a proof that his system is inconsistent, 
<br />
you should publish it.
<br />
<br />* Is it correct to say that category theory cannot define &quot;the whole&quot; 
<br />
because it is outside the heirarchy of the cardinals?
<br />
<br />And another mathematical query for you or anyone on the list:
<br />
<br />I've overlooked until now the fact that mathematical physics restricts 
<br />
itself to (almost-everywhere) differentiable functions of the continuum. 
<br />
What is the cardinality of the set of such functions? I rather suspect 
<br />
that they are denumerable, hence exactly representable by UTM programs.
<br />
Perhaps this is what Russell Standish meant.
<br />
<br />I must insist though, that there exist mathematical objects in platonia 
<br />
which require c bits to describe (and some which require more), and hence 
<br />
can't be represented either by a UTM program or by the output of a UTM.
<br />
Hence Tegmark's original everything is bigger than Schmidhuber's.  But 
<br />
these structures are so arbitrary it is hard to imagine SAS in them, so 
<br />
maybe it makes no anthropic difference.
