<br />Every conscious perspective within the UD could be said to have some

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statistical measure in relation to other conscious perspectives.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which is to say, some experiences occur with a greater frequency than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others.  However, I am wondering if any useful conclusions can be made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from this as Self Sampling Assumptions do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An argument that casts doubt on SSA's is:  First, whatever measure an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience has, if it exists in the UD it has probability 1 of being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experienced, regardless of how frequently or infrequently it occurs in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the UD.  Second, if two experiences are indistinguishable what/how/why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does it matter if it is experienced one time or a million?  How can an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience be given more &quot;weight&quot; by being more common within the UD?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it meaningful to say an experience can be experienced multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Each observer moment lives only transiently and is not in telepathic
<br />
communication with any other OMs, whether related to it or not. The effect
<br />
(or illusion) of continuity of consciousness is adequately explained by each
<br />
OM remembering past experiences. These past experiences need not have
<br />
happened at all, let alone happened in the remembered order and in the
<br />
remembered body. Thus it is meaningless to speak of having the same
<br />
experience multiple times: you only experience one thing at a time, and you
<br />
can't remember experiencing multiple identical experiences, since if you
<br />
could there would be something to distinguish them and they wouldn't be
<br />
identical. However, the weighting of OMs *relative* to other OMs with the
<br />
same time stamp and sense of identity is important in considering future
<br />
expectations. If you undergo destructive teleportation with two copies
<br />
appearing in London and one copy in Paris, you will subjectively have a 2/3
<br />
and 1/3 chance of finding yourself in London and Paris, respectively, after
<br />
entering the sending station.
<br />
<br />A reason for believing SSA's is: If one considered an infinite set
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; containing one instance of every distinguishable observer moment, more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would contain disorded and illogical (talking white rabbit)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences vs. what we would consider to be ordered and logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences.  Consider just visual experiences, there are many more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ways for a disordly almost random image (such as this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a0/Tux_secure.jpg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a0/Tux_secure.jpg</a> ) to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experienced than for a meaningful image (like your computer monitor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infront of you) to be experienced.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As you read and contemplate this post, you find yourself experiencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a rational universe and perspective.  Is your experience now a rare
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abberation among the set of all possible experiences or is there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something to be said for SSA's?  SSA's would suggest most experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are produced in universes that are stable and ordered enough for life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to evolve, and therefore making completely illogical experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; highly unlikely (but not impossible as they could occur as the initial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conditions of a program in the UD).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do most on this list believe there must be some statistical reason for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the order of your current observer moment?  Are self sampling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptions necessary to rule out talking white rabbit experiences?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The most common white rabbit universes in the UD will involve everything
<br />
breaking up into noise, like your image cited above but not just for vision,
<br />
and these will be eliminated not due to having a low measure (they will have
<br />
a relatively much higher measure than orderly universes), but because they
<br />
do not support observers. However, if there are multiple candidate successor
<br />
OMs including ones with bizarre events happening, you should expect to
<br />
experience the ones with higher measure. To deny this would be to deny the
<br />
validity of probability theory.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;the order of your current observer moment&quot;.
