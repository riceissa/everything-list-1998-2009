<br />Actually Bruno, been thinking a bit more and you may be right.
<br />
Shouldn't perhaps have put it like I did.  I'm still not totally clear
<br />
on the ultimate status of the relationship between the physical and
<br />
mathematical worlds - I doubt anyone is ;)
<br />
<br />One thing I *am* sure about is that all valid mathematical concepts
<br />
map to physical concepts.  So I accept the Tegmark thesis about
<br />
mathematics in one sense: that all mathematical things are also
<br />
physical.  Again, physical does not have to imply concrete or finite.
<br />
Some physical oconcepts have be abstract.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;I can only refer you to my 'Class Diagram Of Reality' which is a
<br />
graphical representation of my latest attempt to classify all
<br />
knowledge at the highest level of abstraction.  The story behind it is
<br />
that I spent 5 years of intense focus on ontology (for fans of Vernor
<br />
Vinge: I became a 'zip-head' for 5 years in the field of Ontology) and
<br />
the class diagram is the result of that.  So it's not something I've
<br />
just put up without a *lot* of deep thought.  Here's the diagram:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://marc.geddes.googlepages.com/MCRT_ClassDiagram.html">http://marc.geddes.googlepages.com/MCRT_ClassDiagram.html</a>
<br />
<br />The three levels of reality I've talked about this thread are
<br />
represented in the diagram along the up-down axis.  At bottom are
<br />
'Models' (The State Level Of Reality, the most fundamental).  At top
<br />
are 'Systems' (The Operational or Functional Level of Reality).  In
<br />
middle are 'Tools' (The State-Change Level or the level of
<br />
computatational physics).
<br />
<br />Physical,Mathematical and Teleological concepts are along another
<br />
axis: from left to right.  Incidentally, the fact that there are
<br />
actually more than one ontological axis is, I believe, the source of
<br />
immense confusion in the field of KR/Ontology.   Don't confuse this
<br />
axis with the other axis I mentioned in the previous paragraph!
<br />
<br />The Physical concepts are all represented by the left hand boxes.  The
<br />
Mathematical concepts are all represented by the right hand boxes.
<br />
You map the concepts by mapping the physical boxes to the Mathematical
<br />
boxes in the corresponding positions on the other side of the
<br />
diagram.  It can be seen that math and physics completely map to each
<br />
other.
<br />
<br />But you may be right that in terms of *explanatory power*, mathematics
<br />
is primary.  The 'Reality Theory' represented by the diagram is
<br />
*itself* a class - it belong in one of the mathematical boxes - the
<br />
box 'Symbolic Logic' to bottom right.  In that case it would appear
<br />
that indeed all concepts spring from mathematics.
<br />
<br />But what is mathematics?  It's three things I think: Categories,
<br />
Relations and Propositions.  Of these, Relations and Propositions
<br />
refer to discrete (finite) knowledge.  But Categories includes the
<br />
other two, since categories can also deal with the infinite.  So it
<br />
would appear that the ultimate root of it all is *Categories*
<br />
(Category Theory).  Number Theory/Sets are general kinds of category.
<br />
Machines/Computer Science deal with finite categories.
