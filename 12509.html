Stathis: wise words. (I find your Elvis - Jesus parable exaggerated).
<br />
Values, like ethics or morale is culture related - mostly anti-natural. The natural way of life is &quot;eat the prey, animal and/or plant&quot;, kick out a competitor from your territory, once the lion killed the weaker male: eat his litter, to protect HIS own genes. We find in 'groups' some 'societal' degeneration for group-survival, which went over to more sophisticated (human?) society as tribal etc. self-defense philosophy. Developmental factors colored that into diverse belief systems (religions etc.) &quot;Values&quot; are derived from such. 
<br />
Credibility is also a belief-system consequence: who would have believed in 1000AD that all the angels dancing on a pin can be wiped away by a human-made atomic bomb?  Or would have Plato believed in a quark? 
<br />
(Not more ridiculous than your stabbing me with Santa).

With friendship

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;John, 

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have some sort of system for sorting the wrong beliefs from the less-likely-to-be-wrong 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;ones. This is what science tries to do, although of course it can never arrive at &quot;ultimate truth&quot; precisely 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;because it has to be open to new evidence should it come along. But we have to have some basic standards 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;for evidence, and if we are honest we should apply that standard consistently. If someone believes that Elvis is alive 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;because lots of people have seen him then, IMHO, that person's standards of evidence are too low. But if someone 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;believes that Jesus rose from the dead because it says in the Bible that people saw him, but not that Elvis is alive, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;then not only is that person's standards of evidence too low, he is also being inconsistent. If you believe the incredible 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;things it says in one holy book then you have forfeited your reasons for disbelieving all sorts of other incredible things. 

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As for values, once we have ironed out our disagreements on empirical matters on which our values depend, then all 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;we can say is, I think this and you think that: there is no basis for saying one of us is right and the other wrong.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and the atheist/ agnostic thing: are you atheistic or agnostic about Santa Claus?

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stathis Papaioannou

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; --Logical flaw: different religions accept different 'holy' books (their own, that is) you are in the joke when two people meet at the railroad station and one sais: I am making a trip to a distant foreign country and the other sais: me too, so why are we not traveling  together? --

I just wondered why the 'god-designers' made their idol(s) with all those human fallibilities (vain, seek adoration, pick favorites, no criticism allowed, are vengeful, irate, not impartial, influenceable, cruel, punishing even unjustly (punishing for things by creational flaws etc.) and assigning this world to a creator with such flaws...  And yes, I am an agnostic, because I am not convinced about the superiority of MY ideas over the ideas of others. - JM
