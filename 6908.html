Bruno provides the exercise
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I notice that many people seek refuge in the &quot;no-copying&quot; theorem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; QM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exercise: 1) Show by a qualitative informal reasoning that if we are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turing emulable then a no-cloning theorem is a necessity.
</em><br />
<br />My best guess right now?  Your challenge would be a futile exercise
<br />
in word play!  &quot;no-cloning&quot; involves quantum mechanics. So far as
<br />
I know, computability theory (e.g. Rogers 1967) says ABSOLUTELY
<br />
NOTHING about quantum mechanics, and they are in two completely
<br />
different intellectual domains.
<br />
<br />Let me know when the newspapers announce that you've derived
<br />
QM from computability theory.  Or any blasted physics equation
<br />
whatsoever. (I'm sorry that I have neither the time nor the
<br />
expertise to digest your technical papers.)
<br />
<br />In another thread, Bruno wrote
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is the central problem from those who are deeply concerned as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to *why* 1st person experiences exist.  Too bad that to me, it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; just obvious that they must.  I literally cannot conceive of how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it could be different!  (Poor me, I suppose---in some ways some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of us just have too little imagination, I truly guess.)
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is not so much &quot;why&quot; 1-person experiences exist, but how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they are related to 3-person descriptions, and which one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How do *you* explain the relation?
</em><br />
<br />If I were a great novelist, I might be able to convey certain 1st
<br />
person experiences to you (but that is possible *only* because the
<br />
two organisms Bruno and Lee are so similar).  But I'm not a great
<br />
novelist, and so I can't.
<br />
<br />Therefore, we can only talk about what is in the world, from tables
<br />
to trees to mountains and stars. *People* occupy an infinitesimal
<br />
portion of what's out there. The maze of internal events which make
<br />
each one of them feel and think is interesting, but is a very difficult
<br />
physiological problem.  I claim that it has nothing to do with serious
<br />
philosophy, and is just a hideous distraction, possibly stemming from
<br />
confusion at the semantic level and disturbed sr. Bad epistemology,
<br />
in a phrase.
<br />
<br />THERE ISN'T A PROBLEM!  (Yes, okay, to computer scientists and
<br />
physiologists there is, but not to philosophers or others interested
<br />
in getting their ontology and epistemology straight.) The evolved
<br />
creatures all have their responses and their internal workings;
<br />
and that's *all* there is to it!
<br />
<br />I am an evolved creature; and if I can't understand that that same
<br />
conclusions apply just as much to me as to the creatures I study,
<br />
then I'm yielding to nonsense.
<br />
<br />Lee
