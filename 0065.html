<br />The problem is that nothing a person does can affect the outside view,

which is static.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about is this average (you don't care at all about how many instances 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are enjoying this satisfaction) then you might indeed get the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implication that you should play Russian roulette in your thought 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, but what's so paradoxical about that? It wouldn't mean that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would have any reason to play Russian roulette in that situation, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for I don't think I have the goals that your argument presupposes. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; care about how many branches I will continue to exist on/how many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copies there will be of me.
</em><br />
<br />These things are part of the outside view. They will remain the
<br />
same no matter what you do, so how does it make sense to have a goal of
<br />
changing them?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's how you define the probability, yes, but how do you define the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposition &quot;I will perceive X.&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />I don't know how to define it directly, but its meaning is implicit in the
<br />
definition of the probability.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But your argument, it seems, presupposes that I can't care about how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many instances there will exist of me. That seems wrong.
</em><br />
<br />Part of my argument is that it doesn't make sense to have goals that refer
<br />
to the outside view because the outside view is fixed. But I also showed
<br />
(with the first paradox) that Tegmark's definition of probability is not
<br />
self-consistent. I think that is the more serious problem, since if we
<br />
have a consistent definition of probability that isn't compatible with our
<br />
current version of decision theory, we can always modify decision theory
<br />
or change our ideas of what is rational.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well I think that's problematic. How do we interpret these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;measures&quot;? I.e. what does it mean to say that a certain instance of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience has a certain measure m?
</em><br />
<br />One possible interpretation is that every string has an infinite number of
<br />
instances, but some have relatively more instances than others. This is
<br />
somewhat analagous to intervals of real numbers between 0 and 1. There are
<br />
an infinite number of real numbers in every such interval, but some
<br />
intervals have relatively more real numbers than others.
