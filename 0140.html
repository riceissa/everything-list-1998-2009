&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello.  Here's my take, as advertised.  This is a public forum, so
<br />
I hope Pr. Tegmark doesn't steal any more ideas :-)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, I haven't quite figured out the archive yet.  Really, it
<br />
ought to be on the web, as text.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, it made sense that any symmettry in math, ought to be a
<br />
symmettry in nature; I called it the postulate of symmettry.  Closely
<br />
related was the zero information postulate (ZIP).  Of course, it's not
<br />
really a new idea that 'maybe every possible thing exists'.  The questions
<br />
are: What is the precise mathematical statement?  Does it really have
<br />
no free parameters (ZIP)?  What predictions does it make, and do they
<br />
match our observations?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, first, it is not enough to say that all mathematical stuctures
<br />
exist.  There are infinitely many, and the predictions you get depends on
<br />
how often you count members of each type.  What is needed is a way of
<br />
parametrizing the space of all mathematical stuctures, and then arguing
<br />
that the proper way to count is to assume a uniform distribution in those
<br />
parameters.  I don't know of such a way, but even if there is one, the
<br />
problem is it is not likely to be the only possible way.  So we have free
<br />
parameters, if not.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, it might still be a promising approach to try to
<br />
simplify theories of physics (although not all the way down to ZIP) by
<br />
embedding them in some such parameterized ensemble.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turns out, at the time I was looking at this stuff, I did
<br />
not realize that causal relations play a critical role in
<br />
computationalism.  Some of my conclusions needed updating due to that, and
<br />
I think the result is interesting.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at the digital sector, namely the Turing machine sector,
<br />
due to increased tractability.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most promising parameterization for this sector seems to be
<br />
assuming a uniform distribution in the space of Turing machine programs
<br />
(i.e. laws of physics, as opposed to being uniform in the space of
<br />
solutions to those laws **which is another way of parameterizing**).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might think that the typical program would have infinite
<br />
length.  That would be bad, since we need a mechanism to make the laws
<br />
simple like the ones we know.  Fortunately there is a trick, which is that
<br />
a Turing machine can encounter a command like 'loop back', and everything
<br />
after that command will never be acted upon.  So, in fact, the probability
<br />
of any finite program of length l will go as 1/2^l, since the bits after l
<br />
are chosen arbritrarily.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there's another problem.  A program can 'cheat' by, for
<br />
example, building a simple but large nerve net and cycling through all
<br />
possible initial conditions; some of them are bound to allow 
<br />
consciousness.  The extreme case would be a program which just says 'run
<br />
all possible programs'.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if we assume all the original programs are running at the
<br />
same speed, the thing to do would be to look at the total number of
<br />
conscious computations implemented by each as time goes to infinity.  (For
<br />
more on what I mean by an implementation, which is a nontrivial concept,
<br />
see my web page on interpretation of QM.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'probability' of a program giving rise to our observation is then
<br />
(N_c/t) 2^-l, where N_c is the number of conscious implementions, t the
<br />
number of time steps, and N_c/t presumably fixed for large t which can be
<br />
achieved by perioidic 'restart' commands if needed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may suggest that a program which simulates simple equations,
<br />
without needing a lot of data for initial conditions (which would make a
<br />
huge difference in l) would be most likely.  Darwinian evolution might be
<br />
likely, as a way of getting complexity without complicated initial conditions.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could our universe be a computer simulation of such a nature?
<br />
Quantum systems require exponential computer time as a function of
<br />
simulated time, but the number of implementations might diverge at a
<br />
similar rate, so that's not a solid argument against it.  A way to
<br />
disprove it would be to find a program that maximizes the above
<br />
'probability' better than such a simulation.  I used to have arguments for
<br />
why it would surely fail, but sorry, they're a bit out of date.  Maybe 
<br />
you guys could help me show it fails.  Even if it does not fail, it is
<br />
more my idea than Pr. Tegmark's more general and ZIPed one.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, you get the idea.  I don't know how the corresponding
<br />
treatment for the analog sector might work. 
<br />
