<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;the descriptions of these universes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Doesn't Schmidhuber consider only universes that are the results of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computations? Can't we consider any computation as having an intrinsic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;causal structure&quot;? How would it be possible to write an algorithm that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; describes a &quot;Life&quot; universe where there's no time, where the t-axis is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; replaced by a z-axis, for example?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, you could just replace the letter t with the letter z, but of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that wouldn't change the underlying nature of things.  You might well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;say that there was still a time axis, just that it had a different name.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But the bigger question is whether the order in which a universe is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computed must match the concept of &quot;time&quot; within that universe.
</em><br />
<br />True, it isn't always necessary to compute things in the same order--if 
<br />
you're simulating a system that obeys time-symmetric laws you can always 
<br />
reverse all the time-dependent quantities (like the momentum of each 
<br />
particle) in the final state and use that as an initial state for a new 
<br />
simulation, and the new simulation will behave like a backwards movie of the 
<br />
original simulation. But since I don't have a well-defined mathematical 
<br />
theory of what it means for two computations to have the same &quot;causal 
<br />
structure&quot;, I'm not sure whether the causal structure would actually be any 
<br />
different if you computed a universe in reverse order. When I think of 
<br />
&quot;causal structure&quot;, I'm not really presupposing any asymmetry between 
<br />
&quot;cause&quot; and &quot;effect&quot;, I'm just imagining a collection of events which are 
<br />
linked to each other in some way like in a graph, but the links need not 
<br />
have any built-in direction--if two events are linked, that doesn't mean one 
<br />
event is the cause and the other is the effect, so the pattern of links 
<br />
could still be the same even if you did compute things in reverse order. 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From what I've read about loop quantum gravity, it's a theory in which space 
</em><br />
and time emerge from a more primitive notion of linked events, but I'm 
<br />
pretty sure it's not a time-asymmetric theory.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Further, in our own universe there appears to be quite a bit of ambiguity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about time ordering, and many different computational strategies will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;work equally well.  Relativity theory shows that events either have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;timelike separation, in which case it is clear which one is in the past,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or a spacelike separation, which makes it ambiguous which one is farther
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the past.
</em><br />
<br />True, but the only way for two events to be causally linked in relativity is 
<br />
if there is a timelike separation between them, and in that case all 
<br />
reference frames will agree about the order of the events.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It was suggested here a while back that a Life universe could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computed using an algorithm which ran around somewhat randomly and made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;localized changes to cells in order to make them match the Life rules.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Eventually this would converge to a stable and consistent Life universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Any observers living in that universe would have a perceived direction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of time that was very different from the actual order in which it was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computed.
</em><br />
<br />Another way to do this might just be to have a computer generate *all* 
<br />
possible sequences of cell-changes over some finite number of steps and 
<br />
using a finite-sized board, and then check each one to see if it is obeying 
<br />
the rules of &quot;Life&quot; at each step, and throw out all those that don't. Is it 
<br />
possible that the &quot;causal structure&quot; of a program checking every cell at 
<br />
every step of a valid Life sequence is the same as the causal structure of 
<br />
actually computing that sequence from its initial conditions? Or that even 
<br />
if they're different, one causal structure &quot;contains&quot; the other, like a 
<br />
graph that contains another one as a subset? Again, without a well-defined 
<br />
notion of the causal structure of a given computation it's hard to be sure.
