<br />
Well mhmdriad9.domain.name.hidden your response has been even more disappointing 
<br />
than even my very low expectation prepared me for. You have not even 
<br />
recognised what my questions were about, let alone made any significant 
<br />
attempt to address them.
<br />
<br />As an ex-Christian I know what it is like to be sucked into a world view 
<br />
that projects part of one's own nature into a 'spiritual being' and 
<br />
projects other, completely unacknowledged and rejected parts of one's 
<br />
psyche onto outsiders who are perceived as being threatening and evil 
<br />
because they exhibit those impulses rather than oneself.
<br />
<br />However, we must call a spade a spade; all this guff that gets called 
<br />
'theology' and 'spirituality' is ultimately a bunch of assertions that 
<br />
can neither be proved nor disproved in any concrete sense because they 
<br />
are all expressions of belief and ONLY belief. Because there is no way 
<br />
of relating these holy ramblings to any concrete test, belief in them 
<br />
becomes, as often as not, a function of a person's social and political 
<br />
allegiances. The beliefs change to comply with and rationalise the 
<br />
ambitions and practices of the ruling elite. The chanting of sacred 
<br />
texts and the recitation of beliefs become assurances of acceptance, 
<br />
badges of compliance with the regime. There will be NO significant 
<br />
contributions to the well being and advancement of human kind arising 
<br />
from this religiosity, just acquiescence and the turning of a blind eye 
<br />
to the crimes of the rulers and the thugs who impose the anti democratic 
<br />
rule.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;The moral and intellectual contrast is expressed most vividly, I think, 
<br />
by the way a free-thinking monk called Giordano Bruno was vilified, 
<br />
stripped naked, tortured and finally burnt alive by the inquisitor thugs 
<br />
of the Roman church, in a public square somewhere in Rome 17 February 
<br />
1600. His crime? Being a sceptic and publicly questioning some of the 
<br />
preposterous beliefs that religion required people to agree to. He was 
<br />
murdered because the sceptical method he advocated and employed 
<br />
threatened the very foundations of the corrupt religious hierarchy and 
<br />
the secular regimes - all feudal thug-ocracies. From what I read, hear, 
<br />
and see reported about Islam in Iran, Iraq, Saudi, and umpteen other 
<br />
places, the basic issues are the same as for Christianity. The holders 
<br />
and wielders of traditional power WILL not acknowledge that the 
<br />
demonstrated power of scientific method to show us how the natural world 
<br />
works and to show us deep insights into how the human brain and mind 
<br />
work has a moral authority at least equal to that of their 'holy' books. 
<br />
THIS is the real challenge of the 20 and 21 centuries.
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jesus the same, or, &quot;co-equal&quot; in status with his Father?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Answer No.1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In Greek, `heis' means `one' numerically (masc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; `hen' means `one' in unity or essence (neut.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here the word used by John is `hen' and not `heis'. The marginal notes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in New American Standard Bible (NASB) reads; one - (Lit.neuter) a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unity, or, one essence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If one wishes to argue that the word `hen' supports their claim for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jesus being &quot;co-equal&quot; in status with his Father, please invite his/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her attention to the following verse:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jesus said: &quot;And the glory which Thou hast given me, I have given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to them (disciples); that they may be one, just as we are one.&quot; (John
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 17:22).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If he/she was to consider/regard/believe the Father and Jesus Christ
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be &quot;one&quot; meaning &quot;co-equal&quot; in status on the basis of John 10:30,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then that person should also be prepared to consider/regard/believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;them&quot; - the disciples of Jesus, to be &quot;co-equal&quot; in status with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Father and Jesus (&quot;just as we are one&quot;) in John 17:22. I have yet to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find a person that would be prepared to make the disciples (students)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;co-equal&quot; in status with the Father or Jesus.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The unity and accord was of the authorized divine message that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; originated from the Father, received by Jesus and finally passed on to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the disciples. Jesus admitted having accomplished the work which the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Father had given him to do. (Jn.17:4)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hot Tip (precise and pertinent)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jesus said: &quot;I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I.&quot; (Jn.14:28). This verse unequivocally refutes the claim by any one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for Jesus being &quot;co-equal&quot; in status with his Father.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Question No.2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jesus said: &quot;I am the way, ...no one comes to the Father, but through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me.&quot; (Jn.14:6), therefore, is not the Salvation through Jesus, ALONE?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Answer No.2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Before Jesus spoke these words, he said; &quot;In my Father's house are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many mansions (dwelling places); if it were not so, I would have told
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you; for I go to prepare a mansion (a dwelling place) for you.&quot; (John
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 14:2). The above explicit statement confirms that Jesus was going to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prepare &quot;a&quot; mansion and not &quot;all&quot; the mansions in &quot;my Father's house&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously, the prophets that came before him and the one to come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after, were to prepare the other mansions for their respective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; followers. The prophet that came after Jesus had evidently shown the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current &quot;way&quot; to a modern mansion in the kingdom of heaven.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Besides; the verse clearly states; Jesus was the &quot;WAY&quot; to a mansion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is a folly to believe that Jesus (or any prophet) was the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;DESTINATION&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jesus said; &quot;I am the door&quot; to find the pasture. (Jn.10:9).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A sheep that walks through the &quot;door&quot; will find the pasture.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A sheep that circles around the &quot;door&quot; will never find the pasture.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One who crosses over the &quot;way&quot; will reach the mansion. Anyone that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stops on the &quot;way&quot; and believes the &quot;way&quot; to be the end of his/her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; journey, will be out in the open without any shelter and a roof.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hot Tip (precise and pertinent)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jesus said; &quot;Not every one that says to me; `Lord, Lord,' will enter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of my Father, who is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in heaven.&quot; (Mt.7:21).

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;       MP: Could you please tell us just exactly where all these books and records are.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;       The clause: 'The

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;       Knowledge'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;       is very confusing; something /means/ something else but /is actually/ something else again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;       The second clause: ' and symbolizes the Destiny Formal or Theoretical determining the immaterial order and the life of the universe.' seems to tell me that in fact all this is metaphor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I have a saying: If something can't be put into plain English then it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; probably isn't true. I apply this standard to everything I read and

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hear, particularly when I am confronted with someone or something

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; who/which is 'holding forth' and purporting to describe my world for me.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
