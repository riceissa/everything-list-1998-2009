<br />Perhaps for the 3-person point of view. Trivialy idiotic from the
<br />
1-person point of view. I will not believe that you don't see the 
<br />
difference between Jacques Mallah *as* the person Jacques Mallah
<br />
(the one I'm talking to right now), and Jacques Mallah as an
<br />
input to Gaia or the Universal Wave function.
<br />
If you blur the relative inplementation frontier, then you confirm
<br />
my feeling you will solve your implementation problem by making 
<br />
the comp-level-of-substitution arbitrarily low.
<br />
If you are willing to accept an artificial brain then you or
<br />
your physician must make a cut somewhere.
<br />
Quite sure(°) that distinction is not even definissable from
<br />
the &quot;objective&quot; point of view (making the physician's decision 
<br />
hard, to say the least). But, unless you are the``Pure 
<br />
Empty Whole Consciousness Itself&quot;, if you are able to distinguish
<br />
just one thing from yourself, you, the 1-you !, will introduce,
<br />
happily or not, that distinction.
<br />
<br /><br />(°) I proved that. But a lot of people have foreseen that (Post, 
<br />
Turing, Benacerraf, Chihara, Wang, Reinhardt, and even Penrose in his
<br />
second book on the subject).
<br />

<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;	I don't quite follow you, but I don't really want to.  I think you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have just not absorbed the lesson that measure is proportional to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number of copies, *not* the number of '1st person' distinctions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />1) So you *do* understand the distinction, in some sense, don't you?.
<br />
<br />2) You don't follow me indeed. I DO believe that the measure is 
<br />
proportional to the number of copies. I just aknowledge that the notion
<br />
of copies is not easy to define (and I know you know too!). Now the concept
<br />
of &quot;first person&quot; (introduced in physics by Galileo, progressing a 
<br />
little bit with Einstein, progressing tremendously with Everett, IMO)
<br />
can at least be seen just as a philosophical tool helping to realise
<br />
the essential relativity of the (computational, quantum) states. 
<br />
So, although the measure is linked (plausibly ``proportionaly&quot;) to the
<br />
(transfinite?) number of copies, what we must explain, in fine, 
<br />
are our 1, 1-plural, experiences. 
<br />
<br />When you say (jokingly, for sure) ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;	I deny that such a [1/3]-distinction exists for me to be able to deny :-)
</em><br />
<br />... you are like that dentist who anesthetizes his own teeth before 
<br />
treating the teeth of his patient. This is quite coherent with your
<br />
other distinction blurring:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;	There's no difference between those two things.
</em><br />
<br />where the two things were  a) an infinitely long program
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) a short program + an infinitely long input.
<br />
<br />But here too I AGREE with you! You should really read more
<br />
carefully my posts before answering :-).
<br />
<br />I was talking about a short program/state (think about a state of
<br />
your artificial digital body existing with comp) relatively
<br />
to an indetermined (infinitely long) computation. That indetermined (infinitely long) computation looks more like a *set* of 
<br />
(infinitely long) computations. 
<br />
<br />By all your distinction-blurring you dissolve problems.
<br />
That old sort of trick does not solves problems.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From your URL it seems to me you are aware of the mind-body problem,
</em><br />
but like some physicist (BTW Congratulation!), you are still
<br />
trying to put the mind under the carpet.
<br />
<br />Let me ask you a question:
<br />
<br />Suppose that either:
<br />
<br />1) You are anesthetized, cooled, scanned, annihilated at A, and the 
<br />
information is send at B, where you are reconstituted.
<br />
<br />2) or You are anesthetized, cooled, scanned, annihilated at A, and the 
<br />
information is send at B and C. At B you are reconstituted, but at C the
<br />
information is destroyed.
<br />
<br />3) or You are anesthetized and put in the Schroedinger-cat's box.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From an older post of you I can infer that you believe you will survive
</em><br />
with certainty to 1). Will you survive with certainty 2) ? 
<br />
And, in that case, why will you not survive 3) ?
<br />
<br />Bruno
