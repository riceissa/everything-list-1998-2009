<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;What does &quot;logically possible&quot; mean?

<br />In the above I meant in the context of the larger phrase of: &quot;logically 
<br />
possible worlds&quot;.
<br />
<br />In the following call an individual [Ai,Dj] pair logic system Ln where &quot;i&quot;, 
<br />
&quot;j&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; can go from 1 to an uncountable infinity and all possible 
<br />
[Ai,D,j] pairings are considered.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;A proposition P is logically possible, relatively to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) a consistent set of beliefs A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) the choice of a deduction system D (and then consistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     means &quot;does not derive 0=1).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if the negation of P is not deductible (in D) from A.
</em><br />
<br />So in the larger phrase rather than dealing with a proposition P in 
<br />
relation to Ln I am exploring the range of [Ai,Dj] pairs that would be 
<br />
valid descriptions of &quot;worlds&quot;.  Call this sort after ensemble &quot;W&quot;.
<br />
<br />The further issue is induction and whether or not it fails for a particular Ln.
<br />
<br />Now suppose that &quot;belief&quot; set Ai includes the &quot;belief&quot; that Ai, and Dj for 
<br />
j over some range are both subject to random input from outside the system.
<br />
<br />I see no reason to exclude the Ln which have such an Ai from being a valid 
<br />
description of a World.  It is just an explicit expression of 
<br />
incompleteness rather than an implicit one.   Thus there could be two 
<br />
subsets of Ai in W.
<br />
<br />Is there any reason why the ensemble W can not for reasons of its own 
<br />
structure include Ai from both subsets and also insist that the 
<br />
incompletenesses both implicit and explicit be progressively resolved?  I 
<br />
know of none and to avoid a &quot;selection&quot; within the W it would seem that 
<br />
this arrangement is unavoidable.
<br />
<br />Thus induction would fail for all worlds in W because the logical 
<br />
foundation for all worlds would be constantly shifting from one Ln to 
<br />
another.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Concerning many theories, to say that a proposition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(or a set of propositions) A is logically possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is the same as saying that A is consistent (i.e you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cannot derive 0 = 1 from it),
</em><br />
<br />When talking of descriptions of worlds - in such a venue consistency would 
<br />
only be applicable to individual states [if at all] and not to successions 
<br />
of states.  The question then is can the All [which contains W] contain 
<br />
self inconsistent states such as one with a correctly and completely 
<br />
assembled two wheeled tricycle or a cat that is both alive and dead or the 
<br />
same thing having two valid sets of coordinates?  Now the All is complete 
<br />
so it is internally inconsistent so I see no way to argue against the 
<br />
presence of such states founded on inconsistent Ai.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  or saying that A has a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;model (a reality, a mathematical structure) satisfying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it.
</em><br />
<br />It seems that the idea that mathematical structures are actually consistent 
<br />
is nice but lacks any basis.
<br />
<br />To help place my model in context with the above:
<br />
<br />A core idea is the definitional pair relationship.  The [All,Nothing] pair 
<br />
is unique in being inherently unavoidable but still summing to no 
<br />
information.  Thus it has no initiation and no end.
<br />
<br />Another core idea is: Is there a meaningful question the Nothing must 
<br />
resolve?   The answer to this is: Yes there is:  The Nothing either 
<br />
continues [persists], or it does not.   The answer must be inherent in the 
<br />
information within the Nothing but there is none in there by 
<br />
definition.  Therefore the Nothing is incomplete - it can not resolve any 
<br />
meaningful question.  But in this case it must do so.  The only reservoir 
<br />
of information is the All.   Therefore it must breach the barrier between 
<br />
itself and the All.  In doing so it losses contact with what it was [an Ln 
<br />
shift] and becomes an evolving [including successive Ln shifts] - a 
<br />
multiverse - within the All.  Since the [All,Nothing] is as above an 
<br />
unavoidable definitional pair a &quot;new&quot; Nothing simultaneously replaces the 
<br />
old one.  The cycle repeats. The cycle always was and always will be and 
<br />
the All contains an infinite number of these Somethings all evolving 
<br />
towards completeness.  This produces waves of &quot;physical reality&quot; passing 
<br />
through a random sequence of states [including Ln shifts as per 
<br />
above].   The Somethings evolve because of their own incompleteness and the 
<br />
need for no selection no net information within the All.  The evolution 
<br />
must be random because of no selection and the All is internally 
<br />
inconsistent since it is complete.
<br />
