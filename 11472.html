<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It's one of my favourite lines from Hume!....  but the issue does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; live
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; quite so clearly into the 21st century. We now have words and much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; neuroscience pinning down subjective experience to the operation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; small
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; groups of cells and hence, likely, single cells. It's entirely cranial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CNS.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Cortical, Basal, Cerebellum, upper brain stem. So....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Q If empiricism demands phenomenal consciousness as the source of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; scientific evidence (close your eyes and see what evidence is left.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; QED.) of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the science of the appearance of things, then what is phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness itself evidence of?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is misrepresenting science.  Science doesn't aim at the appearance of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things.  It uses appearance, i.e. empirical evidence, to test models which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; go beyond the appearance.
</em><br />
<br />This belief is metaphysics of the kind that has got us into this mess and of
<br />
the kind destined to go into the fire along with all the other bollocks of
<br />
science folly.
<br />
<br />You are assuming laws of appearances drive the universe. You cannot justify
<br />
this any better than you could justify the existence of the tooth fairy. The
<br />
utility of the laws in predicting appearances is just and only that. End of
<br />
story. If what you say is true then when we opened up a brain we'd see the
<br />
appearances! We don't, we see brain material.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If they didn't the models would be mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; catalogues of data.  Phenomenal consciousness is no different.
</em><br />
<br />So you have some sort of misty eyed attachment to the laws that means you'd
<br />
ignore blaring evidence just so you're comfy? I want explanations not deemed
<br />
truth! If that means admitting we've screwed up our evidence system....so be
<br />
it.... (= if we have to let go of 'phlogiston', fine) 
<br />
<br />And anyway....Yes it is VERY VERY different. Nowhere else in science do you
<br />
get 2 presentations of data and ignore one of them. Whatever is claimed
<br />
found by neural correlates of consciousness (the science you describe) is
<br />
neglected everywhere else in science. For example, if mind is a neural
<br />
correlate of brain material, what is the equivalent correlate of, say,
<br />
coffee cup behaviour? This inconsistency is simply neglected within science
<br />
for no reason. If neural correlates are describing mind in any truly
<br />
explanatory way then we should be able to use it to make scientifically
<br />
supportable claims for whatever passes for the &quot;something correlates of
<br />
coffeecup_ness&quot;, even though coffee cups can't actually confirm it. Being a
<br />
coffee cup may not entail any experiential life but that is not the point.
<br />
The point is being able to make a justified scientific statement about it.
<br />
All that can be scientifically claimed about the cup is that there are no
<br />
neurons there, so there are no _human_ type experiences. This is not a claim
<br />
about the fundamental physics of phenomenality in any other context such as
<br />
a coffee cup. For example if the cup is hot versus cold, what might the
<br />
difference in experience be? Description (causality apparent in appearances)
<br />
is not explanation (underlying causality). Correlation is not causation.
<br />
Cakes are not caused by cake recipes....etc.etc.etc... round we go again....
<br />
<br />The underlying physics (of which we are constructed) generates the
<br />
phenomenality (mind), not a bunch of rules generated by correlating the
<br />
appearances supplied BY it. Just like the underlying causality makes a mass
<br />
appear like F = MA is being used to drive it. Saying NCC says anything about
<br />
what MIND is like using F= MA to make a brick fly. It doesn't make the brick
<br />
fly - it says what it will look like to us if it does.
<br />
<br />Here's the killer question: Can I build an inorganic artifact out of
<br />
whatever comes out of neural correlates science? NO. Good for pathology
<br />
detection (such as the coffee cup pathology above) but no use anywhere else.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
Colin
