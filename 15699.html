Bruno and Kim,
<br />
<br />enjoyable discours by two math.-ly impaired minds (excuse me Kim!) - I met
<br />
several youngsters (up to 70 y.o.) who simply had no 'pitch' to math - yet
<br />
were good smart artists, even business(wo)men, parents and technicians (not
<br />
so with politicians, they are not what I call 'smart').
<br />
I was deemed at 15 &quot;the best mathemathician in the school&quot;, because I was
<br />
lazy to do my homework and was summoned to recite the cosin rule (whatever
<br />
these terms are in English) and I invented a (not quite fitting?) other one
<br />
on location.
<br />
Then I continued 'not learning' and fell back in college, where my elective
<br />
for a chemical Ph.D. was math.
<br />
*
<br />
People are different, Fermi 'dreamed up' a complete electric circuit without
<br />
the designing work, Mozart popped out a full piece of performable music,
<br />
Napoleon &quot;just knew&quot; how to win a battle, Michelangelo &quot;saw&quot; the Moses
<br />
statue within the block of marble, to just chip off the excessive material.
<br />
Etc.
<br />
Most of them had no comprehension to math problems (may be Fermi had?).
<br />
It is like a musical gift, or even a good pich. BTW, many mathematicians
<br />
have a good musical talent, too, beside many have a little 'twitch' in their
<br />
mind for common things.
<br />
When Goedel had to apply for US nationalization, he was thoroughly &quot;trained&quot;
<br />
by friends not to say &quot;anything&quot; except for the shortest reply to the very
<br />
questions (knowing him...). The examining US attorney asked him a question
<br />
about the Constitution. Goedel: (after a little musing): &quot;well, I can tell
<br />
you what is wrong with the Constitution...&quot; - The attorney (who was friendly
<br />
warned) laughed and let him pass.
<br />
*
<br />
Happy New Year!
<br />
John

<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Looks like I have to say &quot;Yes, Doctor&quot; again!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Good!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Tell me first if you have been once mentally or physically raped or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tortured by a mathematician.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. When I was in first class, the school teacher said &quot;Stand up and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recite your 7 times table&quot;. I became anxiety-struck, got sweaty palms and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sat down. I think I may have cried. I think I should find this person and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bring them to justice, what do you say?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The 7 times table? It is a real bastard! If this was a bit systematic, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can bring him or them to justice. Only be sure the judge will not ask you to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stand up and recite the seven times table ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course there is nothing wrong that a teacher ask a student to stand up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and recite the seven times table, but from what has followed and from your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; previews posts and from my experience I can guess it was a bit more than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Later on, it was discovered that the part of my brain that does mathematics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had somehow mapped itself to the musical part, possibly even at that very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment - so that the musical perception became more finely-grained while the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maths-perception missed out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   I kid you not, a psychologist told me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Friedrich Gauss said that math is the most easy of all the sciences, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think he is right.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Yes, but he and you probably were not physically abused or tortured by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your primary school maths teachers the way I was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, I could say that I have been more, and less, lucky.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; More lucky because in primary school, and in high school, I have been in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; front of real gentle and good mathematicians almost all the time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This has given to me a solid base.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Less lucky because I have been tortured at university, once by a logician
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in 1977, and again by the same manipulator in 1994, (with a geometer and a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosopher, who were strictly speaking just other victims of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logicians, (actually a brilliant and ingenuous manipulator).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can imagine the scandal. It is so big, that they use, still today a lot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of energy to hide it. for just one example which is verifiable on the net,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when I got the price of the best thesis in Paris in 1998, see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/mde/prix/janv99.html">http://www.lemonde.fr/mde/prix/janv99.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they have succeeded, from Brussels, to make that price (money+the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; publication of the thesis+ promotion of the thesis) disappear. I don't even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; figure in the list of ancient laureates, see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/mde/prix/ancienslaureats.html">http://www.lemonde.fr/mde/prix/ancienslaureats.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Instead of promotion I got life long defamation and calumnies. The only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation I got from Paris has been: c'est la vie!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am more lucky than you, Kim, because I was an adult, and all in all, they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have only succeeded in deepening my research, in broadening my inquiry, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; motivating me eventually to address myself to the most impartial judge ever,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universal machine. They have not succeed to break down my enthusiasm for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long, and they have made me eventually an infinitely patient teacher.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a very positive nature in life, which makes me extract the positive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things even from the worst.  I have still a little handicap for finishing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paper, though, or deciding when a text is finished, and that is why I like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oral or electronical talk. Tom Caylor asked me why I don't submit papers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the reason is there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is probably not obvious to find something new in math, but it is easy to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apprehend the discovery of others. That needs only work and patience, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some taste, but you are musician and I am sure you have the taste for at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least some part of math.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The part that where they drop a silicon chip into my brain with the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole of mathematics and computational science on it, plus the mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; software to run it - and I simply understand all of it without going to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; monumental effort of learning it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How far off can that be?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The pleasure is in the (long) path (I'm afraid). Note that a math book, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course or a conversation is already a good approximation of this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Math is very large. Almost all tastes can be recompensed. Baroc,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Classical, Jazz, Pop, Techno, Melodic, High, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All geometers like beauty. All logicians like mystery (but only one half of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the logicians admit the fact).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematicians of different sensibilities can be terrible among themselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and with their students. It is very sad!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Like the one I copped when I was in first class who publicly humiliated me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and shorted my math motherboard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no wonder I need a new, fully digital, artificial brain. This one comes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PRE-loaded with the whole of mathematics!!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In that case your head will explode into a multiverse. It could be a good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing, but let us proceed more carefully.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will do KIM 2.2 asap (= tomorrow, or Sunday, or Monday). It introduces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the key difference between first person and third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person experiences/discourses.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   We cannot really know what a person experience is, so we will contend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ourselves for a time with their discourses (including silences).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This sounds like the fun part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are very kind and sensible, it seems to me,  like most victim of (math)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; harassment. Harasser acts by jealousy and sadism, they want to destroy what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they hoped to be but believes they can't be, in general because they have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been themselves victim of harassment.  I am sure in this list some other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have been trapped in similar circumstances. It is widespread with varying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; degrees. I think the circumstances unite so we can help each other,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Best,
