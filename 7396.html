Dear Lee,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you familiar with any of the experiments that have been performed 
<br />
regarding &quot;quantum counterfactuals&quot; or &quot;null measurements&quot;? It turns out 
<br />
that the fact that some particular measure *was not made* counts just as 
<br />
much, and thus affects the results of a measurement, of an actual 
<br />
measurement that was made. Thus information of any occurrence or 
<br />
non-occurrence of a measure of a QM system, coded in an OM, will make a 
<br />
difference that can not be hand waved away.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why I am introducing the notion of a witness.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interleaving...
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm skeptical of &quot;continuity&quot; requirements. Now I do not believe in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Greg Egan's equations in &quot;Permutation City&quot;: according to a premise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; of the story, it order to obtain the you of tomorrow, there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; short-cut alternative to just letting you run.  And that is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; determine the solutions of an immense number of differential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; equations that do not in fact emulate your intermediary states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; If this were so, then it may be that you could discontinuously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; skip past all of tonight and tomorrow's experiences, and just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; start living by directly experiencing the day after that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     Does it not seem that the continuity requirement is such that it only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; comes up when we consider either an external 3rd person P.o.V. of a OM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; chaining P.o.V. or an internal 1st person of a memory of having changed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one's mind about something is some other OM?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, it does seem to come up under both points of view. For some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason I can't fathom. To me, there is no use of it either way:
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this &quot;unfathomness&quot; not bother you? It seems to me that we might be 
<br />
able to navigate our way through this, if we are careful and faithfull to 
<br />
our findings are we go. ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's take the first-person point of view first. What if in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe it so happened that none of your Monday OMs existed? I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say that you would have Sunday's OMs followed by Tuesday's OMs,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and be none-the-wiser. The discontinuity would not be important
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at all.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the discontinuity is irrelevant if and only if the quantity 
<br />
of &quot;duration&quot; coded into the OM is important. It can be easily argued that 
<br />
the duration of coherence of a QM system strongly affects the kinds of 
<br />
interactions that it may have, therefor if the content of an OM codes 
<br />
anything having to do with QM system in interaction, the duration of the OM 
<br />
chaining will matter.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there is obviously, an invariance with respect to 
<br />
&quot;reparametrizations&quot; involved. For example, for a given set of OMs, so long 
<br />
as the total content is the same, it does not matter is a week is made up 
<br />
one one day or seven!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I considered the third-person view above, but here's more: *If*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something weird like Greg Egan investigated were true, then one's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences could be discontinuous. However, as actual machines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we compute all our intermediate states, and so experience is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuous (no matter how it may seem via memory erasure or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain malfunction).
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are going to play around with the idea of OMs, then it is 
<br />
necessary that those OMs contain or code, somehow, all the relevant 
<br />
experiences that some observer might have. If we are going to seriously 
<br />
entain this toy model has having something to do with the world we 
<br />
experience, then somewhere somehow it has to account for the empirical 
<br />
facts, otherwise... ;-)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Egan's idea is &quot;true&quot;, it does not matter, from a 3rd PoV the OMs can 
<br />
be implemented in any order, all that matters is the information that they 
<br />
code.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (In Repeated Experience, this characteristic is not present. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your behavior today is a reenactment of an original calculation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from billions of years ago, then in principle it would be possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for you to experience Sunday, then be terminated, and then a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recorded state from the original Tuesday billions of years ago
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; commenced.)
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that closed-time-like-loops are only a problem if:
<br />
<br />1) OMs code some kind of trace of all OMs that would be in its causal &quot;past&quot;
<br />
<br />and
<br />
<br />2) There is no upperbound on the memory space used so that no contradiction 
<br />
will *ever* obtain.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repeted experience scenario only causes contradiction IF somehow a 
<br />
memory of a previous emulation remains; &quot;Ground Hog Day&quot; style.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     If we erase our memories of having done the loathsome
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; event after actually going through it, do we not need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; also erase the memory of any other witness that might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; able to remind us of the event?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, witnesses can be bought off, or, where I come from, snuffed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out. So long as they keep their traps shut, see, I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; start to wonder about it. But anyway, having them tell me in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all sincerity about things I don't remember isn't anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *like* actually having had the experiences:  suppose that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convince me that the Nazis ran a version of me in 1944 and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tortured the bejesus out of me---well, I'd rather listen to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your story a thousand times than actually go through the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alleged experience.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Lee, you have to account for all possible forms of witnesses, not 
<br />
just human ones! Please take a look at the following:

<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point is highly counter intuitive, explaining why it might not have 
<br />
come out in this thread so far, but the null and &quot;nondemolition&quot; 
<br />
measurements arre very much a reality, having been experimentaly found and 
<br />
replicated.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     How can a OM encode a trace of other OMs such that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can capture the notion of &quot;remembering something&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nature has given our brains a way, somehow. But remember,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those do not need to be veridical OMs. In principle you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can insert the memory of me having been elected president
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into my brain. Doesn't make it so at all.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are just restateting of the COMP thesis, consiousness' content in 
<br />
hardware independent. Be careful what you assume.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Yes, yes, yes, I know: in some universe I *was* elected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; president. But truly, that's irrelevant.)
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in another, you where tortured to death, we are assuming *all* 
<br />
possible OMs related to Lee Cordin exist a priori. It seems that we only 
<br />
disallow OMs that include aspects that would contradict Lee Corbin's 
<br />
existence. Those would code some other entities OM, maybe. ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     What, exactly makes me &quot;me&quot;? Is it &quot;I am what I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; remember myself to be&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say yes. If we got hold of Napoleon's memories and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inserted them in your brain while discarding SPK's original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones, then Napoleon would be alive and you'd be dead.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife might not notice a difference but my mother would! Here the role 
<br />
of entities that have OMs of their own and continuity requirements MUST be 
<br />
taken into account, thus the idea of witnesses can not be dismissed!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     I don't have any problem believing that I *am* all of my duplicates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; either, so long as there is some way that the &quot;me&quot; that I remember now 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be smoothly continued within the world of a duplicate *and* all witnesses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; agree that I did all that I claim I did with in that world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Like I said, witnesses aren't important, and are expendable. Why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do you care about witnesses? Besides, the quality of your life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over the next few minutes is not affected by whether or not it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is true that God created the world 30 seconds ago (and so you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never had any experiences, and even your mother and father are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not reliable witnesses).
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that I have dispelled that incorrect assumption. If not, we can 
<br />
discuss it further. ;-)
