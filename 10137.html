<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; From: Bruno Marchal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; All we need to *reason* for getting consequence of comp is that such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; substitution is *in principle* possible. Theoreticians does that, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; many &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fields. I insist that the UDA (Universal Dovetailer Argument) is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the notion of generalized brain: you could say that your brain in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; entire galaxy. By comp this entails the entire galaxy is turing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; emulable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; then, this is enough to say the platonic UD will go through your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;generalized&quot; brain soon or later (in term of number of steps), and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; enough to understand that comp makes obligatory that the laws of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; emerge from the relation existing among numbers (that + other steps 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasoning of course). The impracticality of substitution is just not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relevant to throw out the theoretical consequences. Then comp can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; tested
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experimentally due to others consequences (like the observable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; interference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; among many computations, etc.). OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have an idea (or dream) for some time. Let's call it the &quot;perfect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument&quot; (PUA).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The purpose of PUA is to produce a perfect universe (a perfect world 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any crimes, any bad things, any natural disasters ... etc.).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's as follows:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1) I teleport myself to the origin of the universe.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Are you sure that this is possible, even just in principle? Actually, 
<br />
just to show me that it could be possible in principle you have to give 
<br />
me your fundamental assumptions. Actually it looks like you are 
<br />
assuming the following:
<br />
a) there is a physical universe (well, with comp this is already 
<br />
impossible)
<br />
b) accepting &quot;a)&quot; you assume that that universe has an origin (this 
<br />
would be impossible even in principle in case there is no origin)
<br />
c) Accepting &quot;a)&quot; and &quot;b)&quot; you assume &quot;physical laws&quot; making time 
<br />
travel possible (which is of course controversial;  this could be in 
<br />
principle possible with very special assumption, which could also be 
<br />
false in principle with other assumption).
<br />
If you do theoretical reasonings you have to make clear the assumptions 
<br />
which are making things &quot;possible in principle&quot;. Up to here, I can 
<br />
follow you (I can imagine such fundamental assumptions).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (2) I adjust some parameters of the universe. (This is like adjusting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parameters in a modern PC program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so that you can get the perfect result when running the program.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (3) The adjustment changes the whole universe immediately and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; becomes perfect.
</em><br />
<br />Your &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; are unfortunately definitely impossible with comp 
<br />
without deciding your PU (your Perfect Universe) being trivial. This is 
<br />
not obvious (but follows from diagonalization similar to those I have 
<br />
already illustrated). Let me just say that it can be shown that if you 
<br />
want your PU enough rich for Universal machine to appear, then you 
<br />
cannot, even in principle, filter those &quot;bad&quot; machines will easily 
<br />
makes your PU unperfect.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; PUA is possible in principle, right? Does it agree to Comp. and UDA?
</em><br />
<br />So the PUA *is* incompatible with comp. The most basic contradiction is 
<br />
given by the consequence of the UDA: there is no physical universe: 
<br />
only computations/dreams some of which &quot;coheres&quot; so as to provides 
<br />
local first person plural notion supervening on them. But even in the 
<br />
case those coherence would define &quot;for all practical purposes&quot; a 
<br />
&quot;physical universe&quot;, and even if it has some sort of physical origin 
<br />
and you can teleport yourself to its origin, the laws of computer 
<br />
science will eventually prevent you of reprogramming &quot;the universe&quot; to 
<br />
satisfy your goal of making it perfect.
<br />
<br />Now, honestly this is a good news. &quot;Perfection&quot; is a virtue, and comp 
<br />
makes it impossible to define any virtue from inside the &quot;universe&quot;, 
<br />
and this saves our freeness, and explains why even Gods cannot conceive 
<br />
&quot;sufficiently rich&quot; universe with build-in perfection.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; From: Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do you believe that IF you vanished at point A and a copy of you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; created at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; point B who was physically and mentally similar to the original to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; extent as if you had walked from A to B you would have survived? If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; answer &quot;no&quot; then you are opening yourself up to the possibility that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not survive the walk either. If you argue that the copy might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physiacally the same but mentally different then you are saying there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some non-physical basis to identity which survives walking but not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; teleportation, which I suppose is possible, but there is no reason to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; believe that such a strange thing would or could have evolved.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can't compare teleportation of human beings with walking since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teleportation is still a fiction now.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But classical teleportation is possible in principle once we assume 
<br />
comp. Now I don't want to argue for comp, but there is no contradiction 
<br />
between comp and any known facts. To be sure I did believe in non-comp 
<br />
at the time I thought that classical mechanics was valid, but the 
<br />
quantum kills all the non-comp aspect of physics, until now.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's also unknown if there is something non-physical in human (or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; living)
</em><br />
<br />We don't know, it is a theory. And then it is possible to prove in that 
<br />
theory that IF comp is true then we will never known it &quot;in any third 
<br />
person communicable ways&quot;. Comp is a theological (in the sense of the 
<br />
greeks, not in the christian sense) belief which forces rationalists to 
<br />
accept that non-comp could be true. A doctor would be criminal to give 
<br />
to his/her (non dying) patient an artificial brain without his/her 
<br />
patient's consent. No computationalist (unless mad or ignorant) would 
<br />
ever force any-soul to believe in comp. Comp is a provably *personal* 
<br />
matter.
