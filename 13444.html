<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How do you derive (a) ethics and (b) human-friendly ethics from reflective

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intelligence?  I don't see why an AI should decide to destroy the world,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; save the world, or do anything at all to the world, unless it started
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; off
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with axioms and goals which pushed it in a particular direction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When reflective intelligence is applied to cognitive systems which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason about teleological concepts (which include values, motivations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc) the result is conscious 'feelings'.  Reflective intelligence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recall, is the ability to correctly reason about cognitive systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When applied to cognitive systems reasoning about teleological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concepts this means the ability to correctly determine the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; motivational 'states' of self and others - as mentioned - doing this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rapidly and accuracy generates 'feelings'.  Since, as has been known
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since Hume, feelings are what ground ethics, the generation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feelings which represent accurate tokens about motivational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; automatically leads to ethical behaviour.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Determining the motivational states of others does not necessarily involve
<br />
feelings or empathy. It has been historically very easy to assume that other
<br />
species or certain members of our own species either lack feelings or, if
<br />
they have them, it doesn't matter. Moreover, this hasn't prevented people
<br />
from determining the motivations of inferior beings in order to exploit
<br />
them. So although having feelings may be necessary for ethical behaviour, it
<br />
is not sufficient.
<br />
<br />Bad behaviour in humans is due to a deficit in reflective
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence.  It is known for instance, that psychopaths have great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficulty perceiving fear and sadness and negative motivational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states in general.  Correct representation of motivational states is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlated with ethical behaviour.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Psychopaths are often very good at understanding other peoples' feelings, as
<br />
evidenced by their ability to manipulate them. The main problem is that they
<br />
don't *care* about other people; they seem to lack the ability to be moved
<br />
by other peoples' emotions and lack the ability to experience emotions such
<br />
as guilt. But this isn't part of a general inability to feel emotion, as
<br />
they often present as enraged, entitled, depressed, suicidal, etc., and
<br />
these emotions are certainly enough to motivate them. Psychopaths have a
<br />
slightly different set of emotions, regulated in a different way compared to
<br />
the rest of us, but are otherwise cognitively intact.
<br />
<br />Thus it appears that reflective
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence is automatically correlated with ethical behaviour.  Bear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in mind, as I mentioned that: (1) There are in fact three kinds of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general intelligence, and only one of them ('reflective intelligence')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is correlated with ethics.    The other two are not.  A deficit in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reflective intelligence does not affect the other two types of general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence (which is why for instance psychopaths could still score
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; highly in IQ tests).  And (2) Reflective intelligence in human beings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is quite weak.  This is the reason why intelligence does not appear to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be much correlated with ethics in humans.  But this fact in no way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refutes the idea that a system with full and strong reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence would automatically be ethical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps I haven't quite understood your definition of reflective
<br />
intelligence. It seems to me quite possible to &quot;correctly reason about
<br />
cognitive systems&quot;, at least well enough to predict their behaviour to a
<br />
useful degree, and yet not care at all about what happens to them.
<br />
Furthermore, it seems possible to me to do this without even suspecting that
<br />
the cognitive system is conscious, or at least without being sure that it is
<br />
conscious.
