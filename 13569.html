Yes that is the issue and I don't think I read all the postings 
<br />
on that thread at the time.
<br />
SP [Feb 21]: 'It is a complicated issue'
<br />
<br />MP: Yep!
<br />
<br />SP: 'So how do I know I'm not that special kind of
<br />
zombie or partial zombie now? I feel absolutely sure that I am 
<br />
not but then
<br />
I would think that, wouldn't I?'
<br />
<br />MP: I think the way this asifism thread has been going, it looks 
<br />
like we have
<br />
A/	1POV which we experience and remember, and
<br />
B/	3POV which is a construction from inference and on-going, 
<br />
informal, Turing tests of everyone we know.
<br />
<br />We can never _know for certain_ that the other person is aware 
<br />
of being here now in the same way that we ourselves are but we 
<br />
get a leg-up from the mirror neurons that seem able to recognise 
<br />
and emulate the behaviour sequences of people we see. [This is 
<br />
the basis of most human learning, and the brain-side locus of 
<br />
memetic existence, but that's another story.]
<br />
<br />It is basically that people act like we do and share the same 
<br />
description of the world which leads us to believe they are 
<br />
conscious just like we are, and that's it! End of story; no 
<br />
rocket science involved.
<br />
<br />For what it is worth, my current surmise on blindsight: the 
<br />
reason sufferers cannot report seeing the stimulus but seem to 
<br />
act as if they ARE seeing it/them is to do with timing; whatever 
<br />
it is that updates that part of their model of self in the world 
<br />
which would be *the representation of their 3D spatial 
<br />
relationship to the stimulus* is out of kilter.
<br />
Given that the strongest candidate for binding is synchronous, 
<br />
resonant, mutual and reciprocal stimulation patterns, my guess 
<br />
is that damage of some sort is preventing incorporation into the 
<br />
model of the resonance patterns which embody that/those 
<br />
aspects/s of the representation. I think that means the damage 
<br />
could be in 'white matter', ie the communication between 
<br />
cortical areas rather than within them. If the person is able to 
<br />
see other parts of their visual field clearly then _clearly_ 
<br />
there must be effective linkage between the visual cortex and 
<br />
the regions controlling eye movements. This implies that 
<br />
information _about_ stimuli in the blinded part of the visual 
<br />
field is available to some areas of visual cortex and thus  may 
<br />
also be available from there to temporal lobe regions dealing 
<br />
with language.
<br />
<br />If the above is the case, and I reckon it is quite reasonable to 
<br />
think so, then what the blind sight patients describe is 
<br />
understandable. They can look for something which is described 
<br />
to them sufficiently for the verbal information to evoke the 
<br />
working memory storage of task and target information, and this 
<br />
can effect the kind of unconscious searching activity which we 
<br />
are used to. Well I am used to it any way! I hunt around the 
<br />
house or garden for something named and may have no clearly 
<br />
conscious pre-conceived image of it for example my offspring are 
<br />
forever misplacing hair brushes, shoes, and so forth and I often 
<br />
have the experience of looking at the place they turn out to be 
<br />
- which strangely enough is always the last place I think to 
<br />
look for them :-0 and the item just seems to appear out of nowhere.
<br />
<br />The work of Benjamin Libet and others has shown that conscious 
<br />
registration of something usually follows about 0.4 or 0.5 
<br />
second after the primary sensory response occurs. With 
<br />
blindsight patients the primary sensory response is occurring 
<br />
and affecting various secondary areas in a useful way but not 
<br />
all of that is available to update the navigational self-model.
<br />
<br />This ties in with Oliver Sachs's work with many patients who 
<br />
presented with unique and interesting deficiencies of awareness 
<br />
who's autopsies revealed specific lesions within their brains. 
<br />
It conforms with the idea that conscious mental experience is 
<br />
what it is like to be certain processes within the brain. It 
<br />
does not conform with the idea that a 'zombie' could be an 
<br />
effective member of society. The key issue is that in order to 
<br />
function as an effective, self-preserving, autonomous being, a 
<br />
human has to be able to review her actions as soon as they occur 
<br />
and be able to correct and behaviour that is sub optimal or not 
<br />
in line with prior planning. Consciousness is simply what it is 
<br />
like to be this reviewing process.
