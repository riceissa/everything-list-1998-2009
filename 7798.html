<br />Well I think you are right. Its a discipline.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Indeed, once you understandenough logic you understand that even in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;mathematics, few &quot;text&quot; can have an univocal interpretation and it helps

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;you to be cautious in front of any &quot;literal&quot; interpretation of any text.
</em><br />
<br />yes. I think there are problems of interpretation in all fields of enquiry. 
<br />
Lets distinguish between 'interpretations' that are handed down, and 
<br />
accidental interpretations that were wrong, or misleading ala Pythagoras's 
<br />
definition of a point, which I understand led to stagnation in geometry for 
<br />
some time. The two are different in the sense that the latter is open to 
<br />
change when the problem is established and understood.
<br />
<br />Futhermore, with regards to formal logic, there is some controversy over how 
<br />
logical operators should be interpreted I gather. Indeed whilst it is 
<br />
possible to derive all operators from just one (Sheffer's I think), and thus 
<br />
reason to think that this operator is fundamental in some way, its 
<br />
interpretation however is clearly a combination of 'english' operators. 
<br />
There doesnt appear to be a strict isomorphism between language and logic.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Note that before Descartes some other were reasoning nicely to.
</em><br />
<br />Ofcourse. Where there are homosapiens, you will no doubt find decent 
<br />
reasoning.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Note that Descartes miss logic, due to the exaggeration of many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;scholastic&quot; logicians, but he is really a good reasoner (which by the way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;shows we don't need logic to be a good reasoner).
</em><br />
<br />I think Descartes is much maligned actually. Sure, his attempt to rebuild 
<br />
the world from the cogito fails, but his theology and philosophy really just 
<br />
form a tiny part of his oevre. His work in analytical geometry is testament 
<br />
to how good a mathematician he was. His study of algebra and curves has been 
<br />
of unquestionable use to the world.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Actually I don't believe in science at all. I believe just in honest and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;curious people capable of trying to make clear and sharable their ideas 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and works.
</em><br />
<br />Knowledge by any means! I think knowledge in science has a pragmatic 
<br />
definition. Ideally, a theory has authority over its field to the degree to 
<br />
which it is of use. More predictive theories replace older ones, whether or 
<br />
not the older ones strictly speaking have been falsified. (Newton vs. 
<br />
Einstein). I follow the argument Hilary Putnam makes in 'The &quot;Corroboration&quot; 
<br />
of Theories', that intertheoretic dependency renders falsifiability 
<br />
impossible for most theories. I certainly agree with Feyerabend, and many 
<br />
others, that scientists usually dont (and shouldnt) worry about 
<br />
falsifiability too much. Given they shouldnt, and dont, it becomes somewhat 
<br />
fustrating to see epirical falsification wielded as some great method other 
<br />
disciplines ignore. So do scientists very often.
<br />
<br /><br />The point is that there isnt a 'unique' method that garauntees futhering 
<br />
knowledge. There are many ways of understanding, and many ways of enquiring. 
<br />
How much did relative space/time as concept cost compared to the non 
<br />
descovery of the Higgs Boson?
<br />
<br />Regards Chris.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;No. But then your definition of theology is perhaps a little bit to much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;a contingent matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Perhaps the word &quot;theology&quot; has too many connotations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I agree largely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I think the correct distinction to make between what people seem to mean 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;wrt the religion/science dispute is between 'recieved wisdom' and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;'reasoned wisdom'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Religion and theology begin to encroach on liberty when the wisdom is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;'recieved'. When things are true 'because that is how it is written'. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;leaves little space for question or change.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree. Thanks for mentioning this important point. Here I deeply believed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that just teaching logic could help people. Indeed, once you understand 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;enough logic you understand that even in mathematics, few &quot;text&quot; can have

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Theology takes on a different character in the hands of a Descartes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;because he reasons for his ideas. In doing so he opens himself up for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;criticism and refutation. We can analyse his methodology and deductive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;accuracy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Absolutely. Note that before Descartes some other were reasoning nicely to. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am tring to have a better understanding of the thread Plato, Plotin, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Proclus and other neo-platonists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Note that Descartes miss logic, due to the exaggeration of many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;scholastic&quot; logicians, but he is really a good reasoner (which by the way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shows we don't need logic to be a good reasoner).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Science can and does adopt sometimes a 'received' methodology. There is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;prevailing world view, a chauvanism towards certain methodologies. A bias 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;towards rewarding certain research projects over others. There seems to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;little understanding that paradigmatic shifts in science often come from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;left field. Theories are judged to an extent on how well they fit in to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the current model - however many difficulties that model is encountering.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;As you point out, many ideas here have mystical consequences really. They 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;are reasoned for however. Whilst life after death is common to many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;religious and philsophical models, in those presented here we can see how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the conclusions are arrived at and why.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Exactly. An expression like &quot;quantum immortality&quot; *is* theological. To 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;negate this consists in making science not only theological again, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dogmatically so!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;For me thats a critical difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I rarely share opinions with &quot;post-modernist&quot; and other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;deconstructivists&quot;, but I do share with some of them the idea that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;frontier between fields are  biological-cultural, just locally useful, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constructions. Actually I don't believe in science at all. I believe just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in honest and curious people capable of trying to make clear and sharable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their ideas and works.  Some gardiners and parapsychologist(*) can be more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rigorous than mathematician and physicists. It is really a question of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;attitude.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(*) I am thinking to that chef-d'oeuvre of science: &quot;In search of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Light&quot; by Suzanne Blackmore (much more rigorous than her more recent book 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on Memes, actually). The original discovery that lucid dreaming can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tested in laboratory (in a third person verifiable way) has been done by a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;parapsychologist (Hearne). The scientific community will gives the credit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to a neuroscientist and mathematician though, Laberge, when he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(re)published the results in &quot;scientific&quot; journal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Some mathematician acts like Pavlov Dog. They dismiss any text has non 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;serious if some words appears in it, like &quot;mind&quot;, &quot;quantum&quot; (sic).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Empirically I have discovered that engineers are most of the time more open 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to serious reasoning on fundamental questions. In science they still exist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;popes&quot;, and truth need to wait they leaves the planet to progress. I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not alluding to anything personal here, but what I say is clear from any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;books on the history of sciences.
