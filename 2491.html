<em class="quotelev1">&gt;things I tend to find unclear in your texts.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thank you.       (Hereafter TE means &quot;Thought Experiment&quot;)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To derive consequences we need to know the assumptions. Of course, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;holds for thought experiments as well. Without defining delays you cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;derive something from delays.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You have no problem (according to your post) with the TE where you 
<br />
are  annihilated in Brussels and reconstitute simultaneously at W 
<br />
and at M. (TE1)              
<br />
<br />In the TE with delay, it is the same TE except that now you are
<br />
reconstitute in W, and only one year later (let us say) you are
<br />
reconstitute at M. (TE2)
<br />
<br />It is a thought experiment. You must imagine I am really proposing you
<br />
that experiment, and I am using the expression &quot;one year&quot; in
<br />
the traditionnal english sense.
<br />
<br />It is precise (although admittedly not formal) because with
<br />
comp I can in principle do the experience.
<br />
<br />My question is &quot;knowing that you are at Brussels before the 
<br />
experience, are your expectation the same in TE1 and TE2?
<br />
<br />I am using the word &quot;delay&quot; in the english traditional sense,
<br />
which is all what is need in the thought experiment.
<br />
<br />Of course if you have still not understand more than 2/15
<br />
of the UDA TE, I can believe the rest of my work
<br />
*must* appear unclear.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What is a &quot;correct level of substitution&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />People of the list will be bored if I repeat this again. 
<br />
I explain what is a correct level of substitution each time
<br />
I recall the definition of COMP.
<br />
(This prove BTW you don't have read neither ma thesis, nor
<br />
my paper CC&amp;Q, nor the UDA posts.)
<br />
<br /><br />Those who knows can skip what follows. Of course some revisal can be
<br />
helpful.
<br />
<br />Suppose that the neurophilosophers (like the Churchland, 
<br />
Francis Crick, ...) are 
<br />
correct. Then you can survive with an artificial brain which emulates
<br />
your neurons. In that case the &quot;correct level of substitution&quot; is
<br />
roughly speaking the level of neurons.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Suppose you &quot;survive&quot; only through a simulation of
<br />
the big bang at the level of the quantum superstring, membrane, etc. 
<br />
then the &quot;correct level of substitution&quot; is the level of the quantum
<br />
superstring, membrane, etc. 
<br />
<br />Remember the definition of COMP, it says that *there exists* such a
<br />
level. It does not say that &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot; *is* the correct level.
<br />
It is a sort of admission of ignorance. This ignorance is 
<br />
fundamental. Indeed it  has been shown (independently by a 
<br />
lot of people---ref in my papers) that comp entails we cannot
<br />
know the correct levels. 
<br />
We can bet on it, though, and we can make reasoning
<br />
relatively to correct bets.
<br />
<br />Normally a constructive philosopher should abandon comp right here,
<br />
because it follows from that theorem that we cannot be machine in
<br />
any constructive sense.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Where does the betting come in? On which alternatives can we bet?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Which is the distribution on the alternatives?
</em><br />
<br />The betting comes from the theorem mentionned just above.
<br />
(Although it follows partially from most of the UDA too).
<br />
<br />In the W-M TE the alternatives are given by the reconstitutions.
<br />
<br />With the assumption that we are living in something described by 
<br />
schroedinger equation, the alternatives are given by some quantum rules.
<br />
<br />The alternatives are unknown and part of the problem with
<br />
comp. It has been shown they are linked to the structure of UD*.
<br />
Defining the set of alternatives is part of our problem.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What is the right level?
</em><br />
<br />I don't know.
<br />
No machines will ever known &quot;the&quot; right level.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Only the drunken Schmidhubers will say it is incomputable. Most will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just say &quot;the history so far is computable by a lengthy program&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You miss the point. Even the one who as PI on his T-shirt is
<br />
wrong if he believes PI helps him to predict the issue of the
<br />
next self-duplication.
<br />
Note that if the program remains as lenghty as the sequence, as it
<br />
happens for most Schmidhubers---in the iterated self-duplication,
<br />
these sequence are called uncomputable by Solovay, Chaitin, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; From the first person point of view the delay introduced by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the doctor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; has not been and cannot been directly perceived.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That seems obvious, but what exactly do you mean by &quot;perceive,&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am glad you see it is obvious, because it *was* my point. 
<br />
What is your point asking 
<br />
what I mean exactly by &quot;perceive&quot; at this stage. The goal
<br />
of the UDA TE is indeed to help people abandonning prejudice
<br />
about the easyness of the issue. To help them ro realise the
<br />
hardness of the mind/body problem with comp. (A lot of people
<br />
tend to belief that comp is the solution of the problem, I show
<br />
it helps on the road toward a formulation of the problem).
<br />
<br />Try perhaps to read the
<br />
whole UDA for getting the general idea, first.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (that's why I insist sometimes that reconstition booth has no windows!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;why sometimes, why sometimes not? 
</em><br />
<br />Are you just playing with me?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
I use reconstitution booth without window to illustrate the fact
<br />
that no person can, from a first person point of view, guess if
<br />
he/she/it is the one reconstitute at W, or the one reconstitute at  M,
<br />
with or without delay, by themselves (by introspection).
<br />
<br />(It is the obvious fact you mentionned above indeed).
<br />
<br />I use reconstitution booth with windows to illustrate that
<br />
a third person communicable observation (looking outside)
<br />
can provide the information.
<br />
Another obvious fact.
<br />
<br />Most of the UDA steps are really obvious indees. Nevertheless, taken 
<br />
together they entails the reversal.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Maybe you are talking about a virtual reality that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can fully control?
</em><br />
<br />No, no ... In the TE W/M with or without delay, I am just
<br />
considering our good old planet earth about 2000 after JC.
<br />
In the UDA at each step the decor changes a little bit.
<br />
At the end we meet the Great Bastard lazily dovetailing on
<br />
all computations. (And we don't need to control it either).
<br />
<br />To be frank, I am less and less sure you are reading seriously 
<br />
my posts.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then which is the precise set of virtual realities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you are considering?
</em><br />
<br />I am considering virtual realities much later in the argument.
<br />
Why are you making remarks which has indeed no relation at all
<br />
with the post ?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your point is the revival of an old science fiction theme.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But as soon as you want to derive something you need to state formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumptions, otherwise you'll end up with empty philosophic blabla.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You need only to make *precise* assumptions. You don't need
<br />
to make *formal* assumption. In most TE occuring in the 
<br />
&quot;philosophy of mind&quot; (or cognitive science), but also in the
<br />
foundation of physics, you cannot be formal
<br />
without *first* choosing informal philosophical assumptions.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is there a probability distribution on this set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(if not, you cannot predict anything)? Which one?
</em><br />
<br /><br />You talk really as if probability was the only manner you
<br />
know for quantifying uncertainty.
<br />
<br /><br />Beside probability there exist other ways to handle the 
<br />
uncertain. The one I know
<br />
the best is Dempster-Shafer theory. 
<br />
(I have work some years with expert in that field).
<br />
<br />Glenn Shafer has written a
<br />
classical little treatise: &quot;A mathematical theory of
<br />
evidence&quot; 1976, Princeton University Press.
<br />
<br />Some modal logic provides even quite different type of tools
<br />
for approaching uncertainty.
<br />
Some are genuinely useful when we handle uncertainty where the
<br />
domain of uncertainty itself is uncertain.
<br />
(the domain of uncertainty is not unrelated with the reference 
<br />
class of Wei Dai's post).
<br />
<br />But I told you: the whole UDA reasoning consists in showing that
<br />
the search of the way to quantify the computationalist uncertainty
<br />
is equivalent with comp to deriving the laws of physics from
<br />
the laws of machine's psychology.
<br />
<br />Why Probability and not Dempster-Shafer credibility, should any
<br />
one (knowing Dempster-Shafer credibility or any other
<br />
way to handle uncertainty) asks.
<br />
<br />Choosing probability at this stage is like giving an answer
<br />
before understanding the problem.
<br />
<br />This is just a forbidden move after having accepted comp. 
<br />
(you should
<br />
understand this clearly when you will proceed on the 15 point of 
<br />
UDA).
<br />
<br />Now, anticipating (the two part of my thesis) I admit I do
<br />
expect probabilities playing an important role and that is 
<br />
why there are aspect of your work I appreciate.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;An essential issue is: are they all equally likely? Do you you assume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a uniform distribution on the possible futures?  Is that what you mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by indeterminacy?  If so, why not simply call it a uniform distribution?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Note there are many alternative distributions besides the uniform one,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that is, there are many alternative TOEs.  Different TOEs, different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;predictions. Why restrict yourself here to a uniform distribution?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I repeat. (I agree this is a subtil point: the way for handling
<br />
the unknown is itself unknown!).
<br />
<br />Not only I do not restrict myself to the uniform distribution, but 
<br />
I don't share your assumption that the only way for quantifying 
<br />
uncertainty is probability. Why not Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence ?
<br />
or any other credibility theory you can find in the literature?
<br />
<br />We just don't know how to quantify the Computationalist Uncertainty 
<br />
(herafter QCU).
<br />
<br />And we haven't clear a priori views even on the domain on which that
<br />
uncertainty bears. 
<br />
<br />One of the reason why it is difficult is that
<br />
with comp the uncertainty is *very* big, as Descartes saw (with
<br />
a weaker form of *mechanism*) : we could &quot;dream&quot;. 
<br />
<br />The great programmer
<br />
like Descartes' Malin Genie, build conscientiously all dreams and other
<br />
fake realities.
<br />
But the real problem with comp is not really that we dont't know in which
<br />
computations &quot;we are&quot;, the problem is that the first person (plural) are
<br />
spread onto rather complex structured set of computations, which put
<br />
enormous doubts on the very sensefulness of the idea that we belong
<br />
to a computation or that we belong to a universe.
<br />
&nbsp;It is part of the problem to throw light on those complex structures.
<br />
<br />When you will realise that all the UDA steps are obvious, you will
<br />
understand that even the word &quot;universe&quot; becomes quite vague, and
<br />
necessarily so.
<br />
<br />But that huge ignorance does not prevent us *at all* to make precise 
<br />
reasoning on the QCU, and to put it in relation whith known things.
<br />
<br />In particular the thought-experiments with 
<br />
comp are used to show that the QCU is invariant for a set of 
<br />
transformations (describable in third person term) on UD*.
<br />
The thought experiment are all possible 
<br />
*in principle* and are not vague at all. Some of which can even 
<br />
be cheaply realised once we accept Everett formulation of QM. 
<br />
(if only for the sake of the argument).
<br />
<br /><br />This makes possible going toward an equation in which the QCU itself
<br />
is the unknown.
<br />
<br />And my main result is a reduction of the mind-body problem
<br />
to the problem of the origin of the laws of physics, itself
<br />
reduced to the search for that QCU.
<br />
<br />In the first part of my thesis:
<br />
I am not pretending that I have solved the mind-body problem, nor
<br />
the problem of the origin of the physical laws, nor the QCU.
<br />
But I have rigorously proved that with comp these problems are 
<br />
equivalent.
<br />
<br /><br />In the second part of my thesis I show with a little more than
<br />
comp (here I am vague, but look at the thesis) that the
<br />
certainty part of QCU obeys a &quot;quantum logic&quot; defined by
<br />
the aritmetical sentences of the form
<br />
BEW(p) &amp; -BEW(-p) with p arithmetical sigma_1 formula. 
<br />
(and BEW = Godel's Beweisbar's predicate).
<br />
<br />Thanks to Solovay's theorem I provide theorem provers for these 
<br />
logics. That is, in the second part,  I propose a precise 
<br />
100% mathematical road to the QCU. 
<br />
<br />A weakness is that I am lead toward hard mathematics.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I accept all formal proofs derived from formal assumptions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />What does that means? I guess you mean a consistent set
<br />
of formal assumptions.
<br />
Assumption about what? And how will you link your assumptions
<br />
and your subject matter?
<br />
You speak here like a pregodelian formalist :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your point is the revival of an old science fiction theme.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But as soon as you want to derive something you need to state formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumptions, otherwise you'll end up with empty philosophic blabla.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are confusing &quot;rigor&quot;, precision, and formalisation, 
<br />
again. You should perhaps read the nice little book by
<br />
James Brown &quot;the laboratory of mind&quot; which explain what
<br />
is a thought experiment. He shows that some informal but 
<br />
precise TE can demolish philosophical prejudice. UDA is
<br />
of this type. (Brown J., Routledge, 1991).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Which unique formalisation? Please write it down!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How can you possibly isolate it by informal reasoning? 
</em><br />
<br />I was talking *there* about the modal logic G, G*, 
<br />
S4Grz, Z1, Z1*, etc.
<br />
These formal logics are intensional (modal) variation of the
<br />
provability logics  of the sound  self-referentially correct 
<br />
machine. I have provide semantics, and theorem provers.
<br />
See explanation and technical details in my thesis and in my 
<br />
papers.
<br />
<br />All formal systems are enfered by informal reasoning allied
<br />
with intuitive view of the subject matter.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I found your CC&amp;Q paper as vague as your other texts.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Obviously: you need a formal definition of delay in a thought
<br />
experiment where such a definition has no relevance at all.
<br />
So you are hardly willing to honestly *do* these thought experiment. 
<br />
No doubt much of the paper and much of the posts should appear
<br />
&nbsp;a little difficult.
<br />
<br />You are also telling us that informal classical mathematics is vague 
<br />
because they admit sets like the set of all functions from one 
<br />
infinite set to another. I am not the one isolated here in making
<br />
sense of these sets. You cannot pretend I am the one 
<br />
pretending 1+1=3! It is a dishonest rhetorical trick.
<br />
<br />Those who have patiently follow the steps are in general quite 
<br />
shocked by the conclusion (the reversal),
<br />
but then, at least, they act honestly: either searching or
<br />
hoping for a precise flaw,  or just abandoning comp. 
<br />
<br />It looks like it does not occur to your mind that *perhaps* 
<br />
I have a point and that you just don't have seen it yet.
<br />
<br />Why not trying being a little more modest, mister &quot;I-am-right&quot;. 
<br />
<br />Have you a prejudice against 
<br />
the whole approach or what ?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Without formal assumptions you have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no theory of everything, no theory of something, no theory at all.
</em><br />
<br />Without informal assumption you cannot use the theory in the
<br />
philosophy of mind and of matter aswell.
<br />
You persist confusing rigor and formalisation.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If I fall from a flying plane, being a realist (though not a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; subtancialist) I believe I will fall somewhere, although I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; no means to describe or analyse where.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is again the issue of describability, given current knowledge, vs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;describability in principle. We are talking about the latter, of course.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;Of course&quot; ?  Certainly not in the TE. What are you saying?
<br />
Please read the archive, we have discussed this a lot
<br />
on this list (cf RSSA versus ASSA (relative self sampling assumption 
<br />
versus absolute self sampling assumtion).
<br />
<br />You always take the relation between observers and computations which
<br />
support them  as granted.  I don't. I cannot abstract any
<br />
question of prediction from the &quot;current knowledge&quot; at the moment of
<br />
the prediction.
<br />
<br />There is no problem with having different opinion, but don't tell me
<br />
one is obviously wrong and one obviously correct.
<br />
This is again sort of rhetorical trick.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Are you among those who argues that talk on consciousness is a hoax ?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not necessarily.
</em><br />
<br /><br />:-))
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Algorithmic TOEs are about computable probability distributions on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe histories computable in the limit.  Such histories subsume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all computable evolutions of all computable observers, including the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conscious ones, if there are any.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am always afraid when I meet people who are doubting 
<br />
the existence of people's consciousness.
<br />
My feeling is that you *do* think that consciousness is a hoax.
<br />
That was my impression, as I told you, after reading 
<br />
your first paper. You just confirm that you don't 
<br />
believe there is a mind/body problem. (Like so much &quot;scientist&quot; BTW).
<br />
<br />Not a big problem, you can still understand the reversal
<br />
without studying the mind/body problem.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;No. There is no need for a definition of what it means to be conscious,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or how to identify a conscious observer in his environment.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You ask me to give a formal definition of delay when I use it
<br />
in the every-day life folk sense, and you are willing to talk
<br />
on consciousness without clarification ????
<br />
<br />We don't need a definition, that is true, but we need some 
<br />
axiomatics.
<br />
That is we need to agree on some feature of consciousness, like
<br />
the fact that a conscious entity cannot prove (even informally, still
<br />
less formally) it is conscious to another conscious entity.
<br />
Here we must agree also on the difference betwen believing and 
<br />
proving, etc. We can demolish prejudice about it through TE, and
<br />
we can make these distinction formaly precise through 
<br />
formal modal logics. I propose both and explain the link.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, what is it?  Is it something different from an ordinary distribution?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If so, what is it?  If not, why don't you call it a distribution?
