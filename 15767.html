Hi Abram and Bruno:
<br />
<br />My goal some time ago was to find an origin to a dynamic in the Everything.
<br />
It seemed that many on the list were pointing to such a dynamic - the UD for
<br />
example. 
<br />
<br />I came up with the Nothing to Something incompleteness dynamic initiator
<br />
maybe 10 or more years ago.
<br />
<br />Since then I have been trying to make the resulting model as simple as I
<br />
could.
<br />
<br />I have looked at Abram's idea of adding inconsistency derived traces in the
<br />
dynamic:
<br />
<br />I have in recent changes stopped using &quot;information&quot; to avoid the
<br />
complications this term seemed to bring with it.  This lead to a compact
<br />
model with just two definitions, one assumption, and the stability trigger
<br />
question resulting in the dynamic.  To maintain this simplicity I note that
<br />
when a Nothing in a particular All containing just one copy of the Nothing
<br />
converts to a Something this also converts the particular All into a
<br />
Something.  The All is inconsistent by reason of its absolute completeness.
<br />
The absence of its Nothing which was consistent but incomplete is not likely
<br />
to make the Something the All became consistent Something.  So this
<br />
Something may be a source of inconsistency driven traces.
<br />
<br />As far as learning how to communicate this model in a more mathematical
<br />
language [logic, set theory, etc.] to aid understanding by others, I have
<br />
consumed what little time I had available over the years just getting to the
<br />
current state of the model.  It has been said that it takes 10,000 hours of
<br />
practice in some endeavor to become an expert in it.  Since I understand
<br />
less than half the mathematical logic based comments in this tread regarding
<br />
my model I am far from expert in such a language. 
<br />
<br />My engineering career gives me some formal exposure and practical
<br />
understanding of it, and I have studied small additional pieces of it in the
<br />
course of developing this model.  However, the current realities of life
<br />
have made adding new time intensive endeavors such as becoming sufficiently
<br />
fluent in such a communication method an &quot;overcome by events&quot; effort. I
<br />
might find maybe an hour a week for my total participation on the list. This
<br />
seems extremely insufficient.  Thus I suspect that despite my real interest
<br />
in developing an alternative means of communication for my ideas in this
<br />
area, my primary reliance for communicating the model will unfortunately
<br />
have to remain using as small a set of words as I can muster. 
<br />
<br />Hal

</em><br />
<br /><br />&quot;nothing&quot; is ambiguous and depends on the theory or its intended  
<br />
domain. Incompleteness means usually arithmetically incomplete.
<br />
The theory with no axioms at all? Not even logical axioms? Well, you  
<br />
can obtain anything from that.
<br />
The theory with nothing ontological? You will need a complex  
<br />
epistemology, using reflexion and comprehension axioms, that is a bit  
<br />
of set theory, to proceed.
<br />
Nothing physical? You will need at least the numbers, or a physics:  
<br />
the quantum emptiness is known to be a very rich and complex entity.  
<br />
It needs quantum mechanics, and thus classical or intuitionistic  
<br />
logic, + Hilbert spaces or von Neumann algebra.
<br />
I would say that &quot;nothing&quot; means nothing in absence of some logic, at  
<br />
least.
<br />
No axioms, but a semantic. Right, the empty theory is satisfied by all  
<br />
structure (none can contradict absent axioms). But here you will have  
<br />
a metatheory which presupposes ... every mathematical structure. The  
<br />
metatheory will be naïve set theory, at least.
<br />
I suspect since some time that Hal Ruhl is searching for a generative  
<br />
set theory, but unfortunately he seems unable to study at least one  
<br />
conventional language to make his work understandable by those who  
<br />
could be interested.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This can be related with the so-called autonomous progressions  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; studied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in the literature, like:  PA, PA+conPA, PA+conPA+con(PA +conPA), etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The &quot;etc&quot; here bears on the constructive ordinals. &quot;conPA&quot; is for &quot;PA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; does not derive P&amp;~P.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have been wondering recently, if we follow the &quot;...&quot; to its end, do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we arrive at an infinite set of axioms that contains all of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical truth, or is it gappy?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The &quot;...&quot; is (necessarily) ambiguous. If it is constructive, it will  
<br />
define a constructive ordinal. In that case the theory obtained is  
<br />
axiomatizable but still incomplete. If the &quot;...&quot; is not constructive,  
<br />
and go through all constructive ordinals at least, then Turing showed  
<br />
we can get a complete (with respect to arithmetical truth) theory,  
<br />
but, as can be expected from incompleteness, the theory obtained will  
<br />
not be axiomatizable.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words, is the hole that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Godel pointed out flexible enough to fill in any hole eventually if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; keep adding con(x), or are there &quot;non-godelian&quot; holes?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure what you mean by a hole filling any hole, nor what you  
<br />
mean by a non-godelian hole. The point is that the hole provided by  
<br />
Godel's incompleteness phenomena cannot be fill completely in any  
<br />
effective way. Even ZF + strong infinity axioms cannot prove all  
<br />
arithmetical truth. All effective theory are arithmetically incomplete.
