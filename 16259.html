<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is a delicate question. You could perhaps ask them.
<br />
<br />I can provide general clues.
<br />
<br />- Quantum mechanics is not known by logicians. So it is easy to make  
<br />
someone interested in modern physics looking crazy for a logician:  
<br />
just say ``look it seems the guy is open to the notion of parallel  
<br />
universe&quot;.
<br />
<br />- Gödel's theorem is not known by physicists. So it easy to make  
<br />
someone interested in self-reference looking crazy for a physicist:  
<br />
look even the big Penrose said craps on Gödel's theorem, no need to  
<br />
imagine what can say a total unknown and solitary researcher.
<br />
<br />- Neither physicists nor logicians really knows about the mind-body  
<br />
problem. So it is easy to make someone interested in consciousness  
<br />
looking crazy: just say: this guy is interested on consciousness (with  
<br />
a grin).
<br />
<br />Why does some people want me so much looking crazy? Well if I tell  
<br />
you, I would myself find you insane to believe me. So I will not even  
<br />
try.
<br />
If you known Belgium recent story, you can imagine, and reality is  
<br />
beyond what you can imagine.
<br />
<br />Let us just say, like Colin Hales says in his rejection_101 document  
<br />
that it is hard to do inter-disciplinary work in a world of extreme  
<br />
specialization. That's at least true for all of us.
<br />
<br />But I don't want you to give the impression that I feel being  
<br />
rejected. I am just ignored. And I have always been accepted by  
<br />
serious and humble scientists, but none listen to them, like if it  
<br />
existed Academy and Academy.  And I have even been praised, more than  
<br />
often, but with no follow-up. Never. There are good but unspeakable  
<br />
local and less local reasons.
<br />
<br />Now, even when all scientists in a some field agree, plausible  
<br />
evidences take time to be accepted. Look at the health politics in  
<br />
most countries. It is not just total non sense, it is criminal and  
<br />
economical non sense. Yet nothing changes. I believe more in cold  
<br />
fusion than in the danger of cannabis or salvia divinorum, you know,  
<br />
or even tobacco, when used properly. At least cold fusion and water  
<br />
memory does not arm.  But the overall resistance to harm reduction  
<br />
technics toward even just legal drugs can make you depressed and  
<br />
despaired about the willingness of human collectivity to be a bit more  
<br />
rational, and a bit more healthy.
<br />
<br />I do appreciate David Deutsch and Alan Forrester. And I would  
<br />
certainly be pleased to have their opinions. But new things take time,  
<br />
especially when circumstances don't help. Give them enough time.
<br />
<br />Bruno

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Even with politics operating behind the scene (which you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hinted), I can't imagine that nothing of the work is publishable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I already discussed proposition of publishing &quot;Conscience et
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mécanisme&quot; with three publishers, before my thesis was judged not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; receivable (meaning no private defense, nor public defense, I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *never* met those who criticize, not even my work, but a product of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their imagination). Then silence, even after the defense in Lille, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even more after the paradoxical price in Paris.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I cannot explain. Or I can explain except that here reality is far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beyond fiction as usual, but also more sad, and rather delicate if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only because that story is not finished.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My life is more unbelievable than any thing I assert in my works. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; took me 22 years to understand what happened in 1977, and since then.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I feel responsible to let them build they own trap, and then  get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; myself a bit worried seeing them to protect themselves from Brussels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to Paris!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is not because I have done an &quot;original work&quot; (say) in Brussels,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I got problems there. It is because I got problems in Brussels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I have done an original work. In 1977, they give me no chance,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not even getting out of Belgium.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In 1994, my work was criticize vaguely as &quot;not original&quot;, &quot;too much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple&quot;,  and then &quot;delirious&quot;. And now already &quot;not from him&quot; in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place. Which again shows the problems is not related with my findings,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; except it belongs to the kind of things you can easily use to treat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you as a fool (Gödel's theorem, Quantum mechanics, consciousness: few
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand so it is easy to say &quot;not serious&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The little scandal has grown up all the time and is too big, now. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the kind of manipulation which makes everyone feel responsible,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from corporatist reflex to corporatist reflex, when actually there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only one, very clever, but very bad,  guy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now that &quot;little scandal&quot; has become big enough to throw light on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other really bigger scandals. There are &quot;cadavres dans les placards&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as we say in French (corpses hidden in boxes). Mean of pressures.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still believe in academies, but like in School &quot;serial killer&quot; can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist. When you see the time made by religious institution to protect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their member of their hierarchy from their much grave behavior, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; estimate it could take a long time if ever to understand and recognize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what happened.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I have no problem with serious academicians and scientists which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand enough to understand it is &quot;serious&quot;, even if probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong, which I have myself never ceased to believe plausible (which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explains why I am eager to discuss the validity of the UDA steps, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people interested). I did defend the work as PhD thesis. I was asked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many questions, I answered them and everyone got the idea. Some people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; takes time, but most get enough to trust the interest of the work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Still today, few get both UDA and AUDA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA is almost easy, but not so easy. AUDA is very *simple*, once you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand enough standard logic (which I have discovered is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; excessively rare). The whole thing is strongly interdisciplinary, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between disciplines, rumors circulate more quickly than &quot;scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bridge&quot;,  which often makes people feeling being aggressed on their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; territories. Even more so when the work approaches question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traditionally qualified as &quot;philosophical&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My initial power comes from the fact that in 1977, I did abandoned,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for bad reasons (but it will take many years to understand that), the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea of doing academic research, and so I did come back to the very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental questioning I have always been living. I didn't and don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complain (my weakness probably).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And it is the Academy, 20 years later, which will push me back again,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and again. I have never submitted publications by myself. All have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been asked by people, having heard I said something new, sometimes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insisting gently. Nowadays, since those events, even ordered paper (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; jobs) get jeopardized quickly. Last year I was asked to write a paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a book in homage to the late logician Jean Ladrière, (who offered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to me its formidable book on Gödel theorems: Les limitations internes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; des formalismes&quot;), and then ... nothing again. I am used to it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for your interest,
