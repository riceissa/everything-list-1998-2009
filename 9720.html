Oh, I see you wrote more about that long letter of mine.
<br />
<br />Thanks for breaking it up!  It's really a separate idea.
<br />
<br />I'll respond today if time.

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; So if I understand you right, this is where the difference between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; a book and a person arises. When a book's letters are scattered over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; the cosmos, the information is lost, but when the observer moments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; are so scattered, the subjective experience still remains.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Now we suppose from quantum mechanics that the Bekenstein bound
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; on the number of states a human can be in is less than 10^10^45.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; (Tipler, 1993, &quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot;.) So each state of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; your life is a very special small subset of all those states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Let's do something special with just *one* life that you've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; led (will lead) in the universe, one life, that is, in a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; spacetime.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I propose to take something quite a bit like observer-moments and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; ask some questions about it. Suppose that an exact frozen replica
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; of your brain is made corresponding to each 10^-42 seconds of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; life. This gives us about 10^42 * 10^7 * 70years, or about 10^50
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; states (a far cry from all those possible for humans, 10^10^45).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; We place those 10^50 states in a long row, and then, for an audience,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; we round up all the billions of observers in the visible universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; to watch the show. First the spotlight is on your brain the second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; after you were born. Then one 10^-42 seconds later the spotlight
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; moves to the next frozen brain, and so forth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; The audience is placed in the same frame of reference as the moving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; light, and so they see an apparently continuous evolution of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; How is this any different from what happened to you actually? From
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; an external scientific point of view, it seems remarkably identical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; (I am ultimately to claim that something essential---but not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; &quot;consciousness&quot; or anything like that is missing, but rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; *causality* is missing.)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it depends on what you believe about how brains work. Let's go to
<br />
the other extreme and make the observer moments very long - minutes, say. If
<br />
I have a minute of conscious experience here, then I am annihilated, and
<br />
either by accident or by design a copy of my brain just as it was at the
<br />
moment of annihilation is made a trillion years later, which goes on to have
<br />
another minute of conscious experience as if nothing remarkable had
<br />
happened, would *that* qualify as two minutes of continuous conscious
<br />
experience in my life? If so, where does causation enter into it to link the
<br />
two minutes? Sure, the second minute is unlikely to come about unless some
<br />
information is saved from the first minute and deliberate work put into
<br />
making the copy, but *how* it comes about can't make any difference *once*
<br />
it comes about. The mere fact that these two physical processes occur
<br />
somewhere in the universe is enough to bring about two continuous minutes of
<br />
consciousness. In fact, I don't see how the experiment I have described
<br />
could possibly not give this result. You don't even need to be a
<br />
computationalist or a functionalist: as long as the second copy has the
<br />
right sort of mental experiences, whether due to God providing a replacement
<br />
soul or the right sort of tiny black holes in the microtubules or whatever,
<br />
then ipso facto, I will have two minutes of apparently continuous conscious
<br />
experience.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I suppose that you would assert that a first person experience was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; attached to this performance, a performance moving against a background
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; of stars as the stage. Is that correct?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The question you are asking is in principle answerable by experiment: how
<br />
finely can you divide up the physical processes which give rise to thought
<br />
and still have continuous thought? You could teleport a subject nanometres
<br />
to the left, then the same distance back to the right, repeating this at
<br />
varying frequencies. We assume that the teleportation is as close as doesn't
<br />
matter to instantaneous and that the resultant &quot;vibration&quot; in situ is not in
<br />
itself noticeable to the subject. You have agreed in previous posts that the
<br />
&quot;regular&quot; sort of teleportation we frequently discuss would not have much
<br />
impact on the subject. If you performed this sort of vibrational
<br />
teleportation in the kilohertz or megahertz range, would he notice anything
<br />
strange happening to him? Would you notice anything strange talking to him?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Next we begin a process of deconstruction.  First, on one century's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; performance, there is trouble with the spotlight, and it's very dim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; although the audience can still see the show. But a few performances
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; (centuries) later, the spotlight goes out altogether. Still, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; audience knows from the notes passed out exactly what is happening.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; On another night, the audience fails to show up. Do these things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; really affect whether or not a first person experience attends the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; brain?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;No, provided that the audience did not interact with the brain on the
<br />
basis of what they saw.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; In other performances, the spotlight dances all around, from a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a hundred trillionth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; of a second (about 10^-50 seconds) from your brain in midlife to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; your brain as an adolescent, then to your brain as a young adult,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; then to the geezer Stathis brain, and so on, completely wrecking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; the order. Now from what you wrote above about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt; it takes to run a human mind, and these moments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt; of consciousness randomly dispersed throughout the multiverse,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt; they would all connect up by virtue of their information content.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; one might surmise that you believe that the order that these frozen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; brains appear is irrelevant. (I happen to agree---my own view is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; that as soon as there was no longer causality connecting each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; frozen brain with another brain---that is, that no real computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; was taking place---the first person experience no longer occurred.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; But if I have surmised correctly, then you wouldn't care that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; frozen brains were not only shown sometimes out of sequence, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; that there did not have to be an audience, nor was the spatial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; relative locations of the brains relevant. They could be jumbled
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; all over the cosmos.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I would *care* because it would be a nightmare, literally: I would not be
<br />
able to interact with the physical universe or with anyone else, I would not
<br />
be able to control where my thoughts took me, I would very quickly
<br />
deteriorate into noise and die (which may be a blessing). At the moment,
<br />
photons strike my retina, which causes certain impulses in my visual cortex,
<br />
which I perceive as light. That's causality at work. If the same impulses
<br />
occur in my cortex randomly, without the light stimulus, I could have
<br />
exactly the same subjective experience, but it would be a hallucination, and
<br />
my interactions with the world would suffer as a result. But if I take the
<br />
subjective experience in isolation, it is *exactly* the same regardless of
<br />
how it came about.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; But next, what about the neurons making up the brains?  What would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; be lost if they too were dispersed through time and space? Finally,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; just when, if any time, would anything be lost: what if the neurons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; are themselves separated into atoms and dispersed?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;We could imagine a brain divided up but each neurone is stimulated just as
<br />
it would have been had the brain been whole; then, each neurone separated
<br />
but stimulated just as it would have been were it still connected to its
<br />
neighbours; and finally, each component of each neurone, down to atoms,
<br />
separated but behaving just as it was when it was whole. We could attach
<br />
ears and vocal cords with the appropriate nerves etc. and talk to the
<br />
atomised brain. I see no reason why this thing shouldn't function as normal,
<br />
and I see no way it could know it wasn't still in its cranial vault, given
<br />
that we were censoring the information it was fed. If exactly the same
<br />
arrangement of matter came into being by chance, there is a difference
<br />
because (a) it's even less likely to happen that way than as a result of
<br />
deliberate effort, and (b) we wouldn't be able to communicate with it,
<br />
because it would be lost in the background noise unless we set it up
<br />
ourselves, but from the point of view of the brain itself, how could it make
<br />
any difference who made it as long as physically it was identical?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Well, to me this is the ultimate reductio, because it means that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; among the dust in the vast, vast, vast volumes of the cosmos, each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; of your brain states already exists. (To me this is as absurd as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; some of Hilary Putnam's claims, or Greg Egan's in Permutation City.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; (For the record, Greg Egan made it clear in an interview that he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; does *not* necessarily believe in the notions presented in all his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; books.))
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Where was this Egan interview?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; The only place in all this chain of reasoning where it seems that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; first person experience could be lost is when one state no longer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; followed *causally* from a preceding state, or, in other words
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; (in my opinion) when a true computation involving information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; flow no longer occurred.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Your thoughts?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My tentative view is that unless self-awareness/cognition  is somehow only
<br />
possessed by creatures specially issued with souls, every physical process
<br />
implements every computation, and this includes every conscious computation.
<br />
Those conscious computations that are the result of causal laws, which
<br />
includes the functioning of our own brains, evolve in a predictable way and
<br />
are able to interact with their environment. Those that are based on noise
<br />
are necessarily disconnected from anything other than their own thoughts,
<br />
and rapidly (or instantaneously) devolve into nothing. So in a sense every
<br />
possible observer moment or mental state exists, but only a tiny subset is
<br />
able to give rise to persons or other recognisably sentient beings.
