Hi Colin,
<br />
<br />Le 28-juil.-05, à 02:57, chales1.domain.name.hidden a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi  Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now look at science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We do correlations of perceptual artefacts = _contents_ of phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consiousness to the point of handing out _Nobel prizes_ for depictions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of correlated artefacts of our phenomenal fields.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; AND THEN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we deny phenomenal consciousness? Declare it unassailable by science?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Delude ourselves that these descriptions actually contain causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessity?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Bruno]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Who does that?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Col]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The entire suite of practical empirical science does that. Walk the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; halls. Find _any_ scientist at the coal face and ask. What planet are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you from? Before your breath has finished the asking sentence you will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be told you are not being scientific.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Perhaps but what's the problem being told non scientific by people who 
<br />
loss the scientific attitude in front of unsolved questions?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Bruno]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think that, in this list, you will find someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; denying phenomenal consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Col]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since when has the data found on this list been _any_ scientific 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; source of confirmation of anythng?
</em><br />
<br />Since I was refering to the list. Come on, I was not trying to confirm 
<br />
anything.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This list is specifically more likely to include people admitting to a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality of phenomenal consciousness! They are not the ones that need 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their brains adjusted: It's mainstream science that needs the therapy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ....we are the therapists.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Careful with the term you are using. It could be ok between us, but 
<br />
this list is public, and to say &quot;we are the therapist&quot; makes you seem 
<br />
(rightly) foolish. It could be a proposition of the type Dt. Those are 
<br />
true, but once said, they are false (or very near).
<br />
The only way to cure the scientist is by helping them to single out the 
<br />
step where they leaves their scientific attitude. Some like Omnes in 
<br />
his book &quot;explaining quantum mechanics&quot;, tells precisely to their 
<br />
readers where he decides to abandon Science
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Bruno]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I don't understand what you mean by causal necessity, especially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when you say that:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We have phenomenal consciousness, the most obvious, egregious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; screaming evidence of the operation of that causal necessity - the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; same causal necessity that results in the desciption F = MA being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; found by Newton...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Col]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you need to (aghast) do some physics or something with a real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirical edge to it. ALL our scientific 'laws' are tautologies in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation to statisical generalisations that don;t actually exist - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like 'Ms Average'. F = MA is exactly that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; NONE of these laws say WHY. They only say WHAT. WHY = 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessity/causality.
</em><br />
<br />I agree. Actually I think that all &quot;causality&quot; notion can be captured 
<br />
by the necessity of an implication. B(p-&gt;q).  (Please skip if you are 
<br />
&quot;logic-anxious&quot;). But then there are 10000 of &quot;causal&quot; links.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is causal necessity behind EVERYTHING, not just consiousness.
</em><br />
<br />Of course!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again- are you even in the same universe as me?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Good question!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whatever generates 'everything' generates phenomenal consciousness as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well.
</em><br />
<br />I follow you.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You think there is one bucnh of happenstance for phenomenal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness and another for eveything else? = dualist delusion.
</em><br />
<br />All right.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you think the universe is run by emprical laws = rationalist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delusion.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not at all!!!!!  it is a NON RATIONALIST delusion.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you think the universe is run by a symbolic crunching machine = 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalist delusion.
</em><br />
<br />Not at all. Please: this is a key point (which follows from the UD 
<br />
argument, ref in my url):
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;if by comp you mean &quot;the universe is run by a computer&quot; then comp *is* 
<br />
contradictory or trivial. By computationalism I mean &quot;I&quot; would not see 
<br />
the difference if you replace my brain/body/universe by some digital 
<br />
machine. This entails that whatever the *observable* universe is, it 
<br />
cannot be run on a computer. To put it simply: if you are a machine 
<br />
then &quot;not you&quot; is not a machine!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These are all unfounded ascrptions and have no evidenntiary basis 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other than the reconfigured brain matter that results from a belief.
</em><br />
<br />Note that the &quot;reconfigured brain matter&quot; is also a belief.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am talking about real, supportable verifyable science of the natural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I hope you are willing to bet that I certainly attempt to do so.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Bruno]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I tend to believe in some causal necessity related to consciousness,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I have no evidence that F=MA has anything to do with that. I guess
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are postulating the existence of some &quot;primitive&quot; physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, aren't you?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Col]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am talking about the natural world, in which we are embedded, of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which we are made as the situation inwhich we must understand the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural world.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't believe in the natural world. To be short. I do believe in 
<br />
observation and measurement's results. The notion of natural world, it 
<br />
seems to me, is a lasting superstition which does not resist any 
<br />
serious observation, nor even serious introspection. But I know many 
<br />
people *want* to believe in some primitive material Nature. For me it 
<br />
is like ether or phlogistic, just a name for stopping Children's 
<br />
question.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If you think that you are 'outside' looking in: another delusion = 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you think you are GOD. :-)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sure. I hope you don't think that I think I am 'outside' looking in.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Bruno]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't pretend that this is obvious, but the missing 50% of science is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not phenomenological consciousness (in this list).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [col]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are making another rationalist ascription. You assume that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical abstractions are the object of scientific endeavours. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; WRONG.
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I don't understand you at all. Surely the prime numbers can be an 
<br />
object of scientific endeavour.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You assume that fiddling with computation about will somehow bestow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; access to the ultimate explanation.  You are not talking about science 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the natural world - you are talking about the science of some other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world. You assume the link between them without justification and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without any proof.
</em><br />
<br /><br />What are you talking about?  About my work? have you studied it? You 
<br />
should be more specific in the critics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Proof: Just watch it come. With empirical evidence from neuroscience. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm happy to wait until then (it may take a decade or so) and then say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'I told you so'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, if this is what you call a proof ... I'm not sure we are talking 
<br />
on the same subject.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW I used to think the same way as you..... I have been on a huge 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; journey. I spent 25 years puting computers in control of the real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You should have consult me. Computers are intrinsically not controlable 
<br />
and they makes the environment less controlable. To control a computer 
<br />
is an infinite art.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  All I can say is: deal with human embeddedness , HERE in our natural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world,
</em><br />
<br /><br />I guess you mean here. Comma.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  fully, comprehensively and you will get answers. Staring at maths and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; running symbols will not do it. The computer chips neede to make a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious machine have not been invented yet and they will be VERY 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different to all von-neumann, parallel and quantum computing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; architectures.
</em><br />
<br />I am problem driven. My initial goal was just to show that the 
<br />
mind-body problem was not yet well formulated when we assume the comp 
<br />
hyp. Then I succeed to show that the comp hyp reduces the mind-body 
<br />
problem partially into the problem of justifying the physical laws from 
<br />
the relation among numbers, all this by a simple but non-constructive 
<br />
proof (and probably not *so* simple). It is mainly the Universal 
<br />
Dovetailer Argument.
<br />
The proof relies on some notion of &quot;grandmother psychology&quot; (which some 
<br />
scientist understand only the week-end!). Still, I succeed to replace 
<br />
the grandmother by the more mathematical &quot;universal machine&quot; (available 
<br />
by Church thesis). Then the translation of the UDA is the language of a 
<br />
universal machine gives the laws of physics. And then I have begin to 
<br />
test that theory with empirical physics, just to see if comp is false, 
<br />
plausible, etc. There is work there for the next millenia. Comp did 
<br />
succeed the first steps.
<br />
Naturalism will disappear like vitalism, even if comp is false. It will 
<br />
take some time sure.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My morning bombast session is over... time for coffee!
</em><br />
<br />You are joking? I have evidence it is the evening!!! (you are right: we 
<br />
are not in the same universe!, but then a last coffee? your fault if I 
<br />
don't sleep this night ;)
<br />
<br />Bruno
