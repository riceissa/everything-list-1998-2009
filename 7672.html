<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;When you observe evidence and construct your models, you need some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;basis for choosing one model over another.  In general, you can create
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;an infinite number of possible models to match any finite amount of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;evidence.  It's even worse when you consider that the evidence is noisy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;and ambiguous.  This choice requires prior assumptions, independent of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;evidence, about which models are inherently more likely to be true or not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;In practice we use coherence with other theories to guide out choice.  With
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;that kind of constraint we may have trouble finding even one candidate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, in principle there still should be an infinite number of theories,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; starting with &quot;the data is completely random and just happens to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; look lawful by sheer coincidence&quot;.  I think the difficulty we have in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finding new ones is that we are implicitly looking for small ones, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means that we implicitly believe in Occam's Razor, which means that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implicitly adopt something like the Universal Distribution, a priori.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;We begin with an intuitive physics that is hardwired into us by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;evolution.  And that includes mathematics and logic.  Ther's an excellent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;little book on this, &quot;The Evolution of Reason&quot; by Cooper.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No doubt this is true.  But there are still two somewhat-related problems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One is, you can go back in time to the first replicator on earth, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think of its evolution over the ages as a learning process.  During this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time it learned this &quot;intuitive physics&quot;, i.e. mathematics and logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But how did it learn it?  Was it a Bayesian-style process?  And if so,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what were the priors?  Can a string of RNA have priors?
</em><br />
<br />An RNA string, arising naturally in a particular envirionment, can be modelled 
<br />
as expressing a prior about the probability of such RNA strings.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And more abstractly, if you wanted to design a perfect learning machine,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one that makes observations and optimally produces theories based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them, do you have to give it prior beliefs and expectations, including
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; math and logic?  Or could you somehow expect it to learn those?  But to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learn them, what would be the minimum you would have to give it?
</em><br />
<br />You'd have to give it the ability to reproduce and an environment in which it 
<br />
competed with other reproducing learners.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm trying to ask the same question in both of these formulations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the one hand, we know that life did it, it created a very good (if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps not optimal) learning machine.  On the other hand, it seems like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it ought to be impossible to do that, because there is no foundation.
</em><br />
<br />Why aren't elementary particles and entropy gradients enough foundation?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Mathematics and logic are more than models of reality.  They are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;pre-existent and guide us in evaluating the many possible models of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;reality which exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I'd say they are *less* than models of reality.  They are just consistency
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;conditions on our models of reality.  They are attempts to avoid talking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;nonsense.  But note that not too long ago all the weirdness of quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;mechanics and relativity would have been regarded as contrary to logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess we could agree that they are &quot;other&quot; than models of reality?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It still strikes me as paradoxical: ultimately we have learned our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuitions about mathematics and logic from reality, via the mechanisms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of evolution and also our own individual learning experiences.  And yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it seems that at some level a degree of logic, and certain mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptions, are necessary to get learning off the ground in the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place, and that they should not depend on reality.
</em><br />
<br />Why should they be any more independent of reality than say evolution or 
<br />
folk-physics?  I highly recommend Cooper's book.
