<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Peter,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We can discuss any subject rationally if we agree on axioms, but the problem is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in matters of value, those axioms are ultimately arbitrary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you say. I don't agree.

</em><br />
We could have a discussion as follows:

<br />
-Killing people because they can't provide for themselves is wrong.
<br />
-No it's not, it's efficient, and efficiency is good.
<br />
-But the wrong from the killing is not outweighed by the good from the efficiency gain.
<br />
-Yes it is, because there is no wrong from the killing.
<br />
-How could you say that? Would you like to be killed if you get old or sick?
<br />
-Maybe not, but I still don't think there is anything wrong with killing others.
<br />
-Isn't that inconsistent?
<br />
-Not at all. You seem to have plucked out the air this axiom that you have to do to others 
<br />
as you would have others do unto you, which I don't accept. And anyway, would you give 
<br />
up your objection to killing others if it would be guaranteed that you could not yourself be 
<br />
similarly harmed?
<br />
-No: it would still be wrong. You could imagine yourself being harmed in their position.
<br />
-What a strange notion! I have to refrain from killing other people because I can imagine 
<br />
that it would be unpleasant if I were in their position, regardless of whether it would be 
<br />
possible for me to be in their position. Who is being irrational now?
<br />
-Look at the wider implications for society, then. Everyone will be worried about what happens 
<br />
to them and their families.
<br />
-Not if they grow up knowing that that is the way it's going to be. People now know that they 
<br />
and everyone they know will get old and sick and die, so what's the difference? In any case, 
<br />
even if it makes everyone miserable, I don't care. Why should it be &quot;bad&quot; if most of the population 
<br />
is miserable? That's another axiom you've plucked out of the air. Through most of history there have 
<br />
been societies where substantial proportions of the population were slaves, or worse.
<br />
-Those were evil societies! We can see that now that we are more enlightened!
<br />
-You say they were evil, but I don't think they were evil, and the members of those societies didn't 
<br />
think they were evil, not even the slaves, who simply accepted slavery the way today it is simply 
<br />
accepted that some people are richer or smarter or taller than others.
<br />
-I simply disagree: causing suffering is evil.
<br />
-Causing suffering is not evil: allowing weak people to thrive is evil. Anyone with half a brain in his 
<br />
head should be able to see that.
<br />
-Monster!
<br />
-Fool!

<br />
etc.


<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  I believe that capital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; punishment is wrong; not because it is not a good deterrent, or because it is irreversible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if a mistake is made, but just because it's bad, evil.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You refusal to rationalise moral issues does not show that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is impossible for others to.

</em><br />
You can rationalise moral issues but eventually you reach a point such as &quot;causing net suffering in the 
<br />
world is bad&quot; which can't be further rationalised, it just has to be accepted or rejected.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Other people do not agree with me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I can't convince them, they can't convince me, because we disagree on an axiom.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is possible to have meta-arguments about axioms.

</em><br />
That's what we're doing.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; someone could show me that violent crime has consistently decreased in places where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; capital punishment has been introduced, and further demonstrated a causative link, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I might have to concede that I was wrong about my facts, but I would not change my mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about capital punishment being wrong, because in the *final* analysis every ethical and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; aesthetic belief has no logical or empirical justification.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or because you have reasons, objective ones, that override the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pragmatic consideration.

</em><br />
What could such an &quot;objective&quot; reason look like? And how would I justify that reason? In the 
<br />
end, the chain of justification has to stop somewhere.
