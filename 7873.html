<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The final word: OMs can be viewed as objective processes, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; efforts to find the simplest explanation considering Everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seem quite appropriate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It sounds like a final word but I'd urge caution. It may be _your_

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; final word but not the natural world's final world. 
</em><br />
<br />Well, I *did* say &quot;can be viewed&quot;, and in the rest of the sentence
<br />
merely stated that I did *not* have an argument with OMs per se. :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The system of observer moments could be just as 'mathematical'/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational and be an illusion - but a real illusion that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fit for purpose.
</em><br />
<br />I have to admit that I don't know what you mean.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Evolutionary considerations do not suggest that observation system[s]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be any better than that consistent with survival (not those necessities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compatible with the survival of a mathematician's view of the observation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system N million years later) :-)
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that's right!  (I mean, of course, I agree.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A cohort of elemental subjective experiences configured to present
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an emergent _apparent_ observation as an objective view equally fits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the circumstances you describe and is a simpler solution. Simpler
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because a brain does not have to make a-priori assertions about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything that is 'not' brain. It can slap computational paint
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on reality and come up with an 'adequate' picture without knowing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything about how 'not brain' works. Isn't that what it has to do?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How can a brain that knows nothing about the universe be created
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the universe from nothing without making such shortcuts?
</em><br />
<br />You say &quot;simpler because a brain does not have to make a-priori
<br />
assertions that is 'not' brain&quot;.  At the risk of perhaps misunderstanding
<br />
you, I would say that the brain was built by evolution first to make not
<br />
assertions but as a machine, to simply respond. For some of us humans, 
<br />
we indeed go further and make assertions and what not, but it's all
<br />
based on our primary functioning.
<br />
<br />Are you saying that our brains know nothing? (I'm trying especially hard
<br />
on this last sentence.)  Or are you asking how it can be created (but I
<br />
think you know the answer to that)?
<br />
<br />Earlier you say that the brain &quot;slaps computational paint on reality&quot;
<br />
and I am not sure at *all* that I know what you are talking about.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It can slap computational paint on reality and come up with an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'adequate' picture without knowing anything about how 'not brain' works.
</em><br />
<br />But our brains do store at least a kind of knowledge exactly about
<br />
how &quot;not brain&quot; (the outside world) works.  That's what they were
<br />
designed to do. So if you know that red means stop (and that operationally
<br />
you want to stop the vehicle when the light turns red to avoid accidents
<br />
and penalties) then you know something about the world. I guess I would
<br />
say that the brain knows that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How can a brain that knows nothing about the universe be created
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the universe from nothing without making such shortcuts?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is an _apparent_ objective view of a 'just-as-real' reality.
</em><br />
<br />Sorry, I'm baffled. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It also can be hypothesized to deliver what we have. If a theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insists that the objective view has any greater status than this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then part of the theory should explain why it is necessarily that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way and how its prescribed circumstances would deliver a solution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preferred by the natural world and indeed a very specific detailing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the difference between the two.
</em><br />
<br />The objective view should have better status (and it does except when
<br />
people start talking too abstractly to other abstract thinkers or when
<br />
they get behind a keyboard).  Here are the reasons why the objective
<br />
view should have higher status:
<br />
<br />1. When conflicts have arisen in the past---not temporary, accidental,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or quickly resolvable conflicts---the objective view triumphs. For
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;example, the objective view of the solar system in which the Earth
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circles the sun has more validity than the system of appearances
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from here on Earth, which was incorporated into more primitive
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and more error prone understandings.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I know that many here will retort that it's only from such a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system of appearances that the correct view was generated. While
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't talk that way, you'll agree that it was the final product
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has the higher status and ought to be regarded as true.
<br />
<br />2. Just as a naive realist---a child, say, who believes that their
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experiences of an object are all there is to an object---isn't
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aware of all the processes (in principle quite error prone processes)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that convey information from distant objects to visual system to the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rest of his brain, so some &quot;naive subjectivists&quot;, if you will, don't
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seem to appreciate that their entire experiences are simply nerve
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;firings.  They don't keep that image continually in mind, and fail
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when you talk to them to speak about what is objectively occurring,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just as Kepler's, Copernicus's, and Galileo's critics refused to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep in mind the picture of the solar system from outside.
<br />
<br />3. The objective view can be communicated to others, and on it successful
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sciences can be and have been built.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence my advice of caution in attributing the source of the 'observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment' to anything more than a subjectively delivered virtual objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view. 
</em><br />
<br />And we realists hasten to retort that better knowledge is built from
<br />
an understanding of the physical world, and that anything that is only
<br />
subjective should be looked at with the gravest suspicion.
<br />
