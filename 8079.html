<br />
Suppose that Leibniz's God had spared him the rigors of getting
<br />
old, and that he retained a fresh young brain and body over these
<br />
hundreds of years.  What would be his beliefs today, and what
<br />
subjects would interest him the most?
<br />
<br />We have to assume that as the 1700's unfolded, he would grudgingly
<br />
adjust to the fact that the &quot;Newtonian&quot; world view was preeminent
<br />
and probably correct. He'd follow (and probably contribute greatly
<br />
to) the scientific advances of the 18th century, and even exult at
<br />
the prediction of atoms (most probably) and the great mathematical
<br />
and chemical advances of the French.
<br />
<br />He would have witnessed Wolfgang Kohler's discovery of uric acid in
<br />
1828, and we must suppose that he'd accept with alacrity the new
<br />
mechanist and anti-vitalist views of the 19th century. With his
<br />
genius, he'd also follow the tremendous scientific strides made
<br />
in the second half of the century, many by his German compatriots.
<br />
<br />With what wonder would he then greet Einstein's most philosophically
<br />
influential discovery of 1905?  He might even after all those years
<br />
secretly revel in the overthrow of the &quot;Newtonian&quot; world view. Knowing
<br />
Leibniz, it wouldn't be surprising that he'd have been right in there
<br />
with Lorentz and Poincare deriving almost simultaneously (pun intended)
<br />
the results of Special Relativity.
<br />
<br />But with what total amazement would he follow Einstein's real
<br />
breakthrough, the one that only Einstein could have made in the
<br />
first half of the 20th century?  I speak, of course, of the
<br />
General Theory. Perhaps Leibniz would get on board at the
<br />
last minute, as did Hilbert, and perhaps also almost beat Einstein
<br />
to final publication. He might have even discovered the Schwarzschild
<br />
solution before Schwarzschild.
<br />
<br />But, given that perpetually fresh young brain, wouldn't Leibniz
<br />
have also contributed to the quantum revolution?  Wouldn't he also
<br />
have grasped before almost anyone else the implications of the work
<br />
of Kurt Gödel?  And one must imagine that in the 1930's Leibniz
<br />
would be the first to recall the work of Babbage, and believe that
<br />
the time was at hand when his beloved calculi would admit true
<br />
mechanical manipulation?
<br />
<br />So Leibniz would have been a part of the electronic and computer
<br />
revolutions, and would have understood the final defeat of vitalism
<br />
in 1953. It seems clear that he would have followed physics right
<br />
up through the development of the standard model in 1968.
<br />
<br />But what then?  The crystal ball grows dark.  Any thoughts?
<br />
<br />Lee
