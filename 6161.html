<br />
The question of free will has generated an enormous
<br />
amount of philosophical literature.  I'd suggest reading
<br />
at least the first part of this page on &quot;Compatibilism&quot;,
<br />
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/</a>.  Compatibilism is the
<br />
doctrine that free will is compatible with determinism.  Probably the
<br />
most well known advocacy of compatibilism is Daniel Dennett'e 1984 book
<br />
Elbow Room.  From the page above:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Compatibilism offers a solution to the free will problem. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical problem concerns a disputed incompatibility between free
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will and determinism. Compatibilism is the thesis that free will is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compatible with determinism. Because free will is taken to be a necessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; condition of moral responsibility, compatibilism is sometimes expressed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in terms of a compatibility between moral responsibility and determinism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. Terminology and One formulation of the Free Will Problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.1 Free Will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would be misleading to specify a strict definition of free will since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the philosophical work devoted to this notion there is probably no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single concept of it. For the most part, what philosophers working on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issue have been hunting for, maybe not exclusively, but centrally, is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feature of agency that is necessary for persons to be morally responsible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for their conduct.[1] Different attempts to articulate the conditions for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moral responsibility will yield different accounts of the sort of agency
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; required to satisfy those conditions. What is needed, then, as a starting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point, is a gentle, malleable notion that focuses upon special features
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of persons as agents. Hence, as a theory-neutral point of departure, free
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will can be defined as the unique ability of persons to exercise control
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over their conduct in a manner necessary for moral responsibility.[2]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Clearly, this definition is too lean when taken as an endpoint; the hard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical work is about how best to develop this special kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; control. But however this notion of control is developed, its uniqueness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consists, at least in part, in being possessed only by persons.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.2 Moral Responsibility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A person who is a morally responsible agent is not merely a person who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is able to do moral right or wrong. Beyond this, she is accountable for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her morally significant conduct. Hence, she is, when fitting, an apt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; target of moral praise or blame, as well as reward or punishment. Free
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will is understood as a necessary condition of moral responsibility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since it would seem unreasonable to say of a person that she deserves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; blame and punishment for her conduct if it turned out that she was not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at any point in time in control of it. (Similar things can be said about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; praise and reward.) It is primarily, though not exclusively, because of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the intimate connection between free will and moral responsibility that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the free will problem is seen as an important one.[3]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.3 Determinism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A standard characterization of determinism states that every event
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is causally necessitated by antecedent events.[4] Within this essay,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we shall define determinism as the metaphysical thesis that the facts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the past, in conjunction with the laws of nature, entail every truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the future. According to this characterization, if determinism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is true, then, given the actual past, and holding fixed the laws of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nature, only one future is possible at any moment in time. Notice that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an implication of determinism as it applies to a person's conduct is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that, if determinism is true, there are (causal) conditions for that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person's actions located in the remote past, prior to her birth, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are sufficient for each of her actions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.4 Compatibilism's Competitors
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The compatibilists' main adversaries are incompatibilists, who deny the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compatibility of free will and determinism. Some incompatibilists remain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agnostic as to whether persons have free will. But most take a further
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stand regarding the reality or unreality of free will. Some of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incompatibilists, libertarians, hold that at least some persons have free
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will and that, therefore, determinism is false. Other incompatibilists,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hard determinists, have a less optimistic view, holding that determinism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is true and that no persons have free will. A minority opinion is held
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by hard incompatibilists, who hold that there is no free will regardless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of determinism's truth or falsity.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think the essay covers it, but as others have pointed out the
<br />
problem with basing free will (as defined above) on quantum indeterminacy
<br />
is that it seems as bad as determinism as far as satisfying our instincts
<br />
about what deserves blame or praise.  We don't praise a machine for
<br />
working as designed, nor do we praise the dice for coming up the way
<br />
we want in a gambling game.  These are not moral agents.  This is the
<br />
paradox, and the essay on compatibilism might also shed light on how a
<br />
purely random nondeterminism can be compatible with free will as well.
