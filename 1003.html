One of the thins which is attractive about Wei's approach, as I understand
<br />
it, is that it does not try to answer the question of whether a given
<br />
system is conscious, at least not in yes-or-no terms.  Rather, it tries
<br />
to give a probability that a given system is conscious, and specifically
<br />
that it instantiates a particular consciousness, such as my own.
<br />
<br />This allows you to have such things as systems which are &quot;probably&quot;
<br />
conscious, or, in a sense, &quot;partially&quot; conscious (in the sense that
<br />
we can treat them as having a 10% chance of being conscious, say).
<br />
This interpretation makes most sense in the context of the Strong
<br />
Self-Selection Assumption (that we can consider our moments of experience
<br />
as randomly chosen from among all observer-moments).  The probabilities
<br />
assigned to consciousness serve as a weighting factor for how much they
<br />
contribute to the ensemble of all observer-moments.
<br />
<br />We don't try to ask, &quot;is it like something to be this rock, or this
<br />
brain&quot;.  We ask, what is the probability that it is like something
<br />
to be this rock, or perhaps, what is the probability that it is like
<br />
&quot;being me right now&quot; to be this rock.
<br />
<br />In Chalmer's &quot;fading qualia&quot;, he points out the unreasonability of
<br />
describing systems as being partially conscious, maybe halfway between
<br />
between being conscious as we are and being zombies.  But Wei's approach
<br />
avoids this while still allowing for gradations of consciousness.  He does
<br />
not try to imagine what it is like to be one of those systems which is
<br />
&quot;50% conscious&quot;, rather he simply incorporates the 50% in the contribution
<br />
the system makes to the overall ensemble of conscious systems.
<br />
<br />Wei's method is reminiscent of an objective variant on Hans Moravec's
<br />
pan-psychism, the notion that everything is potentially conscious,
<br />
it's just a matter of how we look at it.  Hans would say that a brain
<br />
seems conscious to us and a rock does not, because the mapping needed
<br />
to see the brain's consciousness is simpler from our perspective than
<br />
the mapping that would be necessary for the rock's.  He raises the
<br />
possibility that there could be other observers in our own world for
<br />
whom the rock was conscious but the brain was not, because the mapping
<br />
was simpler in that direction for them.
<br />
<br />Wei's approach rejects the subjective element but retains the notion
<br />
that there is a degree of probability for any system's consciousness.
<br />
The brain's probability is very high, and the rock's is very low.
<br />
The construction of the probabilities might be operationally very similar
<br />
to Hans' model, having to do with how complex the mapping would have
<br />
to be (similar as well to Jacques Mallah's proposal).  But it is given
<br />
an objective interpretation.  In effect we reject the notion that there
<br />
are legitimate observers for whom the rock is conscious.  Whether there
<br />
is a sound objective basis for doing so is still unclear to me.
