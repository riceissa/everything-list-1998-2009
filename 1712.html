<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And as I said, without measure-like concept, without structure on the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The concept of measure is tricky. If one insists on an absolute value for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure, (such that measure is lost upon death and gained upon branching) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then one gives up the Cosmological Principle that the Universe looks the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from any point (in the Plenitude). In addition, one must come up with a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;value 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for that measure, for example 75690339.  Furthermore, one must find a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for this particular value which defeats the nice acausal symmetry provided 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by the concept of the plenitude. (Laws without laws by Wheeler? I don't know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if my quote is correct). This, I guess, is the approach that Jacques is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;taking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;On the other hand, if one accepts a relativistic measure, that is if we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;renormalize the measure at everypoint along the branching process, it almost 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;makes a mockery of the whole concept of measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Almost the same words could have been said about motion before Galileo and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also before Einstein..... If motion is absolute then what is the velocity of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Earth? And if it is relative, then any motion measured.... from its own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;frame of reference.... is always zero....
</em><br />
<br />I see the point, ok.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This brings us to the concept of 1st person and 3rd person measure. We could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;view measure in the same way as motion. First person measure is always the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same. We could define this value to be unity. Third person measure would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be different. Very low for someone when we observe this someone near death, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very high for someone if we - the observers - are ourselves near death.
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;First person measure of TRUE or tautologies have unity valued. Not
<br />
first person measure of the event &quot;going to Washington&quot; of course.
<br />
So OK.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Third person measure would then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be different. Very low for someone when we observe this someone near death, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very high for someone if we - the observers - are ourselves near death.
</em><br />
<br />Well, that is ambiguous. Here G said nothing, and G* say very high.
<br />
But G and G* are 3-person. The 1-person, as you say remains constant.
<br />
In some sense and ideally and among machines. The real human first 
<br />
person will build his first expectations from his favorite religion ...
<br />
(I guess).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This has all sort of implications in Quantum theory. One implication is that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the wave function appears different dependent on the 3rd person probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of continuing living.
</em><br />
<br />Not sure about that. Need to think about. With my pure comp approach
<br />
I haven't the universal function at my disposal, except as a powerfully
<br />
inspired guide.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;One more thing. There is really no such a thing as a single third person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a unique measure and a unique probability of continued life. Each &quot;third 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person&quot; observer carries with him his own measure and his own probability of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continued life.
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Therefore, I think that the &quot;third person&quot; should be replaced by the more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;general relativistic concept according to which each observer has his own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(relativistic) measure and (relativistic) probability of continued life.
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps. I see to much meanings in this statement.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The problem is to desigh the experiment to test the theory. :-)
</em><br />
<br />Sure ! But first you should formulate sufficiently clearly 
<br />
the theory for being able to design the experiment :-)
<br />
What I'm saying here is that I don't understand your idea of putting
<br />
the (relativistic) measure in the observer. In what sense ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How can the concept of relative measure be adapted to Bruno's attempt (comp) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to explain the laws of Physics from WAP and Turing?
</em><br />
<br />Good question ;-)
