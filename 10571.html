Bruno
<br />
<br />I'm absolutely sincere in what I've said about approaching comp in
<br />
'as if' mode. But at the same time I've hoped from the beginning
<br />
that we could make explicit the choices that motivate our different
<br />
ontic starting assumptions. Are there perhaps irreconcilable issues of
<br />
style or preference, or are there fundamental logical, philosophical,
<br />
or even semantic errors entailed in one or other position? Well, let me
<br />
continue in the effort by trying to clarify my position on some of your
<br />
recent points.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, either you put in AR something which is not there (like peter D
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jones who want me doing &quot;Aristotle error&quot; on the numbers (like if I was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reifying some concreteness about them), or you should have a powerful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument against AR, but then you should elaborate.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be honest I have not yet seen where you postulates comp wrong in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your long anti-roadmap post.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Recall that I take comp as YD + CT + AR (Yes Doctor + Church Thesis +
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Arithmetical Realism).
</em><br />
<br />OK.  I've already agreed to accept AR in 'as if' mode. So that implies
<br />
I'm staying on the comp road in the same 'as if' spirit to see where it
<br />
leads. It's very interesting! Also I genuinely think that AR is not
<br />
'false' from any of the *logical* perspectives from which you
<br />
defend it. My problem - outside 'as if' mode (and this goes back to the
<br />
'primacy' issue) - is with adopting *any* 3rd-person postulate as
<br />
'ontic ground zero'. My view - and I'm still not clear whether
<br />
you think it unjustified, or that you simply *prefer* to start
<br />
elsewhere - is that we go wrong the moment we fail to treat reflexive
<br />
indexical necessity with maximal - *extreme* - seriousness. My most
<br />
basic claim is that to make *any* 3rd-person assumption primary - even
<br />
one as apparently 'modest' as AR - is to try to 'sneak past'
<br />
this, and thereby to fail *the* crucial test of ontic realism.
<br />
<br />We could call this position maximal personal, or indexical,
<br />
seriousness, but what's in a name? It frustrates me almost beyond
<br />
endurance that this isn't simply 'obvious' (though error,
<br />
especially one's own, is subtle). But it seems as though we're
<br />
somehow 'tricked' out of seeing it because all 'personal'
<br />
interaction (including that with the 'self') is relational, and
<br />
3rd-person is the characteristic mode of relational interaction. So all
<br />
natural language just assumes it.
<br />
<br />Consequently when you say:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What you say is exactly what the lobian *first person* will feel.  I hope you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see this eventually.
</em><br />
<br />I think I 'see' it *now*. I understand that the lobian first person
<br />
*emerging* from your 3rd person AR postulate *would* indeed
<br />
'possess' such a view. But my problem is with all this 3rd person
<br />
language. I can indeed 'see' how you can invoke a '1st-person
<br />
David analog' in this way, but I can't at all see how this causes
<br />
'indexically necessary David' - 'here and now' - to appear
<br />
out of 'thin 3rd-person air'. Logic lacks this power. It seems as
<br />
if only magic will do. It's like Harry Potter saying - &quot;I know
<br />
I'm just imagining you, but hang on, in just a jiffy AR will make you
<br />
indexically necessary&quot;.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, bare 'indexical necessity' is the sole ontic
<br />
postulate I need. Is this an insufficiently 'modest' requirement? My
<br />
justification is reflexively evident and incorrigible. It does no
<br />
practical damage to the subsequent postulation of AR - it can't do,
<br />
because this position simply *is* the situation from which I postulate
<br />
it. By the same token, CT survives (if true) undamaged by being
<br />
postulated from this position. In other words, I'm claiming that we
<br />
have access to versions of AR and CT manifested entirely in virtue of
<br />
their generalisation from relational reality, and I can't see that
<br />
you or I have reason to believe anything else, except through
<br />
'Penrose direct revelation', which you reject. So what's the
<br />
alternative?
<br />
<br />YD now becomes the interesting case, and the point, as I recall, where
<br />
we started. My long post refers to the dependencies and assumptions,
<br />
implicit in bit-stream representations, that are only made explicit by
<br />
their instantiation. My argument is that any digital program is an
<br />
arbitrary gloss on the behaviour of a 'substrate' (i.e. lower logical
<br />
level) - I think I've seen you argue more or less the same point -
<br />
and therefore relies on a notion of 'causation' (dependency,
<br />
sequence, structure, behaviour, or state your preferred terminology) -
<br />
that is essentially non-local at the level of such instantiation.
<br />
<br />Consequently we must choose: to believe either that *any* example of
<br />
situated, indexical, experience arises from localised phenomena at the
<br />
causal level of their instantiation (appropriately schematised), or
<br />
that it arises from arbitrary, non-localised, aspatial, atemporal,
<br />
abstractions from behaviour at this level. I can't see that these
<br />
considerations don't apply to *any* digital 'substitution level'
<br />
that relies on a purely syntactical expression - e.g. instantiation
<br />
in a digital computer - and would consequently have to decline the
<br />
doctor's offer. This is what I mean by non-invariance of experiential
<br />
structure to Turing emulation.
<br />
<br />However, the question then becomes one of defining the 'level' of
<br />
instantiation. You have pointed out, I recall, that the comp
<br />
assumptions leave 'matter' devoid of any unique explanatory
<br />
function. This isn't a surprise surely, because 'matter' is
<br />
defined purely relationally as behaviour. Be that as it may, why would
<br />
we ever expect a purely relational or behavioural description to invoke
<br />
prior indexical necessity in my maximally serious sense? And without
<br />
such a prior ontic postulate, any relational schema surely 'exists'
<br />
only in 'Harry Potter space'? With it, 'matter' becomes a
<br />
causal layer in the construction of experience and everything we infer
<br />
from it. If we can schematise this in a way that proves capable of
<br />
'substitution', YD would then emerge as an empirical possibility
<br />
'from the bottom up'. In effect, to say 'yes' to the doctor
<br />
would be to agree to be cloned.
<br />
<br />So, in summary, if comp were presented as a relational substitution
<br />
scheme defined on prior, maximally serious ontic necessity - in my
<br />
sense - from which AR, CT and YD emerge at the appropriate relational
<br />
level, I could perhaps travel with you even more happily. I just
<br />
can't see, except in 'as if' mode, how AR truly serves as
<br />
'ontic ground zero' in this 'maximally serious' sense. I'd be
<br />
grateful if you could show me how this is false. Or is it rather that
<br />
modesty dictates that comp takes us no further than 'as if'?

<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Comp is false&quot;. Let's see where *that* leads.....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; isn't intended as a definitive claim that comp *is* false.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. AR is false, but CT is true, and YD is true. This would mean there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a program which stops or does not stop according to my knowledge of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it. It is beyond my imagination, even if, as a logician I know that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to postulate AR. Of course the UD would loose all its purpose.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. CT is false. This would mean there exist a way to explain in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finite time how to compute a function from N to N, such that no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer can be programmed to compute it. Possible but unlikely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) YD is true, but CT is false and AR is false. This means the doctor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is helped by Gods or Goddesses.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) YD is false (and CT and AR are true). This means I am an actual

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite object.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5) 6) 7): combination of above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Rather, *if*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it is false, in what ways specifically, and what are the alternatives?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Can they be stated as clearly and explicitly as Bruno is trying to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for his approach ('to see where it leads')? Hence the 'anti-roadmap',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or perhaps better - 'another roadmap', or some ideas for one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is certainly interesting. But comp is a very weak statement, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-comp is very strong. It needs some actual infinite to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;implemented&quot;. Judson Webb range &quot;comp&quot; in the &quot;finitist doctrines&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (but not in the ultra-finitist doctrine).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Most of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the thoughts in it were originally expressed in some earlier postings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on 'The Fabric of Reality' list, which Bruno was kind enough to copy to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this list.  Anyway, it's intended as a point of departure (for me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; certainly) and I look forward to some strenuous critiques.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; One misgiving I have, now that I've finally grasped (I think) that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; comp 'theology' entails 'faith' in the number realm, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I prefer to reserve &quot;faith&quot; for the resurection &quot;promised but not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guarantied&quot; by the (honest) doctor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I need infinitely less faith to believe that each number has a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successor than to believe the sun will rise tomorrow. AR is very weak.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sometimes I regret to have been explicit on AR, because it looks like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everyone believe in it, except when we write it explicitly. People put
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many things in it, which are not there. Not believing in AR also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entails that there is a finite polynomial (on the integers) such that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two different people can find different integer values when applying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the polynomial on the same number, and despite those people agree on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the meaning of + and * and zero and &quot;+1&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ... is that by this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; token it seeks to provide a TOE (Bruno, am I wrong about this?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are right. By the UDA it is not a matter of choice.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is, beginning with an assertion of 'faith' in UDA + the number realm,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we seek to axiomatise and 'prove' a complete theory of our origins.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Bruno is a very modest person, but I worry about the 'modesty' of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; goal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Modesty is not incompatible with ambitious goal. You can decide to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; climb the everest Mountain, and recognize you have climb only two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meters high :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course, it's highly probable that I just misunderstand this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; point. However, I'm having trouble with my faith in numbers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; monseigneur.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We cannot build a theory without accepting some intuitive truth, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some third person presentation of those truth. AR false means that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple y = sin(x) real function could intersect the real axes on some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non integer abscisse. Do you really believe that? Quantum mechanics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relies completely on AR. If AR is false, QM is inconsistent (and almost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all math).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, either you put in AR something which is not there (like peter D
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jones who want me doing &quot;Aristotle error&quot; on the numbers (like if I was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reifying some concreteness about them), or you should have a powerful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument against AR, but then you should elaborate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My own intuition begins from my own indexical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; self-assertion, my necessity, generalised to an inclusive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; self-asserting necessity extending outwards indefinitely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here I have a pedagogical, if not diplomatical, problem. What you say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is exactly what the lobian *first person* will feel.  I hope you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see this eventually.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for a way to 'get behind' this, and to this extent I don't seek a TOE,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; because I can't believe that 'everything' (despite the name of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; list) is theoretically assimilable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is not. Here is the funny thing: the third person &quot;ultimate reality&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with comp seems to be not so great: it is just the natural numbers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; including their relations in term of addition and multiplication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is enough to give rise to first person plenitude(s) which are way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bigger than &quot;just the numbers&quot;. Indeed the first person plenitude
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; escapes *all* theories. (Even provably so, and that is why comp gives a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort of vaccine against almost all &quot;normative&quot; psychology or theology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Accepting comp is like accepting we cannot control everything. Comp,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well understanded, should be appreciate by those who likes freedom, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be feared by those willing to control too much.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It looks paradoxical, but it is only &quot;counter-intuitive. It is akin to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Skolem paradox&quot; in &quot;model theory&quot;. Some little structure can have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; giant substructures.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This may well be blindness more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; than modesty, however.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Having said this, of course in a spirit of learning I'm trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; understand and adopt *as if* true the comp assumptions, and continue to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; put my best efforts into getting my head around Bruno's roadmap as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emerges. I have a lot of experience of changing my mind (and maybe I'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; get a better one!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I certainly appreciate your good will,
