Hal Finney has provided some intriguing notions and possibly
<br />
some very useful explanations. But I would like help in clarifying
<br />
even the first several paragraphs, in order to maximize my
<br />
investment in the remainder.
<br />
<br />But first a few comments; these may be premature, but if so,
<br />
the comments should be ignored.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some time back Lee Corbin posed the question of which was more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental: observer-moments or universes?  I would say, with more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought, that observer-moments are more fundamental in terms of explaining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the subjective appearance of what we see, and what we can expect.
</em><br />
<br />But in general, what do observer-moments explain? Or what does the
<br />
hypothesis concerning them explain?  I just don't get a good feel
<br />
that there are any &quot;higher level&quot; phenomena which might be reduced
<br />
to observer-moments (I am still very skeptical that all of physics
<br />
or math or something could be reduced to them---but if that is 
<br />
what is meant, I stand corrected). Rather, it always seems like
<br />
a number of (other) people are trying to explain observer-moments
<br />
as arising from the activity of a Universal Dovetailer, or a 
<br />
Platonic ensemble of bit strings, or something.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; An observer-moment is really all we have as our primary experience of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world.  The world around us may be fake; we may be in the Matrix or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a brain in a vat.  Even our memories may be fake.  But the fact that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are having particular experiences at a particular moment cannot be faked.
</em><br />
<br />Nothing could be truer.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the universe is fundamental, in my view, in terms of the ontology,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physical reality of the world.  Universes create and contain observers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who experience observer-moments.  This is the Schmidhuber/Tegmark model...
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but now arises my need for clarification:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In terms of measure, Schmidhuber (and possibly Tegmark) provides a means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to estimate the measure of a universe.  Consider the fraction of all bit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strings that create that universe as its measure.
</em><br />
<br />I think that perhaps I know exactly what is meant; but I'm unwilling
<br />
to take the chance. Let's say that we have a universe U, and now we
<br />
want to find its measure (its share of the mega-multi-Everything
<br />
resources).  So, as you write, we consider all the bit strings
<br />
that create U.  Let's say for concreteness that only five bit strings
<br />
&quot;really exist&quot; in some deep sense:
<br />
<br />010101110100101010011101010110001010110101...
<br />
101101110100010101111111001011010110100101...
<br />
001010100111010100111010001001000010101111...
<br />
11011101000100100001010l110110000101010011...   
<br />
110010111010101110100010000101001010011111...
<br />
<br />and then it just so happens that only 2 out of these five actually
<br />
make the universe U manifest. That is, in the innards of 2 of these,
<br />
one finds all the structures that U contains. Am I following so far?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In practice this is roughly 1/2^n where n is the size of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shortest program that outputs that universe.
</em><br />
<br />So each of these universes (each of the five, in my toy example)
<br />
has a certain Kolmogorov complexity?  Each of the five can be
<br />
output by some program?  But is that program infinite or finite?
<br />
<br />Argument for finite: normally we want to speak of *short* programs
<br />
and so that seems to indicate the program has a limited size.
<br />
Argument for infinite: dramatically *few* bit strings that are
<br />
infinite in length have just a finite amount of information.
<br />
Our infinite level-one Tegmark universe, for example, probably
<br />
is tiled by Hubble volumes in a non-repeating irregular way so
<br />
that no program could output it.
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />
Lee
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Tegmark model may allow for similar reasoning,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; applied to mathematical structures rather than computer programs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, how to get from universe measure to observer-moment (OM) measure?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is what I want to write about....
