You don't need an infinite number of universes, or even an infinite number 
<br />
of states in the one universe (if there is only one universe) to have 
<br />
something approaching immortality. If you limit yourself to the information 
<br />
theoretically containable in even something as small as a human-sized 
<br />
object, it would be many orders of magnitude greater than the amount of 
<br />
information processed by a human brain in a single lifetime. I think it 
<br />
would be relatively straightforward to calculate how many orders of 
<br />
magnitude using the Beckenstein Bound - perhaps someone could comment. If 
<br />
you allow for the potential information content in the whole visible 
<br />
universe, I'm sure that would be plenty of lifetimes for every human that 
<br />
has ever lived. The problem is not the number of possible lifetimes squeezed 
<br />
into the universe, but whether these possibilities will actually be 
<br />
realised.
<br />
<br />In a many worlds interpretation of QM, all possibilities WILL be realised in 
<br />
some universe. If the universe is unique but infinite in extent (and hence 
<br />
contains an infinite amount of information), all possibilities will be 
<br />
realised provided that it is homogeneous but non-repeating. If all possible 
<br />
computations are implemented by virtue of their platonic existence, without 
<br />
the need for a &quot;real&quot; physical universe at all, then again all possibilities 
<br />
will be realised and we are immortal in this virtual heaven. If the universe 
<br />
collapses in such a way as to allow an infinite number of computations in a 
<br />
finite amount of time, as per Tipler, then potentially we will experience 
<br />
immortality, although I have not been able to understand how the 
<br />
quantisation of time would allow such a thing.
<br />
<br />In a recent post (&quot;All possible worlds in a single world cosmology?&quot;) I 
<br />
wondered about this question in a more pessimistic situation: one universe, 
<br />
containing a finite amount of matter/energy/information, expanding and 
<br />
cooling forever. As discussed above, even this model contains the 
<br />
possibility of near-immortality; certainly the possibility of at least every 
<br />
possible future our current limited minds could conceive. As you suggested, 
<br />
even single word interpretations of QM allow for extremely improbable 
<br />
events, such as the Earth quantum tunnelling to another star. I don't accept 
<br />
your notion of a minimal quantum of probability; there seems no reason to 
<br />
postulate such a thing. Given infinite time, such improbable events MUST 
<br />
occur - provided that the probability statys constant or increases per unit 
<br />
time. But if the probability decreases with time, then, even given eternity, 
<br />
it is NOT certain that the given improbable-but-not-impossible event will 
<br />
occur, so that immortality is not guaranteed. Bummer!
<br />
<br />So far, no-one has been able to tell me what happens to the probability of 
<br />
bizarre quantum events occurring as t-&gt;infinity in a finite, eternally 
<br />
expanding universe, which incidentally seems more likely than the Tipler 
<br />
scenario.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Subject: regarding QM and infinite universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Date: Mon, 26 Jul 2004 20:54:33 -0400
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I posted this today on the Fabric of Reality Yahoo Group, but would like to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;get responses to it over here as well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;First, regarding the idea of magical universes or quantum immortality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for that matter, doesn't this assume a truly infinite number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes?  However, if you start with the idea that the reality we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience is being created by a mechanical/computational process,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;isn't it more likely that the number of universes is just extremely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;large?    Why should we assume the &quot;creator&quot; (however you choose to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;define that) has access to infinite resources?   Also, everything that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;makes up our universe appears to have finite characteristics (per QM),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so it seems like every possibility within the parameters of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multiverse could be covered by an enormous, but not infinite range of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possibility.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My understanding of QM is that it describes possibilities (even if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;vanishingly small) of bizarre things occurring in our everyday world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;For instance, I once read a book in which the author calculated the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possibility(incredibly small obviously) that our planet would suddenly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appear in orbit, fully intact, around another star.  He argued that QM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;allows for this possibility.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think we are overlooking something here.  It seems like there should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be a quanta of probabilty, just as there is (apparently) with time,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;space, and matter.  In other words, once the probability of something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happening falls below a certain threshold, it is not realized.  Could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there be a Planck scale of probability?  Does decoherence somehow keep
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these strange events from occurring on a macro scale?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also, it seems to me that the violation of other physical laws comes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;into play in preventing many scenarios from taking place.  For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instance, with quantum immortality, I understand the concept that if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there are infinite copies of me, there will always be one more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe in which I survive another second.  But the reality is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there would seem to be a rate of diminishing return here.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability curve would have a point where it approaches zero, even as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the number of alternatives approached infinity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Another way to resolve the immortality issue is to presume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness survives death, but I will not remark on that further.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One thing that I think hurts the MWI as a theory is the misconception
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;among many that everytime a choice is made, the entire universe splits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in two, and there is a proliferation of all of these virtually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;identical copies of universes out there somewhere.  In reality there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is only one universe, and there is a proliferation of differences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being created.  The only thing that matters are the recorded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;differences, everything else remains unchanged. If you view our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality as a virtual reality it is much easier to understand this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concept.  For instance a program that predicts the weather doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have to create an entirely new simulation for each outcome it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;predicts- it can overlap the various possibilities in one simulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
