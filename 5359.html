<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am not sure about that. Suppose a teacher has 10^1000 students. Today

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1/(10^1000) chance that he will be interrogated. That's quite negligible,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(assuming that all student are lazy) none of the students prepare the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interrogation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But then the day after the teacher says: &quot;Smith, come on to the board, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interrogate you&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I hope you agree there has been no miracle here, even if for the student, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the one interrogated is a sort of (1-person) miracle. No doubt that this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;student
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could cry out for an explanation, but we know there is no explanations...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose the teacher and the student are immortal and the teacher 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interrogates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one student each day. Eternity is very long, and there will be arbitrarily 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;period where poor student Smith will be interrogated each days of that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;period.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Obviously Smith will believe that the teacher has something special against 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;him/her.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But still we know it is not the case ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So I don't think apparent low probability forces us to search for an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explanation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;especially in an everything context, only the relative probability of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continuation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could make sense, or &quot;ab initio&quot; absolute probabilities could perhaps be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;given for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entire histories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />But your example assumes we already know the probabilities. If Smith has two 
<br />
different hypotheses that a priori both seem subjectively plausible to 
<br />
him--for example, &quot;the teacher will pick fairly, therefore my probability of 
<br />
being picked is 1 in 10^1000&quot; vs. &quot;I know my father is the teacher's 
<br />
arch-nemesis, therefore to punish my family I expect he will fake the random 
<br />
draw and unfairly single me out with probability 1&quot;, then if Smith actually 
<br />
is picked, he can use Bayesian reasoning to now conclude the second 
<br />
hypothesis is more likely (unless he considered its a priori subjective 
<br />
likelihood to be less than 10^-1000 that of the first hypothesis).
<br />
<br />This is a better analogy to the situation of finding myself to be a human 
<br />
and not one of the much larger number of other conscious animals (even if we 
<br />
restrict ourselves to mammals and birds, who most would agree are genuinely 
<br />
conscious, the number of mammals/birds that have ever lived is surely much 
<br />
larger than the number of humans that have ever lived--just think of how 
<br />
many rodents have been born throughout the last 65 million years!) Even if I 
<br />
a priori favor the idea that I should consider any observer-moment equally 
<br />
likely, unless I am virtually certain that the probabilities are not biased 
<br />
in favor of observer-moments with human-level complexity, then finding 
<br />
myself to actually be experiencing such an observer-moment should lead me to 
<br />
shift my subjective probability estimate in favor of this second sort of 
<br />
hypothesis. Of course, both hypotheses assume it is meaningful to talk about 
<br />
the absolute probability of being different observer-moments, an assumption 
<br />
you may not share (but in that case the Smith/teacher analogy should not be 
<br />
a good one from your perspective).
<br />
<br />Another possible argument I thought of for having absolute probabilities as 
<br />
well as conditional probabilities. If one had a theory that only involved 
<br />
conditional probabilities, this might in some way be able to explain why I 
<br />
see the laws of physics work a certain way from one moment to the next, by 
<br />
describing it in terms of the probability that my next experience will be Y 
<br />
if my current one is X. But how would it explain why, when I examine records 
<br />
of events that happened in the past, even records of events before my 
<br />
subjective stream of consciousness began, I still see that everything obeyed 
<br />
those same laws back then as well? Could you explain that without talking 
<br />
about the absolute probability of what type of &quot;universe&quot; a typical 
<br />
observer-moment is likely to percieve himself being in, including memories 
<br />
and external records of the past?
