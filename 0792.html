<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think the requirement for computationalism for the existence of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;terminology, some of you may equate computationalism with rationality)
</em><br />
<br />Even without the comp hypothesis humans are (at least) Universal Turing
<br />
Machines. With comp we can look at things with a *Universal Turing 
<br />
Machine - tropic* constraint. We can introduce rationnality by 
<br />
restricting these machines with self-referential correctness, for 
<br />
exemple. And we can use logic
<br />
and computer science to study the possible discourse of these machines.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, I'm not sure rationality is necessary for consciousness. 
<br />
Well, it depends on the levels. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;GSLevy:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Similarly recording the activities of neurons and then playing them back 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;results in no consciousness at playback time but consciousness certainly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exists at recording time.
</em><br />
<br />You say that, I guess, because the &quot;activities of the neuron&quot; are
<br />
counterfactually correct (sensible to environment change). And the 
<br />
playback is only accidentally correct.
<br />
The problem is the following one. As Maudlin has shown, you can
<br />
transform an accidentally correct computation into a counterfactually 
<br />
correct one WITHOUT adding any physical activity. (And this is what I do 
<br />
with the filmed graph argument, the *crackpot proof* in Mallah's term).
<br />
This make the attribution of consciousness to the &quot;physical recording&quot;
<br />
problematic.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;GSL:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now lets make it more interesting and say that the playback machine is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implemented simply by rewinding the universe to some past state and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allowing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the same events to happen again.
</em><br />
<br />By taking the rewinding of the entire universe you got the situation of 
<br />
the dreaming brain, or any closed universal machine, and with comp this 
<br />
change nothing. But here you say:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;then in my opinion the two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness are actually one and the same because they view the world in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exactly the same way with the same rationality.
</em><br />
<br />And then you quote Hal and Jacques M Mallah:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hal:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(My solution is, as I said earlier, that the question isn't meaningful,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;because it is at best another iteration of an already-produced 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;calculation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and it doesn't matter if a conscious calculation is instantiated multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;times.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jacques: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I obviously reject that.
</em><br />
<br />And you say:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And this is the point where the idea of measure comes in.
</em><br />
<br />Well. I agree with you (if I understand you). In fact I agree with 
<br />
Hal when he says &lt;&lt;that the question isn't meaningful, because it is at 
<br />
best another iteration of an already-produced calculation&gt;&gt;
<br />
This is without doubt very important. It helps to explain the role of the 
<br />
depth of the computation (in Bennett sense). But I disagree with Hal when 
<br />
he adds:
<br />
&lt;&lt; and it doesn't matter if a conscious calculation is instantiated 
<br />
multiple times&gt;&gt;.
<br />
<br />In fact, it will matter in the case those computations can potentially 
<br />
diverge or (I still don't know) actually will diverge (in the UD*). In 
<br />
such a way a
<br />
*relative* measure will appears (and be completley defined in the limit). 
<br />
And consciousness depends here and now on this limit, because, as you say:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consciousness is playback independent and is also time independent. You 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implement it on a time share computer and it would not know the difference 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even if the active time intervals last one microsecond every billion years. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As long as the rational link between the time segments is maintained. 
</em><br />
<br />But you should realize at this stage that consciousness
<br />
is no more linkable to the actual physical activities of the neurons.
<br />
Quite the contrary, it is the physical activities of the neurons (and of 
<br />
the stars BTW) wich emerges from the possible experience of consciousness.
<br />
The physical emerge from the computationnal, as kind of sharable dreams 
<br />
between rational (sure!) machines.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This however is only my opinion. How to prove this and make scientific 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;predictions as Jacques demands can only be done if one is brave enough and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;willing to go through Tegmark's experiment. Eventually we will all have a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chance to do so and maybe Jacques will then be convinced :-). However if he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is right we won't be around to change our mind :-(
</em><br />
<br />Another way to make this more &quot;scientific&quot; is to take Church's thesis
<br />
seriously, to defined consciousness by something like the truth the 
<br />
machine can know (infer?) and cannot prove (a little child of Godelian 
<br />
Consistency), and then to use computer science to isolate and make 
<br />
precise the relative measure from which we can derive qualitative aspects 
<br />
of the physical world, like the MW aspect. And then compare with nature.
<br />
Immortality/MW are only one consequence among others of the hypothesis 
<br />
that we are Turing emulable.
<br />
<br />Bruno.
