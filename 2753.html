<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does not seem to be a response to my above point.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But what do *you* mean by implementation ?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;    It's hard to define &quot;existence&quot;, isn't it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;No. Positive integers exists. Nothing else.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    I must point out that you in no way addressed the question of defining 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;existence&quot;.  I am sure you do not mean to say that it is defined as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;positive integers!  To be pedantic, it is obvious that &quot;the square of 2&quot; is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;defined to be &quot;2 x 2&quot; and is not just defined to be &quot;4&quot;, even though we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;agree (after laborious calculation!) that the number 4 has the property in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. What I was trying to say is that I take arithmetical truth as 
<br />
something
<br />
independent of myself, although I am &quot;in there&quot; with all the rest. 
<br />
This follows from comp and UDA. I do not pretend it is obvious.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I have no problem if you want more, but in general I don't need it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The &quot;right&quot; frontier is somehow arbitrary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Arbritrary ain't good.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not at all. It fuzzifies things and make real decision easier, but
<br />
wrong sometimes, sure.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Consistency is an attribute of theories or machines or talking ducks,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;not of mathematical object like numbers.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    We seem to disagree on what a mathematical object is.  For me, anything 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that can be described mathematically counts as a mathematical structure. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is circular. But then you are no trying to really define what is
<br />
a mathematical object, I suppose.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; of course, an inconsistent description does not describe any math structure. 
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is not always obvious whether a given description is consistent or not, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and one way discussion of such a question is often framed is in terms of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whether the hypothetical structure that would be described 'exists'.  (e.g. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Does a power series expansion for f(x) exist?&quot;)
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. What's the point?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    However, there are perhaps three kinds of 'existence' to distinguish.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If a mathematical structure could (in principle) be described, then it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exists in the weakest sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    A classical Platonist would say that the structure belongs in Plato's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;heaven of math; it's a feature of the world which is logically necessary.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is an intermediate form of existance.  (Such an object need not have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any finite description, BTW.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Let's define a quantum Platonist as one who goes a step further and says 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Plato's realm of math is no heaven, but includes our Earth.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't take a word like Earth as granted in a metaphysical argument.
<br />
But I agree that the ten thousand earth and their variants exists in 
<br />
Plato's
<br />
heaven.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  This implies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the AUH. 
</em><br />
<br />Except that U is undefined. All Universes are indeed in Plato's heaven, 
<br />
but
<br />
none are material. They appears material to their inhabitant, that's all. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Unlike the classical position, this requires a unique and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inevitable *measure distribution* on the set of mathematical structures.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No. measure are relevant for inhabitant relatively to their computational
<br />
histories. And that need &quot;trans-univers&quot; reasoning. (A good thing, because
<br />
without that there would be no hope for a computationalist explanation of
<br />
quantum interferences).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    My position is that either the classical or the quantum Platonist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;position is true, with the latter being more likely (as it explains why 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we're here, but in its disfavor it demands a measure distribution).
</em><br />
<br /><br />It seems to me that the quantum is first person plural subjective and
<br />
is a consequence of comp platonisme. I make it &quot;clear&quot; formally in the
<br />
second part of my thesis.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You cannot just say physical = mathematical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree of course, but it is not obvious. It is part of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;work to make that clear. In particular, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that case, we must be able to prove F = ma, or SE.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  We use &quot;physical&quot; to refer to the structure that we guess exists in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strong sense.  If you believe in the AUH, then the distinction disappears.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Most people don't.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I believe in the All Computations thesis, except that it is not an
<br />
independant thesis. It follows from the (arithmetical) platonism.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The distinction disappears ontologically only, but the appearance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of the distinction does not disappear and must be explained.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    We would certainly like to be able to do that.  Unfortunately, as I have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;argued in other posts, the AUH is not falsifiable, so even if we prove that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;F=ma is very unlikely for us to see with the AUH, we are still stuck with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the AUH.  But it would be very unsatisfactory, of course.  We need to derive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;F=ma not to prove the AUH, but to make ourselves happy with it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The &quot;All Computation + comp&quot; *is* quasi-falsifiable. Mmmh...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    For me the key word is &quot;appearances&quot;.  I am sure Everett did NOT believe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in any discontinuous or probabilistic elements in his interpetation.
</em><br />
<br />First I agree with Bryce Dewitt that Everett did not propose an 
<br />
interpretation
<br />
of QM. Everett proposes only a new formulation which is essentially 
<br />
SE+COMP.
<br />
Then he explicitely derives the Wave reduction as a subjective process, 
<br />
from
<br />
an analysis of the memories of normal (Gaussian) classical machines, 
<br />
embedded
<br />
in a universal quantum computation. (I show the last is redundant).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Rather, he believed that, for a _typical_ observer-moment, that thought 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would include _seemingly random_ information which gave the _illusion_ or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;randomness, just like a typical member of the ordered set 000 001 010 011 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;100 101 110 111 &quot;looks like&quot; a random #.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes, sure. But he cares for those illusions, and he does not call them
<br />
illusions at all, just subjective appearances. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    My interpretation of Everett is proved by his statement that &quot;The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;behavior of these observers shall always be treated within the framework of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wave mechanics.&quot; 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Exactly. Behavior is typically objective/third person. I agree with this
<br />
reading of Everett.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This indicates that he did NOT intend to introduce any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;mind-like hidden variables&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Obviously.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; - and thus, no &quot;1st person&quot; merde about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness &quot;flowing&quot; from one observer-moment to another.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The flowing of consciousness is part of the appearances.
<br />
I still don't figure out why you want dismiss those appearances so much.
<br />
Especially talking on Everett who cares so much about it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;In my thought experience (UDA and the like) I use *exactly* the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Everett notion of subjective/objective. I call them first person and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;third person as in classical philosophy of mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    You just don't understand Everett, it appears.  As far as I can tell, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;his beliefs were normal (as opposed to crackpot/1st person/mind-like hidden 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;variable/QTI).
</em><br />
<br />Everett derives the first person plural probability from the third 
<br />
person SE. Why do you mix hidden variable into that. You *know* I
<br />
think that hidden variable *are* crackpot.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Of course, his model of the observer is seriously flawed (it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is not a computationalist model and does not address the reasons for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;considering a given set of states to be a 'memory'),
</em><br />
<br />Except that he has foreseen the &quot;decoherence of history&quot; approach. But yes
<br />
he forgets to justify SE, that is, once you accept comp you must take
<br />
all computationnalist state (not just the quantum one) into account and 
<br />
then 
<br />
show that SE emerges also from the first person plural point of view. And 
<br />
also, he doesn't take  Church thesis into account, and Godel, etc. 
<br />
So I did it :-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;there is an objective measure distribution, therefore no QTI or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other '1st person' nonsense.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree there is an objective measure distribution on the possible
<br />
relative consistent extension of my computational histories.
<br />
But apparently it entails COMPImmortality, and indeed QTImmortality,
<br />
I'm afraid.
<br />
And this with respect to a quite large set of possible ways for
<br />
defining &quot;personal identity&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;If you say, prior to the duplication &quot;I will either end up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;in Washington xor in Moscow&quot;, that's an objectively false statement.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Correct. I hope you will agree that if you say , prior to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;duplication, &quot;I will feel myself ending up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in Washington xor in Moscow&quot;, that's an objectively true statement.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(objectively with comp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    No.  (Or at least, incomplete.)  It all really depends on the definition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of &quot;me&quot;.  At this point I can think of three reasonable ways to define it, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but none of them would lead to that statement.  The simplest definition is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to define 'me' as a thought; then I exist only for a moment and never leave 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my home city.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ridiculous, I am not talking to a thought.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    The closest to what you want would be to define 'me' as a particular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implementation of a computation.  I believe that in this case, some of 'us' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would die, some of us would end up in Moscow, while the rest of 'us' would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;end up in Washington.
</em><br />
<br />With comp you cannot be a particular implementation of a computation.
<br />
You can perhaps say that you are an infinity of similar computation all 
<br />
speculating apparently about the existence of some magical singularising 
<br />
&quot;implementation&quot;. With comp, below our level of substitution, we live
<br />
(or &quot;we&quot; supervene) on all possible implementations.
<br />
That is why we &quot;discover&quot; parallel histories when we look &quot;outside&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;inside&quot; close enough.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But because the total measure increases in the copying process, bear in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mind that a # of implementations must also be created.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    I say that the original implementations would die or split up, but be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;joined by their newly created brothers in the new cities.  (Mathematically, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;recall that I am referring to sets of mappings which satisfy the transition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rules in question.  A mapping could refer both to my original body and to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the particles used to create a new body; such a mapping could survive the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;transition.  I should study this more carefully, e.g. to find out if the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fraction that do this is large or negligable.)
</em><br />
<br /><br />?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Finally, I could define 'me' as the set of all such implementations.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then I should say &quot;I will feel myself ending up in Washington and not in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Moscow, _as well as_ in Moscow and not in Washington.&quot;  (In different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moments, of course.)
</em><br />
<br />And this makes sense for the &quot;panscient spectator&quot;, in a third person
<br />
sense. Nothing really related to you.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [snip]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What does differentiate different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;people?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Memories. Cosmological, genetical, individual memories. I would 
<br />
say. Most of the time there are organized into histories, so I could
<br />
have said simply: Histories. Isn't it?
