<br />Thanks for letting me know.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I joined the list like two years ago and from that time I've read most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of your key papers. Honestly, it is not the easiest stuff to read
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; style-wise. You try to precise, define well, etc. yet it cannot really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be compared to the quality of, let us say, Physical Review Letters and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alike articles.
</em><br />
<br />I work on a subject which is not usually approach in any reviews of  
<br />
physics.
<br />
And then my english is sometimes a bit hazardous. But I have never get  
<br />
referee or any feedback about the rigors, which in my field (machine  
<br />
theology) is far more developed than usual. It is part of the problem  
<br />
for some people I think. It is just unusual.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my opinion, that is why it is hard to either agree or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disagree with your thesis.
</em><br />
<br />I disagree. It is simple. Just say a number between 01 and 8, with a  
<br />
justification of what you don't understand.
<br />
Perhaps between 00 and 8, if you have a problem with the definition of  
<br />
comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can imagine that right now you are tempted to write something along
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the lines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a\ I just propose to take Church thesis seriously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; b\ All I ask you is 'Do you say yes to the doctor?
</em><br />
<br />yes, for the sake of the argument. A non computationalist can just  
<br />
consider someone else saying yes to the doctor. A bit more is needed,  
<br />
and it is necessary to recall the definition of comp: it exists a  
<br />
level of description of my (generalized) such that I survive through a  
<br />
digital functional substitution made at that level.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; While valid proposal and question, there is really not much to agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with/disagree with/critize unless one is willing to undertake long
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussions, clarifications and position adjustments.
</em><br />
<br />Indeed, there is nothing to disagree. Only to understand, and who  
<br />
knows? to clarify. But then it is up to those who try to understand to  
<br />
say what they don't understand, besides the intrinsic difficulty with  
<br />
the subject. In the seventies some people argued that any sentence  
<br />
containing the word &quot;consciousness&quot; was automatically crackpot. Of  
<br />
course this is an illustration of the complete absence of  
<br />
understanding of the axiomatic method. We never know what we are  
<br />
talking about, we can only agree on starting propositions and method  
<br />
of reasoning, and then see if the conclusion follows from what we have  
<br />
admitted.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, your papers and letters are really a great source of ideas to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think about and that is exactly what I do.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am happy with that.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; From the day one on the list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I keep myself busy with the question of &quot;Why should I believe in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Church thesis&quot; (you see, I don't write &quot;Why do I ...&quot;).
</em><br />
<br />Good question. A lot of my work consists in showing that CT is a very  
<br />
strong principle. It is far stronger than most computer scientist  
<br />
imagine.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've got into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the writing of Bernard Bolzano (I consider his work cruicial in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; keep an open mind about the Cantor diagonal argument) ..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - and now back to the beginning of my letter -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bolzano (Cantor), your insights and thinking about alternatives at any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment make me pretty happy. Thanks!
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are welcome.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; PS: I'd love to read a book by Bruno Marchal.
</em><br />
<br />I have already written three books, and one was ordered by a publisher  
<br />
after getting a price. The two other one were disputed by different  
<br />
publishers, and then suddenly, without explanation, all those projects  
<br />
were abandoned. I have lost my trust in that kind of world I'm afraid.  
<br />
I don't think the reason of that abandon has any relationship with my  
<br />
work which is really of the type: &quot;find the error&quot;.  I will surely  
<br />
write one paper and one book. Recently I have submitted a paper, and  
<br />
the referees were quite enthusiast, but the paper has been refused for  
<br />
being out of the topic, which it was not (unless you don't believe  
<br />
that observers are person).
<br />
We will see. My work is simple in two senses: UDA is simple because  
<br />
you need nothing more than a very tiny amount of understanding on  
<br />
numbers, set, computable functions and consciousness/kowledge. AUDA is  
<br />
relatively &quot;simple&quot; because you need only to understand Solovay's  
<br />
theorem and the Theaetetical definitions of knowledge. It makes comp  
<br />
hard to believe, no doubt, but here the work of Everett in quantum  
<br />
mechanics can provide a big help. Ah, ok, all this at once needs works  
<br />
and time, but nothing more.
