Recently Ken Olum wrote an article about a related paradox involving the
<br />
anthropic principle, see here:
<br />
<br /><br /><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0303070">http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0303070</a>
<br />
<br />''Conflict between anthropic reasoning and observation
<br />
<br /><br />Anthropic reasoning often begins with the premise that we should expect to
<br />
find ourselves typical among all intelligent observers. However, in the
<br />
infinite universe predicted by inflation, there are some civilizations which
<br />
have spread across their galaxies and contain huge numbers of individuals.
<br />
Unless the proportion of such large civilizations is unreasonably tiny, most
<br />
observers belong to them. Thus anthropic reasoning predicts that we should
<br />
find ourselves in such a large civilization, while in fact we do not. There
<br />
must be an important flaw in our understanding of the structure of the
<br />
universe and the range of development of civilizations, or in the process of
<br />
anthropic reasoning.''
<br />
<br />This is similar to the doomsday argument. Unlike this paradox, the doomsday
<br />
argument becomes
<br />
ineffective in the case of an infinite universe or an ensemble of all
<br />
possible universes (actually, I believe it is
<br />
always flawed).  Maybe one has to take into account that at a certain point
<br />
biological life forms will be replaced by machines.  It is likely that a
<br />
future civilization consisting of machines will consist of only one
<br />
superintelligent being, instead of many independent individuals.
<br />
<br />Assuming that the AP is valid and given that we haven't colonized our solar
<br />
system yet, we should asume that this is the typical situation intelligent
<br />
observers find themselves in. They are just about to leave their planet and
<br />
start colonizing nearby planets. This suggests that the replacement of
<br />
biological life forms will typically start at this very moment. The reason
<br />
is that space is a very hostile environment for biological life forms. Going
<br />
to nearby planets and colonizing them is so expensive that it is cheaper to
<br />
build intelligent machines to do the job.

Subject: Peculiarities of our universe
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are a couple of peculiarities of our universe which it would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nice if the All-Universe Hypothesis (AUH) could explain, or at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shed light on them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One is the apparent paucity of life and intelligence in our universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This was first expressed as the Fermi Paradox, i.e., where are the aliens?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As our understanding of technological possibility has grown the problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has become even more acute.  It seems likely that our descendants
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will engage in tremendous cosmic engineering projects in order to take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; control of the very wasteful natural processes occuring throughout space.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We don't see any evidence of that.  Similarly, proposals for von Neumann
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self reproducing machines that could spread throughout the cosmos at a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; large fraction of the speed of light appear to be almost within reach
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; via nanotechnology.  Again, we don't see anything like that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So why is it that we live in a universe that has almost no observers?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wouldn't it be more likely on anthropic grounds to live in a universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that had a vast number of observers?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second peculiarity is the seemingly narrow range of physical laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which could allow for our form of life to exist.  Tegmark writes about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this at <a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html">http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html</a>.  He shows a chart of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two physical constants and how if they had departed from their observed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; values by even a tiny percentage, life would be impossible.  In the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; full paper linked from there he offers many more examples of physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paramters which are fine-tuned for life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So why is this?  Why does it turn out that our form of life (or perhaps,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any form of life) can exist for only a tiny range of variation?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why didn't it turn out that you could change many parameters a great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deal and still have life form?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see anything a priori in the AUH that would have led to this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prediction.  Now, it may just be one of those things that &quot;happens to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen&quot;, a fundamental mathematical property like the distribution of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primes or the absence of odd perfect numbers.  Self-aware subsystems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just mathematically turn out to only be possible in a very tiny region
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of parameter space.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, you might be able to make the argument that &quot;tiny&quot; is not well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined, that there is no natural length scale for judging parameter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ranges.  Tegmark could as easily have zoomed in on the appropriate region
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of his graph and shown a huge, enormous area where parameters could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moved around and life would still work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However I think there is a more natural way to put the question, which is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what fraction of computer programs would lead to simulated universes that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; include observers?  And here, if we follow Tegmark's ideas, the answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appears to be that it is a very small fraction.  (Of course, you still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need to use your own judgement to decide whether that is &quot;tiny&quot; or not.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a way, then, these two questions are both related, and perhaps the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same.  They both ask, why so few observers?  One question looks around the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interior of our universe, and the other looks at the set of all universes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In each case, it seems that intelligent life is terribly uncommon.
</em><br />
