<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hello

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The time has come again when I need to seek advice from the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and its contributors.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is the general consensus here on that score. I know that there

<br /><br />This is a fundamental issue, even though things are clear for the 
<br />
logicians since 1921 ...
<br />
But apparently it is still very cloudy for the physicists (except 
<br />
Hofstadter!).
<br />
<br />I have no time to explain, but let me quote the first paragraph of my 
<br />
Siena papers (your question is at the heart of the interview of the 
<br />
lobian machine and the arithmetical interpretation of Plotinus).
<br />
<br />But you can find many more explanation in my web pages (in french and 
<br />
in english). In a nutshell, Penrose, though quite courageous and more 
<br />
lucid on the mind body problem than the average physicist, is deadly 
<br />
mistaken on Godel. Godel's theorem are very lucky event for mechanism: 
<br />
eventually it leads to their theologies ...
<br />
<br />The book by Franzen on the misuse of Godel is quite good. An deep book 
<br />
is also the one by Judson Webb, ref in my thesis). We will have the 
<br />
opportunity to come back on this deep issue, which illustrate a gap 
<br />
between logicians and physicists.
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br /><br />------ (excerp of &quot;A Purely Arithmetical, yet Empirically Falsifiable, 
<br />
Interpretation of Plotinus¹ Theory of Matter&quot; Cie 2007 )
<br />
1) Incompleteness and Mechanism
<br />
There is a vast literature where G odel¹s first and second 
<br />
incompleteness theorems are used to argue that human beings are 
<br />
different of, if not superior to, any machine. The most famous attempts 
<br />
have been given by J. Lucas in the early sixties and by R. Penrose in 
<br />
two famous books [53, 54]. Such type of argument are not well 
<br />
supported. See for example the recent book by T. Franzen [21]. There is 
<br />
also a less well known tradition where G odel¹s theorems is used in 
<br />
favor of the mechanist thesis. Emil Post, in a remarkable anticipation 
<br />
written about ten years before G odel published his incompleteness 
<br />
theorems, already discovered both the main ³G odelian motivation² 
<br />
against mechanism, and the main pitfall of such argumentations [17, 
<br />
55]. Post is the first discoverer 1 of Church Thesis, or Church Turing 
<br />
Thesis, and Post is the first one to prove the first incompleteness 
<br />
theorem from a statement equivalent to Church thesis, i.e. the 
<br />
existence of a universal‹Post said ³complete²‹normal (production) 
<br />
system 2. In his anticipation, Post concluded at first that the 
<br />
mathematician¹s mind or that the logical process is essentially 
<br />
creative. He adds : ³It makes of the mathematician much more than a 
<br />
clever being who can do quickly what a machine could do ultimately. We 
<br />
see that a machine would never give a complete logic ; for once the 
<br />
machine is made we could prove a theorem it does not prove²(Post 
<br />
emphasis). But Post quickly realized that a machine could do the same 
<br />
deduction for its own mental acts, and admits that : ³The conclusion 
<br />
that man is not a machine is invalid. All we can say is that man cannot 
<br />
construct a machine which can do all the thinking he can. To illustrate 
<br />
this point we may note that a kind of machine-man could be constructed 
<br />
who would prove a similar theorem for his mental acts.²
<br />
This has probably constituted his motivation for lifting the term 
<br />
creative to his set theoretical formulation of mechanical universality 
<br />
[56]. To be sure, an application of Kleene¹s second recursion theorem, 
<br />
see [30], can make any machine self-replicating, and Post should have 
<br />
said only that man cannot both construct a machine doing his thinking 
<br />
and proving that such machine do so. This is what remains from a 
<br />
reconstruction of Lucas-Penrose argument : if we are machine we cannot 
<br />
constructively specify which machine we are, nor, a fortiori, which 
<br />
computation support us. Such analysis begins perhaps with Benacerraf 
<br />
[4], (see [41] for more details). In his book on the subject, Judson 
<br />
Webb argues that Church Thesis is a main ingredient of the Mechanist 
<br />
Thesis. Then, he argues that, given that incompleteness is an easy‹one 
<br />
double diagonalization step, see above‹consequence of Church Thesis, 
<br />
G odel¹s 1931 theorem, which proves incompleteness without appeal to 
<br />
Church Thesis, can be taken as a confirmation of it. Judson Webb 
<br />
concludes that G odel¹s incompleteness theorem is a very lucky event 
<br />
for the mechanist philosopher [70, 71]. Torkel Franzen, who 
<br />
concentrates mainly on the negative (antimechanist in general) abuses 
<br />
of G odel¹s theorems, notes, after describing some impressive 
<br />
self-analysis of a formal system like Peano Arithmetic (PA) that : 
<br />
³Inspired by this impressive ability of PA to understand itself, we 
<br />
conclude, in the spirit of the metaphorical ³applications² of the 
<br />
incompleteness theorem, that if the human mind has anything like the 
<br />
powers of profound self-analysis of PA or ZF, we can expect to be able 
<br />
to understand ourselves perfectly². Now, there is nothing metaphorical 
<br />
in this conclusion if we make clear some assumption of classical 
<br />
(platonist) mechanism, for example under the (necessarily non 
<br />
constructive) assumption that there is a substitution level where we 
<br />
are turing-emulable. We would not personally notice any digital 
<br />
functional substitution made at that level or below [38, 39, 41]. The 
<br />
second incompleteness theorem can then be conceived as an ³exact law of 
<br />
psychology² : no consistent machine can prove its own consistency from 
<br />
a description of herself made at some (relatively) correct substitution 
<br />
level‹which exists by assumption (see also [50]). What is remarkable of 
<br />
course is that all machine having enough provability abilities, can 
<br />
prove such psychological laws, and as T. Franzen singles out, there is 
<br />
a case for being rather impressed by the profound self-analysis of 
<br />
machines like PA and ZF or any of their consistent recursively 
<br />
enumerable extensions 3. This leads us to the positive‹open minded 
<br />
toward the mechanist hypothesis‹ use of incompleteness. Actually, the 
<br />
whole of recursion theory, mainly intensional recursion theory [59], 
<br />
can be seen in that way, and this is still more evident when we look at 
<br />
the numerous application of recursion theory in theoretical artificial 
<br />
intelligence or in computational learning theory. I refer the reader to 
<br />
the introductory paper by Case and Smith, or to the book by Osherson 
<br />
and Martin [14] [46]. In this short paper we will have to consider 
<br />
machines having both provability abilities and inference inductive 
<br />
abilities, but actually we will need only trivial such inference 
<br />
inductive abilities. I call such machine ³L obian² for the proheminant 
<br />
r-ole of L ob¹s theorem, or formula, in our setting, see below. Now, 
<br />
probably due to the abundant abuses of G odel¹s theorems in philosophy, 
<br />
physics and theology, negative feelings about any possible applications 
<br />
of incompleteness in those fields could have developed. Here, on the 
<br />
contrary, it is our purpose to illustrate that the incompleteness 
<br />
theorems and some of their generalisations, provide a rather natural 
<br />
purely arithmetical interpretation of Plotinus¹ Platonist, non 
<br />
Aristotelian, ³theology² including his ³Matter Theory². As a theory 
<br />
bearing on matter, such a theory is obviously empirically falsifiable : 
<br />
it is enough to compare empirical physics with the arithmetical 
<br />
interpretation of Plotinus¹ theory of Matter. A divergence here would 
<br />
not refute Plotinus, of course, but only the present arithmetical 
<br />
interpretation. This will illustrate the internal consistency and the 
<br />
external falsifiability of some theology.
<br />
