Hi Kim,
<br />
<br />I have not the time to think deeply on zero, so I will answer your  
<br />
last post instead :)

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Only a scientist admits he can be wrong.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. I would even say that someone who can admit to be wrong *is* a  
<br />
scientist.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everyone else will risk their

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life in the attempt to &quot;prove&quot; how right they are.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Either they just lack trust in *themselves*, or they are preprogrammed  
<br />
robot or low animals (if that exists).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How &quot;right&quot; can one be? Considering the emotion and passion some

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people invest in defending their righteous viewpoint you would perhaps
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right&quot; or even &quot;totally right&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I like to &quot;define&quot; truth by a Queen who wins all battles without any  
<br />
army (albeit She  *can* take time, infinite time). I am an optimist.
<br />
It is more difficult to convince people of falsities, you need bodies,  
<br />
clothes, armies, churches, temples, academies, relations, money, bad  
<br />
faith, and other rhetorical skills.
<br />
<br />Of course once you have  bodies, clothes, armies, churches, temples,  
<br />
academies, relations, money, bad faith, and other rhetorical skills,  
<br />
you can even make people liking and needing the falsities. Leading to  
<br />
my (late) father's, more pessimistic  definition of truth: truth is  
<br />
what humans don't want to hear.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The project is highly ambitious and you should follow your own best
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counsel in how to go about it most effectively. The burden is upon me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to come up to your level of description in my understanding.
</em><br />
<br /><br />To understand math you will have to develop a sense of naivete.
<br />
Somehow a mathematician is someone who abandons metaphysics, who  
<br />
somehow is capable of stopping, at the right place, the questioning.  
<br />
The right place is of course dependent of the goal you have in mind.
<br />
Of course this makes applied mathematics to metaphysics a bit subtle  
<br />
and hard (many traps).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; After all, I am supposed to explain to you how, when we assume the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; comp hypothesis, the ultimate realities become mathematical in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nature,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; even arithmetical or number theoretical. But how could I explain this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to you without doing a bit of mathematics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may seem strange, but, without demonstrating my understanding in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any technical sense, I can at least assure you of my &quot;faith&quot; in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; power of your reasoning.
</em><br />
<br /><br />To be franc this will not be enough. yet I know about your  
<br />
mathematical experience. So I formally promise that I will never ask  
<br />
you to demonstrate your technical skills. But you will have to develop  
<br />
that skill up to some point. To taste the deep flavor, you will have  
<br />
to trust your own power of reasoning, or more precisely your own ppwer  
<br />
to convince yourself by a reasoning made by another. I hope that you  
<br />
will have the serenity to tell me when you don't understand something.  
<br />
A minimum of &quot;easy&quot; exercises is needed to be sure the understanding  
<br />
does not diverge. My way of teaching you seem appreciate is anything  
<br />
but questioning (you, and then the &quot;amnesic&quot; universal machine).
<br />
I would like you to understand in some deep way the seventh step,  
<br />
which asks for few but important insight in theoretical computer  
<br />
science. Only then can I explain to you in some layman language what  
<br />
really AUDA consists in.
<br />
<br />I could say this. Although machines can only scratch Cantor's  
<br />
Paradise, there is no part of Cantor's paradise which does not throw  
<br />
light on the behavior of possible machines.  You know, little numbers  
<br />
cannot distinguish a Big Number with a *Very* Big Number.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand music when I hear it - why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should it be any different for this discourse?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmmm... First there are musical pieces that I have understood, or  
<br />
appreciated, only after many listening. Then, mathematics is usually  
<br />
understood after many readings and rereadings, and many personal  
<br />
thought experiments, some time with aspirin (if not better).
<br />
I can test on you, with your permission, a sort of particular  
<br />
pedagogical path, sort of shortcuts. I have to think.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I somehow sense the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; music in the logic. If you choose well your words, I accept that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerge from a mind that has already mapped language to arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth. Of course, I do not expect to pass any high level logic tests
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; using this argument...
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have to choose well the words, and I have to choose well the path.  
<br />
Expect some dead end alleys. I have to figure out some tradeoff  
<br />
between between different kind of efforts.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Mathematics is a curious music that only the musicians can hear.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It has always struck me as a possible advantage the musician has over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the mathematician. You can fill your whiteboard with your arcane
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; script, but you can not play any of it on your violin. Why I want to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compose music derived from my understanding of all this. That is my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ambitious project.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Of course this will be impossible literally, but I can get the feeling.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Mathematicians play with instruments that only them can hear.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To listen to a mathematician, you have to be a mathematician and play
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the instrument. Fortunately, all universal machine like you, are a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematician, and when a human seems to feel he is not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematician, it just means the mathematician living within is a bit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sleepy, for a reason or another.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or merely terrified of his lack of education over it. Nobody loses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sleep thinking they are tone-deaf, because you can still live
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successfully without an inner &quot;pitch model&quot; but it is the same fiction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as you describe. If you actually were tone deaf, you could not change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gears in your car - you could not recognise a happy-sounding voice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from an angry voice, you could not distinguish your mother's voice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from your father's, you could not distinguish waves on the beach from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the wind in the trees. Music is where our natural tonal recognition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; faculty is concentrated like a laser beam. I miss greatly the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concentrated ability with numbers.
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;From the order point of view, the numbers provide the simplest rhythm:
<br />
<br />BAM ... BAM ... BAM .... BAM ... BAM ... BAM ... BAM ... BAM ...  
<br />
BAM ... BAM ... BAM ... BAM ....
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ...  
<br />
I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ...
<br />
<br />The first stroke, the second stroke, the third stroke,
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;From the quantity point of view, it is the same, except each numbers  
<br />
seems to want to memorize his past:
<br />
<br />I ... II ... III ... IIII ... IIIII ... IIIIII ... IIIIIII ....  
<br />
IIIIIIII ... IIIIIIIII ... IIIIIIIIII ... IIIIIIIIIII ...  
<br />
IIIIIIIIIIII ... IIIIIIIII ... IIIIIIIIIIIII ...
<br />
<br /><br />And then reality kicks back, we have to add the empty or null  
<br />
quantity, making 1 the second number. Even the Greeks I love could  
<br />
have sent me away from the Academy for daring making 1 the *second*  
<br />
number. The &quot;Plotinus&quot; in me is still unders the shock. Order, and  
<br />
Quantity:  there is already a discrepancy, a conflict. How dares the  
<br />
number zero take the first place?
<br />
<br />Charles Seife, in his book &quot;ZERO, the biography of a Dangerous Idea&quot;  
<br />
said that zero is the twin of Infinity (if I remember well). And this  
<br />
indeed has many mathematical interpretation (1/0 = infinity, the  
<br />
intersection on the empty set gives the universe, the conjunction of  
<br />
zero argument is true, etc. That's probably why a theory of NOTHING  
<br />
can be tolerated in a EVERYTHING debate :)
<br />
<br />To begin math at zero? perhaps it is more easy starting with one, or  
<br />
even two. Perhaps zero should be taught only to hyper-super-qualified  
<br />
people, with password, and special permission from authorities from  
<br />
the government. We should make zero illegal, perhaps, and cut the head  
<br />
of for those who dare to divide by zero.
<br />
<br />Thanks to Platonia, nobody can divide by zero, in a finite time. No  
<br />
reason to panic, if your computer divides a number by zero,  
<br />
inadvertently, you can still cut the electrical power. The galaxy will  
<br />
not disappear.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Especially that I am realizing that some people confuse a computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with a description of a computation, which are two very different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical objects (albeit relative one) existing in Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can burn all musical scores (partitions) of any piece and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; piece is still there.
</em><br />
<br />You could be right here, but you could be wrong. There is a big and  
<br />
important ambiguity. Exactly the kind of ambiguity which can make  
<br />
people to confuse a computation and a description of a computation, or  
<br />
to confuse numbers and ciphers. We know today that numbers and ciphers  
<br />
are handled in different part of the brains.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A thought once thought cannot be unthought. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot delete information from the universe.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Vast subject, but let us not anticipate too much.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; plays a key role in the articulation of the step seven with the step
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; eight. It plays a key role to understand the computationalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; supervenience thesis, and thus where the laws of physics come from,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and of course it is strictly needed when ultimately we interview the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal Lobian machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I walk slowly in this direction. I am drawn to it by the beauty of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distant music I already hear.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Scientists search the truth, and are driven by beauty. They find some  
<br />
ugliness there, and have to change their mind or admits they were  
<br />
wrong. Real concrete scientist will not admit the error, but  
<br />
eventually their students will, and indeed will develop a new taste  
<br />
and criteria for beauty, and the cycle continues.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So, the time has come I cure your math anxiety, if you or some others
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are still interested.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You teach me maths for free, I translate your theses for free
</em><br />
<br /><br />You did a very good job. Good deal, thanks.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I can awake the mathematician in you (like I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; awake the mathematician living in any universal entity, btw :).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK - so you have NO excuse for not applying for a Templeton Foundation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grant. Awaken the musical mathematician in the widest possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; audience. Us musicians, we play very sweetly when somebody throws big
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; money at us!!!
</em><br />
<br /><br />I should. I guess. Thanks for reminding me.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I propose we begin with the numbers, and, to keep our motivation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; straight, I propose we meditate a little bit on the distinction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; between numbers and descriptions of numbers, and notations for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; numbers. It is a bit like the difference between a symphony and a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; symphony's partition ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Parfaitement entendu
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Given the importance of such distinction in the whole drama, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; worth to get those conceptual nuances clear right at the beginning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I really propose to you to begin math at zero.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But now I am already stuck: should I explain first the number 1,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or ... the number zero?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A tricky one that number zero ... :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Zero was &quot;invented&quot; (discovered?) only AFTER 1.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet, zero precedes one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the natural scheme of things.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Ah! Like above. It belongs to the natural scheme of quantities, but  
<br />
not on the natural scheme of order, at least not obviously so.
<br />
Armstrong is not the zeroth man on the moon, nor the zeroth winner of  
<br />
seven the France Cyclist Tour, all right?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In systems analysis it is axiomatic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the sequence of the arrival of information determines the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ordering of all subsequent information, just as rain falling on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; landscape creates channels and river basins that channel all

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subsequent rainfall. I believe that civilisation should have started
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with zero - had this happened, we would be 400 or so years ahead of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where we currently are in our understanding of reality. I do not know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why I believe this, perhaps you can explain my intuition here. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe we are suffering from a historically ingrained perceptual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; error about zero and one.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sure, one is also quite a weird one.
<br />
Two too, isn't it?
<br />
<br />And if you think twice about three, and four ...
<br />
<br />Believe me: mathematicians are at ease *only* with *infinities*. They  
<br />
invented them to get some clues on zero and one, and two ...
<br />
<br />The term &quot;Number&quot; has the same roots as &quot;Numerous&quot;. For the greeks  
<br />
numbers really begin with three. zero was just unthinkable those days.  
<br />
And how could 1 be a number? 1 is certainly not numerous, nor is two.
<br />
I agree with you that zero is a BIG discovery, which asks for some  
<br />
time to be swallowed, if that's possible.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Music begins with silence. The silence that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precedes the upbeat is part of the music. Sometimes the Nothing is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inserted into the midst of the music, Listen to the opening 20 or so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bars of Claude Debussy's &quot;L'après midi d'un faune&quot; for a glowing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; illustration of what I mean. He starts with the one, then remembers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the zero ( an inexplicable and mystical silence takes place, not long
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after the beginning. People have long wondered why this silence.)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yeah, zero is a bit mystical, 0 notes, at the right place, can even be  
<br />
dissonant, frightful ...
<br />
<br />To begin with a silence is almost perverse, you mean this?

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; PS I now you are busy. I propose we go at the minimum of your rhythm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and mine. But I tell you that &quot;the poem is long&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Qu'il ne finisse jamais

<br /><br />It can't. The symphony is infinite. But like the posts or papers, or  
<br />
partitions, we have to put a last point without which we perish,  
<br />
paradoxically enough.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Kind regards,
<br />
<br /><br />B.
