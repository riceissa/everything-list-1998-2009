<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you have references for these two ideas?
</em><br />
<br />No. They actually came to me while I was figuring some other
<br />
ways of simulating a universe than the sequential one that seemed
<br />
to give rise to many problems to me. The second one is influenced
<br />
by the prossibility to consider the whole universe within a
<br />
variational formulation as suggested by Hawking in &quot;A brief
<br />
history of time&quot; where he also considered the possibility of a
<br />
boundaryless universe (that makes much sense to me) that would
<br />
make difficult the use of any (initial or other) boundary condition.
<br />
Among other problems are the one of defining a global time within
<br />
a universe ruled by general relativity and including time
<br />
singularities within black holes for instance. Last but not
<br />
least is the problem of the emergence of the flow of time itself
<br />
from the gradient of order within the universe.
<br />
<br />There might be references which I do not know of and I would say
<br />
probably for the case of simple physics (possibly fluid dynamics
<br />
or heat transfer for instance) phenomena which could be simulated
<br />
in a 3+1 (or 2+1 or 1+1) dimensional meshes as wholes.
<br />
<br />I think the refining mesh could be practically experimented in a
<br />
1D+1D and possibly up to 2D+1D for heat conduction within a solid
<br />
object with various boundary conditions. While it could much less
<br />
efficient (but is it even so obvious ?) than a sequential approach,
<br />
implementing a finite element mesh including the time dimension and
<br />
solving the partial derivative heat diffusion equations by standard
<br />
linear algebra on the whole spatio-temporal domain seems perfectly
<br />
feasable to me (at least for small amounts of time).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm wondering, suppose the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe you're trying to simulate contains a computer that is running a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; factoring algorithm on a large number, in order to cryptanalyze somebody's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RSA public key. How could you possibly simulate this universe without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; starting from the beginning and working forward in time? Whatever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation method you use, if somebody was watching the simulation run,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they'd see the input to the factoring algorithm appear before the output,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right?
</em><br />
<br />I would say there is a strong anthropomorphic bias in this view.
<br />
I suggest you to read my other posts in which I comment a bit
<br />
about this kind of things.
<br />
<br />Indeed, the practical implementation of the simulation of the
<br />
whole universe including the considered computer would be very
<br />
heavy if a variational formulation and/or a 4D iteratively
<br />
refining mesh had to be used. But I do not see why it should fail
<br />
to simulate the computer calculation. What is very difficult is
<br />
to guarantee that all interactions propagate at the appropriate
<br />
level of accuracy through all of the 4D mesh and/or through all
<br />
of the action paths which can be very large and interconnected.
<br />
No doubt that &quot;close (up to an unimaginable level) to singular&quot;
<br />
matrices will be encountered. But is this very different if one
<br />
is to simulate the universe from the big bang up to this
<br />
computer calculation with the appropriate accuracy needed to
<br />
ensure that from the big bang initial conditions through stellar
<br />
formation and human evolution this computer would be built and
<br />
would run this particular calculation ? I am not so sure.
<br />
<br />I do not believe in either case that a simulation with this level
<br />
of detail can be conducted on any computer that can be built in
<br />
our universe (I mean a computer able to simulate a universe
<br />
containing a smaller computer doing the calculation you considered
<br />
with a level of accuracy sufficient to ensure that the simulation
<br />
of the behavior of the smaller computer would be meaningful).
<br />
This is only a theoretical speculation.
<br />
