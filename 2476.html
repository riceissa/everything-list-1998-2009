</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I preferred &quot;direct perceptions and thoughts&quot; because they didn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;require an object &quot;observer&quot; which I put in quotes because, as I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indicated, I supposed that &quot;I&quot; (the observer) is an inference for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;patterns in the &quot;observer moments&quot;.  However, part of the reason for my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;posting was that I wanted to say that all the above blocks &quot;exist&quot; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different senses and it is only poetic argument to say &quot;only observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;moments exist&quot;.  It is all right to make such provacative, poetic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assertions, but they should be followed by an explanation of how all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the other blocks &quot;seem&quot; to exist, or exist in some other way.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Absolutely. 
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As for the continuity of consciousness, I think it is clear that there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is continuity in the sense that perceptions and thoughts are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;disconnected.  At the level of physical descriptions, nuerological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;states have some finite duration.  Even if you like to assert &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical world doesn't exist&quot; your complete theory must take into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;account this &quot;appearance&quot;. 
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Absolutely.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; These states are not disjoint, but overlap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in time.  So I would say the there is continuity of consciousness but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it is not fundamental - it is contingent (having been knocked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unconscious I can attest to that directly).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Consciousness creates, and re-creates, continuity and time, and space, 
<br />
and identity through time and space, etc.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately I am not able to create enough time to justify this :-)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno has explained the &quot;uncertainty&quot; in his Washington-Moscow thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiment as one of the thoughts that I would have before being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;duplicated.  I would think I am uncertain as to where I will end up.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;see nothing interesting or fundamental in this.  
</em><br />
<br />At which step do you stop in the UDA thought experiment ?
<br />

<br />
<br /><br />With Everett or just with comp (at least according to
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal</a>), we *are*
<br />
duplicated, (or differentiated), all *the time*.
<br />
It is not a matter of choice. Having the comp postulates, we are
<br />
automatically confronting that problem. And then we must indeed
<br />
justify the appearances and the apparently consistent and 
<br />
continuous change of those appearances.
<br />
The problem is to find for each &quot;observer-moment state&quot; a measure
<br />
on all its possible relative computational continuations
<br />
and justifying physics (the absence of white rabbits) from that.
<br />
<br />Schmidhuber has the same basic ontology as mine. But he
<br />
assumes that the universe (without clearly saying what that 
<br />
means) is computable. 
<br />
I  accept *all* computations. And I explain how the appearance
<br />
of universes, including appearance of some statistical 
<br />
inter-relations between theses universes, appears. 
<br />
These stabilize as truths, some communicable, some uncommunicable,
<br />
from the point of view of the sound UTM introspecting herself. 
<br />
<br />The UDA shows that
<br />
the emergence of &quot;physical&quot; appearances emerges from
<br />
the statistics on all computations going through definite states
<br />
*of* universal machines, as seen *by* universal machine.
<br />
<br />This generates automatically appearance of non computable
<br />
aspect in the universes. (Despite Juergen).
<br />
<br />With the same basic ontology as Schmidhuber I show the average
<br />
little sound UTM confront herself, from her point of view,
<br />
&nbsp;with the power of the continuum if not the continua.
<br />
Note that there is no need for accepting an ontological existence
<br />
for the continuum, but comp entails no sound machine can
<br />
avoid a phenomenological (first person) continuum.
<br />
<br />This provides also a new *interpretation* of Everett's *formulation*
<br />
of quantum mechanics. But it is actually an obliged interpretation
<br />
of *arithmetic* for those who say &quot;yes&quot; to the mechanist doctor!
<br />
<br />Everett has shown that if we accept Schroedinger equation as
<br />
third person description of reality, then we can derive
<br />
the wave collapse as a first person (plural!) truth.
<br />
<br />But Everett use comp, and what I have shown is that with comp
<br />
we just cannot postulate Schroedinger equation. (With comp
<br />
our mind cannot be associated with any equation, *unless* that
<br />
equation defines the measure on all computations from a
<br />
first person plural point of view, relative to a &quot;observer-
<br />
moment).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am uncertain at this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very moment as to what I will have for lunch tomorrow.  This kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uncertainity about the future is commonplace and has no interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophical implications. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Remember that today we are making interfering alternative futures
<br />
in (prototypical for sure) little quantum circuits. And this
<br />
*is* a confirmative type of argument for many-worlds or many
<br />
histories. This confirmes comp too.  
<br />
<br />(of course it does not prove it. No experiences, nor experiments
<br />
*prove* anything (at a third person)).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The only diffence is that if I express my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uncertainity about my Washington-Moscow future I may use a semantic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ambiguity when thinking where &quot;I&quot; will be when there are two &quot;I's&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have failed to distinguish them.
</em><br />
<br />And so you must not fail to distinguish them. And you should
<br />
believe, with the comp hypothesis, that you will not die
<br />
in that processes. So you know that after the experiment
<br />
you will feel to be somewhere. You know, with comp, that,
<br />
each of 3-you, has not a brain capable of creating the
<br />
feeling of being at both place at once. 
<br />
So if you believe you will survive, you believe that after
<br />
the experiment you will survive writing Moscow, *or*
<br />
writing Washington in your diaries.
<br />
<br />(No more astonishing (especially for a Everettian many-worlders)
<br />
than looking to a spin and seing it up).
<br />
<br />According to you psychological profile it will be a pleasure or
<br />
a displeasure to meet your doppelganger at Brussels.
<br />
You will most probably realise how much your are unknow to
<br />
yourself. All first person keep secrets.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In reading Juergen's posts and some earlier ones, I wonder whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;diagram I made would reflect his view if I added postulates (6), &quot;The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information content of the mathematical description of the world does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not have any contingent or historical part because it is a description
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of all possible (describable) worlds and so there is no need to try to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infer (2) from (3).  I don't think this makes the informational content
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;level (4) anymore &quot;real&quot; than the others - but it is an interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;project to see if one can start there and get to the other levels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(mostly by invoking the weak-anthropic principle it seems).            
</em><br />
<br /><br />You get everything from the weak universal-Turing-tropic principle.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From superstring, to even qualia thanks to the difference between
</em><br />
the machine-itself G and its guardian angels G*. 
<br />
G and G* are two little propositional logics formalising the provable
<br />
(G) + the unprovable (G*) self-referential (Godelian, Lobian) truth.
<br />
The difference between G and G* makes possible to formalise cleanly
<br />
the n-person nuances.
<br />
It is the difference between intensional variants of G and G* which
<br />
makes possible the talk on qualia.
<br />
The incredible thing is that some quantum logics appears even at
<br />
that stage.

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In a way I agree with James Higgo that this argumentation about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;consciousness&quot; is pointless.  On the other hand I don't agree that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;only observer moments exist&quot;. It may be interesting to try to start
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with observer moments and see how far you can get, but if you can't get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the rest of the world - levels (1) thru (4) - and just end up logic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chopping and giving, &quot;That's just your observer moment.&quot; as the answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to every question, then I'd say your project had failed.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I am very afraid about James Higgo these days. 
<br />
Mostly after the following post:
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />James Higgo wrote:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;BTW, George, of course I understand the 3rd person vs 1st person fallacy,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which it took Jacques Mallah about a year to disabuse me of in the old QTI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;debates. Once I saw that there was no such thing as the first vs third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person, all the contradictions under discussion vanished, and hence I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not been active in the debate since then.
</em><br />
<br /><br />1) I have not seen any contradiction appearing with the use
<br />
of the first person and third person concepts. If there is one,
<br />
please give the address.
<br />
<br /><br />2) The difference between first person and third person is illustrated
<br />
by the difference between &quot;(I am observing that) I am tortured&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;(I am observing that) he is tortured&quot;. Two painfull &quot;observer-moment&quot;,
<br />
but certainly not painful in the same sense.
<br />
It does not mean that the difference is not an illusion, it means
<br />
that the &quot;appearance&quot; of the difference cannot *easily* be dismissed. 
<br />
<br /><br />3) Psychologists evaluate that children begin to make that 1/3-distinction
<br />
when they are two years old. Here too, it does not mean that the 
<br />
distinction is accurate. It means it is easy to use it in thought
<br />
experiments, even if those very thought experiments eventually
<br />
help us to nuance or even abandon the distinction. If we reject some
<br />
common sens right at the start we will not make ourselve understandable.
<br />
<br />4) As I say above, Everett gave us the most relevant use of the
<br />
1/3 person distinction. He uses the word 'objective' for
<br />
3rd person and 'subjective' for 1st person. Are you criticizing 
<br />
Everett on that point? See what I say above: Everett shows that
<br />
third person Schroedinger equation entails first person wave collapse.
<br />
<br />In both the self-duplication experiment, and in Everett, the
<br />
first person experience are linked to the memory (the diary) which
<br />
is supposed to be duplicated. It is just a definition which does not
<br />
need a theory of consciousness (see my use of it in my reply to
<br />
Juergen). Nevertheless a theory of consciousness is eventually
<br />
necessary.
<br />
<br />How many times will it be necessary for disabusing you from Jacques 
<br />
Mallah's unhappy confusion of 1st and 3rd person ? 
<br />
At least Jacques is aware that a theory of mind is necessary for
<br />
a theory of everything (look at his URL).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The mind/consciousness discussion is not pointless, it is, in 
<br />
my opinion, most crucial.
<br />
<br />BTW James what is your current opinion on QTI? (Quantum Immortality).
<br />
<br />James, you wrote also in another post:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is no proof of a physical world. There is just this OM, [...]
</em><br />
<br />The absence of proof doesn't entails the non truth.
<br />
Moreover do you think you have a proof of *just this OM*?
<br />
<br /><br />Here, I got it. There, I lost it. Now, gone, forever ...

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno I fully agree with you in so far the delay is concerned but why do

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you restrict your reconstitution to the same level? What if you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reconstituted in a virtual level for example? Shouldn't the distribution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be invariant for *all levels* and all methods of implementation?

<br /><br />absolutely
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is true, time is not an objective real entity, but  is reduced to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logical linkage between awareness states, with logic, in a recursive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fashion, being an emergent property of awareness. Time becomes a first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person phenomenon.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am glad you see the point, George.
<br />
Of course I don't make that restriction. 
<br />
Virtual neighborhood appears at the step 10 and sequitur 
<br />
in the UDA, where indeed people are
<br />
reconstituted in virtual (simulated) levels, 
<br />
even eventually appearing in UD*.
<br />
(archive at <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html</a>).
<br />
<br />With the Movie Graph argument (or a little less convincingly with
<br />
just UDA + OCCAM) we even got the reconstitutions in the arithmetical
<br />
level: no need for an actual running of a concrete UD.
<br />
<br />But we need some arithmetics (and some logic) for getting
<br />
the needed minimal arithmetical realism.
<br />
<br />Time indeed becomes a first person phenomenon. Space too, 
<br />
energy too. All physical predicates becomes first person plural 
<br />
phenomena. This is coherent with the general result which makes 
<br />
physics a branch of machine's psychology. It makes the
<br />
multiverse a part of the universal web of number's dreams.
<br />
It sounds poetical but people should be aware that I pretend
<br />
it to be a literal consequence of &quot;being a digital being&quot; (comp).
