<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I insist that it is impossible to know whether and in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what way an entity is conscious without actually *being*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that entity oneself, then to be consistent I have to admit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that anything and everything might be conscious. OK; I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; admit it; technically, I'm a panpsychist. However, I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; treat this belief in the same way as I treat a belief in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solipsism.
</em><br />
<br />It's possible that a fundamental division between us is the
<br />
quest for certainty. It's a mistaken idea, with IMO, a tragic
<br />
history, to worry about absolute certainty. It's unattainable
<br />
in any event. So on a literal level, I agree: to be consistent
<br />
we have to admit that anything and everything **might** be
<br />
conscious.
<br />
<br />But that's absurd. I say that it is absurd to entertain highly
<br />
unlikely cases as being true, unless one is making some important
<br />
philosophic point of some kind.
<br />
<br />I am glad that you then say that you treat your &quot;belief&quot; in
<br />
panpsychism the way that you treat belief in solipsism; namely
<br />
---if I may be so bold as to come out plainly and say it---you
<br />
just don't buy it. That is, you think it highly unlikely to
<br />
be true.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Looking at the world around me, other humans behave in roughly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same way I do, so by analogy with my own experience, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume they are conscious. Rocks, on the other hand, display 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no behaviour, so I assume they are not conscious.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, exactly. We are in the position of people in the 14th
<br />
century who had only a vague idea of what warmth and heat was.
<br />
But just in the way that a one of them might presciently maintain
<br />
that (a) warmth is a real, not merely subjective phenomenon,
<br />
yes, a 1st person experience but much much more importantly 
<br />
some kind of scientific phenomenon in the world and (b) someday
<br />
careful investigators (i.e. scientists) will someday pin it
<br />
down, so today are *we* about consciousness: although *certainty*
<br />
will never be achieved, some day an extremely careful 
<br />
examination of a physical object---the way that it manipulates
<br />
information---will reveal whether it is conscious or not.
<br />
<br />In the meantime, we can only guess. Just as a 14th century person
<br />
might say &quot;well I don't know *exactly* what warmth is, that
<br />
iceberg, by God, is *not* warm, and someday what I am saying
<br />
will be quantified&quot;, so we can say &quot;rocks are *not* conscious, and
<br />
someday it will be proved&quot;.  (Again, with the caveat that
<br />
all knowledge is conjectural, and nothing is ever &quot;proved&quot;
<br />
beyond doubt.)
<br />
<br />More likely, of course, in keeping with my temperature analogy,
<br />
it will one day be proved that rocks have almost zero consciousness,
<br />
ants have a piddling amount, and dogs are very conscious.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Animals fall somewhere between humans and rocks, so I assume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they have varying levels of consciousness depending on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complexity of their nervous system. The implicit theory behind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this classification scheme is that consciousness is associated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the sort of information processing that occurs in organisms 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with central nervous systems.
</em><br />
<br />We agree completely here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Using empathy as a substitute for direct experience, I can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be absolutely sure of this, of course, but then I can't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be absolutely sure that the world doesn't disappear when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I turn my back on it, either.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, and so don't worry about it. You can't be &quot;absolutely sure&quot;
<br />
of *anything*!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now to my aliens. It is a nuisance when discussing philosophy of mind that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we cannot switch our consciousness off in order to study it as disinterested 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers. Addressing this problem, my hypothetical aliens are intelligent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but non-conscious or differently-conscious. I did not state this in my last 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; post, so you may have assumed that any intelligent entity would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious.
</em><br />
<br />For all practical purposes, and maybe for *all* purposes, we can
<br />
safely assume that any naturally evolved process that makes maps
<br />
of its surroundings, cunningly contrives to control its environment
<br />
to the point that it can survive, responds intelligently to challenges
<br />
---such a being is almost beyond doubt conscious. The only counter-
<br />
examples I know of are extremely contrived, extremely bizarre, and
<br />
involve almost infinitely much in the way of memory resources and
<br />
process time.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe this is so; maybe it is even the case that any aliens able 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to study us at all must have enough in common with us to recognise us as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fellow conscious entities. However, for the sake of argument, I wanted to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eliminate the kind of empathy that allows us to believe that other humans or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; animals are conscious. The point I wanted to make is that *only* through 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empathy (as a substitute for direct experience) would the aliens recognise 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us as conscious. There is nothing they could go on from our behaviour alone, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no matter how well they understood it, that would provide them with an idea 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of what it is like to be human from the point of view of a human.
</em><br />
<br />Okay, but I'd say that *all* they have to go by is what all the
<br />
rest of us have to go by: behavior.  You think that someone or
<br />
something is conscious only by virtue of its behavior. You said
<br />
so above.  Empathy is a *consequence* of observing such behavior;
<br />
I'm not sure why you want to accord it a special role.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even if they had derived some rule through contact with multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; species, eg. &quot;any organism able to count to ten is conscious&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this would only be understood as an abstraction unless they were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in some way able to empathise with us.
</em><br />
<br />Well, :-), those extremely capable aliens of yours will have
<br />
a more elaborate theory than &quot;it can count to ten&quot;!  Let's
<br />
say that they have a complex theory involving the kinds of
<br />
circuits an entity has, the way it channels information,
<br />
the kinds of maps it makes of the world around it and, key,
<br />
the way it includes a place for itself in that map. Moreover
<br />
---vitally---their theory accords *extremely* well with their
<br />
informal (and our informal) observations.
<br />
<br />(Oh, yes, there may have been a few surprises: they might have
<br />
discovered (in conformance with their theory which they believe
<br />
almost as we are wed to the heliocentric theory), that oddly,
<br />
it turned out that chipmunks were hardly conscious, or some
<br />
other unanticipated consequence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From your last sentence, you seem to want to demote certain
</em><br />
kinds of theories as being &quot;only abstractions&quot;.  But our
<br />
theories provide our best explanations, and on this usage
<br />
of words, are all that we have.  And the best theories,
<br />
like the theory of evolution or the heliocentric theory, are
<br />
rightly taken by us as &quot;factual&quot;, (never forgetting for an
<br />
instant that all knowledge is conjectural).
