<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 'm' word in talking about level 4 (and other level) universes, but I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; asking why he needs it to provide 'anthropic content'.)
</em><br />
<br />You have to ask what motivates a physicist like Tegmark to propose this 
<br />
concept. OK, there are deep metaphysical reasons which favour it, but the 
<br />
they arn't going to get your paper published in a physics journal. The 
<br />
main motive is the Anthropic Principle explanation for alleged fine tuning 
<br />
of the fundamental parameters. As Brandon Carter remarks in the original 
<br />
AP paper, this implies the existence of an ensemble. Meaning that fine 
<br />
tuning only ceases to be a surprise if there are lots of universes, at 
<br />
least some of which are congenial/cognizable. But this bare statement is 
<br />
not enough to do physics with. But suppose you can estimate the fraction 
<br />
of cognizable worlds with, say the cosmological constant Lambda less than 
<br />
its current value. If Lambda is an arbitrary real variable, there are 
<br />
continuously many such worlds, so you need a measure to do this. This 
<br />
allows a real test of the hypothesis: if Lambda is very much lower than it 
<br />
has to be anthropically, there is probably some non-anthropic reason for 
<br />
its low value.
<br />
<br />(Actually Lambda does seem to be unnecessarily low, but only by one or two 
<br />
orders of magnitude).
<br />
<br />The point is, without a measure there is no way to make such predictions 
<br />
and the AP loses its precarious claim to be scientific.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are hints that it may be worth exploring fundamentally different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approaches to the White Rabbit problem when we consider that for Cantor the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of all integers is the same 'size' as that of all the evens (not too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good on its own for deciding whether a randomly selected integer is likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to come out odd or even); similarly for comparing the set of all reals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between 0 and 1000, and between 0 and 1. The standard response to this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that one *cannot* select a real (or integer) in such circumstances - but in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the case of many worlds we *do* have a selection (the one we are in now), so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maybe there is more to be said than that of applying the Cantor approach to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real worlds, and also on random selection.
</em><br />
<br />This is very reminiscent of Lewis' argument. Have you read his book? IIRC 
<br />
he claims that you can't actually put a measure (he probably said: you 
<br />
can't define probabilities) on a countably infinite set, precisely because 
<br />
of Cantor's pairing arguments. Which seems plausible to me.
<br />
<br />Lewis also distinguishes between inductive failure and rubbish universes 
<br />
as two different objections to his model. I notice that in your articles 
<br />
both you and Russell Standish more or less run these together.
<br />
<br />&lt;SNIP&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A final musing on finite formal systems: I have always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered formal systems to be a provisional 'best guess' (or *maybe* 2nd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; best after the informational approach) for exploring the plenitude - but it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occurs to me that non-finitary formal systems (which could inter alia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; encompass the reals) may match (say SAS-relevant) finite formal systems in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simplicity terms, if the (infinite-length) axioms themselves could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithmically generated. This would lead to a kind of 'meta-formal-system'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach. Just a passing thought...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I think this is the kind of trouble you get into with the &quot;mathematical 
<br />
structure&quot; = formal system approach. If you just take the structure as 
<br />
mathematical objects, you are in much better shape. For instance, although 
<br />
there are aleph-null theorems in integer arithmetic, and a higher order of 
<br />
unprovable statements, you can just generate the integers with a program a 
<br />
few bits long. And the integers are the complete set of objects in the 
<br />
field of integer arithmetic. Similarly for the real numbers: if you just 
<br />
want to generate them all, draw a line (or postulate the complete set of 
<br />
infinite-length bitstrings). No need to worry about whether individual 
<br />
ones are computable or not.
