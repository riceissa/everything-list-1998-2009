<br />It also depends on the logic that one chooses (e.g., Lukaciewicz/Rational
<br />
Pavelka and Product/Goguen and Godel fuzzy multivalued logics - see P. Hajek
<br />
Metamathematics of Fuzzy Logics, Kluwer: Dordrecht 1998 for an excellent
<br />
exposition except for his mediocre probability section)..   See my
<br />
contributions to <a href="http://www.superstringtheory.com/forum">http://www.superstringtheory.com/forum</a>, especially to the
<br />
String - M Theory - Duality subforum of their forum section (most of which
<br />
is archived, but membership is free, and archives are accessible to
<br />
members).   Or my paper in B. N. Kursunuglu et al (Eds.) Quantum Gravity,
<br />
Generalized Theory of Gravitation, and Superstring Theory-Based Unification,
<br />
Kluwer Academic: N.Y. 2000, 89-97, which has some further references to my
<br />
earlier work.
<br />
<br />Analysis including nonsmooth analysis does combine the discrete and the
<br />
connected/continuous, but in my opinion it generally regards the discrete as
<br />
an approximation to the continuous/connected or piecewise
<br />
continuous/piecewise connected (pathwise, etc.).
<br />
<br />One confusing point, I think, is the tendency of many mathematical logicians
<br />
to identify with algebra and in fact to claim that their field is a branch
<br />
or outgrowth of algebra.   This was originally claimed by *Clifford
<br />
Algebra,* but Clifford himself and many of his wisest descendants/followers
<br />
such as Hestenes of Arizona State U. realized than the opposite true -
<br />
*Clifford Analysis,* *Spacetime Algebra,* and so on are typical terminology
<br />
used by the latter and others to indicate that they are really dealing with
<br />
analysis and geometry and related things.  Why do so many mathematical
<br />
logicians identify with algebra?    Largely, in my opinion, because algebra
<br />
is much more mainstream-accepted than mathematical logic (and popular, and
<br />
respected, etc.), but also because algebra is abstract and mathematical
<br />
logic seems to many of its practitioners to be more abstract than concrete.
<br />
I have cautioned in various places that even in pure mathematics there needs
<br />
to be a balance between abstractness/abstraction and concreteness/physical
<br />
application.  Analysis historically has had much more of this balance (rough
<br />
equality of abstraction and concreteness).
<br />
<br />There are also many built-in biases in mathematical and theoretical physics,
<br />
and one of them in my opinion is the bias toward dissolution of geometry at
<br />
the sub-Planck level.    Part of this is the pre-quantum computer bias
<br />
toward the discrete and finite or at most countably infinite and the digital
<br />
vs analog computer bias (in favor of digital computers).   The real line and
<br />
real line segments of course are uncountably infinite and connected, and
<br />
thee would essentially be no applied mathematics or mathematical physics for
<br />
example without it - and not much pure mathematics either.    It helps to
<br />
occasionally look back in mathematical history, especially to Georg Cantor's
<br />
Contribution to the Theory of Transfinite Numbers, which even Birkhoff and
<br />
MacLane in their algebra textbooks made sure to include.   Of course,
<br />
Birkhoff ended up in applied differential equations and hydrodynamics
<br />
largely, but MacLane has never been accused of being Analysis-inclined to my
<br />
knowledge, and Birkhoff started out at least algebraic.
<br />
<br />I hope that we can resist the temptation to go into absolutes.   I am glad
<br />
to see that you started your reply with a tolerant and compromising tone,
<br />
and I will end this posting with a similar tone.  The discrete and the
<br />
connected are in my opinion different theories or parts of different
<br />
theories overall, and they are also parts of different interpretations.   My
<br />
view is that science progresses by tolerating different theories and
<br />
different interpretations for competition and because many supposedly wrong
<br />
theories or interpretations end up much later having something useful to
<br />
contribute.   The majority of scientists (the *Mainstream* as I refer to
<br />
them) do not subscribe to this view, but consider that science advances in a
<br />
spiral by *killing off* the wrong theories or by only generalizing
<br />
(including generalizing in the limit) the partly correct theories - the Law
<br />
of the Jungle viewpoint of competition by (intellectual) warfare or
<br />
*cannibalistic* absorbtion as opposed to the Competing Teams idea of
<br />
competition in which one keeps other teams alive in order to keep competing
<br />
and for motivation and ultimately because one respects them and regards them
<br />
as like oneself trying to achieve the *Impossible Dream*.   You may find my
<br />
contributions to math-history (see the Math Forum and epigone sites) to be
<br />
interesting in this regard.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is good to hear from a lattice theorist and algebraist, although I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; myself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; prefer continuity and connectedness (Analysis - real, complex,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; functional,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; nonsmooth, and their outgrowths probability-statistics and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; differential and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; integral and integrodifferential equations; and Geometry).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Hopefully, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can live together in peace, although Smolin and Ashtekar have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; obtaining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; results from their approaches which emphasize discreteness (in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; opinion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; built in to their theories) and so there will probably be quite a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; battle in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this respect at least intellectually.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not set one way or the other about discreteness, especially as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level of quantization is at Planck length scales, presumably. That is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 10^-34 cm or so. Maybe even smaller. And the Planck time is on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order of 10^-43 second.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One reason discrete space and time isn't ipso facto absurd is that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really have no good reason to believe that smooth manifolds are any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more plausible. We have no evidence at all that either space or time is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinitely divisible, infinitely smooth. In fact, such infinities have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; begun to seem stranger to me than some form of loops or lattice points
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at small enough scales.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why, we should ask, is the continuum abstraction any more plausible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than discrete sets? Because the sand on a beach looks &quot;smooth&quot;? (Until
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one looks closer.) Because grains of sand have little pieces of quartz
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which are smooth? (Until one looks closer.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, more importantly, the causal set (or causal lattice) way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looking at things applies at vastly larger scales, having nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatsoever to do with the ultimate granularity or smoothness of space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and time. That is, a set of events, occurrences, collisions, clock
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ticks, etc. forms a causal lattice. This is true at the scale of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; microcircuits as well as in human affairs (though there we get the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; usual &quot;interpretational&quot; issues of causality, discussed by Judea Pearl
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at length in his book &quot;Causality&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You say you prefer continuity and connectedness....this all depends on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the topology one chooses. In the microcircuit case, the natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topology of circuit elements and conductors and clock ticks gives us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our lattice points. In other examples, set containment gives us a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural poset, without &quot;points.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (In fact, of course mathematics can be done with open sets, or closed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sets for that matter, as the &quot;atoms&quot; of the universe, with no reference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to points, and certainly not to Hausdorff spaces similar to the real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number continuum.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The really interesting things, for me, are the points of intersection

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between logic and geometry.
