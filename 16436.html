<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; B.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This works at the ontological level, or for the third person point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; view. But if A is a consciousness related state, then to evaluate the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; probability of personal access to B, you have to take into account
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *all* computations going from A to B, and thus you have to take into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; account the infinitely many universal number relations transforming A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; into B. Most of them are indiscernible by &quot;you&quot; because they differ
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; below &quot;your&quot; substitution level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, going back to some of your other posts about &quot;transmitting&quot; a copy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a person from Brussels to Moscow.  What is it that is transmitted?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Information, right?
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So for that to be a plausible scenario we have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say that a person at a particular instant in time can be fully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described by some set of data.
</em><br />
<br />Not fully. I agree with Brent that you need an interpreter to make  
<br />
that person manifest herself in front of you. A bit like a CD, you  
<br />
will need a player to get the music. Now, any (immaterial, simple)  
<br />
Turing universal system will do, so I take the simplest one, the one  
<br />
that we learn at school: elementary arithmetic. (On some other planet  
<br />
they learn the combinators at school, and in the long run it could be  
<br />
better, but fundamentally it does not matter).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would seem to me that their conscious state at that instant must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recoverable from that set of data.  The only question is, what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conditions must be met for them to &quot;experience&quot; this state, which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely described by the data set?
</em><br />
<br />But from the first person perspective I need, and elementary  
<br />
arithmetic provides, an infinity of universal histories going through  
<br />
my current states. It is not just &quot;information&quot;, it is information  
<br />
relative to possible computations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I don't see any obvious reason
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why anything additional is needed.  What does computation really add
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to this?
</em><br />
<br />It adds the relative interpretation of that information. Information,  
<br />
which you identify with some bit strings is just a number, it is just  
<br />
an encoding of a person, not the person.
<br />
<br />Consciousness is the state of mind of a person who believes in a  
<br />
reality. This makes sense only relatively to probable universal  
<br />
histories.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You say that computation is crucial for this &quot;experience&quot; to take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place.  But why would this be so?  Why couldn't we just say that your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various types of mathematical logic can describe various types of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlations, categories, patterns, and relationships between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; informational states, but don't actually contribute anything to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious experience?
</em><br />
<br />Remember I assume the computationalist hypothesis. This means I will  
<br />
accept to be encoded in an information string, but only under the  
<br />
promise it will be decoded relatively to probable computational  
<br />
histories I can bet on, having an idea of my current first person state.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Conscious experience is with the information.
</em><br />
<br />Conscious experience is more the content, or the interpretation of  
<br />
that information, made by a person or by a universal machine.
<br />
If the doctor makes a copy of your brain, and then codes it into a bit  
<br />
string, and then put the bit string in the fridge, in our probable  
<br />
history, well in that case you will not survive, in our local probable  
<br />
history.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations that describe the relations between various informational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states.
</em><br />
<br />If you say yes to a doctor for a digital brain, you will ask for a  
<br />
brain which functions relatively to our probable computational  
<br />
history. No?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But if A is a consciousness related state, then to evaluate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the probability of personal access to B, you have to take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; into account  *all* computations going from A to B
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see how probability enters into it.  A and B are both fully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contained conscious states.  Both will be realized, because both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonically exist as possible sets of information.  State B may have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a &quot;memory&quot; of State A.  State A may have an &quot;expectation&quot; (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; premonition) of State B.  But that is the only link between the two.
</em><br />
<br />The UD generates an infinity of computations going from A to B.  
<br />
Probabilities, credibilities, plausibilities, provabilities will all  
<br />
emerge unavoidably.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Otherwise the exist independenty.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see any sense in which the term &quot;computational state&quot; makes  
<br />
sense independently of a least one computation. But from inside we  
<br />
have to take care on the infinity of computation, including those with  
<br />
the &quot;dovetailing-on-the-reals&quot; noisy background. (From inside we  
<br />
cannot distinguish the many finite initial segment of those reals with  
<br />
the reals themselves.)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So Brian Greene had a good passage somewhat addressing this in his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; last book.  He's actually talking about the block universe idea, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still applicable I think:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;In this way of thinking, events, regardless of when they happen from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any particular perspective, just are. They all exist. They eternally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occupy their particular point in spacetime. This is no flow. If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were having a great time at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1999, you still are, since that is just one immutable location in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spacetime.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The flowing sensation from one moment to the next arises from our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious recognition of change in our thoughts, feelings, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceptions. Each moment in spacetime - each time slice - is like one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the still frames in a film. It exists whether or not some projector
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; light illuminates it. To the you who is in any such moment, it is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now, it is the moment you experience at that moment. And it always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be. Moreover, within each individual slice, your thoughts and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memories are sufficiently rich to yield a sense that time has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuously flowed to that moment. This feeling, this sensation that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time is flowing, doesn't require previous moments - previous frames -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be sequentially illuminated.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />I totally agree with this picture. Brian Green uses a space time,  
<br />
where I use the numbers with they additive and multiplicative  
<br />
structure, and my point is that assuming comp, it has to work, and I  
<br />
show how space time and energy has to emerge from the inside view of a  
<br />
tiny fragment of arithmetic. But both in Green and with comp, the  
<br />
information or the points makes sense because they are structured, by  
<br />
space-time in Green, and by addition and multiplication in comp. A  
<br />
computation is a mathematical object in Plato Heaven, or just in a  
<br />
tiny part of the standard model of arithmetic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On your earlier post:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The physical has to emerge from the statistical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; probability interference among all computations, going through my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (current) states that are indiscernible from my point of view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Why such interference takes the form of wave interference is still a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (technical) open problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my view, I just happen to be inhabit a perceptual universe that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fairly orderly and follows laws of cause and effect.
</em><br />
<br />You hope this! But with comp this is globally wrong, and only &quot;locally  
<br />
apparent&quot;. &quot;You&quot; (3-person) are distributed densely on the border of a  
<br />
universal dovetailing. What you perceive is the mean on all possible  
<br />
&quot;continuations&quot;. My point is that it has to be such once we assume  
<br />
comp, and that this is empirically verifiable/refutable.
<br />
I put  &quot;continuations&quot; in quotes, because it is not necessarily  
<br />
related with physical notion of futures. It is more logical consistent  
<br />
extensions. It could develop on physical pasts, and elsewhere.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are other conscious observers (including other versions of me) who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inhabit perceptual universes that are much more chaotic and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nonsensical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But everything that can be consciously experienced is experienced,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because there exists information (platonically) that describes a mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (human, animal, or other) having that experience.
</em><br />
<br />Yes there is a world in which you computer will transform itself into  
<br />
a green flying pig. The &quot;scientific&quot;, but really everyday life  
<br />
question, is, what is the &quot;probability&quot; this will happen to &quot;me&quot; here  
<br />
and now. If the probability is 99,9 %, I will not find worth to even  
<br />
begin writing a post ....
<br />
Physics is the science of such prediction, and if comp is true, the  
<br />
correct-by-definition prediction have to take account all histories  
<br />
and to see those who have measure near 1.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I say that because it seems to me that this information could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (theoretically) be produced by a computer simulation of such a mind,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which would presumably be conscious.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, because the computer will generate not just the states, but it  
<br />
will related them.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So add platonism to that, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there you go!
</em><br />
<br />We agree here. And comp makes arithmetical platonism sufficient. It  
<br />
makes highly undecidable if there is anything more. From inside, on  
<br />
the contrary, the bigness is not even measurable or nameable. That  
<br />
follows from &quot;simple&quot; theoretical computer science.
