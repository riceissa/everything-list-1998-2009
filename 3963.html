Hi Tim, Hi All
<br />
<br />So I got indeed the Yetter's book. I promise to you, Tim, some
<br />
commentaries. Here they are. It is for me an opportunity
<br />
to write my last long post, before I try to write that english
<br />
text as Wei gently insists I do. Yetter's book interests me for
<br />
two related reasons, both linked to my thesis, and even to the most
<br />
advanced part of it---in some sense you arrive, in the list, a
<br />
little to early with your toposes! :-).
<br />
<br /><br />As you know, I am interested in the mind-body problem, and toes.
<br />
A toe which would not solve the mind-body problem, or &quot;meta-solve&quot;
<br />
it by explaining why we cannot solve it, would be a very poor
<br />
toe, imo. I think it has been a good methodology for the physicists
<br />
to forget the mind, but such attitude cannot last in a search of
<br />
a theory of *everything*.
<br />
<br /><br />About the mind I am a conservative sort of logician, and I am
<br />
platonist about positive integers, so by mind I take first
<br />
boolean arithmetical truth. Did not George Boole entitled his
<br />
book &quot;The Laws of Thought&quot;?
<br />
Add the digital mechanist, or computationalist, hypothesis,
<br />
and you get a more *psychological* mind: boolean arithmetical
<br />
truth, as seen (as anticipated) by consistent boolean universal
<br />
machine. This is the passage George Boole =&gt; George Boolos.
<br />
No pun intended. The whole idea can be simplified into: MIND = BIT.
<br />
<br /><br />About the body I am a conservative sort of physicist and I
<br />
am willing to bet on quantum mechanics. I am not so conservative
<br />
to keep the wave collapse principle as a *physical principle*,
<br />
but enough conservative to keep it as a psychological principle.
<br />
Well, here we have qubits, and, with some simplified Deutsch Kitaev
<br />
Freedman thesis we could say that MATTER = QUBIT.
<br />
<br /><br />A simplified translation of the mind-body problem can be
<br />
made with those conservative views. The MP problem can be seen
<br />
as a search of a justification of the BIT-QUBIT relation.
<br />
<br /><br />It is not a too big exaggeration to say that the work by Everett,
<br />
Graham, Hartle, Zeh Joos, Kiefer (and others) gives an explanation
<br />
of BITS from QUBITS. That is, how classical observers/worlds emerge
<br />
from a quantum reality.
<br />
<br /><br />And it is not at all an exaggeration to say my work is an attempt
<br />
to explain QUBITS from BITS. Actually I show more and less:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;-More: because my work provides a proof that, IF we take the
<br />
comp hyp seriously enough, THEN qubits *must* follow from bits.
<br />
This is basically done by the Universal Dovetailer Argument UDA (+
<br />
the Movie Graph Argument if you don't like explicit reference to
<br />
OCCAM razor).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;-Less: because I just paved the beginning of a way from bits
<br />
to qubits. It is the purpose of the Arithmetical UDA (AUDA).
<br />
It is at the completion of that road that Yetter's work
<br />
should help.
<br />
<br /><br />As you see, I dig on both sides of the mind-body relation, and
<br />
Yetter's book bears on both side too, as I will try to explain.
<br />
<br />The UDA is a thought experiment in which &quot;you&quot; are implicated.
<br />
UDA shows that &quot;your&quot; immediate future is given, relatively to
<br />
&quot;your&quot; actual state (whatever that is) by some measure on all
<br />
consistent histories/computations going through that state.
<br />
The AUDA is a translation of the UDA in the language of any
<br />
consistent universal machine capable of proving enough arithmetical
<br />
truth. Since Godel 1931, we know that we can use, as universal 
<br />
language, just elementary arithmetics, with elementary induction.
<br />
Our goal is to interview a &quot;scientific&quot; machine about its
<br />
consistent extensions (ce).
<br />
Those ce are playing the role of the &quot;consistent&quot; histories (not
<br />
exactly in the sense of Hartle, Isham, ...). By UDA, physics is
<br />
literally redefined as a &quot;probability&quot; measure on those extensions.
<br />
The first thing to do is to define the notion of consistent
<br />
extension in the language of the machine. This is easy, at least
<br />
after reading Godel! Indeed Godel succeeded in defining the
<br />
notion of &quot;provable by a machine M&quot; in the language of that machine
<br />
M. Godel used &quot;principia mathematica&quot; as machine M, and today we
<br />
prefer to use Peano Arithmetic, but any boolean topos with
<br />
natural numbers object can play that role. So the intuitive
<br />
sentence &quot;M proves p&quot; can be translated in arithmetic with Godel's
<br />
beweisbar arithmetical predicate B. B(`x') means the formula
<br />
with godel number x is provable by the machine M. You can read
<br />
&quot;M proves -B(`f')&quot; as M proves that M cannot prove the false.
<br />
But this is equivalent to:  M proves that M is consistent.
<br />
Actually, Godel's second incompleteness theorem is that this never
<br />
happens: a consistent machine cannot prove its consistency:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-B(`f') -&gt; -B(`-B(`f'))    where `x' = godel number of x
<br />
<br />It happens that consistent machines *can* prove the last formula!
<br />
The machine M can prove &quot;if M is consistent then M cannot prove
<br />
its consistency&quot;.
<br />
<br />Let us write Bp as a modal formula []p (p refering to an
<br />
arithmetical sentence).
<br />
-[]f means the machine is consistent. In all modal logic
<br />
-[]A is the same as &lt;&gt;-A. So -[]f is the same as &lt;&gt;-f, i.e. &lt;&gt;t.
<br />
<br />Godel's second theorem can be written as:   &lt;&gt;t -&gt; -[]&lt;&gt;t.
<br />
<br />You see that a modal logic emerges with the box &quot;[]&quot; being
<br />
interpreted by the arithmetical provability predicate, and the
<br />
diamond &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; by the arithmetical consistency predicate. This last
<br />
one is, as you guess, useful for interviewing the machine about
<br />
the consistent extension and about the measure we are searching
<br />
on those extension.
<br />
<br />Is the provability box a good candidate for playing the role
<br />
of the machine's (first person) knowledge?
<br />
<br />NO. For this we should have the provability of &quot;[]A -&gt; A&quot;.
<br />
In particular we should have []f-&gt;f, but A-&gt;f is -A, so
<br />
[]f-&gt;f is -[]f, that is *consistency*. The consistent machine does
<br />
not prove []A-&gt;A. The consistent machine cannot prove its
<br />
soundness.
<br />
<br /><br />Also the consistent machine, being unable to prove its consistency,
<br />
cannot prove the existence of---even just one---consistent
<br />
extension. Apparently this takes the hope for a rich interview
<br />
about the consistent extensions off. But
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) the machine can prove sentence like &quot;&lt;&gt;t -&gt; &lt;something&gt;&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(like if M is consistent then &lt;something&gt;). Cf the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fact that the machine can prove Godel's second theorem, even
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about itself.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) because physics is redefined as the measure on the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consistent extensions, we are primarily interested by the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*truth* about those ce, not necessarily what the machine
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are able to *prove* about them.
<br />
<br /><br />Here enter Solovay theorems. Let me give you the exact wording
<br />
of it. See <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3889.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3889.html</a>
<br />
for the formal presentations of G and G*.
<br />
<br />Let L = {p, q, r, ...} = the propositional sentence letters.
<br />
Let LA be the set of first order arithmetical sentences (like
<br />
Ex(x=0) AxEy(y&gt;x) Bew(`x'), etc.) (E = it exists, A = For all)
<br />
A realization R is a function from L to LA assigning to each
<br />
propositional sentence an arithmetical sentence.
<br />
Now we can define a translation T of propositional modal sentences
<br />
in arithmetic:
<br />
T(p) = R(p) for any propositional sentence letter p
<br />
T(f) = f
<br />
T(A -&gt; B) = T(A) -&gt; T(B)
<br />
and most importantly T([]A) = Bew(`T(A)')  with Bew the arithmetical
<br />
provability predicate (Bew for the German Beweisbar. (&quot;Bew&quot; is
<br />
less misleading than the &quot;B&quot; above).
<br />
<br />Solovay first arithmetical completeness theorem is that the modal
<br />
logic G proves A iff the machine M proves T(A). And this does not
<br />
depend on the realisation R. So the logic G captures what a machine
<br />
can prove about its own capacity of proving things.
<br />
<br />Solovay second arithmetical theorem is that the logic G* proves
<br />
A iff T(A) is true for the machine M, independently of the fact
<br />
that M can prove it or not! In some sense G* formalizes completely
<br />
the incompleteness! G is obviously included in G*, and G is
<br />
strictly included in G*. The simplest example is given by the
<br />
consistency proposition &lt;&gt;t:  G does not prove it, and indeed
<br />
the machine cannot prove its consistency, and G* does prove it.
<br />
<br />That's why sometimes I refer to G as the discourse by the machine
<br />
itself, and G* as the discourse by the machine's guardian angel.
<br />
G* knows much more than G.
<br />
<br />As we have seen above the provability predicate does not obey
<br />
the typical modal &quot;knowledge&quot; reflexivity formula []p -&gt; p.
<br />
The provability predicate is not first-person knowledge.
<br />
It embodies a sort of scientific, third person, form of self
<br />
reference. G* *can* prove []p -&gt; p, but G* is not closed for the
<br />
necessitation rule, so that, according to any S4-type
<br />
formalization of knowledge G* cannot be directly in use.
<br />
<br />Those bad news are really good news, for it shows a way to
<br />
handle with care those &quot;intuitive&quot; notion in our counter-intuitive
<br />
context. In particular, knowing that the machine cannot prove
<br />
[]p -&gt; p (modulo a realisation and a translation, but I will
<br />
commit the language abuse of not repeating this), although it is
<br />
true (G* trivially prove []p -&gt; p), we can, thus, define the
<br />
knowledge of p, by []p &amp; p.
<br />
<br />This leads to a very interesting notion of first person for
<br />
consistent machine. It is possible to show that this notion of
<br />
knowledge cannot be defined in arithmetic! (like the notion of
<br />
truth with Tarski theorem). This notion of knowledge will entail,
<br />
for example, that any consistent machine will hardly believe
<br />
being a (consistent) machine.
<br />
Independent works by Kuznetsov &amp; Muravitsky, and George Boolos,
<br />
and Robert Goldblatt, based on the thesis in modal logic by
<br />
Segerberg show that the logic of [1]p  (by definition = []p &amp; p)
<br />
is completely captured by the modal system S4Grz. That is
<br />
S4 + the Grzegorczyk formula:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[]([](p -&gt; []p) -&gt; p) -&gt; p
<br />
<br />This &quot;horrible formula&quot; gives antisymmetry for the accessibility
<br />
relation of the S4Grz Kripke semantics.
<br />
<br /><br />This is a GOOD news because it makes the link between
<br />
anticipation of consistency, as seen by the &quot;first-person&quot; machine,
<br />
and irreversibility of the passing from one state of knowledge
<br />
to another. So S4Grz makes a sort of link between
<br />
consciousness/ perception (as defined by Helmholtz: anticipation)
<br />
and subjective time. This is akin to Brouwer's theory of
<br />
consciousness, from which he based its intuitionist philosophy.
<br />
<br />This is confirmed through the works of Grzegorczyk and Goldblatt:
<br />
&nbsp;From S4Grz you can isolate an arithmetical, in term of
<br />
provability, version of Brouwer's intuitionist logic.
<br />
<br />And more: It is natural to define S4Grz* (which correspond to
<br />
G* as S4Grz correspond to G). But surprise: S4Grz = S4Grz*.
<br />
The first person is his own guardian angel! Even Boolos remarks
<br />
in his second 1993 book on provability that this phenomenon
<br />
is &quot;shades of the intuitionists' doctrine that mathematical
<br />
truth is to be identified with provability.
<br />
<br />And now that we have an intuitionist first person, we can
<br />
associate a &quot;free topos&quot; to it, capable of providing rich
<br />
contextual semantics for the first person in any
<br />
contextual situation.
<br />
<br /><br />Now I know you like very much toposes, but at the time I isolate
<br />
the first person logic, I did not take the antisymmetry of
<br />
the relation as a good news. Why? Because I hoped for a symmetrical
<br />
relation, because symmetry is the mark of the physical, and the
<br />
UDA reasoning shows physics should rely on the first person.
<br />
At that time I depressed a little bit because I realize that my
<br />
enterprise was contradictory: how to get physical symmetry from
<br />
psychological antisymmetry?
<br />
<br /><br />Oops! I realize I am rather long here. Also I must go
<br />
now. Don't hesitate to ask question, even about little formal
<br />
details. I hope you see a little bit more clearly how I proceed.
<br />
<br />Wait for the next episode if you want see the arithmetical
<br />
marriage between symmetry and antisymmetry, and more ...,
<br />
including the importance of Yetter's book, or, more generally,
<br />
of symmetric and ... non symmetric monoidal categories for
<br />
eventually extracting the qubits from the dreaming bits.
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
<br />
<br />So it is not exactly my last long post, but it is among them.
<br />
Perhaps such more detailled explanations will help me in
<br />
planning a longer paper. Thanks for your patience.
