I attempted something like your water tank model of the multiverse with the 
<br />
game I describe here: <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m6608.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m6608.html</a>. My 
<br />
conclusion was that the relative measure is important in determining the 
<br />
successor OM (I think this is what you call the RSSA, although I prefer to 
<br />
spell it out when the idea is at all problematic), but the absolute measure 
<br />
makes no difference from the observer's point of view (is this a rejection 
<br />
of the ASSA?).
<br />
<br />One can imagine God shuffling all the instantiations of all the OM's 
<br />
associated with a particular observer and pulling out an OM at random, which 
<br />
will then more probably be an OM with higher absolute measure. But this is 
<br />
not how it works from the observer's point of view, contemplating his place 
<br />
in the multiverse. For a start, it is impossible to know what the absolute 
<br />
measure of an OM is, because it makes no first person difference. If it did, 
<br />
i.e. if multiple instantiations of an OM could somehow be distinguished, 
<br />
then by definition it is not the one OM.
<br />
<br />Even if the above objection were overcome, and the absolute measure could be 
<br />
taken into account, it is difficult to see how it could possibly have the 
<br />
effect claimed by critics of QTI. The life history of each observer can be 
<br />
traced through the multiverse from birth to infinity as a single, continuous 
<br />
thread. The observer experiences only one OM at a time, regardless of what 
<br />
the absolute (or for that matter the relative) measure is. Suppose the 
<br />
observer encounters on Monday a lode of very high measure, let's say a 
<br />
trillion times what it was on Sunday or will again be on Tuesday. What 
<br />
effect is this going to have? Will he somehow be stuck in Monday? Will time 
<br />
slow down for him? Will there be any difference between him and the regular, 
<br />
low measure people around him? One answer I have been given to this question 
<br />
is that he will be much more likely to find himself alive on Monday than on 
<br />
another day - but what can this possibly mean, given that Monday will only 
<br />
last 24 hrs?
<br />
<br />The game I have cited above allows the parameter analogous to the absolute 
<br />
measure to change, and it makes no difference to the progress of the player. 
<br />
I suggest that this is the only sensible answer.

<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Subjectively, there is *always* a one to one correspondence between an

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;earlier and a later version, even though from a third person perspective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the relationship may appear to be one to many, many to many, or many to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;one. This is in part why reasoning as if observer moments can be sampled 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;randomly from the set of all observer moments gives the wrong answer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Can you explain more why you think this one-to-one relationship implies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it's incorrect to apply the self-sampling assumption to observer-moments? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As I said in the &quot;Request for a glossary of acronyms&quot; thread (at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://tinyurl.com/5265d">http://tinyurl.com/5265d</a> ), I am inclined to believe a final theory of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;everything would allow us to use both the ASSA (the theory would assign 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each observer-moment an absolute probability, and we could reason as if our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;current OM was randomly selected from the set of all possible OMs, weighted 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by their absolute probability) and the RSSA (for each OM, the theory would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;give a conditional probability that the observer's subsequent experience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be any other possible OM). If you're suggesting the two are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;incompatible, there's no need for them to be. Consider the following 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;analogy--we have a bunch of tanks of water, and each tank is constantly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pumping a certain amount of its own water to a bunch of other tanks, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;having water pumped into it from other tanks. The ratio between the rates 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that a given tank is pumping water into two other tanks corresponds to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ratio between the probabilities that a given observer-moment will be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;succeeded by one of two other possible OMs--if you imagine individual water 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;molecules as observers, then the ratio between rates water is going to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;two tanks will be the same as the ratio between the probabilities that a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;given molecule in the current tank will subsequently find itself in one of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;those two tanks. Meanwhile, the total amount of water in a tank would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;correspond to the absolute probability of a given OM--at any given time, if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you randomly select a single water molecule from the collection of all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;molecules in all tanks, the amount of water in a tank is proportional to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the probability your randomly-selected molecule will be in that tank.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, for most ways of arranging this system, the total amount of water in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different tanks will be changing over time. In terms of the analogy, this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be like imposing some sort of universal time-coordinate on the whole 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multiverse and saying the absolute probability of finding yourself 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiencing a given OM changes with time, which seems pretty implausible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to me. But if the system is balanced in such a way that, for each tank, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;total rate that water is being pumped out is equal to the total rate that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;water is being pumped in, then the system as a whole will be in a kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equilibrium, with no variation in the amount of water in any tank over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time. So in terms of OMs, this suggests a constraint on the relationship 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between the absolute probabilities and the conditional probabilities, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this constraint (together with some constraints imposed by a 'theory of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness' of some kind) might actually help us find a unique 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-consistent way to assign both sets of probabilities, an idea I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;elaborated on in the &quot;Request for a glossary of acronyms&quot; thread.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In terms of the QTI, accepting both the ASSA and RSSA seems to imply there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be no point at which our stream of consciousness would end, but the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ASSA also implies that it's unlikely a typical observer-moment has memories 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of being extremely old, so it seems we'd have to accept some sort of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;immortality with amnesia&quot;--maybe as I approach death, my stream of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness will move into simpler and simpler OMs, and then eventually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;start climbing back up the ladder of complexity into the OMs of a different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person who has no memory of my life. Or maybe the advanced transhuman 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intelligences of the future periodically like to wipe most of their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;memories and experience what it was like to be a human-level intelligence, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so that at the end of my life my memories will be reintigrated with those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of this larger intelligence (maybe this replaying of a life would be a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;necessary part of the merging of two distinct transhuman minds, something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which transhuman intelligences would probably want to do if at all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible). There are probably other creative ways to have immortality (as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implied by the RSSA) be compatible with the idea that my current OM is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;typical&quot; one (as implied by the ASSA), too.
