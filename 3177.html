<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: &quot;Charles Goodwin&quot; &lt;cgoodwin.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'll have another go at explaining my position (maybe I'll spot a flaw in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it if I keep examininig it long enough).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK.  Nice to see you're honestly thinking about it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bayesian reasoning assumes (as far as I can see) that I should treat my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;present observer moment as typical.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not quite.  Rather, treat it as though it's &quot;randomly&quot; drawn from the 
<br />
set of possible OMs.  (I have already explained why this is useful although 
<br />
there is really nothing random.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of them are typical (if there is a typical; sometimes there are 
<br />
just a lot of different categories none of which is typical), some are not - 
<br />
that's automatically taken into account when you calculate the posterior 
<br />
Bayesian probabilities.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My objection to doing so is that this assumes the result you want to prove
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming, a priori, that it is typical would indeed be an illegitimate 
<br />
move.  You just need to understand that the Bayesian procedure does nothing 
<br />
of the sort, as I said above.  Sorry to repeat what I said above, since I 
<br />
hope you got the point, but such is the nature of replying by email.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;because if my observer moment is typical and QTI is correct, then the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;likelihood of me experiencing a moment at which my age is less than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinity is infinitesimal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This either demonstrates that (1) my present observer moment is typical and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;QTI is wrong or (2) the present observer moment isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;typical and Bayesian reasoning is inappropriate ((2) doesn't imply that QTI 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is correct, of course, merely that it's compatible with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observation).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.  So the question is: Is Bayesian reasoning sound?  This is a 
<br />
general question that should be considered independently of the FIN.  The 
<br />
answer is surely yes, but I guess you need some more convincing of that, so 
<br />
considering another example should help.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;*Assuming* that QTI is correct, then the chances of you and me interacting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at a typical observer moment (for either of us) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;negligible. QTI guarantees that almost all interactions between observers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will occur at highly non-typical observer moments, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(scary thought) for 99.9999999999999999999....% of any given person's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer moments, the rest of the human race will be extinct.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hence Bayesian reasoning isn't appropriate because the fact that we're 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;communicating with one another guarantees that at least one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of us, and with overwhelming probability both of us, is experiencing highly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;atypical observer moments.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You seem to be confusing a priori probabilities with predictions.  This 
<br />
should become clearer in the example I'll use below.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, even if the human race were extinct, you would surely have saved an 
<br />
archive of the best literature, such as my posts to this list ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The &quot;assumption of typicality&quot; can't be made without first checking that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you're not dealing with a special case. To take an obvious example, if I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was to apply Bayesian reasoning to myself I would be forced to assume that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am almost certainly a peasant of indeterminate sex living in the third 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeterminate sex?  I would think you simply wouldn't know which sex.  I 
<br />
don't think most peasants are transexuals or transvestites ... but let's not 
<br />
go there ...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;1st world&quot; / &quot;3rd world&quot; case is an excellent example.  Suppose 
<br />
that 90% of people live in world #3, while 10% live in world #1.  If you had 
<br />
no other information, then indeed the best you could do is to guess that you 
<br />
are 90% likely to be in #3.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's your a priori Bayesian probability of being in #3, but you do 
<br />
have additional information.  In my case for example (which I'll use becuase 
<br />
I don't know where you are located), I can look out my window and see vast 
<br />
stretches with nothing but fast food restaurants, churches, cattle, and 
<br />
bales of hay.  These things correlate very strongly with being in North 
<br />
Dakota.  Let's say that only 1% of world #3 is like that, while 50% of world 
<br />
%1 is like that.
<br />
<br />So now I will guess my location: (here &quot;see&quot; is short for &quot;what I see&quot;)
<br />
<br />p(me in world #1)
<br />
= p(see|#1) p_0(#1) / [p(see|#1) p_0(#1) + p(see|#2) p_0(#2)]
<br />
=   (.50)   (.1)   /  [  (.50)     (.1)  +    (.01)    (.9) ]
<br />
= .05 / (.05 + .009) = 0.847
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I now think I am about 85% likely to be in world #1.  Using the 
<br />
additional information gained by observation, I realized that my location is 
<br />
probably not typical.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if I didn't have that information, then I would have been 
<br />
correct to think I am 90% likely to be in world #3.  After all, 90% of 
<br />
people are in #3.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that saying &quot;assume your location is typical&quot; is often a 
<br />
good qualitative charicature of the Bayesian procedure, especially when 
<br />
there is little additional information to go on, but it is not at all what 
<br />
Bayesian reasoning actually does.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, there are no &quot;special cases&quot; in which you have to &quot;first 
<br />
check&quot; before you can apply Bayesian reasoning.  Bayes' theorem 
<br />
automatically handles all cases and every bit of information you have.  It's 
<br />
just that you have to be careful not to jump the gun, not to incorporate 
<br />
information into your prior that should enter later in the form of 
<br />
observational evidence.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the FIN case, the prior becomes how likely you would think it is for 
<br />
the FIN to be true, a priori, as if you have not yet considered your age at 
<br />
all.  Suppose you pick 0.5, which I think is ridiculously high, but just for 
<br />
the sake of argument.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you can look at the conditional probability of seeing your 
<br />
observational evidence given each hypothesis.  In this case, that's the 
<br />
conditional probability of being younger than some natural reference point - 
<br />
which (surprise!) you are.  For the FIN that's almost zero, so the posterior 
<br />
probability for the FIN to be true is almost zero regardless of the prior 
<br />
you started with.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I were really older than the natural reference points (such as 
<br />
being too old to calculate), then Bayes' theorem would no longer argue 
<br />
against the FIN.  It's simply not true that Bayes is biased against the FIN. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its just that the actual, observed evidence is overwhelmingly unlikely if 
<br />
the FIN were true.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Or more likely a beetle... Or even more likely a microbe (assuming microbes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have observer moments).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the &quot;reference class&quot; issue is actually an interesting question that 
<br />
I'll probably address a bit in reply to another person, but actually I don't 
<br />
think the solution should be mysterious.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure is &quot;likely to work&quot; because most people using it will get 
<br />
the right answer.  So, creatures that can't use it don't count.  You should 
<br />
assume, a priori, that you are of a type of creature that is able to use 
<br />
Bayesian reasoning.  If everyone who can use it makes that assumption, then 
<br />
it will be reliable for the people that can use it.
