<br />Yes. But he says he isn't assuming Platonism, although he must be.
<br />
<br />Well, if he is, so what? If we allow him this, what then follows -
<br />
isn't this more interesting?
<br />
<br />He claims that computationalism is incompatible with
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; materialism. That is not modest (or correct AFAICS)
</em><br />
<br />I think the 'modesty' part is meant more to relate to provability
<br />
vs.believability, per Goedel/Lob - that we must live with doubt (i.e.
<br />
empiricism is ineliminable). As to computationalism, there seems to be
<br />
some confusion on the list (and elsewhere) between (at least) two
<br />
varieties. The first might I suppose be characterised as minimalist
<br />
comp, dealing with programs as instantiated in (as one might say) real
<br />
- i.e. material - computers. Clearly it would make no sense to say that
<br />
this kind of computationalism is incompatible with materialism - i.e
<br />
that physical processes can 'compute'.
<br />
<br />So how does he get &quot;computationalism is incompatible with
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; materialism&quot; out of such interviews?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the 8th step of the UDA argument. This attempts to show that if
</em><br />
one (but not you, I think?) starts with the much stronger assumption
<br />
that *consciousness supervenes on computation itself*, then it can't
<br />
also supervene on the physical. AFAICS, this stems fundamentally from
<br />
the inability to stabilise the instantiation of a computation, given
<br />
the lack of constraint on the material substrates that can be construed
<br />
as implementing equivalent computations. Given materialism, in other
<br />
words, 'computation' is just a metaphor - it's the physics that does
<br />
the work. I have to say that I think this may really point to a fatal
<br />
flaw in any assumption - within materialism - that consciousness can
<br />
supervene on the physical *per computation* in the standard AI sense.
<br />
However, consciousness may of course still be shown to supervene on
<br />
some physically stabilisable material process (e.g. at the neurological
<br />
or some other consistently materially-reducible level of explanation).
<br />
<br />Bruon's empirical prediction require a UD to exist. That
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is an assumption beyond computationalism.
</em><br />
<br />But not beyond 'comp', which is a horse of a different colour. The UDA
<br />
argument attempts to establish, and show the consequences of, a 'comp'
<br />
constrained to CT, AR, and the 'modest empiricism' of 'yes doctor'. It
<br />
*assumes* that putative stable conscious experiences are associated
<br />
with certain types of machine thus defined. From this stems the claim
<br />
that the consciousness of such machines can't simultaneously supervene
<br />
on an unstabilisable externally-defined 'material' substrate - in fact,
<br />
the 'material' also has to be an emergent from the computational in
<br />
this view. Comp and materialism start from radically different
<br />
assumptions, and have diametrically opposed explanatory directions.
<br />
However, I don't think they treat the *observables* in any essential
<br />
way as less 'real', but differ radically as to the source - and here
<br />
its does get difficult, because one can no longer simply appeal
<br />
directly to those observables - as Johnson failed to note in stubbing
<br />
his toe on the stone.
<br />
<br />How can he come to conclusions about the uneality
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of matter without assuming the reality of something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to take its place?
</em><br />
<br />Well, in the end we can only believe that whatever it is must be 'real
<br />
in the sense that I am real', or where are we?
<br />
<br />No, it's really easy. I am real, or I would not
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be writing this. What you mean is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; establish it by abstract argumentation is difficult.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, it is. That is why empiricists prefer empiricisim.
</em><br />
<br />Well, as you know, I've also had some discomfort with aspects of
<br />
platonic or other possibly implicit assumptions in this approach, but I
<br />
think now that it's interesting and fruitful enough to suspend
<br />
judgement on this pending further (preferably empirically refutable)
<br />
results, without fully committing as a believer - but then that is not
<br />
what is demanded. However, I acknowledge the robustness of your
<br />
Johnsonian approach to refutation!

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; assumptions involving numbers and their relations.Yes. But he says he isn't assuming Platonism, although he must be.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  As he often

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and - dealing as it does in 'machine psychology' -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; limiting its claims to the consequences of 'interviewing' such machines

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and discovering their povs.So how does he get &quot;computationalism is incompatible with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; materialism&quot; out of such interviews?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In achieving these results, AFAICS, no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; claims need be made about the fundamental 'ontic realism' of numbers:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rather one is doing logic or mathematics from an axiomatic basis in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; normal way.How can he come to conclusions about the uneality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of matter without assuming the reality of something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to take its place?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The question of which set of 'ontic prejudices' we in fact employ as we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; go about our daily affairs is of course another issue.And yet antoher issue is whether the conclusions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a valid arguiment must be contained in its premises.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It may of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; eventually turn out that theoretical or, preferably empirically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; disconfirmable, results derived from comp become so compelling as to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; force fundamental re-consideration of even such quotidian assumptions -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; e.g. the notorious 'yes doctor' proposition.Bruon's empirical prediction require a UD to exist. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is an assumption beyond computationalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But as Bruno is again at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; pains to point out, this won't be based on 'sure knowledge'. It will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; always entail some 'act of faith'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; To establish what is in some ultimate sense 'real' - as opposed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; knowable or communicable - is extraordinarily difficult,No, it's really easy. I am real, or I would not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be writing this. What you mean is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; establish it by abstract argumentation is difficult.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, it is. That is why empiricists prefer empiricisim.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and perhaps at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; root incoherent. The debate, for example, over whether the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computational supervenes on the physical doesn't hinge on the 'ontic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reality' of the fundamental assumptions of physicalism or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computationalism. Rather, it's about resolving the explanatory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; commensurability (or otherwise) of the sets of observables and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relations characteristic of these theoretical perspectives. Indeed what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; else could it possibly be for humans (or machines) with only such data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at our disposal?
