<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The point you picked up 'self-referential thought' is not relevant to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discussion we were having. However, it is the most interesting thing in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;post.
</em><br />
<br />I think it's actually pretty relevant.  What we're talking about is what 
<br />
Nick Bostrom calls &quot;the problem of the reference class&quot; in 
<br />
anthropic/copernican reasoning (although this problem only crops up in 
<br />
certain versions of anthropic reasoning; see below).  Part of my argument 
<br />
for a theory of consciousness is that I don't think there's a good way to 
<br />
deal with this except by referring to conscious observer-moments.  You seem 
<br />
to be saying that we can deal with it in terms of &quot;self-referential 
<br />
thoughts&quot; or something similar...but you may actually be using a version of 
<br />
the anthropic principle where the reference-class problem doesn't come up in 
<br />
the first place (again, see below).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have been thinking about this for a while. The only thoughts that we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;apply the anthropic principle to are thoughts about the anthropic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;principle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The only thing we know to exist is a thought about why we exist. So the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number of possible universes is restricted to those in which thoughts about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;why we exist can be supported.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The universe need not contain thinkers, far less 'human beings' with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brains,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;blood and other thoughts. The anthropic principle is universally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mis-applied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by everyone who has ever written on he subject because they make the leap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from their thought to a thinker. This leap, as I have long argued, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unjustifiable.
</em><br />
<br />I think we need to distinguish between two kinds of anthropic reasoning 
<br />
here.  The first version just says &quot;I observe that I exist, so I know with 
<br />
probability 1 that I must occupy a time and place where my existence is 
<br />
possible.&quot;  Obviously this is completely uncontroversial.  In this version, 
<br />
though, it's not really important that you say &quot;I exist&quot; or &quot;intelligent 
<br />
observers capable of anthropic reasoning exist&quot;--you could just as easily 
<br />
have made up the &quot;star-thropic principle&quot; which says that you know with 
<br />
probability 1 that stars exist, so you must be in a time and place where 
<br />
star formation is possible.
<br />
<br />As originally envisioned by Carter, both the &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; anthropic 
<br />
principles were versions of this idea.  In &quot;Modern Cosmology &amp; Philosophy,&quot; 
<br />
John Leslie writes that &quot;Carter's weak principle reminds us of the obvious 
<br />
but oft neglected truth that our place and time must, granted that we are in 
<br />
fact there, be a place and time where observers can exist: they are not, for 
<br />
example, fried immediately, as they would be shortly after the Big Bang.  
<br />
Carter's strong principle similarly reminds us that our universe must--as we 
<br />
do exist in it, don't we?--be a universe whose nature is not 
<br />
life-excluding...the 'must' is in both cases like that of 'The photo is 
<br />
marked WIFE, so *must* be of a woman.'  No suggestion that the photo *had to 
<br />
be* of a woman or that it is somehow especially easy to be a woman!&quot;
<br />
<br />But there's another version of &quot;anthropic reasoning&quot; which, although it 
<br />
perhaps deserves a different name, seems to me to be valid as well.  This 
<br />
version says that, given that at least some observer-containing regions 
<br />
exist, &quot;I&quot; must find myself in one of these regions.  In this case &quot;I&quot; is 
<br />
like the &quot;I&quot; in the Doomsday argument, which says &quot;I&quot; could have been born 
<br />
at any time in history, despite the fact that I wouldn't be the same person 
<br />
if I'd been born at some other time.  In this version the fact that we're 
<br />
talking about &quot;observers&quot; is important--it wouldn't work with stars or 
<br />
anything else.
<br />
<br />If I win the lottery, I'm pretty &quot;lucky&quot;--I could just as easily have been 
<br />
one of the losers.  On the other hand, despite the fact that physically 
<br />
realized genetic codes occupy only a tiny fraction of the space of all 
<br />
possible human DNA sequences, I wouldn't say I'm &quot;lucky&quot; to have an existing 
<br />
sequence rather than a nonexisting one--it isn't possible to &quot;be&quot; a 
<br />
nonexistent person, so of course I'm one of the existing ones (assuming for 
<br />
the moment that these other sequences aren't realized in a parallel universe 
<br />
or something).  This is an application of the second version of anthropic 
<br />
reasoning.
<br />
<br />The distinction between these two versions still may not be entirely clear.  
<br />
Another way to put it is that the second version, when coupled with the 
<br />
assumption of multiple universes/regions, allows you to *explain* why you 
<br />
find yourself in what is possibly a quite unlikely set of circumstances.  
<br />
For instance, if we assume that many physical constants are indeed set 
<br />
randomly, then it seems the fact that our universe's constants are 
<br />
fine-tuned to allow life becomes less puzzling if we assume multiple 
<br />
universes (or multiple regions with different constants).  In this case, the 
<br />
&quot;explanation&quot; for the apparent fine-tuning is that at least one 
<br />
correctly-tuned universe is likely to exist, and the second version of the 
<br />
anthropic principle says that's the universe that &quot;I&quot; must find myself in.  
<br />
In contrast, the first version can't explain anything at all--it's just a 
<br />
statement about your prior knowledge.
<br />
<br />An even clearer way to distinguish the two versions is that the second 
<br />
version allows you to make new inferences about reality, while the first 
<br />
only describes what you already know.  For example, if we find that our 
<br />
universe is indeed fine-tuned, then by a version of Bayesian reasoning we 
<br />
can say we should be more inclined to believe in the existence of other 
<br />
universes with different constants, in order to explain the &quot;coincidence&quot; of 
<br />
observed fine-tuning (to make this more obvious, feel free to assume we know 
<br />
a priori that there's a 50% chance God created a single universe and a 50% 
<br />
chance he created a multiverse).
<br />
<br />This is similar to &quot;copernican&quot; reasoning, like the Doomsday argument, which 
<br />
also allows you to infer new things about reality just by observing your own 
<br />
position in it.  In fact, I'd make a case for distinguishing the two 
<br />
anthropic principles by saying the second is identical to what's sometimes 
<br />
called the &quot;copernican anthropic principle.&quot;  For example, most people who 
<br />
say fine-tuning increases the probability of multiple universes would also 
<br />
say that we're more likely to find ourselves in a universe where observers 
<br />
(or observer-moments) are more common rather than one where they are rare, 
<br />
assuming the number of each kind of universe is about equal.
<br />
<br />So my question for you is, when you say &quot;the anthropic principle is 
<br />
universally mis-applied,&quot; are you saying that you think only Carter's 
<br />
original version of anthropic reasoning is valid, while the copernican 
<br />
anthropic principle is not?  Or do you accept the copernican anthropic 
<br />
principle but think the &quot;reference class&quot; can only consist of 
<br />
observer-moments that are using anthropic reasoning?  Or something else?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You ask: &quot;Is it just amazing luck that I find myself to be one of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;extremely rare complex observer-moments?&quot; - surely you don't mean this. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is equivaent to the traditional question &quot;Is it amazing luck that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe supports my life&quot;, to which the traditional mis-application of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anthropic principle is the ripost.
</em><br />
<br />This ripost only works if you assume multiple universes/regions, although I 
<br />
suppose you might say it doesn't work even then.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Obviously, if you were not one of these rare complex observer moments you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would not be asking why you were one. Luck has nothing to do with it. It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a 100% certainty.
</em><br />
<br />You misunderstood my point.  I was saying that if my &quot;reference class&quot; 
<br />
includes all &quot;self-referential thoughts&quot;, and if my definition of 
<br />
self-referential thoughts is such that simple ones greatly outnumber complex 
<br />
ones, then I can *not* use anthropic reasoning (of either sort) to explain 
<br />
why I find myself to be a rare complex one rather than a simple one...so the 
<br />
fact that I am a complex one would be very, very lucky in this case.  This 
<br />
then becomes a reason to say the original choice of reference class may have 
<br />
been incorrect.
<br />
<br />And this is still true if you replace &quot;self-referential thought&quot; with 
<br />
&quot;thought about the anthropic principle&quot; or something similar.  I can write a 
<br />
simple program that prints out &quot;I am thinking about the anthropic 
<br />
principle&quot;, and the number of physical systems that implement this program 
<br />
is probably still much greater than the number of systems that implement the 
<br />
complex processes going on in my brain (unless you take Hans Moravec's view, 
<br />
in which any system can be seen as implementing any 'thought' under the 
<br />
right mapping).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As an aside, these observer moments are not rare, in that there is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infnite number of them. Jacques Mallah might argue, however, that they have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;low measure in the universe of thoughts. Having said that, viz the CD that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;maps all natural numbers onto a series of thoughts, you need some external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mapping system to decide what is a thought and what isn't. From some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspective, from some mapping, all series in the universe can be viewed as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a self-referential thought.
</em><br />
<br />So you do take Hans Moravec's view?  But in that case, why do you think that 
<br />
observer-moments of the laws of physics operating normally should be any 
<br />
more common than observer-moments seeing crazy violations of physical law?  
<br />
If any physical system can map onto any kind of observer-moment I don't see 
<br />
how this can be explained.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[Note: I use the terms 'thought' and'observer moment'  interchangeably:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'observer moment' is the orthodoxy of this list, but I prefer 'thought'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;since it does not imply an observer. This is still a bit sloppy but I guess
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the terminology wil firm up in due course.]
</em><br />
<br />Would a program that prints out &quot;I am thinking about the anthropic 
<br />
principle&quot; count as a &quot;thought&quot; about the anthropic principle?  If not, on 
<br />
what basis do you rule it out?
