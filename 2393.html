<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ... if a given system implements all possible computations than no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; folk-psychological explanation is ultimately better than any other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I suggest you should pick the one that provides you the most effective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interaction, of the ones your able to muster.  That will be better for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you, at least, if not better in an absolute cosmic sense.
</em><br />
<br />But it seems like, in your view, planning for my own future would just be a 
<br />
matter of &quot;interpretation&quot; too.  There are plenty of Platonic worlds that 
<br />
have histories identical to this one up until the present, and then suddenly 
<br />
the laws of physics go crazy or something.  Can I become Superman by using 
<br />
an interpretation that says the law of gravity will be suspended for me and 
<br />
me alone?
<br />
<br />The key question here is whether reality has an objective global structure 
<br />
beyond &quot;all possibilities exist&quot;--for example, a weight or probability 
<br />
measure on the set of all possible worlds or experiences.  I think that my 
<br />
experiences are in some sense imposed on me by external reality--a good 
<br />
theory of everything should give some explanation for why I observe myself 
<br />
to be in a lawlike, consistent universe.  It's possible that even if there 
<br />
is an answer, it's beyond our abilities to comprehend...but since we really 
<br />
have no idea, we might as well try to look for some candidate theories.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My view is that a theory of consciousness should involve a one-to-one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mapping between subjective experiences and *some* set of mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; structures, but I don't think the set of all &quot;computations&quot; is a good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; candidate.  I think we need something more along the lines of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;isomorphic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; causal structures,&quot; but there doesn't yet seem to be a good way to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this intuition...Chalmers' paper at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/rock.html">http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/rock.html</a>&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; discusses his views on the subject.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I see attempts (notably Chalmers') to classify mappings into valid and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;invalid implementations as arbitrary lines in the sand, good for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;starting arguments, but otherwise having no significance or benefit.
</em><br />
<br />Well, certainly any mapping is OK for you to make if you want.  But I think 
<br />
Chalmers' idea is that there are some sort of psychophysical laws that 
<br />
determine a correspondence between the physical and the mental, so that the 
<br />
frequency of certain physical patterns determines the probability of 
<br />
experiencing certain first-person events.  So even though you're free to 
<br />
choose any mapping that interests you, reality may have a kind of &quot;preferred 
<br />
mapping&quot; that determines the probability I will experience one outcome or 
<br />
another.
<br />
<br />In the many-worlds interpretation all physically allowable patterns of 
<br />
matter/energy probably exist somewhere, but different patterns may have 
<br />
different measure--some may be more &quot;frequent&quot; or more &quot;probable&quot; than 
<br />
others (although physicists haven't yet found a way to define global 
<br />
probability in the MWI).  Given some set of psychophysical laws, you could 
<br />
use this to derive the fact that from a first-person point of view I am more 
<br />
likely to observe certain possibilities than others.
<br />
<br />But even if we grant the possibility of psychophysical laws, it seems that 
<br />
there are strong arguments for the idea that instances of the same 
<br />
computation lead to the same subjective experience--for example, imagine 
<br />
gradually replacing each neuron with a chip that responds to inputs and 
<br />
outputs the same way.  So then we get the same problem, that it seems sort 
<br />
of arbitrary to say that a computer is a &quot;good&quot; implementation but a rock is 
<br />
not.
<br />
<br />But I think something like &quot;isomorphic causal structure&quot; would make more 
<br />
sense, although it's hard to make this notion precise.  It seems like a 
<br />
computer simulation of my brain should have the same causal structure as my 
<br />
brain, even if the computer running that simulation is from a vanished 
<br />
civilization and no external observers have any idea what the shifting 1's 
<br />
and 0's are supposed to &quot;represent.&quot;   Likewise, even if the &quot;mind fire&quot; you 
<br />
talk about in &quot;Robot&quot; (one of my favorite parts of the book, incidentally) 
<br />
manages to squeeze huge computational power into the tiniest particle 
<br />
dynamics in a way that's totally incomprehensible to outside observers at 
<br />
our level of intelligence, such observers could still see the causal 
<br />
structure of these dynamics--they just wouldn't know what they &quot;mean.&quot;  In 
<br />
contrast, I don't believe advanced minds are ever going to download 
<br />
themselves into the ticks of a clock.
<br />
<br />It's true that under the right mapping, the ticks of a clock can be seen as 
<br />
doing any &quot;computation&quot; you please, including a simulation of an intelligent 
<br />
A.I.  But if you wanted to actually implement this mapping in the physical 
<br />
world so you could interact with the A.I., you'd end up reproducing the 
<br />
causal structure of the A.I. on the computer (or brain) responsible for the 
<br />
mapping.  That's my intuition anyway--since I don't have a precise 
<br />
definition of &quot;causal structure&quot; I can't be sure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It doesn't make much sense to imagine two universes which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; identical in terms of both physical events and mental experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (if they exist), but which differ in a single way: in one,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Shakespeare is &quot;really&quot; better, and in the other Danielle Steele is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sure it does.  Imagine universes created by inferences from axiom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;systems.  Two universes could have generating axioms identical except
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for the one about writing quality just as you've stated it.  A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Platonic universe can have &quot;literary goodness&quot; as a basic property
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just as it can have number, energy, or intention.
</em><br />
<br />Even if it was part of a Platonic universe's axioms to assign a measure 
<br />
called &quot;literary goodness&quot; to various pieces of literature, I don't think 
<br />
that would settle much--the values could be pretty arbitrary, and observers 
<br />
in the universe would be free to say that what they mean by the term 
<br />
&quot;literary goodness&quot; is completely different from the quantity in the axioms. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But universes with different psychophysical laws would make different 
<br />
experiences more or less likely, and the observers' opinions wouldn't change 
<br />
that...just as my opinions won't change the fact that if I jump off a 
<br />
building I'm overwhelmingly likely to fall to the ground.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think, like the recent election, our disagreements are smaller
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than our uncertainties.
</em><br />
<br />No doubt.  But unwarranted speculations are what this list is all about, 
<br />
right?
