<br />Let's look a little closer at the story in terms of gestalts.
<br />
<br />On one side we have published author Robert Heinlein writing a story in 
<br />
1939 about a guy named Silard who works with a uranium bomb, a beryllium 
<br />
target and a fellow named &quot;lenz.&quot;  We'll leave Korzybski out of this one (I 
<br />
suspect Heinlein borrowed the name from A. Korzybski, a sematicist of some 
<br />
renown back in the 1930s.)  To me the interesting nodes involve the words 
<br />
&quot;Silard&quot; &quot;lenz&quot; &quot;beryllium,&quot; &quot;uranium&quot; and &quot;bomb.&quot; So let's agree that here 
<br />
is a story that includes a gestalt of the words &quot;Silard, lenz, beryllium, 
<br />
uranium and bomb.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, to my knowledge, no other articles prior to 1945 that include 
<br />
any of these words together.  Or four of them.  Or three.  Or two.   If 
<br />
this sort of thing is such a coincidence, then perhaps you can point out 
<br />
which articles (sci fi or otherwise) included any of these words 
<br />
together---this unique gestalt.
<br />
<br />Now, on the other side, lets take a look at the timeline for the real Leo 
<br />
Szilard, et al:
<br />
<br />Szilard, in 1939 was bouncing between London and New York.  As for the 
<br />
Manhattan Project, it truly began in June, 1942, when the S-1 Committte in 
<br />
the US concluding that an atomic weapon was feasible and would take two 
<br />
years to build.  On November, 25, 1942 the US government paid $440,000 for 
<br />
54,000 acres of land in Sandoval county, NM, and in August, 1943 Roosevelt 
<br />
met with Canadian Prime Minister King to work out the agreements outlining 
<br />
cooperation for construction of the device.  It was that year that the US 
<br />
government assembled scientists to begin work---among them, Klaus Fuchs, 
<br />
Edward Teller, Neils Bohr and George B. Kistiakowski (a Russian immigrant 
<br />
who had initially worked at Harvard's Chemistry Dept.)
<br />
<br />As for the Lenz issue---originally, the Los Alamos team had decided on a 
<br />
rifle approach (that eventually was &quot;tested&quot; at Hiroshima).  But scientist 
<br />
Seth Neddermeyer came up with the idea for explosive lenses--no one thought 
<br />
it would work until Oppenheimer himself endorsed it, and John Von 
<br />
Neumann---after some calculation, agreed that it would be the most 
<br />
economical way to get to criticality.   After that Kistiakowski's 
<br />
&quot;X-Division&quot; focused on the explosive lenses.  Thus, we have a gestalt that 
<br />
matches Heinleins 1939 set, but only after quite a bit of secret work.
<br />
This was at the end of 1943.
<br />
<br />One set occurs in 1939, published in 1940.  The other set after 1943.   Of 
<br />
course it is a coincidence---two similar gestalts occurring years apart, 
<br />
but are you suggesting:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)  that this sort of thing shouldn't be evaluated in terms of a 
<br />
model?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) no proper model exists, so it's not worth investigating?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) nothing with a p&lt;10^-9 chance of random occurrence is worth 
<br />
investigating because it's obviously just a spike.  (That, by the way, is 
<br />
one of the reasons the CDC refuses to take cancer clusters seriously). Or 
<br />
is it (more likely). . .
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Math and logic techniques fail when evaluating real world 
<br />
events such as the one described---something like dividing an unknown by 
<br />
zero and coming up with infinities that mean nothing?
<br />
<br />I surely hope this isn't the case.
