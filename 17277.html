<br /><br />I can understand how easy for a materialist it is, to conceive at  
<br />
first sight, that numbers and mathematical objects are convenient  
<br />
fiction realized as space-time material configuration, perhaps of  
<br />
brains.
<br />
But those space-time configuration are themselves described by  
<br />
mathematical functions far more complex that the numbers described or  
<br />
explain. This leads to major difficulties, even before approaching the  
<br />
consciousness problem.
<br />
This shows that a purely physicalist explanation of numbers could lead  
<br />
to difficulties. But the same for a description of any piece of  
<br />
material things, by just that token.
<br />
So, I am not sure that physicist can be said to have solved the  
<br />
&quot;matter&quot; problem either, and some physicists are already open,  
<br />
independently of comp, to the idea that physical objects are relative  
<br />
mathematical (immaterial) objects. Which of course are &quot;no material&quot;.  
<br />
Wheeler, Tegmark, for example.
<br />
But then with comp, you are yourself an immaterial object, of the kind  
<br />
person, like the lobian machine. You own a body, or you borrow it to  
<br />
your neighborhood, and &quot;you&quot; as an immaterial pattern can become  
<br />
stable only by being multiplied in infinities of coherent similar  
<br />
histories, which eventually the physicists begin to talk about  
<br />
(multiverse).
<br />
<br />I tend to believe in many immaterial things. Some are absolutely real  
<br />
(I think) like the natural numbers.
<br />
Some may be seen as absolutely real, or just as useful fiction: it  
<br />
changes nothing. This is the case for the negative number, the  
<br />
rational, a large part of the algebraic and topological, and analytical.
<br />
Some are both absolutely real, and physically real, they live in  
<br />
&quot;platonia&quot;, and then can come back on earth: they have a relatively  
<br />
concrete existence. For example, the games of chess, the computers,  
<br />
the animals, and the persons. But the concreteness is relative, the  
<br />
'I' coupled with the chessboard is an abstract couple following  
<br />
normality conditions (that QM provides, but comp not yet).
<br />
Some could have an even more trivial sense of absolute existence, and  
<br />
a case could be made they don't exist, even in Platonia, like the  
<br />
unicorns, perhaps, and the squared circles (hopefully).
<br />
<br />Each branch of math has its own notion of existence, and with comp, we  
<br />
have a lot  choice, for the ontic part, but usually I take  
<br />
arithmetical existence, if only because this is taught in school, and  
<br />
its enough to justified the existence of the universal numbers, and  
<br />
either they dreams (if &quot;yes doctor&quot;) or at least their discourse on  
<br />
their dreams (if you say no the doctor and decide to qualify those  
<br />
machines are &quot;inexistent zombies&quot;).
<br />
<br />There is a sense to say those universal machines do not exist, but it  
<br />
happens that they don't have the cognitive abilities to know that, and  
<br />
for them, in-existence does not make sense.
<br />
<br />And for a mathematicans, they exists in a very strong sense, which is  
<br />
that, by accepting Church Thesis, they can prove the existence of  
<br />
universal digital (mathematical) machine from 0, succession, addition  
<br />
and multiplication.
<br />
Both amoebas colony (human cells), and engineers are implementing some  
<br />
of them everyday in our neighborhood, as we can guess.
