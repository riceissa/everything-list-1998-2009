<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So let me try an interesting variant on the experiment.  I think someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;else proposed this recently, the idea of &quot;retroactive causation&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I won't put that exact spin on it though.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose you will again be simultaneously teleported to Washington
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and Moscow.  This time you will have just one copy waking up in each.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then you will expect 50-50 odds.  But suppose that after one hour,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the copy in Moscow gets switched to the parallel computer so it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;running with 10 times the measure; 10 copies.  And suppose that you know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;beforehand that during that high-measure time period (after one hour)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in Moscow you will experience some event E.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What is your subjective probability beforehand for experiencing E?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think you agreed that if you had been woken up in Moscow on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the super-parallel computer that you would expect a 90% chance of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiencing E.  But now we have interposed a time delay, in which your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure starts off at 1 in Moscow and then increases to 10.  Does that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;make a difference in how likely you are to experience E?
</em><br />
<br />Again, it's a two step process, each time considering the next moment. 
<br />
First, 50% chance of waking up in either Moscow or Washington. Second, 100% 
<br />
chance of experiencing E in Moscow or 0% chance of experiencing E in 
<br />
Washington. The timing is crucial, or the probabilities are completely 
<br />
different. Russell Standish realised this in his response to my green/red 
<br />
light puzzle. To summarise, God places you in a room with a light changing 
<br />
colour every 10 minutes, corresponding with a high measure state (10^100 
<br />
copies of you, say green) and a low measure state (one copy of you, say 
<br />
red), but you don't know which colour is which. In my original wording, I 
<br />
said you don't remember how you got there and only after you notice the 
<br />
light changing colour over several cycles do you see God's explanatory note. 
<br />
Now, if you have to guess which colour corresponds with with which state, 
<br />
you may as well toss a coin, because your experience is that you spend half 
<br />
your time red and half green; or, to put it differently, when you anticipate 
<br />
the next moment when the light is about to change colour, there is a 50% 
<br />
chance you will be in the high measure state and a 50% chance you will be in 
<br />
the low measure state, from the symmetry of the situation from your 1st 
<br />
person perspective. But Russell's answer was that if you remembered what 
<br />
colour the light was when you first arrived in the room, that would almost 
<br />
certainly have been the high measure state. The reason this is so different 
<br />
is that when you consider your next moment when God is about to put you in 
<br />
the room, you have to take both possibilities into account simultaneously 
<br />
rather than sequentially, and there are 10^100 times as many ways the light 
<br />
could end up green as red. This is the error people make when they say that 
<br />
you are more likely to find yourself living in a period of high measure 
<br />
(when you are younger) than low measure (when you are millions of years 
<br />
old), as an objection to QTI. It isn't valid to shuffle all the OM's from 
<br />
all time periods and draw one at random, except when considering your 
<br />
initial introduction into the world. Once you are already alive, you have to 
<br />
pay attention to the special way our minds create continuity of 
<br />
consciousness from moment to moment.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am wondering if you think it makes sense that you would expect a 50%
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability of experiencing events which take place in Moscow while
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your measure is 1, but a 90% probability of experiencing events like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;E, which take place while your measure is 10?  I'm not sure about this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;myself, because I am skeptical about this continuity-of-identity idea.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But perhaps, in your framework, this would offer a solution to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problem you keep asking, of some way to notice or detect when your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure increases.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In that case we would say that you could notice when your measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;increases because it would increase your subjective probability of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiencing events.
</em><br />
<br />I think the subjective probability stays the same, for the above reasons. I 
<br />
consider my next moment: what are the possibilities? What is the relative 
<br />
proportion of each possibility? It's probably easiest to visualize with a 
<br />
tree diagram, or with the game I suggested in my post &quot;objections to QTI&quot;. 
<br />
You can't just mix up all the OM's from different time periods and hope to 
<br />
make sense of it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps we could even go back to the thought experiment where you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;alternating days of high measure and low measure.  Think of multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lockstep copies being created on high measure days and destroyed on low
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure days.  Suppose before beginning this procedure you flip a quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;coin (in the MWI) and will only undergo it if the coin comes up heads.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, could you have a subjective anticipation of 50% of experiencing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;events you know will happen on low-measure days, but an anticipation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;90% of experiencing the events you know will happen on high-measure days?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then that would be a tangible difference, and you would be justified in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pre-arranging your affairs so that pleasant events happen on the high
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure days and unpleasant ones happen on the low measure days.
</em><br />
<br />No, I think your expectations should be the same if we're talking about 
<br />
consecutive days, for the above reasons.
