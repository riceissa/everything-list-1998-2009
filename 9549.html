</em><br />
<br />I am mostly referring to the philosophical literature on the problems of
<br />
what counts as an instantiation, as well as responses considered here
<br />
and elsewhere.  One online paper is Chalmers' &quot;Does a Rock Implement
<br />
Every Finite-State Automaton?&quot;, <a href="http://consc.net/papers/rock.html">http://consc.net/papers/rock.html</a>.
<br />
Jacques Mallah (who seems to have disappeared from the net) discussed
<br />
the issue on this list several years ago.
<br />
<br />Now, Chalmers (and Mallah) claimed to have a solution to decide when
<br />
a physical system implements a calculation.  But I don't think they
<br />
work; at least, they admit gray areas.  In fact, I think Mallah came
<br />
up with the same basic idea I am advocating, that there is a degree of
<br />
instantiation and it is based on the Kolmogorov complexity of a program
<br />
that maps between physical states and corresponding computational states.
<br />
<br />For functionalism to work, though, it seems to me that you really need
<br />
to be able to give a yes or no answer to whether something implements a
<br />
given calculation.  Fuzziness will not do, given that changing the system
<br />
may kill a conscious being!  It doesn't make sense to say that someone is
<br />
&quot;sort of&quot; there, at least not in the conventional functionalist view.
<br />
<br />A fertile source of problems for functionalism involves the question
<br />
of whether playbacks of passive recordings of brain states would be
<br />
conscious.  If not (as Chalmers and many others would say, since they
<br />
lack the proper counterfactual behavior), this leads to a machine with a
<br />
dial which controls the percentage of time its elements behave according
<br />
to a passive playback versus behaving according to active computational
<br />
rules.  Now we can turn the knob and have the machine gradually move from
<br />
unconsciousness to full consciousness, without changing its behavior in
<br />
any way as we twiddle the knob.  This invokes Chalmers' &quot;fading qualia&quot;
<br />
paradox and is again fatal for functionalism.
<br />
<br />Maudlin's machines, which we have also mentioned on this list from time
<br />
to time, further illustrate the problems in trying to draw a bright line
<br />
between implementations and clever non-implementations of computations.
<br />
<br />In short I view functionalism as being fundamentally broken unless there
<br />
is a much better solution to the implementation question than I am aware
<br />
of.  Therefore we cannot assume a priori that a brain implementation and a
<br />
computational implementation of mental states will be inherently the same.
<br />
And I have argued in fact that they could have different properties.
<br />
