<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Speculation for me is not a pejorative term, to begin with. Yes, there 
<br />
is a sense in which all theories are speculative but
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;some have ceased to be purely so because either empirical or heuristic 
<br />
evidence was found in their favor. That is the sense
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;in which they are no longer considered speculative. So QM, for 
<br />
example, is no longer called a speculative theory, though
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;people do speculate a lot around it since it poses some serious 
<br />
intepretative problems. The Everett version of QM is either
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;an interpretation of QM or a better theory (let us call it EQM) 
<br />
depending on whom you ask, and that is actually another
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;item of speculation, btw. But the people who claim that EQM is a 
<br />
theory need to come up with feasible empirical tests for
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;which EQM gives predictions distinct from QM. Until these tests are 
<br />
proposed and are performed EQM remains a speculative theory!!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My view, as addressed to physicist, is the following. I make it 
<br />
simpler for reason of clarity.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Copenhagen QM:
<br />
&nbsp;SWE
<br />
&nbsp;Unintelligible dualist theory of measurement/observation
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Everett QM:
<br />
&nbsp;SWE
<br />
&nbsp;comp theory of observation/cognition
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Your servitor:
<br />
&nbsp;comp.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The collapse is a speculation on a theory which does not exist, and 
<br />
which has been invented to make the (isolated, microscopic) 
<br />
superposition non contagious on the environment. So if you want make 
<br />
the distinction between speculation and hypothesis, I would say the 
<br />
&quot;collapse&quot; is far more speculative.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;You are probably right about this but I would say it differently: 
<br />
there is no Quantum Theory of &quot;collapse&quot; though something
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;quite like that needs to occur to produce the classical world we know. 
<br />
Anything beyond this is... speculation either way! It
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is incorrect to say that &quot;EQM explains collapse&quot; because in EQM there 
<br />
is no collapse. It is also incorrect to say that EQM
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;includes COMP for the reasons I already stated to you out of 
<br />
Preskill's lectures.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of comp is that machine cannot know if they are supported 
<br />
by any computations and it is up to Everett Deutsch etc. to explain why 
<br />
the quantum computations wins the &quot;observability conditions&quot; on the 
<br />
(well defined by Church Thesis) collection of all computations. This is 
<br />
not obvious at all and constitutes the first main result I got.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This I don't quite follow. Sorry! How are &quot;conditions of 
<br />
observability&quot; defined by CT?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For comp &quot;philosophers of mind&quot; (Alias theoretical cognitive 
<br />
scientists), the two main result I got can be seen as a &quot;correction&quot; of 
<br />
the &quot;old&quot; Lucas Penrose argument which try to refute comp by Godel's 
<br />
incompleteness.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I remember it right this is an argument that aims to show why a 
<br />
&quot;mathematician&quot; cannot be a &quot;digital computer&quot;. Does your
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;correction make it a better argument? I take it you are saying that it 
<br />
is correct after all!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;From this I see only a couple of ways out: Either
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 1) your derivation leads you not to QM but to a better physical 
</em><br />
theory with testable empirical predictions that falsify
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;those of QM, presumably including those that lead to the invalidation 
</em><br />
of YD. I would very much like to see that
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;theory if you have it!
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;On my web page you can find all the needed programs to run a theorem 
<br />
prover of that physics. With some time and training you could perhaps 
<br />
optimize it and ... refute or confirm comp (admitting quantum logic 
<br />
operates on nature).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;From what has been already derived, some non trivial quantum logical 
<br />
features did appeared.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it that this means you are trying out the route I labelled (1) 
<br />
or that you think that is the way to go. I am not sure
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that &quot;quantum logic operates on nature&quot; because there isn't one but 
<br />
many &quot;quantum logics&quot; and I am not acquainted
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;with one that reproduces the quantum formalism with all its quirks. 
<br />
But what you say above already denotes the use
<br />
&nbsp;of some &quot;non-boolean&quot; logic from where I sit.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;2) you actually prove (by non-QM means, I assume) that YD is 
<br />
empirically implementable
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is nonsense. Better: with comp it is provably nonsense. (G G* 
<br />
confusion, for those who knows). It is a key point: if comp is true YD 
<br />
will never be proved to be implementable. (It is of the type Dt, or 
<br />
equivalently ~B~t, its truth makes it unprovable).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;So it is (1), I guess!
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;and that would only require
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; that you replace the experience of one human being (may I suggest 
</em><br />
yours?) by a digital computer version of the same.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the act of faith needed for the comp practitionners. Recall 
<br />
that for many people such a question will be a weaker one at first, 
<br />
like should I accept an artificial hyppocampus instead of dying now. 
<br />
Well the real question will be: should I choose a mac, a pc, or what? 
<br />
The fact is that comp can justify by itself why it is a act of faith, 
<br />
and I am not sure it is entirely &quot;comp-polite&quot; to suggest such an 
<br />
operation to anyone but oneself.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad I was polite enough to suggest you do it to yourself! The 
<br />
rest of what you say above I don't think I follow...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;See I made the switch to the Mac, does that commit my hypocampus to 
<br />
mortality? (;-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; (Of course you can always claim that it has already occurred, as you 
</em><br />
sometimes suggest and that is cute but just plain silly,
<br />
&nbsp;too. )
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I claim this in the context of comp + OCCAM. Amoeba's 
<br />
self-duplication, and even the high sexual reproduction of mammals 
<br />
involved rather clearly digital information processing.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Bruno
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;!!! Now you are no longer cute and talking real dirty trash ! I am 
<br />
turning on my V-chip... (;-)
