<br />The 'substrate' to which I refer is not matter or anything else in
<br />
particular, but a logical-semantic 'substrate' from which 'mind' or
<br />
'matter' could emerge.  On this basis, 'sense-action' (i.e. two
<br />
differentiated 'entities' primitively 'sensing' each other in order to
<br />
'interact') is a logical, or at least semantically coherent,
<br />
requirement.  For example, if you want to use a particle-force
<br />
analogy, then the 'force' would be the medium of exchange of sense-
<br />
action - i.e. relationship.  In Kant's ontology, his windowless monads
<br />
had no such means of exchange (the 'void' prevented it) and
<br />
consequently divine intervention had to do the 'trick'.  I'm hoping
<br />
that Bruno will help me with the appropriate analogy for AR+COMP.
<br />
<br />In this logical sense, the primitive 'substrate' is crucial, and ISTM
<br />
that any coherent notion of 'organisation' must include these basic
<br />
semantics - indeed the problem with conventional expositions of
<br />
functionalism is that they implicitly appeal to this requirement but
<br />
explicitly ignore it.  A coherent 'functionalist' account needs to
<br />
track the emergence of sense-action from primitive self-motivated
<br />
sources in an appropriate explanatory base, analogous to supervention
<br />
in 'physical' accounts.  However, if this requirement is made
<br />
explicit, I'm happy to concur that appropriate organisation based on
<br />
it is indeed what generates both consciousness and action, and the
<br />
causal linkage between the two accounts.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course all that is true, but it doesn't explain why neurons in the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cortex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; are the ones giving rise to qualia rather than other neurons or indeed

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; peripheral sense organs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well, you might as well ask why the engine drives the car and not the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; brakes.  Presumably (insert research programme here) the different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; neural (or other relevant) organisation of the cortex is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; difference that makes the difference.  My account would run like this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the various emergent organs of the brain and sensory apparatus (like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; everything else) supervene on an infrastructure capable of 'sense-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; action'.  I'm (somewhat) agnostic about the nature of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; infrastructure: conceive it as strings, particles, or even Bruno's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; numbers.  But however we conceptualise it, it must (logically) be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; capable of 'sense-action' in order for activity and cognition to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; supervene on it.  Then what makes the difference in the cortex must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a supremely complex 'mirroring' mode of organisation (a 'remembered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; present') lacked by other organs.  To demonstrate this will be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; supremely difficult empirical programme, but IMO it presents no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; invincible philosophical problems if conceived in this way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What you're suggesting is that matter is intrinsically capable of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense-action, but it takes substantial amounts of matter of the right kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organised in the right way in order to give rise to what we experience as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness. What do we lose if we say that it is organisation which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsically capable of sense-action, but it takes a substantial amount of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organisation of the right sort to in order to give rise to consciousness?
