<br />Hi Peter
<br />
<br />I'd like to be really careful here to avoid getting into some of the
<br />
same loops that so frustrated Alan on the FOR list!  I may well be dead
<br />
wrong in what I'm claiming, but at least I'd like us both to be clear
<br />
on precisely what in fact this is.
<br />
<br />Firstly, my overall enterprise is to arrive at some general description
<br />
of things that relies on as few explanatory entities as possible.  Now,
<br />
IMO we cannot avoid taking first person into account - I find I can't
<br />
begin to have an intelligible discussion with anyone who doesn't accept
<br />
this (not you clearly).  From this, if first person is to be a given,
<br />
the simplest approach is to explore whether, ontologically speaking, we
<br />
could take it to be the sole given, and my project has been to see
<br />
where this leads.  One of the difficulties has been to pin down the
<br />
language to distinguish the different meanings associated with the term
<br />
'first person', so I've attempted to define certain usages (which I'm
<br />
happy at any time to abandon for better ones). These are:
<br />
<br />1) FP1g - primitive 'global' first person entity or context
<br />
2) FP1i - individual person delimited by primitive differentiation
<br />
(which is agnostic to comp, physics, or anything else at this logical
<br />
level)
<br />
3) FP2 - narrative references to first persons, as in 'David is a first
<br />
person', an attribution, as opposed to 'David-as-first-person', a
<br />
unique entity.
<br />
4) TP - third person, or structure-read-as-information, as opposed to
<br />
structure-demarcating-an-entity
<br />
<br />Later on in the reply to Bruno from which you quote, and in some of the
<br />
earlier posts, I make the point that starting from such a generalised
<br />
or undifferentiated first person context we can see that certain sorts
<br />
of structural differentiation can create delimited zones within the
<br />
whole. Some of these zones take the form of individual first persons
<br />
(FP1i).  Within each FP1i person so constituted exists a 'set of
<br />
capabilities' and a 'structural model of the world'.  Which part of the
<br />
FP1i acts as 'perceiver' and which 'perceptual model' is simply an
<br />
aspect of function-from-structure.  It happens to be the former that
<br />
has the organisation for representing information and self-reporting,
<br />
so it's the one that gets to enjoy 'experience'.
<br />
<br />Within the structural model of the world - our only means of
<br />
representing, and through 'downloading', sharing information with other
<br />
first persons - there will of course be regions that we variously label
<br />
'self' (e.g. 'my arm') or 'other' (e.g. Peter Jones').  The latter, I
<br />
presume, would be an example of what you call 'stuff that appears,
<br />
subjectively , to be not-me'.  Of course I agree that 'If I ignore it,
<br />
I am not making full use of my only epistemologial resource'.  So, I
<br />
don't ignore it.
<br />
<br />However, you go on: 'If I treat is as 1st-personal as well as
<br />
third-personal, I am overcomplicating things'.  My response to this is
<br />
two-fold.  First, of course, it is simply not the case that my
<br />
representation of 'Peter Jones' is the same as its presumed referent in
<br />
the world 'Peter Jones'.  My assumption is that it is informationally
<br />
connected with this referent, and to an extent co-varies with it, but
<br />
it is well for me to remember that such representations are my
<br />
reponsibility and not yours.  But more fundamentally, and this is why I
<br />
recapitulated my overall project at the outset, the intention is to
<br />
simplify, not complicate.  My representation of 'Peter Jones' is a part
<br />
of my subjectivity, and it is a part I label 'third person' to
<br />
distinguish it from 'self', an evolutionarily useful distinction.
<br />
<br />Peter Jones in the world I take to be another first person entity
<br />
(FP1i) that derives this status in virtue of being another delimited
<br />
zone, appropriately structured, within FP1g, the single ontological
<br />
context.  Outside of my subjective model of the world, and that of
<br />
other first persons, in no sense is Peter Jones in the world 'third
<br />
person'.  Only the *references* to Peter Jones are subjectively
<br />
categorised as such within individual world-models, and these are FP2
<br />
first-person analogs, or third person descriptions of first persons -
<br />
as distinct from 'instantiated first persons'.
<br />
<br />Now it seems to me that all of the above has been accomplished without
<br />
moving outside of a primitive first person ontology.  I have
<br />
distinguished various zones within this single context, and I've
<br />
suggested how one information structure can be used to 'label' another
<br />
(i.e. stand in relation to it) as 'third person' (description or
<br />
narrative), 'self', or 'other', and all without deploying any other
<br />
ontological type, other than metaphorically.  That's what I'm trying to
<br />
achieve.
