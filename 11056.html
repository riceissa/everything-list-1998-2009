<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; It's interesting that people actually withdraw their hand from the fire *before* they experience

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the pain. The withdrawl is a reflex, presumably evolved in organisms with the most primitive

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Even more curious, volitional action also occurs before one is aware of it. Are you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; familiar with the experiments of Benjamin Libet and Grey Walter?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These experiments showed that in apparently voluntarily initiated motion, motor cortex activity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually preceded the subject's awareness of his intention by a substantial fraction of a second.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words, we act first, then &quot;decide&quot; to act.
</em><br />
<br />Does Benjamin Libet's Research Empirically Disprove Free Will ?
<br />
Scientifically informed sceptics about FW often quote a famous
<br />
experiment by benjamin Libet, which supposedly shows that a kind of
<br />
signal called a &quot;Readiness Potential&quot;, detectable by electrodes,
<br />
precedes a conscious decisions, and is a reliable indicator of the
<br />
decision, and thus -- so the claim goes -- indicates that our decisions
<br />
are not ours but made for us by unconsious processes.
<br />
<br />In fact, Libet himself doesn't draw a sweepingly sceptical conclusion
<br />
from his own results. For one thing, Readiness Potentials are not
<br />
always followed by actions. he believes it is possible for
<br />
consicousness to intervene with a &quot;veto&quot; to the action:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The initiation of the freely voluntary act appears to begin in the
<br />
brain unconsciously, well before the person consciously knows he wants
<br />
to act! Is there, then, any role for conscious will in the performing
<br />
of a voluntary act?...To answer this it must be recognised that
<br />
conscious will (W) does appear about 150milliseconds before the muscsle
<br />
is activated, even though it follows the onset ofthe RP. An interval of
<br />
150msec would allow enough time in which the conscious function might
<br />
affec the final outcome of the volitional process.&quot;
<br />
<br />(Libet, quoted in &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; by Daniel Dennett, p. 230 )
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This suggests our conscious minds may not have free will but
<br />
rather free won't!&quot;
<br />
<br />(V.S Ramachandran, quoted in &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; by Daniel Dennett, p.
<br />
231 )
<br />
<br />However, it is quite possible that the Libertarian doesn't need to
<br />
appeal to &quot;free won't&quot; to avoid the conclusion that free won't doesn't
<br />
exist.
<br />
<br />Libet tells when the RP occurs using electrodes. But how does Libet he
<br />
when conscious decison-making occurs ? He relies on the subject
<br />
reporting the position of the hand of a clock. But, as Dennett points
<br />
out, this is only a report of where it seems to the subject that
<br />
various things come together, not of the objective time at which they
<br />
occur.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose Libet knows that your readiness potential peaked at second
<br />
6,810 of the experimental trial, and the clock dot was straight down
<br />
(which is what you reported you saw) at millisecond 7,005. How many
<br />
milliseconds should he have to add to this number to get the time you
<br />
were conscious of it? The light gets from your clock face to your
<br />
eyeball almost instantaneously, but the path of the signals from retina
<br />
through lateral geniculate nucleus to striate cortex takes 5 to 10
<br />
milliseonds -- a paltry fraction of the 300 milliseconds offset, but
<br />
how much longer does it take them to get to you. (Or are you located in
<br />
the striate cortex?) The visual signals have to be processed before
<br />
they arrive at wherever they need to arrive for you to make a consicous
<br />
decision of simulataneity. Libet's method presupposes, in short, that
<br />
we can locate the intersection of two trajectories: # the
<br />
rising-to-consciousness of signals representing the decision to flick #
<br />
the rising to consciousness of signals representing successive
<br />
clock-face orientations so that these events occur side-by-side as it
<br />
were in place where their simultaneity can be noted.
<br />
<br />(&quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; by Daniel Dennett, p. 231 )
<br />
<br />Dennett refers to an experiment in which Churchland showed, that just
<br />
pressing a button when asked to signal when you see a flash of light
<br />
takes a normal subject about 350 milliseconds.
<br />
<br />Does that mean that all actions taking longer than that are unconcisous
<br />
?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain processes stimuli over time, and the amount of time
<br />
depends on which information is being extracted for which purposes. A
<br />
top tennis player can set up to design a return of service within 100
<br />
milliseconds or so. The 78 feet from base line to base line can be
<br />
traversed by a serve from Venus Williams [...] in less than 450
<br />
milliseconds [...] And since the precise timing and shape of that
<br />
return depends critically on visual information and put it to highly
<br />
appropriate use in that short a time. As Churchland showed, just
<br />
pressing a button when asked to signal when you see a flash of light
<br />
takes a normal subject about 350 milliseconds.
<br />
<br />(&quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; by Daniel Dennett, p. 238 )
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our lives are full of decisions to act when the time is ripe,
<br />
revisable commitments to policies, and attitudes that will shape
<br />
responses that must be executed top swiftly to be reflectively
<br />
considered in the light of actions.
<br />
<br />(&quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; by Daniel Dennett, p. 239 )
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing tricks usually fit together seamlessly and are
<br />
incorporated into the brain's own monotoring of what it is up to, but
<br />
in artifical cicumstances (as set up by clever experimenters) the
<br />
tricks can be exposed.
<br />
<br />(&quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; by Daniel Dennett, p. 239 )
<br />
<br />It is important to separate the idea that of an action being done (or
<br />
not) by you, being consciously done (or not) by you, and the being done
<br />
(or not) by you at a moment in time. The Tennis player who reacts too
<br />
quickly to have made a conscious decision is reacting too quickly ot
<br />
have made a decision at that time. On the other hand, their decisions
<br />
is not unwelcome or unexpected. It feels like their decision. And why
<br />
should it not when it is the outcome of long practice, practice of the
<br />
kind that is necessary to fulfil any taks that requires precise timing,
<br />
such as sport or music. The consciousness of the decision comes from
<br />
the cnsncious decision to train oneself to react in a certain way. The
<br />
consciousness of the act is stored, and pre-prepared, and using it we
<br />
can perform feats where Libet's 300m sec. delay would be quite
<br />
unnacceptable.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing going for this hypothesis is that such judgements of
<br />
simultaneity are unnatural acts in the first place, unless they are
<br />
framed for a particular purpose, such as your trying to get your
<br />
staccato attack in sync with the conductor's downbeat, or trying to
<br />
connect with a low fastball so a to send it straight back over the
<br />
pitcher's head.
<br />
<br />(&quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; by Daniel Dennett, p. 235 )
<br />
<br />Dennett's idea of &quot;stored&quot; conscious volition is quite in line with our
<br />
theory. Indeed, we would like to extend it in a way that Dennett does
<br />
not. We would like to extend it to stored indeterminism. Any decision
<br />
we make in exigent situations wher we do nto have the luxury of
<br />
conisdered thought must be more-or-less determinsistic -- must be
<br />
more-or-less determined by our state of mind at the time - -if they are
<br />
to be of any use at all to us. Otherwise we might as well toss a coin.
<br />
But our state of mind at the time can be formed by rumination, training
<br />
and so over a long period, perhaps over a lifetime. As such it can
<br />
contain elemetns of indeterminism in the positive sense -- of
<br />
imagination and creativity, not mere caprice.
<br />
<br />This extension of Dennett's criticism of Libet (or rather the way
<br />
Libet's results are used by free-will sceptics) gives us a way of
<br />
answering Dennett's own criticisms of Robert Kane, a prominent defender
<br />
of naturalistic Free Will.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; These studies did not examine pre-planned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; action (presumably that would be far more technically difficult) but it is easy to imagine the analogous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situation whereby the action is unconsciously &quot;planned&quot; before we become aware of our decision. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other words, free will is just a feeling which occurs after the fact.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It's equally easy to imagine the opposite.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is consistent with the logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossibility of something that is neither random nor determined, which is what I feel my free will to be.
</em><br />
<br />FW can be an appropriately structured mixture of the two.
