<br />
John,
<br />
<br />My email pgm sometimes (as now) balks at quote/copying 
<br />
material from emails I'm replying to.  So I'll do as best
<br />
to reply without having your exact words to refer to.
<br />
<br />re Bruno's inquiring about how I link changes of inertia
<br />
to Csness, I'll do that in a few days.
<br />
<br />re Gendankens - I won't waste time debating you. The only 
<br />
thing that's important about gedankens is that they
<br />
isolate and highlight certain relationships which seem
<br />
important to the line of inquiry. If real-event scenarios
<br />
&amp; analogs can be used - all the better. But if invented,
<br />
that's not criminal or necessarily 'conceptually illegal'
<br />
:-) .. serves the inquiry and 'what if' exploration of 
<br />
relations, I WOULD SAY.
<br />
<br />re 'falling branch/tree', yes it came to be 'experienced
<br />
sound' versus 'generated wave' - but originally, it was
<br />
a clear 'existential' question: can a thing 'exist' if
<br />
something else doesn't experience the effects OF that
<br />
first thing's existence.   Ie: if science hasn't acknowledged
<br />
something experimentally/experientially, then the 'something'
<br />
has no verity or validity.  No 'proof', no existence.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, there is a conflated/confused definition of
<br />
'proof'; it now embraces: 'explanation' and independent record.
<br />
<br />re Csness=data storage.  Yes, you no longer count it sufficient for
<br />
Csness.  But a lot of folks do, especially AI researchers.  They 
<br />
presume that 'memory reconstitution' is equal to Csness reconstitution.
<br />
And that's not the case.
<br />
<br />re femto coma-awakening-death.  it may be the gedanken you may find
<br />
frustrating, and then cast it aside as 'unknowable', and if
<br />
unknowable, then ..SOWHAT&quot;, but I put it to you that this is 
<br />
exactly the relational key to understanding Csness.
<br />
<br />What is the limit of us, or any system for that matter, to wholistically
<br />
'experience itself'.   That was the opening concept notion I put forth
<br />
in Understanding the Integral Universe.  &quot;Imagine youself floating
<br />
totally alone in a lightless, energyless universe, with no external
<br />
anything - to gauge anything by. Not motion not anything. ...&quot; 
<br />
&quot;What purpose would consciousness serve?  .. It wouldn't. Consciousness
<br />
is only of utile value in situations where self encounters else.&quot;
<br />
<br />I keep on that track of logic for a while, parsing away until
<br />
concluding that anykind of 'response' can be embraced as a
<br />
'primitive consciousness' - no matter that its not
<br />
complex or re-reportable/transmittable/sharable.  But it's
<br />
at that extreme, that I conclude that any holistic system,
<br />
even if minimalized in complexness of architecture, can
<br />
be projected to be holistically self-sensitive in an
<br />
information disseminational way.  That the formative 
<br />
entity: spacetime - it already presumed non-discontinuous.
<br />
That continuousness is the stage for disseminated information,
<br />
where changes of time, motion, fields, forces, waves --
<br />
least action -- constitute a 'sharing' of change-information.
<br />
The Batesonian minimal'bit'.  Reliant on the smallest 
<br />
spacetime 'change' .. which is identifiable as some or 
<br />
any change-of-inertia event.
<br />
<br />[ok Bruno, I guess here is a good portion of what you were 
<br />
asking about].
<br />
<br />My main goal was this:  find a reasonable comprehension for
<br />
primitives that could develop into complexities - have a 
<br />
core foundation of simple 'relations' that -become- 
<br />
human/animal sentience.  Bridge the realms of physics
<br />
and biology, without breaking the known/presumed relations
<br />
already identified.
<br />
<br />Only I had to make one crucial change in definitions.
<br />
<br />The universe is not dichotomized nonliving/living.  It is
<br />
dichotomized preliving/living.  The qualia we find in 
<br />
living systems ARE PRESENT in pre-animate systems, only
<br />
they are there in simple basic preparatives forms.
<br />
<br />My favorite example being the valence shells of atoms.
<br />
These are relationally and effectively the &quot;lungs&quot; of 
<br />
an atom - able to fill (inhale) an electron, and 
<br />
unfill (exhale) an electron.  Do atoms actively 
<br />
flex these 'cavities' to capture/exude electrons?  No,
<br />
absolutely not. But life 'breathes', if and only if 
<br />
atoms chemically transfer electrons by moving them
<br />
into and out of valence shelled arrangements.  Life
<br />
'breathes' because atoms breathe.  Atoms aren't 
<br />
'alive', but we couldn't be either unless that
<br />
shared/similar function-relation was fundamentally 
<br />
there in the first place.
<br />
<br />The same goes for Csness.  The universe is a 
<br />
fundamentally pansentient organization with many
<br />
levels of sentient compleness and self-awareness.
<br />
We humans, are part of the sentient capacity of the
<br />
universe to 'understand itself'.  We aren't a separate
<br />
mentality exploring an &quot;it&quot; -- 'out there';  we ARE
<br />
a piece of the 'it' exploring the other parts of
<br />
the It.  We are the universe attempting to not
<br />
just experience itself, but to understand itself - in 
<br />
a novel, different, available, way.
<br />
<br />Jamie
