<br />The reference to Susskind is a paper we discussed here back
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in Aug 2002, Disturbing Implications of a Cosmological Constant,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0208013">http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0208013</a> .  The authors argued that in current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cosmological models the universe dies a heat death and falls into a steady
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state of exponential expansion which goes on forever.  In that state,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum gravity fluctuations will eventually cause macroscopic objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to appear.  This is extremely rare but still with infinite time to work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with, every object will appear an infinite number of times.  That includes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disembodied brains, the so-called Boltzmann brains, as well as planets and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole universes.  But the smaller objects are vastly more common, hence it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is most likely that our experiences are due to us being a Boltzmann brain.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It isn't generally the case that given a non-zero probability of an event E
<br />
occurring per trial (or per unit time period), then as the number of trials
<br />
n approaches infinity the probability of E occurring approaches 1. For
<br />
example, if Pr(E) = 1/2^n, then even though Pr(E) is always non-zero, the
<br />
probability of ~E as n-&gt;inf is given by the infinite product of (1-1/2^n),
<br />
which converges to approximately 0.288788, not zero. So if the exponential
<br />
expansion is associated with a continuous decrease in the probability that
<br />
an event of interest will occur during a unit time period, that event may
<br />
still never occur given infinite time, even though at no point can the event
<br />
be said to be impossible.
<br />
<br />This has a few bad implications; one is that our perceptions should end
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and not continue (but they do continue) and another is that brains would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be just as likely to (falsely) remember chaotic universes as lawful ones
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (but we only remember lawful ones).  So this model is not considered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent with our experiences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Because they depend on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fluctuations of particles, Boltzmann brains would be more common in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; regions of high entropy than low entropy. If the universe had started
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; out in a state of high entropy, it would be more likely to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; populated by Boltzmann brains than life forms like us, which suggests
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that the entropy of our early universe had to be low. As a low-entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; initial state is unlikely, though, this also implies that there are a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; huge number of other universes out there that are unsuitable for us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think this reasoning makes sense, for two reasons.  First, even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though the universe did apparently start out in a low-entropy state,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hence giving an opportunity for non-Boltzmann (ie not disembodied)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brains like ours to form, still as argued above eventually it gets into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a high-entropy state and you then still have the problem of an infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of Boltzmann brains.  The choice then is between a universe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; starts high-entropy and has only Boltzmann brains, and one that starts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; low-entropy and has a finite number of &quot;normal&quot; brains and an infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of Boltzmann brains.  It's not clear that the latter choice really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explains and justifies why we are non-Boltzmann.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Second, even if so, as it says these ideas are usually applied in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context of multiverse theories, so there would be an infinite number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes, some starting in low entropy and some in high entropy states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again we would have an infinite number of Boltzmann brains in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse compared with only a finite number of non-Boltzmann brains,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so we haven't really explained why we find ourselves in one of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes which has normal non-Boltzmann brains.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would suggest two ways out of the dilemma.  The first is from physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One of the things I learned in my reading last night is that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model of an infinite expanding universe may not actually work.  This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so-called de Sitter state does not have a consistent quantum explanation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The theory suggests that the de Sitter state may be inherently unstable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and will somehow decay, perhaps by tunnelling into another vacuum state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This could happen fast enough that the total expected number of Boltzmann
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brains is finite, potentially resolving the paradox.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The other is from our measure-based reasoning.  For various reasons we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might argue that the measure of brains existing in the extremely far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future is less than that of brains existing today.  Such brains are much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; smaller spatially in comparison to the universe as a whole than our brains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are today, for one thing, so perhaps they deserve a lesser share of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe's total measure.  Also, the amount of information to specify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the location of such a brain in terms of Planck moments since the Big
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bang would be vastly greater than for brains like ours existing in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relative youth of the universe.  A measure concept related to information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might therefore reduce the measure of such brains to insignificance.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Another possibility is that Boltzmann Brains arising out of chaos are the
<br />
observer moments which associate to produce the first person appearance of
<br />
continuity of consciousness and an orderly universe. Binding together
<br />
observer moments thus generated is no more difficult than binding together
<br />
observer moments generated in other multiverse theories.
