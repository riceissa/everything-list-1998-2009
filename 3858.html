<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here's a simplified thought experiment that illustrates the issue. Two

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copies of the subject S, A and B, are asked to choose option 1 or option 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. If A chooses 1, S wins a TV (TV), otherise S wins a worse TV (TV2). If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B chooses 1, S wins a stereo, otherwise S wins TV. S prefers TV to TV2 to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stereo, but would rather have a TV and a stereo than two TVs. The copies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to choose without knowing whether they are A or B.
</em><br />
<br />OK, I understand now that the utilities below are the utilities for A
<br />
and B when S gets the various items.  So U(TV) is the utility for A for
<br />
S to get a TV, which is the same as the utility for B since they are
<br />
identical copies.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; According to my incorrect analysis, SSA would imply that you choose option 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2, because that gives you .5*U(TV2) + .5*U(TV) &gt; .5*U(TV) + .5*U(stereo) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since U(TV2) &gt; U(stereo). I argued that you should consider yourself A and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B simultaneously so you could rationally choose option 2, because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; U({TV,stereo}) &gt; U({TV2, TV}).
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that makes sense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However taking both SSA and game theory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into account implies that option 2 is rational. Furthermore, my earlier 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggestion leads to unintuitive results in general, when the two players 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do not share the same utility function.
</em><br />
<br />I know you meant to write that game theory implies that option 2 is
<br />
irrational.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The game theoretic analysis goes like this. There are two possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outcomes with pure strategies (I'll ignore mixed strategies for now). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Either A and B both choose 1, or they both choose 2. The first one is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nash equilibrium, the second may or may not be. To understand what this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means, suppose you are one of the players in this game (either A or B but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you don't know which) and you expect the other player to choose option 1. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then your expected utility if you choose option 1 is .5*U({TV,stereo}) + 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; .5*U({TV,stereo}). If you choose option 2, the expected utility is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; .5*U({TV2,stereo}) + .5*({TV,TV}) which is strictly less. So you have no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason not to choose option 1 if you expect the other player to choose 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; option 1. Whether or not the second possible outcome is also a Nash 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equilibrium depends on whether U({TV2,TV}) &gt; .5*U({TV2,stereo}) + 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; .5*({TV,TV}). But even if it is, the players can just coordinate ahead of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time (or implicitly) to choose option 1 and obtain the better equilibrium.
</em><br />
<br />If option 2 is also a Nash equilibrium, that is better than option 1,
<br />
right?  This is why option 2 was preferred under the first analysis.
<br />
However I see that under this reasoning there are utility assignments
<br />
which make option 1 be a Nash equilibrium while option 2 is not, hence
<br />
option 1 would be preferred in those cases, despite the earlier reasoning
<br />
which would choose option 2.
<br />
<br />I have a problem with this application of game theory to a situation where
<br />
A and B both know that they are going to choose the same thing, which I
<br />
believe is the case here.  Let me make this more specific by assuming that
<br />
A and B (and S) are deterministic computational systems.  Their needs
<br />
for randomness are met by an internal pseudo random number generator.
<br />
When S is duplicated to form A and B, the PRNG state is duplicated as
<br />
well, so that A and B are running exactly the same deterministic program.
<br />
<br />This is the situation which most sharply appeals to the intuition that A
<br />
and B should be thought of as &quot;the same person&quot;.  They are two instances
<br />
of the same deterministic calculation, with exactly the same steps being
<br />
executed for both.
<br />
<br />Under these circumstances, I don't see how considerations of Nash
<br />
equilibria can arise.  These require implicitly assuming that the other
<br />
side may choose a different value than yourself.  But with the setup I
<br />
give, it is physically impossible for that to happen.  The other player
<br />
has no more freedom to behave differently than does an image in a mirror.
<br />
<br />Likewise with the amnesiac prisoner's dilemma, if the amnesia is provided
<br />
in the manner I have described, so that both parties are running exactly
<br />
the same program and both know that they are doing so, it seems perfectly
<br />
reasonable to choose to cooperate.  There are actually fewer degrees
<br />
of freedom than the game matrix implies; only two possible outcomes,
<br />
rather than four.  And the best of the two possible outcomes is when
<br />
both parties cooperate rather than defect.
<br />
<br />This approach suggests a question with regard to the causal interpretation
<br />
of Newcomb's paradox.  First, as something of a digression, suppose
<br />
it turns out that the experimenter's eerie accuracy in the Newcomb
<br />
setup is because he has a time machine.  After the subject's decision
<br />
is made to choose one or two boxes, the experimenter goes back in time
<br />
and fills the boxes appropriately.  In this case, it seems to me that
<br />
the causalist may decide that taking one box is the preferred outcome,
<br />
because his choice does *cause* the filling of the boxes.  The effect
<br />
takes place earlier in time, but given that there is a time machine in
<br />
the picture, we have to accept reversed causality.  OTOH the causalist may
<br />
reject this reasoning, arguing along his usual lines that the boxes have
<br />
already been filled, and taking two has to give him more than taking one.
<br />
I don't know which conclusion he would choose.
<br />
<br />But more relevantly, suppose that the experimenter's secret is as
<br />
follows.  Let the subject be a deterministic computational system as in
<br />
the APD and other examples above.  What the experimenter does is to run
<br />
the computation forward until it makes a choice.  Then he rewinds the
<br />
computation to the state it was in at the beginning, and fills the boxes.
<br />
Now he runs the computation forward again, where it will make the same
<br />
decision (being deterministic) and so the &quot;prediction&quot; is always correct.
<br />
<br />Of course, this description is not much different from standard variants
<br />
where the experimenter is an alien with a perfect grasp of human
<br />
psychology, or God, able to predict with perfection what people will do.
<br />
But by making it concrete in terms of deterministic computations, it
<br />
allows for a different view from the causal perspective.
<br />
<br />Specifically, when the subject is asked to make his decision, he knows
<br />
that he will be put into this state twice; once when the experimenter
<br />
was running him to find out what he'd do, and again when the actual
<br />
choice was made.  From the point of view of shared minds, the subject
<br />
must view himself as being in a superposition of these two states.
<br />
<br />The point is that in one of those two states, his decision does in
<br />
fact have a causal effect on the outcome.  It is the direct effect of
<br />
his decision that lets the experimenter fill the boxes.  So from his
<br />
subjective perspective, where he doesn't know if this is the first or
<br />
second run, he can at least figure that there is a 50% chance that his
<br />
decision has a causal effect on the outcome.  It seems to me that this
<br />
might be enough to justify choosing one box even from a causal analysis.
