Perhaps I can throw in a few thoughts here, partly in the hope I may learn
<br />
something from possible replies (or lack thereof!).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A very similar argument (&quot;rubbish universes&quot;) was put forward long ago
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against David Lewis's modal realism, and is discussed in his &quot;On the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plurality of worlds&quot;. As I understand it, Lewis's defence was that there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no &quot;measure&quot; in his concept of &quot;possible worlds&quot;, so it is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningful to make statements about which kinds of universe are &quot;more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely&quot; (given that there is an infinity of both lawful and law-like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds). This is not a defense which Tegmark can make, since he does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; require a measure (to give his thesis some anthropic content).
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand this last sentence - why couldn't he use the 'Lewisian
<br />
defence' if he wanted - it is the Anthropic Principle (or just logic) that
<br />
necessitates SAS's (in a many worlds context): our existence in a world that
<br />
is suitable for us is independent of the uncountability or otherwise of the
<br />
sets of suitable and unsuitable worlds, it seems to me. (Granted he does use
<br />
the 'm' word in talking about level 4 (and other level) universes, but I am
<br />
asking why he needs it to provide 'anthropic content'.)
<br />
<br />There are hints that it may be worth exploring fundamentally different
<br />
approaches to the White Rabbit problem when we consider that for Cantor the
<br />
set of all integers is the same 'size' as that of all the evens (not too
<br />
good on its own for deciding whether a randomly selected integer is likely
<br />
to come out odd or even); similarly for comparing the set of all reals
<br />
between 0 and 1000, and between 0 and 1. The standard response to this is
<br />
that one *cannot* select a real (or integer) in such circumstances - but in
<br />
the case of many worlds we *do* have a selection (the one we are in now), so
<br />
maybe there is more to be said than that of applying the Cantor approach to
<br />
real worlds, and also on random selection.
<br />
<br />I use the simple 'limit to infinity' approach to provide a potential
<br />
solution to the WR problem (see appendix of
<br />
<a href="http://www.physica.freeserve.co.uk/pa01.htm">http://www.physica.freeserve.co.uk/pa01.htm</a>) - Russell's paper is not
<br />
too dissimilar in this area, I think. This approach seems to cover at least
<br />
the 'countable' region (in Cantorian terms), and also addresses the above
<br />
problems (ie odd/even type questions etc). The key point in my philosophy
<br />
paper is that it is mathematics (and/or information theory) that is more
<br />
likely to map the objective distribution of types of worlds, compared to the
<br />
particular anthropic intuition that is implied by the WR challenge.
<br />
<br />A final musing on finite formal systems: I have always
<br />
considered formal systems to be a provisional 'best guess' (or *maybe* 2nd
<br />
best after the informational approach) for exploring the plenitude - but it
<br />
occurs to me that non-finitary formal systems (which could inter alia
<br />
encompass the reals) may match (say SAS-relevant) finite formal systems in
<br />
simplicity terms, if the (infinite-length) axioms themselves could be
<br />
algorithmically generated. This would lead to a kind of 'meta-formal-system'
<br />
approach. Just a passing thought...
