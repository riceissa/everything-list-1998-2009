<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dissipation, structures, the passage of time, and the possibility of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This cycle can and will repeat indefinitely.
</em><br />
<br />As usual, I am intensely skeptical. From the magnitudes of the 
<br />
calculations, not from a &quot;gut feel.&quot;
<br />
<br />The gedankenexperiment of all the molecules in a box being found in one 
<br />
small volume/corner of the box is a classic textbook calculation. I 
<br />
haven't done the calcs in a long, long time, but it's fairly clear that 
<br />
even a mole-magnitude quantity of molecules might &quot;easily&quot; take some 
<br />
incredibly huge amount of time, something like 10^500 years, to 
<br />
&quot;randomly&quot; end up in a volume 1% as large as the box. (It might just as 
<br />
easily be 10^2000  years or more....6 x10^23 molecules bouncing around 
<br />
is hard to find in one region of the phase space.)
<br />
<br />How long before 10 moles find their way to a small part of the phase 
<br />
space? Or galactic-cloud-sized quantities?
<br />
<br />And biological structures with chemical reactions driven by 
<br />
concentration gradients on lipid layers...whew.
<br />
<br />I guarantee that the &quot;time for gas molecule-type recurrence&quot; is 
<br />
something like 10^10^10^10^10^10.....10 years.
<br />
<br />Now I realize that &quot;infinity&quot; is a much larger number than 
<br />
&quot;10^10^10^10^.....10 years,&quot; and so a Cantorian correspondence might 
<br />
suggest that &quot;it could happen.&quot;
<br />
<br />But in any finite chunk of time, no matter how large, my hunch is that 
<br />
the &quot;divergence&quot; issues utterly dominate. That is, in the first 100 
<br />
billion years of the universe's life after the stars all burn out (say, 
<br />
200 billion years from now), there still will not be a single instance 
<br />
anywhere in the universe where a mole of hydrogen in some reasonable 
<br />
volume (a thousand cubic kilometers, maybe) has &quot;fluctuated&quot; into an 
<br />
ordered state where the hydrogen is at much higher concentration.
<br />
<br />(This doesn't preclude bounces which reset to very dense states.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is, if we really assume that somehow this gas in the corner evolved
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life which then died out in the heat death of the universe, then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most likely path back into the corner is to evolve life backwards.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We would see the formless void of space begin to cluster together to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure.  That structure would include the pattern of dead life-forms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These life-forms would come to life, and they would live their lives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; backwards.  They would grow young and be un-born.  Each generation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be replaced by its ancestors.
</em><br />
<br />I don't claim to understand the physics of time asymmetry (despite the 
<br />
books I have read, including starting Huw Price's book recently, based 
<br />
on recommendations here), but this extension of billiard ball 
<br />
gedankenexperiments to &quot;living lives backwards&quot; is just too bizarre.
<br />
<br />So many chemical reactions, so many biological &quot;objects,&quot; so many issues 
<br />
of functional causality (as but one example, the heart pumping blood, 
<br />
enabling cell growth, etc.). To hypothesis that &quot;if we wait long enough, 
<br />
cells will randomly get smaller, will ungrow, causing reverse fluid flow 
<br />
to then cause the heart to beat backwards....&quot; (as but one of a vast 
<br />
number of examples...and this effect has to happen across all organisms 
<br />
in all places, else the Universe has not really &quot;unaged.&quot;
<br />
<br />If a mole quantity of hydrogen may take &quot;10^10^10^...10&quot; years just to 
<br />
get to a &quot;low entropy state, but not necessarily the same structure as 
<br />
before,&quot; then how long .... well, it ain't something I'll lose sleep 
<br />
over.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe it follows, then, that if we are living in such a Poincare
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recurrence, it is overwhelmingly likely that the universe did not really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; go all the way back to the Big Bang.  Rather, our past is an illusion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Time ran backwards far enough to form us; but among those recurrences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where we formed, the overwhelming majority of them don't have time go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; back much farther than that.  (My son is reading the Price book now and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; says that this idea goes back to Boltzmann, that our past is false and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe no older than us, if our experience are explained by such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a recurrence.)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Nietzsche had similar ideas of the &quot;eternal recurrence,&quot; circa 1870.
