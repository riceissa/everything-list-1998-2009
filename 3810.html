<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tim makes a very genuine remark (but he writes so much I fear that has

</em><br />
<br />True enough...I write a lot! (The old joke applies: &quot;I don't have enough 
<br />
time to write a short letter.&quot;)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; He said: read Tegmark (Everything paper), then learn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; category, then read again Tegmark.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I didn't actually say &quot;then learn category (theory). I said spend 
<br />
enough time looking at category theory to get the gist of what they are. 
<br />
A couple of days, for example.
<br />
<br />Reading styles differ, but I have come to favor the &quot;hawk spiral.&quot; I see 
<br />
hawks spiralling in the thermals near my house, and this is how I like 
<br />
to learn. I read something from one book, think, read from another, 
<br />
think, try to compare what the authors are saying, read from another, go 
<br />
back to the earlier book and read more, and so on. A helix, covering the 
<br />
same material many times.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed I would say category theory has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerged from the realisation that mathematical structures are themselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematically structured. Categorist applies the every-structure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for each structure. Take all groups, and all morphism between groups: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get the category of groups. It is one mathematical structure, a category
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (with objects = groups and arrows = homomorphism) which, in some sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capture the essence of group.
</em><br />
<br />Exactly. A very nice explanation.
<br />
<br />And much of what Tegmark outlines in his large chart can be dramatically 
<br />
simplified and abstracted. Crane, Baez, Dolan, and others call this the 
<br />
&quot;categorification&quot; process. Robert Geroch's textbook, &quot;Mathematical 
<br />
Physics,&quot; uses categories and functors throughout as a unifying (and 
<br />
intuition-increasing) tool.
<br />
<br />Hey, let me be very clear about something: I don't know what the 
<br />
categorification of Tegmark's ideas are!
<br />
<br />Categories and toposes are not a magic bullet.
<br />
<br />But I know that gettting lost in the swamps of mathematical structures 
<br />
is a real danger, and that mathematicians have found certain unifying 
<br />
symmetries, structures, parallels which simplify things dramatically. 
<br />
Category theory is a lot like finding metaphors and parallels. (We use 
<br />
the term &quot;isomorphism&quot; almost in everyday language, so the leap to all 
<br />
sorts of morphisms is not great.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Categories arises naturally when mathematician realised that many proofs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looks alike so that it is easier to abstract a new 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure-of-structures,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then makes proofs in it, then apply the abstract proof in each structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you want. So they define universal constructions in category (like the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;product&quot;), which will correspond automatically to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    - &quot;and&quot; in boolean algebra
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    - &quot;and&quot; in Heyting algebra
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    - group product in cat of groups
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    - topological product in cat of topological spaces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    - Lie product in cat of Lie groups, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So Category theory helps you to make a big economy of work ... once you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; invest in it, if you are using algebra. It saves your time.
</em><br />
<br />Exactly. Another good explanation here.
<br />
<br />And it's more than just a notational convenience. Proofs in one area, 
<br />
such as some branch of topology, can be transformed into proofs in other 
<br />
areas.
<br />
<br />(Aside: I believe this is a big part of what thinking is about: applying 
<br />
thoughts/concepts/morphisms/etc. from one area to another. Perhaps 
<br />
category theory will push AI in new ways. Perhaps the &quot;frame problem&quot; 
<br />
will be solvable with new tools.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, to come back to Tim remark, it hints that a giant part whole of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics is naturally mathematically structured, and this should be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taken
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into account.
</em><br />
<br />I first heard of category theory about 10 years ago. A friend of mine 
<br />
was working for a company in Palo Alto which was using category theory 
<br />
to model economic data bases (such as petroleum reserves, ports in 
<br />
different countries, etc. ...very probably CIA-related, now that I think 
<br />
about it). He didn't have the interest or insight to explain why 
<br />
category theory was so cool.
<br />
<br />I asked a mathematician friend of mine (Eric H., for Hal and WD) about 
<br />
it and he said it was about what mathematicians do when they draw 
<br />
diagrams on blackboards. It didn't sound very interesting. It sounded 
<br />
like some variant of denotational semantics.
<br />
<br />But when the light bulbs went off this spring, when I dug into the 
<br />
writings of Baez, Hillman, Markopoulou, and the books of Lawvere, Mac 
<br />
Lane (difficult), and others, I had a major epiphany, a real &quot;Ah ha!&quot; 
<br />
experience.
<br />
<br />Everything seemed directly related to problems which had fascinated me 
<br />
for decades. Some of these issues I hope I have hinted at here.
<br />
<br />It was almost as if category and topos theory had been invented just for 
<br />
me....an exaggeration, but it captures my sense of wonder. I haven't 
<br />
been this excited about a new area in more than a decade. I expect I'll 
<br />
be doing something in this area for at least the _next_ decade.
<br />
<br />My apologies if this explanation of enthusiasm is too personal for you 
<br />
the reader, but I think enthusiasm is a good thing.
