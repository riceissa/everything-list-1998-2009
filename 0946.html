<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not well-implemented (although here &quot;not well executed&quot; seem better).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	OK; I would say the computation was not implemented.
</em><br />
<br />Let me restate Marchal's example slightly, to avoid confusing talk of
<br />
&quot;demons&quot;.
<br />
<br />Suppose you have a Turing machine running a program which renders it
<br />
conscious.  However, the machine has a weak point in its design, which
<br />
causes occasional but rare intermittent failures.  During the failed
<br />
state, the machine executes randomly for a period of time, then the
<br />
failing part spontaneously corrects itself and the machine operates
<br />
correctly from then on.
<br />
<br />Marchal then asks us to suppose that on some particular run of this
<br />
machine, the failure occurs, but during that time the random operation
<br />
of the machine &quot;just happens&quot; to match exactly what the machine was
<br />
supposed to be doing anyway.
<br />
<br />I agree that during this time interval the machine cannot be considered
<br />
to handle counterfactuals correctly, hence the computation was not
<br />
implemented by that definition.  Had the inputs to the machine been
<br />
different, since the machine was behaving randomly there is no reason
<br />
to expect that it would have &quot;happened to&quot; performed correctly with
<br />
those inputs.
<br />
<br />(I would comment that it is astronomically unlikely that such an
<br />
event could occur for a long enough period of time to be perceptable.
<br />
Our brains are extremely complex, with billions of neurons that fire
<br />
thousands of times a second.  If the shortest period of time we can
<br />
perceive is maybe 1/20 of a second, that is still many billions of neural
<br />
firings.  The chances that we would get that many firings occuring at
<br />
random but with exactly the same timing that would have occured naturally
<br />
is astronomically small.  Any thought experiment which relies on such
<br />
an event should be mistrusted, because it is so far from our experience
<br />
and common sense.  In my opinion Maudlin's paradox is more relevant.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But remember that the UTM was well-implementing the brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And now I make the *Maudlin's move*:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	And I'll annul your alliterative argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Add a physically inactive piece such that, in the case of a change in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; neighborhood of the UTM, that physically inactive piece become active, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; act as an automated demon fixing instantaneously the UTM, in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; accidentally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; correct state let by the lucky cosmic rays.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (That that is possible is showned in Maudlin's paper).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	I take it that you mean that if the machine departs from it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normal sequence, a switch will be triggered to activate a backup machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think Maudlin's example used a false implementation, and I'm not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convinced that it could be done that way otherwise, but that's not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quickest route to debunk the argument so let's continue.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure I understand exactly what Marchal is proposing here.
<br />
He wants an automated demon to fix the UTM as soon as there is &quot;a change
<br />
in the neighborhood of the UTM&quot;.  What is this change which triggers
<br />
the fix?
<br />
<br />I don't believe he refers to the failure of the machine.  If his demon
<br />
fixed the machine as soon as it broke, it would simply not be broken
<br />
and would behave properly during the interval in question, so would
<br />
handle counterfactuals correctly.
<br />
<br />I think what he wants is that the demon watches the machine and if the
<br />
machine ever breaks AND behaves other than what it is supposed to by
<br />
its program and design, then it will be fixed.  So if the machine
<br />
randomly happens to follow the correct state transitions even while
<br />
broken, then the demon will not be activated and so the machine will
<br />
not need to get fixed.
<br />
<br />In the case of the example above, where the machine follows the correct
<br />
transitions &quot;by accident&quot; and then spontaneously fixes itself, the demon
<br />
is never active, and so the machine's actual activity is the same as
<br />
in the original state.
<br />
<br />Assuming this is the intention, we can dispense with the demon and replace
<br />
him by some repair circuit.  However if we consider how this circuit would
<br />
work, I want to note one thing.  How can the repair circuit know when the
<br />
machine is behaving incorrectly, as defined above?  Incorrect behavior is
<br />
defined as departure from what the machine is actually supposed to do.
<br />
But the only way to detect that is to calculate, either in advance or
<br />
while the program is running, what the machine is supposed to be doing.
<br />
<br />This means that we either have to be running a replay of a previously
<br />
instantiated computation, or we have to be running a second computation
<br />
in parallel with this one.  In either case we are not dealing with a
<br />
unique calculation where this UTM is the only case where the calculation
<br />
is instantiated.  The consciousness in question WILL BE or HAS BEEN
<br />
instantiated.  If &quot;I&quot; am that consciousness, there is no question in
<br />
this thought experiment about whether I will ever have the experience of
<br />
thinking the thoughts in question.  I do, I must.  The only question is
<br />
whether my thoughts are being instantiated in this particular run of this
<br />
particular machine.  I, as a thinker, could not tell the difference; it's
<br />
not like it would make the difference between my existence and my lack
<br />
of existence.  It would only affect how many times I am instantiated,
<br />
and as I have argued before, it is questionable to me whether this has
<br />
any subjective or objective effects.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now I tell you that there will be no change between t1 and t2 in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; neighborhood of the UTM, so that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; inactive demon remains inactive. Note that the whole setting is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; counterfactually correct and should, I think, be considered 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; well-implemented,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; because &quot;the correct-conterfactualness&quot; concern the alledged turing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emulability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the correct implemention (by construction) of the brain by the UTM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	OK, so you think the computation is implemented in this case.
</em><br />
<br />I believe, from what Jacques says below, that he also believes that
<br />
the computation is implemented in this case, and that the addition of
<br />
the repair circuit (or demon, as Marchal has it) would make the
<br />
system conscious.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So your &quot;correct implementation&quot; whatever it is, as far as it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Turing-emulable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; will fall in the Maudlin's trap, I think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; MORAL : You cannot associate consciousness to the physical activity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; supporting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a computation. (i.e. NOT SUP-PHYS)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	I think the key word here is 'activity'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	I don't go around using the term 'SUP-PHYS', but it seems that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what you mean by it is not what I mean by physical computationalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Whether or not a computation is implemented depends on the laws of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics and the initial conditions.  Equivalently, it depends on the laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of physics and the history of the system over time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	It is clear that in the two cases you described, the initial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conditions are *different*, and the history of the system is different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the first example there was no 'demon', while in the second example
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a 'demon' and it moves at the constant velocity of the system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	That's why the argument is a straw man.  Maybe (?) some people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once said that only objects that move in certain ways affect whether a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation is implemented and Maudlin countered that, but I never said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything like that.  For me a stationary object is still part of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system and it's perfectly OK if the computation depends on the position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and properties of that object.
</em><br />
<br />I think this is a logical answer, that the system with a repair circuit
<br />
would have different properties than a system without one, even if the
<br />
repair circuit is not activated.  Hence we can say that the system is
<br />
conscious with repair circuit and unconscious without, and not contradict
<br />
outself.
<br />
<br />Maudlin also accepts that this answer is possible, but he does offer some
<br />
critiques.
<br />
<br />To introduce them, let us sharpen the situation somewhat: we know that
<br />
the repair circuit is never activated.  Let us suppose that it is a rather
<br />
complicated circuit involving a robot which halts the TM, takes it
<br />
apart, repairs the machine, puts it back together, and allows it to
<br />
continue to run.
<br />
<br />Now Jacques has agreed, I think, that the existence of consciousness
<br />
between t1 and t2 depends on the existence of this robot.  If the robot
<br />
exists and can function properly, then the TM is conscious.  If the robot
<br />
does not exist or cannot function, then the TM is unconscious.
<br />
<br />The problem is that we can make the presence of consciousness in this
<br />
machine depend on some far-removed events.  For example, suppose that in
<br />
order to fix the machine the robot would have to order some new part.
<br />
Now suppose that, all the way around the world, there is a catastrophe
<br />
which makes the new part unavailable.  The robot would be unable to
<br />
complete his repairs, hence the machine becomes unconscious.
<br />
<br />Again, remember that the robot is never actually activated during this
<br />
time interval.  So intuitively it is hard to understand why an event
<br />
happening on the other side of the world would affect the consciousness
<br />
here and now of the machine.  But that is the position which we appear
<br />
to be forced to if we take this path.
<br />
<br />Here is what Maudlin says:
<br />
<br />&quot;The modern picture of brain function rests primarily on the notion
<br />
of neural activity.  The essential structure of mentation seems to be
<br />
founded in patterns of neural firings.  Because those firings can be
<br />
analyzed as carrying information, the brain has come to be considered
<br />
as an information processor.  So let us suppose that some time in
<br />
the future the electro-encephalograph is so perfected that it is
<br />
capable of recording the firing of every single neuron in the brain.
<br />
Suppose that researchers take two different surveys of a brain which
<br />
match exactly: the very same neurons fire at exactly the same rate
<br />
and in exactly the same pattern through a given period.  They infer
<br />
(as surely they should!) that the brain supported the same occurrent
<br />
conscious state through the two periods.  But the computationalist now
<br />
must raise a doubt.  Perhaps some synaptic connection has been severed
<br />
in the interim.  Not a synaptic connection of any of the neurons which
<br />
actually fired during either period, or which was in any way involved
<br />
in the activity recorded by the encephalograph.  Still, such a change in
<br />
connection will affect the counterfactuals true of the brain, and so can
<br />
affect the subjective state of awareness.  Indeed, the computationalist
<br />
will have to maintain that perhaps the person in question was conscious
<br />
through the first episode but not conscious at all through the second.
<br />
I admit to a great deal of mystification about the connection between mind
<br />
and body, but I see no reason to endorse such possibilities that directly
<br />
contradict all that we do know about brain process and experience.
<br />
<br />&quot;Whether the reason is enshrined in the supervenience thesis or not, our
<br />
general picture of the relation between physical and mental reality firmly
<br />
grounds the intuition that Olympia's [Olympia is Maudlin's name for his
<br />
pseudo-conscious TM - Hal] experience cannot be changed by the presence
<br />
or absence of the second set of blocks [these are blocks which interrupt
<br />
the operation of an extra circuit, like the repair circuit above - Hal].
<br />
These intuitions are not sacrosanct, but the computationalist especially
<br />
abandons them at his own risk.  For similar intuitions are often appealed
<br />
to in defending the appropriateness of computational analogies in the
<br />
first place.  One first step in arguments aimed at inducing assent to
<br />
the possibility of computers that can think, or feel, or intend, is
<br />
to imagine that some sort of prosthetic human neuron made of silicon
<br />
has been invented.  We are then to imagine slowly replacing some poor
<br />
sap's brain bit by bit until at last we have a silicon brain that, our
<br />
intuitions should inform us, can do all of the mental and intensional
<br />
work of the original.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is as yet a far cry from showing that anything has mental properties
<br />
in virtue of its computational structure, but it is supposed to break
<br />
down parochial species-chauvinistic views about there being any deep
<br />
connection between mentality and organic chemistry.  But the thought
<br />
experiment rests on a tacit appeal to supervenience.  How could it
<br />
matter, one asks, whether the electrical impulses are carried by neurons
<br />
or by doped silicon?  The implication is that mentality supervenes
<br />
only on the pattern of electrical or electrochemical activity.  If the
<br />
computationalist now must assert that the presence or absence of a piece
<br />
of metal hanging untouched and inert in the midst of silent, frozen
<br />
machinery can make the difference between being conscious and not, who
<br />
knows what enormous changes in psychical state may result from replacing
<br />
axons and dendrites with little copper wires?  Should the computationalist
<br />
reject the extremely general intuitions at play in assessing Olympia's
<br />
case, no means of judging the plausibility or implausibility of any
<br />
theory of mind seems to remain.&quot;
<br />
<br />Or, in my example, if a factory fire in India can affect whether a system
<br />
here and now is conscious, you are moving into a realm where intuitions
<br />
about consciousness become highly suspect.
