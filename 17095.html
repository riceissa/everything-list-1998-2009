Okay, I've reworked my views a bit based on the discussion thus far.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that the primary meaning of &quot;to exist&quot; is &quot;to be conscious&quot;.
<br />
<br />But what causes conscious experience? Well, I'm beginning to think
<br />
that nothing causes it. Our conscious experience is fundamental,
<br />
uncaused, and irreducible.
<br />
<br />Why do we think that our conscious experience must be caused? Maybe
<br />
this isn't a valid assumption. Maybe we are being led astray by the
<br />
apparent nature of the macroscopic material world that we perceive?
<br />
<br />So on the surface this view of consciousness as fundamental may sound
<br />
a bit off-putting, but I think it's not so radical compared to
<br />
competing theories.
<br />
<br />From a materialist perspective, what caused the universe (or
<br />
multiverse) to exist?
<br />
<br />From a religious perspective, what caused God to exist?
<br />
<br />From a platonic perspective, what caused the Numbers to exist?
<br />
<br />And, of course, if anyone offers an answer to the above, the obvious
<br />
next question would be &quot;what caused THAT to exist?&quot;.
<br />
<br />This drive to reduce our consciousness into smaller parts, I think is
<br />
maybe misguided.
<br />
<br />I think that there may be a problem with the idea that we must explain
<br />
conscious experience in terms of the things that we perceive, or
<br />
things that we infer from what we perceive. Consciousness is the
<br />
conduit through which we experience the world, BUT I think it's a
<br />
mistake to conclude that consciousness is a product of what is
<br />
experienced.
<br />
<br />Maybe consciousness is fundamental, uncaused, and irreducible.
<br />
However, what we are conscious OF is reducible and representable.  A
<br />
crucial difference.
<br />
<br />Take the brain. I haven't verified it myself, but I'm willing to
<br />
believe that the structure and function of the brain is closely
<br />
correlated with the mind. My brain represents the contents of my
<br />
conscious experience. The activity of the brain over time maps to the
<br />
the contents of my conscious experience over time. Fine. But the brain
<br />
is not the cause of my conscious experience. A brain is something that
<br />
one is conscious OF, and thus has a secondary, derivative type of
<br />
existence.
<br />
<br />I can think about my brain, so it is something that I am conscious of,
<br />
and so it exists in that sense. To the extent that I can examine and
<br />
experiment on someone else's brain, that is also a perceived
<br />
experience. But again, all of these things could happen in a dream, or
<br />
hallucination, or to a brain-in-a-vat, or to someone in a computer
<br />
simulation.
<br />
<br />That something is perceived is no guarantee that it has an existence
<br />
on par with, or superior to, that which does the perceiving.
<br />
<br />Similarly, science. I'm willing to believe that quantum mechanics and
<br />
relativity both describe my observations very well. But this is just
<br />
the fitting of various mathematical formulas and narratives to what we
<br />
are conscious of. There's no deeper meaning to science than that. It
<br />
doesn't tell us about what fundamentally exists. It provides us with
<br />
stories that fit what our experiences: &quot;IF you were made from
<br />
subatomic particles in a physical universe, THIS system of particles
<br />
and forces is consistent with your current observations.&quot;
<br />
<br />Science is basically us trying to make sense of a dream.
<br />
<br />So in this view, consciousness is very simple. What's complicated is
<br />
fitting &quot;explanatory&quot; scientific theories to what is observed, and
<br />
identifying and understanding causal structures (e.g., a brain, a
<br />
machine, whatever) whose evolving state can be interpreted as
<br />
representing a series of &quot;connected&quot; or &quot;related&quot; instances of
<br />
consciousness. But the observed physical system is NOT conscious, it
<br />
just represents the contents of someone's conscious experience.
<br />
<br />So initially this view seems somewhat...solipsistic (?), but
<br />
ultimately I think it really isn't much more radical than any other
<br />
theory on the table. For instance, any deterministic scientific theory
<br />
entails that we have the experience of making choices without making
<br />
actual choices (in the free will sense). And so does any
<br />
indeterminstic theory that is based on bottom-up causation.
<br />
<br />Beyond that, all theories eventually boil down to having to having to
<br />
take some set of fundamental entities and laws as unexplained,
<br />
unsupported brute facts. So whether it's one level down or twelve
<br />
levels down, at some point they end up saying &quot;and these things just
<br />
exist, created from nothing, supported by nothing&quot;.
<br />
<br />So, no matter which way we go, reality doesn't match our common-sense
<br />
expectations. I think this view makes the fewest assumptions, and
<br />
ultimately seems no more fantastical than any other theory on offer.
