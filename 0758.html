<br />Chris Maloney - the latest, and worst, addition to our little group.
<br />
<br />I have posted maybe five times. I mainly explain my own personal
<br />
theories. Unlike Chris, I haven't read any of the archived posts. None
<br />
of my posts have fit in with the regular discussions. Remember my idea
<br />
that all worlds branch or converge toward one future. Obviously
<br />
crackpot. How 'bout when I dropped time as a dimension. No one has
<br />
posted a response to anything I have written.
<br />
<br />I have been ignored. I posted ideas about the distant future being
<br />
determined or inevitable, and how that shapes the present, which got no
<br />
direct response.
<br />
<br />Quantumly speaking, we know the past is not determined until we observe
<br />
it, as is true of the future. There isn't merely one past. So we can
<br />
imagine the wave function of all possible worlds in the past. The wave
<br />
function is very wide first considering the immediate past, yet as we
<br />
look ever deeper into the past, all the many possible worlds we can
<br />
envision merge toward a single beginning, common to all paths, the Big
<br />
Bang. All possible worlds begin from or near a common single state.
<br />
Notice how that one inevitable distant past shapes what we observe about
<br />
the past. It shapes our present. It makes the background radiation
<br />
evenly distributed. It shows us one model of the past, not many
<br />
depending upon which direction we look, or on different days.
<br />
<br />The common origin of all quantum worlds makes our past consistent and
<br />
contributes to the flow of time being consistent. It radically narrows
<br />
the wave function, as related to what is possible to have happened. Now
<br />
look at the future. What is possible in the immediate future is also
<br />
wide. Consider that the set of all possible futures narrows toward a
<br />
single outcome, a single state, just like the past. Notice how that
<br />
single future would shape our world, our present, just as the single
<br />
state in our past shapes our world. Notice finally that if the past only
<br />
shaped the present, if the future didn't shape the present, then what is
<br />
possible; the wave function, would expand radically into chaotic
<br />
possibilities. Then, there would be no rational laws of nature.
<br />
<br />So anyway, I don't see why Chris gets to be denoted as the worst member
<br />
of this group. This is not fair. I mean, he shared something personal
<br />
but the topic clearly related to quantum immortality, and come on, it
<br />
was great reading. Damn, I thought it was an excerpt from a book or
<br />
something. It reminded me of Douglas Adams. Seriously Chris, I thought
<br />
it was too polished to be a post. You should consider publishing that
<br />
story, and I am not just saying that to redeem my position.
<br />
<br />On the issue of quantum suicide, there are factors to what is possible
<br />
in the branching paths of time that are not being discussed in this
<br />
group and that are simply not known at this time. A line from LeGuin,
<br />
&quot;The truth is that as a man's real power grows and his knowledge widens,
<br />
ever the way he can follow grows narrower; until at last he chooses
<br />
nothing, but does only and wholly what he must do...&quot;
<br />
<br />Again, the future is shaping the past, so it doesn't matter much what
<br />
course one maneuvers. We cannot escape the future. Eventually we collide
<br />
with the same problems, in this life or whatever follows, so we face and
<br />
eventually solve them. Its part of the process. We each are an evolving
<br />
universe. That's not meant to be positive. Its real.
<br />
<br />I didn't think your story was scary at all. It was real and fascinating,
<br />
sort of in the sense that fact is more fascinating than fiction. You see
<br />
I think already in different terms. If this group is centered upon
<br />
discussing an everything universe, and is going to do anything other
<br />
than regurgitate other peoples science and idea, it needs to confront
<br />
more vividly the issues surrounding timelessness and the meaning of an
<br />
infinite universe.
<br />
<br />Most people respond with fear and avoidance to the suicide option,
<br />
mainly from our common struggle to cope with the meaninglessness that
<br />
creeps into our lives. How does our response change if we factually know
<br />
that the observer exists beyond death? If this group was really
<br />
accomplishing something, it would be a place to exercise the mind in
<br />
different ways of seeing such things as real death, or suicide, from the
<br />
perspectives that result of MWs, or an anthropic universe, an observer
<br />
created reality, etc.
<br />
<br />Here is something I like to think about. There is no place where the
<br />
universe is not. If the observer is indeed a world in itself, then we
<br />
cannot stop existing. Its not a choice we have. Non-existence cannot be.
<br />
What we are, what we become, is ever changing, yet each observer
<br />
experience ends as another begins. That is true of every moment. We die
<br />
in the stillness of each moment and are constantly reborn into another.
<br />
<br />Now that is deep shit without direct mention of any science. And I have
<br />
spent hours writing my other posts, carefully explaining crackpot
<br />
theories that contradict much of what you guys discuss. I don't see why
<br />
Chris should get all the violent opposition.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, let me share other thoughts. I think there should
<br />
be a different title for those such as Einstein, Newton, Feynman and
<br />
Hawking, the explorers and creators of science, and the masses that
<br />
follow claiming also to be scientists, who in fact don't relate at all.
<br />
That's really not so much of an insult to anyone as one might think.
<br />
<br />Mainly, I think most in this group need to keep in mind a healthy dose
<br />
of reasonable doubt that we have all the major factors needed to
<br />
understand the shape of many worlds or of an ensemble or everything
<br />
theory. This shouldn't be a discussion place of sharply narrow issues
<br />
yet. Ideally this group needs a monitor that would keep discussions
<br />
civilized, open, and vibrant, to counteract individuals who desire to
<br />
squelch all but their own adherence and discipline.
