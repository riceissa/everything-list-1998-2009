<br />Well, an advocate of the pure RSSA approach might simply say that it's not a 
<br />
well-defined question to ask what the probability of one birth moment vs. 
<br />
another is, that it only makes sense to talk about the probability of 
<br />
different possible successors to your current OM. Also, if you accept 
<br />
absolute probabilities, conditional probabilities, and the immortality of 
<br />
all streams of consciousness as I do, then it seems to me a necessary 
<br />
consequence of this that streams of consciousness are neither created or 
<br />
destroyed, so there's no such thing as &quot;birth moments&quot; in your sense. In 
<br />
terms of the water tank analogy, if you want the amount of water in each 
<br />
tank to stay constant over time (no change in the absolute probabilities, 
<br />
since there's no time at the level of the multiverse as a whole), then if 
<br />
water molecules are not destroyed they can't be created either. As I said 
<br />
earlier, it seems to me if you want to believe both in immortality and the 
<br />
idea that your current OM is fairly typical (as suggested by the ASSA), you 
<br />
need some kind of &quot;immortality with amnesia&quot;--I suggested two ways that 
<br />
could work in that earlier post.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No, I'm not saying there is no &quot;next&quot; OM, my point was that the two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;methods
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can give different probabilities for my next OM--for example, a Jesse 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mazer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; OM and a Russell Standish OM might have about equal absolute measure, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; given my current OM, a Jesse Mazer OM would have much higher relative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, of course.
</em><br />
<br />OK, is that why you're saying the ASSA and RSSA are incompatible? But my 
<br />
point is that I think this incompatibility is removed if you always take the 
<br />
ASSA as applying to your current observer-moment, and the RSSA as applying 
<br />
to your next observer-moment. This may seem like nonsense because your 
<br />
&quot;next&quot; observer-moment will become &quot;current&quot; when you are experiencing it, 
<br />
but I don't think it is. Remember that the information available to you 
<br />
changes over time, you know nothing more than the content of your current 
<br />
observer-moment--in terms of the water-tank analogy, the molecules have no 
<br />
independent &quot;memory&quot; of where they've been in the past, they only know their 
<br />
current tank (the tank itself may have 'memories' of some sort, but they 
<br />
will be compatible with multiple possible past tanks). So suppose we 
<br />
calculate the absolute probability of different possible OMs being my &quot;next&quot; 
<br />
experience *without* taking into account specific knowledge of what my 
<br />
current OM is, by doing a sum over the absolute probability of each OM being 
<br />
my current experience multiplied by the conditional probability that that OM 
<br />
will be followed by the OM whose probability of being my &quot;next&quot; experience 
<br />
we want to calculate. If we just had 3 possible OMs labelled A, B, and C, 
<br />
then we'd do:
<br />
P(C is next) = P(A is current)*P(A -&gt; C) + P(B is current)*P(B -&gt; C) + P(C 
<br />
is current)*P(C -&gt; C). The condition I talked about earlier that there is no 
<br />
change in the absolute probabilities, that the level of water in each tank 
<br />
doesn't change because the water flowing out is balanced by the water 
<br />
flowing in, is equivalent to imposing the requirement that P(C is next) = 
<br />
P(C is current), which means that the vector of absolute probabilities must 
<br />
be an eigenvector of the matrix of conditional probabilities with eigenvalue 
<br />
1:
<br />
<br />P(A)*P(A -&gt; A) + P(B)*P(B -&gt; A) + P(C)*P(C -&gt; A) = P(A)
<br />
P(A)*P(A -&gt; B) + P(B)*P(B -&gt; B) + P(C)*P(C -&gt; B) = P(B)
<br />
P(A)*P(A -&gt; C) + P(B)*P(B -&gt; C) + P(C)*P(C -&gt; C) = P(C)
<br />
<br />This is the constraint that I think might help to determine a unique 
<br />
self-consistent probability distributions for both absolute and conditional 
<br />
probability, an idea I discussed in the &quot;Request for a glossary of acronyms&quot; 
<br />
thread. And if you impose this constraint, it means that if you calculate 
<br />
the probability of experiencing different possible OMs as your &quot;next&quot; 
<br />
experience without specific knowledge of what your &quot;current&quot; experience is, 
<br />
then the probability you get for having a given OM as your next experience 
<br />
is exactly the same as the absolute probability of that OM being your 
<br />
current experience. So this is why I think there is no incompatibility 
<br />
between the ASSA and the RSSA, if you define them in the way I do.
<br />
