&nbsp;You say that, I guess, because the &quot;activities of the neuron&quot; are
<br />
&nbsp;counterfactually correct (sensible to environment change). And the 
<br />
&nbsp;playback is only accidentally correct.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;The problem is the following one. As Maudlin has shown, you can
<br />
&nbsp;transform an accidentally correct computation into a counterfactually 
<br />
&nbsp;correct one WITHOUT adding any physical activity. (And this is what I do 
<br />
&nbsp;with the filmed graph argument, the *crackpot proof* in Mallah's term).
<br />
&nbsp;This make the attribution of consciousness to the &quot;physical recording&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;problematic.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I haven't read Maudlin proof but I can see that in the final analysis, 
<br />
consciousness seems to be a characteristic relative to the beholder. A 
<br />
self-referential perception.  Whether the events supporting consciousness are 
<br />
physically ordained, virtually ordained, in a movie or just accidental, as 
<br />
long as they appear to be, to the conscious entity itself, rationally 
<br />
connected between each other and to the consciousness itself (anthropic 
<br />
requirement), then that consciousness will exist at that level, be it 
<br />
physical, virtual, movie, or accidental. 
<br />
<br />Going beyond that, I think that consciousness is also level independent, just 
<br />
as it is playback independent or time share independent and here is why:
<br />
<br />Let's go back to the issue of consciousness implemented by a series of 
<br />
disconnected accidental events. In the context of the MW, most connections 
<br />
from one &quot;frame&quot; to another &quot;frame&quot; in the MW are accidental. However, we can 
<br />
only be aware of those frames that are linked by what appears to be rational 
<br />
links which support both consciousness and physical laws. Therefore, in a 
<br />
sense ALL EVENTS ARE ACCIDENTAL AND  CONSCIOUSNESS THRIVES IN THIS 
<br />
ENVIRONMENT.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
And you continue:
<br />
&lt;&lt;
<br />
&nbsp;But you should realize at this stage that consciousness
<br />
&nbsp;is no more linkable to the actual physical activities of the neurons.
<br />
&nbsp;Quite the contrary, it is the physical activities of the neurons (and of 
<br />
&nbsp;the stars BTW) wich emerges from the possible experience of consciousness.
<br />
&nbsp;The physical emerge from the computationnal, as kind of sharable dreams 
<br />
&nbsp;between rational (sure!) machines.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
&nbsp;I think I kind of agree with you, except that I see consciousness, 
<br />
rationality and physical laws as different aspects of the same underlying 
<br />
phenomenon having its root in the MW.  
<br />
<br />and you continue:
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt; Another way to make this more &quot;scientific&quot; is to take Church's thesis
<br />
seriously, to defined consciousness by something like the truth the 
<br />
machine can know (infer?) and cannot prove (a little child of Godelian 
<br />
Consistency), 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I don't think there is any Godelian truth about the real world we can infer 
<br />
but cannot prove. Maybe what you are saying is that the perception of 
<br />
consciousness is the perception of the self referential logical black hole 
<br />
(or blind spot) inferred by Godel, the source of logical uncertainty in the 
<br />
decision making process.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think the requirement for computationalism for the existence of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness is a red herring. The real requirement is rationality of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness as well as anthropic and rational constraints in the flow of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consecutive events. Computationalism and physical laws are derived from

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anthropic and rational constraints. (Maybe this is just a question of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;terminology, some of you may equate computationalism with rationality)
</em><br />
<br />Even without the comp hypothesis humans are (at least) Universal Turing
<br />
Machines. With comp we can look at things with a *Universal Turing 
<br />
Machine - tropic* constraint. We can introduce rationnality by 
<br />
restricting these machines with self-referential correctness, for 
<br />
exemple. And we can use logic
<br />
and computer science to study the possible discourse of these machines.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, I'm not sure rationality is necessary for consciousness. 
<br />
Well, it depends on the levels. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;GSLevy:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Similarly recording the activities of neurons and then playing them back 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;results in no consciousness at playback time but consciousness certainly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exists at recording time.
</em><br />
<br />You say that, I guess, because the &quot;activities of the neuron&quot; are
<br />
counterfactually correct (sensible to environment change). And the 
<br />
playback is only accidentally correct.
<br />
The problem is the following one. As Maudlin has shown, you can
<br />
transform an accidentally correct computation into a counterfactually 
<br />
correct one WITHOUT adding any physical activity. (And this is what I do 
<br />
with the filmed graph argument, the *crackpot proof* in Mallah's term).
<br />
This make the attribution of consciousness to the &quot;physical recording&quot;
<br />
problematic.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;GSL:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now lets make it more interesting and say that the playback machine is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implemented simply by rewinding the universe to some past state and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allowing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the same events to happen again.
</em><br />
<br />By taking the rewinding of the entire universe you got the situation of 
<br />
the dreaming brain, or any closed universal machine, and with comp this 
<br />
change nothing. But here you say:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;then in my opinion the two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness are actually one and the same because they view the world in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exactly the same way with the same rationality.
</em><br />
<br />And then you quote Hal and Jacques M Mallah:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hal:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(My solution is, as I said earlier, that the question isn't meaningful,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;because it is at best another iteration of an already-produced 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;calculation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and it doesn't matter if a conscious calculation is instantiated multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;times.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jacques: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I obviously reject that.
</em><br />
<br />And you say:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And this is the point where the idea of measure comes in.
</em><br />
<br />Well. I agree with you (if I understand you). In fact I agree with 
<br />
Hal when he says &lt;&lt;that the question isn't meaningful, because it is at 
<br />
best another iteration of an already-produced calculation&gt;&gt;
<br />
This is without doubt very important. It helps to explain the role of the 
<br />
depth of the computation (in Bennett sense). But I disagree with Hal when 
<br />
he adds:
<br />
&lt;&lt; and it doesn't matter if a conscious calculation is instantiated 
<br />
multiple times&gt;&gt;.
<br />
<br />In fact, it will matter in the case those computations can potentially 
<br />
diverge or (I still don't know) actually will diverge (in the UD*). In 
<br />
such a way a
<br />
*relative* measure will appears (and be completley defined in the limit). 
<br />
And consciousness depends here and now on this limit, because, as you say:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consciousness is playback independent and is also time independent. You 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implement it on a time share computer and it would not know the difference 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even if the active time intervals last one microsecond every billion years. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As long as the rational link between the time segments is maintained. 
</em><br />
<br />But you should realize at this stage that consciousness
<br />
is no more linkable to the actual physical activities of the neurons.
<br />
Quite the contrary, it is the physical activities of the neurons (and of 
<br />
the stars BTW) wich emerges from the possible experience of consciousness.
<br />
The physical emerge from the computationnal, as kind of sharable dreams 
<br />
between rational (sure!) machines.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This however is only my opinion. How to prove this and make scientific 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;predictions as Jacques demands can only be done if one is brave enough and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;willing to go through Tegmark's experiment. Eventually we will all have a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chance to do so and maybe Jacques will then be convinced :-). However if he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is right we won't be around to change our mind :-(
</em><br />
<br />Another way to make this more &quot;scientific&quot; is to take Church's thesis
<br />
seriously, to defined consciousness by something like the truth the 
<br />
machine can know (infer?) and cannot prove (a little child of Godelian 
<br />
Consistency), and then to use computer science to isolate and make 
<br />
precise the relative measure from which we can derive qualitative aspects 
<br />
of the physical world, like the MW aspect. And then compare with nature.
<br />
Immortality/MW are only one consequence among others of the hypothesis 
<br />
that we are Turing emulable.
<br />
<br />Bruno.
