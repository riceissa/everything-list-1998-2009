<br />
As a recent member of this list, I'm slowly getting up to
<br />
speed with all the reading material.  I've been reading the
<br />
archives of this list, and am up to about article 150 (out
<br />
of about 650!).  I'll refrain from posting on old discussions
<br />
until I've finished that, as perhaps the old issues I feel
<br />
the urge to post about have already been resolved.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, here are a few thoughts on Tegmark's paper.  This
<br />
is about 1/2 of the review that I'm writing on it (I always
<br />
review these sorts of things for my own purposes anyway).
<br />
<br />---------------
<br />
This was an excellent paper, which effectively explicated many of the
<br />
ideas I've been formulating over the last fourteen years.  The
<br />
fundamental principle put forth is the Principle of Plenitude, that
<br />
all mathematically consistent structures exist.  Basically, he makes
<br />
the statement that mathematical existence is the same as physical
<br />
existence.
<br />
<br />He introduces the acronym SAS (self-aware substructures) for
<br />
conscious entities within a mathematical structure.  This is fine by
<br />
me, but Sarah (my wife) didn't know what to say when I called her my 
<br />
favorite self-aware substructure.
<br />
<br />The initial defense of this basic principle is well presented.  He
<br />
presents four possibilities, the first three of which are lumped
<br />
together:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The physical world is completely mathematical
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Everything that exists mathematically exists physically
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Some things that exist mathematically exist physically,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others do not.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Nothing that exists mathematically exists physically
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The physical world is not completely mathematical
<br />
<br />There is not much that can be said about choice number 2, that the
<br />
physical world is not mathematical.  So this paper does not even
<br />
attempt to argue that point.  I, on the other hand, am going to have
<br />
to address it head on if I'm going to direct my book towards
<br />
non-scientists.  I think most non-scientists would not agree that the
<br />
world is mathematical.  I think that belief reduces to materialism,
<br />
versus mysticism.
<br />
<br />1c. can be dispensed with instantly, if you agree with Descartes that
<br />
&quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;.  I don't know if any philosophers have
<br />
seriously attempted to refute the existence of something.  I wouldn't
<br />
buy it, anyway.
<br />
<br />So that leaves the choice between 1a and 1b.  He asks the poignant
<br />
question which I've read elsewhere:  why would some possible
<br />
structures exist but not others?  The best defense along these lines
<br />
comes in his footnote number 16, where he describes that the entire
<br />
universe could be shown to be isomorphic to a small set of data that
<br />
describes its initial conditions and its mathematical laws.  This
<br />
data could probably fit on a CDROM.  Now, do you really need the
<br />
CDROM in order for that universe to exist?  I think he got this
<br />
argument from Physics of Immortality, by Tipler.
<br />
<br />Section II of the paper categorizes mathematical structures, thus
<br />
putting the phrase &quot;all logically possible universes&quot; on a firmer
<br />
footing. This presentation was concise and fun. Interestingly, he
<br />
doesn't even need to keep the idea that the mathematical structure be
<br />
free from contradiction.  Actually, and mathematical structure that
<br />
allows a contradiction immediately reduces to a trivial thing in
<br />
which all statements are provable theorems.
<br />
<br />He made one statement, that &quot;mathematical structures are 'emergent
<br />
concepts'&quot;, that I'm not sure I agree with.  I think that I probably
<br />
don't understand what he means by this statement, but it seems to me
<br />
that mathematical structures are fundamental.
