<br />I feel a strong ambiguity about the possible sense of

&quot;appearance&quot; here. Indeed, the universe *can* appear as a
<br />
mathematical object and it certainly does to at least a few
<br />
people (whether this appearance is correct or not and even
<br />
whether it is sound or not). Whatever sense you choose I
<br />
don't understand your point.

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - The multiverse is isomorphic to a mathematical object,

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you mean? I guess this: The multiverse is not a mathematical

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; object, but still  is describable by a mathematical object.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No. I mean that there is a one to one correspondance between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the &quot;components&quot; of the multiverse and those of a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical object and that this correspondance also maps the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;internal structures&quot; of the multiverse with those of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical object. &quot;Components&quot; and &quot;internal structures&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; should not be understood here as atoms or people or the like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but only &quot;at the most primitive level&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems that this is just a precise formulation of what I did 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand, except that I still don't know if you postulate the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of a physical universe.
</em><br />
<br />I do (in the context of these speculations) in a monist sense
<br />
which means I do not in a dualist sense (see below).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If not, what is the difference 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between being a physical object and being a mathematical object ?
</em><br />
<br />At the level of the whole universe (or multiverse) I don't see
<br />
any (and this is what I call a monist view in this context).
<br />
Everything else that appears to us as a &quot;physical object&quot; is
<br />
unlikely (possibly even electrons) to individually correspond
<br />
to a mathematical object. These (other) &quot;physical objects&quot; only
<br />
appear as such as (formally ill-defined) emerging properties.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *If* comp is true. I am not sure of that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Me too. But it is the theory I am studying. Also comp provides some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neat &quot;etalon philosophy&quot; to compare with other theories. The advantage 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of comp (which I recall includes Church thesis) is that, at least, many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental questions can be addressed.
</em><br />
<br />Which one for instance (that is not addressed in the view of
<br />
the universe/multiverse as a mathematical object)?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; But then: What is mind, what is matter, what is activity?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would say for all three: emerging properties that appear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as such when &quot;viewed from the inside&quot; of the universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All right, but then you should make clearer what you mean by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;universe&quot;. I do think like you that mind, matter, activity, ... are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerging from an inside view (actually it needs to be so once comp is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *postulated*),
</em><br />
<br />It also needs to be so once it is postulated that the universe
<br />
(or multiverse) is a (particular) mathematical object.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but at least with comp we can say more. Mind matter 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity arises from the collection of all the &quot;inside view&quot; (sometimes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refer too in terms of observer-moment in this list) which are all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implicitly defined in the Arithmetical Platonia.
</em><br />
<br />I do not see how this says more.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kronecker said: God created the natural numbers, all the rest has been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; invented by humans.
</em><br />
<br />If God did create the natural numbers, He did not have much
<br />
choice while doing so. Possibly so little choice that nothing
<br />
was left for Him to create. He could ne create them with the
<br />
Fermat's therorem being false for instance.
<br />
<br />Last but not least: time seems to be a *local* property
<br />
*within* a universe (there do not seem to exist a global time
<br />
within the universe and it it is even harder to imagine a time
<br />
outside of it). How can have He creat*ed* numbers, especially
<br />
if they are a requisite for a universe with a time flow to
<br />
exist?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But with comp you can say: God has created the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural numbers, all the rest has been invented by the natural numbers.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;From the &quot;mathematical object&quot; perspective, it can also be
<br />
argued that real numbers, Hilbert spaces, etc. also come with
<br />
natural numbers. God had not much (if nay) choice than men
<br />
about their properties.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course here &quot;God creates X&quot; means that we cannot even conceive how X 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could have appeared or have been created.
</em><br />
<br />I can conceive (yes, I can be wrong) of natural numbers (up
<br />
to Hilbert spaces and higher) as necessary beings by themselves.
<br />
&quot;... have appeared or have been created&quot; sounds to me like an
<br />
anthropomorphism. They just &quot;are&quot; in an intemporal sense and
<br />
questionning their appearance or creation is a nonsense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you postulating a physical universe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is an ill-formed question. The universe could be purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical and still appear as physical from the inside.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That what I think. By default I tend to use the expression &quot;physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe&quot; as a short form for &quot;Aristotelian physical universe&quot;, that is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one in which there is a primary matter, that is a notion of primitive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter which would not be reducible to anything else.
</em><br />
<br />I mentionned that these reflections questions the meaning that
<br />
&quot;physical existence&quot; may have. I agreed (and mentionned) that
<br />
the default sense did correspond to a dualist view (&quot;there
<br />
needs to be some special substance in particles&quot;, which seems
<br />
equivalent to what you call an &quot;Aristotelian physical universe&quot;).
<br />
But I also suggested that it could also have another sense
<br />
corresponding to a monist view. From the inside, both should
<br />
be undistinguishable (and that was my point, with in addition
<br />
Okham's razor in favor of monism). So I guess that you meant
<br />
that comp is incompatible with a physical universe in the dualist
<br />
sense but not it might not be with the monist sense. To your
<br />
question &quot;Are you postulating a physical universe?&quot; I would reply
<br />
&quot;No&quot; in the dualist sense and &quot;Yes&quot; in the monist sense.
<br />
<br />Georges.
