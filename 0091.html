<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think it's enough. In the outside view of AUH, there is a matter of fact

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about how any decision is made in each universe. How do you define the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effects of making any particular choice? WIthout AUH you can define the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effects of a choice as the set of events that would not have occured had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you not made that choice. But with AUH this definition no longer makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense, because there is no possible meta-universe where you do not make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any particular choice or make that choice with a different frequency or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure.
</em><br />
<br />Why can't there be any meta-universes where I make that choice with 
<br />
a different frequency or measure? 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I was assuming that by this time the copies have received some extra 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; differentiating information, however slight. One copy might have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; heard the sound &quot;alpha&quot; and the other &quot;beta&quot;. Then the one that has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; heard &quot;alpha&quot; could say to himself: &quot;The probability that the copy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; who heard alpha (me) will see heads when he opens his eyes is p.&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; However, I now realize that in principle, the copy could calculate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; whether it was the alpha-copy or the beta-copy that will see tail. So 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the probability would be 1 or 0 if the copy in question could compute 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this; but if there are practical limitations on his computational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; abilities then the above reasoning might still give the copy useful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probabilistic information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure i understand your setup here. Can you be more explicit about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how the &quot;alpha&quot; and &quot;beta&quot; fit into the situation that we're talking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about?
</em><br />
<br />Ok:
<br />
<br />At time 0 the experiment starts. At time 1 a coin is flippend and 
<br />
observerd by the experimenter. At time 2 a second coin is flipped 
<br />
(but not observerd by the experimenter). At time 3 the experimenter 
<br />
is duplicated iff both coins show heads.
<br />
<br />Now, I add the following feature:
<br />
<br />At time 3.5, everybody is showed a card with a different colour, 
<br />
randomly. (Say, one is showed a blue card, one a green card and one a 
<br />
red card.)
<br />
<br />At time 4, everybody is told the following: &quot;You exist at time 4. 
<br />
What is the probability that you will see the second coin showing 
<br />
heads when you open your eyes and observe it?&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br />So on the AUH, at time 4 there will be one guy, A, who remembers 
<br />
having seen (tail, tail); B remembers having seen (tail, heads); C 
<br />
(heads, tail); D(heads, heads) and E(heads, heads). In addition, each 
<br />
if these guys has seen a different colour. Hence, if a guy has seen 
<br />
yellow, he can meaningfully ask: &quot;What is the subjective probability 
<br />
(relative to my knowledge) that the guy who saw a yellow card will 
<br />
see heads when he opens his eyes?&quot;
<br />
<br />It is true that if this guy had unlimited processing power, then he 
<br />
could solve the theory of everything and deduce that with probability 
<br />
one or zero, the guy who say yellow will see heads. But if 
<br />
intellectual restrictions make this infeasible, he can make the 
<br />
following reasonable guess: &quot;The guy who saw yellow remembers having 
<br />
seen the first coin showed heads. There are three guys who remember 
<br />
having seen the first coin showed heads. Two of these will see the 
<br />
second coin showing heads when they open their eyes; the third won't. 
<br />
Since I don't have any other info that I know how to take into 
<br />
account, I estimate the subjective probability that the guy who saw 
<br />
yellow (i.e. me) will see the second coin showing heads is 2/3.
<br />
<br />This is one way in which the AUH, given my interpretation (with 
<br />
standard probability &amp; decision theory) gives a useful way of making 
<br />
predictions.
