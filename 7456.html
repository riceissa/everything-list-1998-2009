<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The idea that the earth is an orb is not counter intuitive even though 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the earth is flat locally. It counters no logical principles. The idea 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that particles can be in more than one place at the same time is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counter intuitive because it is a 'non local' fact - ie concerning 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things that are 'unseen' - , but because 'particle' is traditionally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined in a particular way which logically prohibits such a fact. Our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition is at fault, our intuition is sound.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If by counter intuitive you mean &quot;against logical principle&quot; I would 
<br />
agree with you. But I was using the term in the more general sense of 
<br />
contradicting some bets we usually do from our experiences.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Surely modern physics makes many counter intuitive,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but if you look at history you see that physicist take time to accept 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which counter intuitive idea should be accepted?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Either relatively to a theory we bet on, or simply when facts 
<br />
contradicts some of our believes so that we need to update or revise 
<br />
them.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That there are infinite universes existing beyond falsification? That 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibilities collapse into actuality on being looked at (again beyond 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; falsification)? Both fit the equations I am led to understand. I dont 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think either of these interpretations will be accepted for long.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I guess here we differ a lot and that we will need to discuss a lot. 
<br />
Now, as an applied logician, I am interested in truth but I believe I 
<br />
can only propose theories and interpretations of those theories. What I 
<br />
am sure of is that if the computationalist hypothesis is correct in 
<br />
cognitive science then the notion of universe(s) is not a primitive 
<br />
one. Physical reality emerges from a measure on all possible 
<br />
computations, and this is closer to many universes than just one 
<br />
universe. In this list many agree that all consistent realities exist 
<br />
in less demanding than accepting anyone particular reality. Then we are 
<br />
confronted with the dragon problem.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think physicists continue to hope for a classical universe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; underlying and deterministically explaining quantum 'reality'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Some physicists are, but my &quot;poll&quot; inquest goes in the other direction, 
<br />
even if some minority try to go back to Newton. Now I don't care about 
<br />
numbers of people believing something. With my work you can deduce that 
<br />
newtonian physics implies the falsity of the comp hyp.
<br />
(But that is for later).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think Quantum mechanics is the first time in the history of science 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that truelly counter intuitive ideas, indeed illogical ideas, have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been presented and asked to be accepted. Unless someone can offer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another example.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I disagree, unless you mean &quot;non classically logical&quot; by &quot;non logical&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; '&gt;Like in classical logic. You can prove things without constructing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But logic proves validity, not truth.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Pure logic, but not apply logic in some field. Of course at some level, 
<br />
as we agree (I think), we always prove things relatively to a theory 
<br />
(made explicit or not).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We shouldnt assume there is any truth about a valid argument. We can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question the premises of a valid argument, and should do so if its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusions are as counter intuitive as those of the DH. But which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; premises are at fault?
</em><br />
<br /><br />We can reason like that, but to question the premisses, the 
<br />
counter-intuitive propositions should be close to total absurdity. As I 
<br />
said, most of the time &quot;counter-intuition&quot; is just &quot;the intuition&quot; of 
<br />
the other.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surely its the definition of 'typical' as having  birth ranks placed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the peak of a rising population count.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Isnt the DH an epistemological argument really?. Its about what to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expect might happen rather than what will happen. I can have no reason 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to say I am typical or untypical in my birth rank in this respect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; untill I know what the maximum count will be, and I shouldnt therefore 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use the DH to speculate about what the maximum count should be. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be resolutely agnostic about this.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. Nevertheless I think the DA is completely convincing once we 
<br />
accept some hypotheses. But all are in contradiction with both the comp 
<br />
hyp, or with some finite set of physical facts (like the five 
<br />
Stern-Gerlach experiment from which Julian Swinger quasi-derives the 
<br />
Quantum formalism).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'If the humans solve all &quot;human problems and prevent all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; risk of apocalypse, or build bunker for all citizens&quot; then the DH 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; entails we will all die for an unknown reason.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isnt there is a sense in which (in a constantly rising population) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyone in history could formulate the DH and come to the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusion, and looking back we can see their expectancy would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong. Over and over again the DH would predict doom soon, yet it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never comes. Inductively then, we shouldnt accept it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />A long time ago I have made the calculation. By taking the data (human 
<br />
population) from something like -125000 to 500 before C. I got a 
<br />
prediction of apocalypse between 1000 and 3000 after C. taking into 
<br />
account the data from -600000 to us makes just the prediction more 
<br />
precise. Yet I don't believe in the apocalypse, because I don't believe 
<br />
in the premisses of the DA. Nor am I sure of the population amount in 
<br />
the past.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (nor to be sure the idea of absolute self-sampling among humans, why 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not bacteria).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you mean that we should interpret the DH so that its reference 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; class can contain all types of organism, and kind of maximise the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; priors accordingly to temper the DH conclusion, then I think there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something in that. But I still prefer to just intuitively shrug it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; off.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think that is wise.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyhow, getting back to your papers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Im reading 'Mechanism And Personal Identity'. Its hard. You know ive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; got Perry's book on Personal Identity right here, and your paper is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lot harder than that.
</em><br />
<br /><br />&quot;Mechanism And Personal Identity&quot; is not the simplest paper and is a 
<br />
bit old.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The amount of formal logic is a little daunting for me, are there any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good summeries?
</em><br />
<br />I would suggest you read the step-by-step UDA in this very list. The 
<br />
links can be found here
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll maybe dig out 'Sane'.
</em><br />
<br />I regret the title!  But it is quite readable especially if you buy 
<br />
Smullyan's &quot;Forever Undecided&quot; which is a nice introduction to the 
<br />
logic G which axiomatizes completely (in some sense) what machine can 
<br />
prove above themselves.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Some on this list agrees
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physicality could be secondary and could or should emerge from some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relative or absolute measure on the set of &quot;Observer-Moments&quot;. '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Idealism? OMs being little bits of consciousness? If so, Im familier 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the idea, but not the dove tail argument for it.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Don't hesitate to comment it. Actually, for the first steps of the 
<br />
Universal Dovetailer Argument (UDA), the actual discussion, mainly 
<br />
between Stathis and Lee is quite interesting. To sum up: I agree 
<br />
completely with Stathis and I disagree completely with Lee :)
<br />
Next week (hopefully) I will be a little less busy and I intend to sum 
<br />
up some important point made by Stathis in logical form so that people 
<br />
interested will be able to see the relationship with the Godel Lob 
<br />
Logic G.  I will also  send a post to Lee to single out some 
<br />
contradiction, but I need some time. To be sure I do agree with Lee on 
<br />
some important point but they are irrelevant about the measure problem 
<br />
and about the fact that once we take the comp hyp seriously enough, 
<br />
physics just cannot be &quot;all there is&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; '&gt;As you see we dig deep: the primitive nature of nature is really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; where Aristotle opposed himself against Plato, and since 2300 years 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; most follows Aristotle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is that the argument here? Whether matter is an emergent property or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether it is a substrate?
</em><br />
<br /><br />In part.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'and since 2300 years most follows Aristotle.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Who did Kant follow? Didnt he argue quite powerfully for agnosticism 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. But since Kant, both Physics and Logics have made important 
<br />
progress. There are genuine new data.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Speak Soon hopefully.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This week I am very busy. I can still send short comments. You could 
<br />
read the UDA, or even just the first steps, or just read the 
<br />
Stathis/Lee discussion. The point, in a nutshell is the following: if 
<br />
we are digital machine then we are duplicable. Suppose I am &quot;read&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;annihilated&quot; here in Brussels, and suppose I will be reconstituted in 
<br />
Washington and Moscow (say). What can I predict about my future feeling 
<br />
or first person experience.
<br />
Lee says &quot;I will soon feel to be in Washington AND I will soon feel to 
<br />
be in Moscow&quot;
<br />
Stathis says &quot;I will soon feel to be in Washington OR I will soon feel 
<br />
to be in Washington&quot;.
<br />
Given that the question does not concern my body (3-person 
<br />
describable), but my mind (first person knowable), and given that, as 
<br />
Stathis has repeated many times, I cannot *feel* to be at two places at 
<br />
once, I find rather easy that it follows (from comp) that I must expect 
<br />
to feel either in W or in M. All this, I add for Lee, Independently of 
<br />
the fact that I consider my doppelganger to be &quot;me&quot; or not: the 
<br />
question here bears on immediate first person expectations.
<br />
<br />Looking forward to hear your comments,
<br />
<br />Bruno
