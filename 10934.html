<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  No need to add
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; metaphysics at this stage
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes there is. You need metaphysics to answer the question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of whether the existence-claims of mathematics shouldbe takne
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literally.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;Metaphysics&quot; is provided through the &quot;yes doctor&quot;,  which you have no 
<br />
choice not to take literally.
<br />
I mean you would not say &quot;yes&quot; to a doctor who tells you that you will 
<br />
survive the comp-substitution and then add: don't take this literally.
<br />
But even this is strictly speaking suppressed when defining the many 
<br />
notion of contingency and necessity from the intensional (modal) 
<br />
variant of the Godel Lob self-referential provability notions.
<br />
Recall the UDA and AUDA difference (AUDA =  Arithmetical UDA = lobian 
<br />
interview).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (nor at any other stage by the way, except
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the yes doctor, which I prefer to range in &quot;theology&quot; than in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;metaphysics&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is theology better-foudned as a discipline ?
</em><br />
<br />When done by rational theologians, like most of the greek one, it is. 
<br />
Of course in our civilization &quot;theology&quot; has been appropriated by 
<br />
&quot;politics&quot; since a long time. Still many Christian theologians have 
<br />
been &quot;rigorous&quot; or &quot;modest&quot; or &quot;scientific&quot; since, but are generally 
<br />
put on the margins, if not burned alive or ignored. Today the 
<br />
aristotelian primary matter hypothesis is defended by the atheist and 
<br />
the Christian, mainly.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And Sherlock Holmes lives because Sherlock Holmes lives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at 221b Baker Street.
</em><br />
<br />Really? Could you give me his phone number please? I will verify.
<br />
Come on Peter, this is a diversion which has nothing to do with the 
<br />
notion of existence of numbers.
<br />
You refer to possibly interesting nuances, but those are out of topics 
<br />
here.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Arithmetical statements use the word &quot;exists&quot;, or the symbolic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; euivalen thereof. However, it is not to be taken literally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in all contexts.
</em><br />
<br />I don't care. The point is that with comp, the existence of an 
<br />
electron, or of anything, cannot be taken literally too. The point is 
<br />
that with comp you can derive from PEANO, why numbers have to believe 
<br />
in electron, although electron existence is less literal than the 
<br />
existence of 417.
<br />
You keep doing the 1004 fallacy. The question are not metaphysical at 
<br />
all, and does not address any notion of metaphysical existence in which 
<br />
I am not interested at all. The point is that the computationalist 
<br />
hypothesis generates many different notion of existence, and the 
<br />
interesting thing to do (with respect of explaining quanta, qualia, 
<br />
where do we come from etc.) consists in finding the relation between 
<br />
those form of existence, not some intrinsic meaning that they would 
<br />
have.
<br />
Now the simplest notion of existence is the standard interpretation of 
<br />
&quot;Ex&quot; in first order logic presentation of arithmetic, if only to begin 
<br />
with. All other notion of existence (psychological, physical, 
<br />
theological, etc.) are derived from it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Necessary truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; can exist in  a world of contingent existence -- providing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; all necessary truths in such a world are ontologically non-commital.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I don't understand.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If necessary truths don't refer to contingently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existing things, they cannot be &quot;infected&quot; by their contingency.
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand. A necessary truth could refer to contingently 
<br />
existing things. If you take (like we will do in the Lobian interview) 
<br />
&quot;provability B&quot; for &quot;necessity&quot;, and consistency D or &quot;possibility&quot;, 
<br />
Godel's second incompleteness theorem is already an example of 
<br />
necessity about contingencies: it is necessary that if a tautology is 
<br />
consistent then it is consistent that a falsity is necessary
<br />
G proves Dt-&gt;DBf, or G* proves B(Dt-&gt;DBf). Also B(Ex(x=x)) which is 
<br />
enough.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; AR does not ask you for believing in some metaphysical (still less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical) existence of numbers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then it does not show the UD exist, and it cannot follow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I part of its output.
</em><br />
<br />You should have written: &quot;Then it does not show the UD exists 
<br />
physically, and it cannot follow
<br />
that I am a physical part of its output.&quot;
<br />
And I agree with you given that I already do not believe you exist 
<br />
physically in any genuine (applicable) sense of the word (assuming 
<br />
comp). BTW I have already makes long answer of this, and you did not 
<br />
reply.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  It ask you to agree that a proposition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the type ExP(x) is true or false independently of any cognitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; faculty.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may well be true. It may well mean nothing more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than &quot;P(x) is non-contradictory&quot;
</em><br />
<br />No. ExP(x) means that it exist a natural number verifying the property 
<br />
P.
<br />
&quot;P(x) is non-contradictory&quot; is the proposition DP(x),or ~B~P(x), i.e. 
<br />
~Bew('P(x)') which is a completely different proposition. This one is 
<br />
even undecidable by *any* lobian machine.
<br />
Example: Bf is false but is also non-contradictory for any sound theory 
<br />
of arithmetic.
<br />
Contradictory
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Cognitive abilities are needed to believe or know that ExP(x)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is true (or false), but that's all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quite. So nothing in the argument can tell me about the nature of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence.
</em><br />
<br /><br />?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Pythagorean rationalist *must* believe mater
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is impossible -- the argument becomes inconsistent otherwise.
</em><br />
<br />Could you elaborate?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The argument that matter is &quot;useless&quot; is more akin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to empiricism than rationalism.
</em><br />
<br />I agree.
<br />
But don't see your point unless you believe I am not an empiricist, 
<br />
which of course I am, given that one of my main point in my PhD thesis 
<br />
is that comp is empirically testable.
<br />
True, sometimes some people believe that I am not empiricist because I 
<br />
show that if comp is correct the physics is entirely &quot;in our head&quot;. But 
<br />
I have never said that everything &quot;in our head&quot; should necessarily be 
<br />
taken for granted. We can and must, from comp, extract the physics 
<br />
which is in our head, and then compare it with the empirical physics, 
<br />
and so we can test comp. OK?
<br />
(Again this is something I have already explain, I repeat the 
<br />
explanation because I suspect others could still be confused, but I am 
<br />
not sure I will repeat this an infinity of times, if only because I 
<br />
will be more buzy. I will begin to concentrate myself on the 
<br />
presentation of the &quot;roadmap/hypostases&quot;.  This should help you to 
<br />
reevaluate more constructively your critics perhaps, imo.
