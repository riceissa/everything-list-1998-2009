<em class="quotelev1">&gt;RM: Are you suggesting that a fair analysis would be to wait until Google 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Print has the requisite number of books available, download the text, then

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sic Mathematica onto them to look for word associations linked with a

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;useless (though certainly do-able) exercise?
</em><br />
<br />I'm saying that you have to select the possible targets before you actually 
<br />
go mining the data of old stories to see what's there (or at least you have 
<br />
to try to imagine you didn't know what was there when selecting the 
<br />
targets). If your choice of targets is explicitly based on what you find in 
<br />
the data you will get bad probability estimates, for reasons I've already 
<br />
explained (you haven't really responded to these arguments in any 
<br />
substantive way--for example, do you agree or disagree that basing the 
<br />
choice of target on knowledge of the data tends to lead to situations where, 
<br />
even if the correlations are pure coincidence, 1 out of x parallel versions 
<br />
of you would claim to see a 'hit' with a significance of 1 out of y, where y 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; x?)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;. . . Would it be fair to test for ESP. . .
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We're not testing for ESP--only out-of-causal-order gestalts in popular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;literature that are associated with similar gestalts in literature (or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;national) events taking place at some future time.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I was using &quot;ESP&quot; as an umbrella term for any mysterious foreknowledge 
<br />
that can't be explained in terms of currently-known types of information 
<br />
channels. Substitute &quot;foreknowledge not explainable in terms of known 
<br />
science&quot; for &quot;ESP&quot; in that sentence (and any other sentence where I talk 
<br />
about 'ESP') if you like.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Or it might be explained by some of the more offbeat analytical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;procedures---say, involving exponential or Poisson probabilities as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;applied to delayed choice events.
</em><br />
<br />I know what &quot;delayed choice&quot; means in the context of QM, but what do you 
<br />
mean by &quot;applying&quot; exponential or Poisson probabilities to delayed choice? 
<br />
According to our current version of QM, it is possible to prove that delayed 
<br />
choice experiments cannot be used to send information backwards in time--are 
<br />
you suggesting a modification of QM, and if so, how exactly are &quot;exponential 
<br />
or Poisson probabilities&quot; involved?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Again, my concern is that scientists are too willing to prejudge 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;something before diving into it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;OK, but this is a tangent that has nothing to do with the issue I raised 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in my posts about the wrongness of selecting the target (whose probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of guessing you want to calculate) using hindsight knowledge of what was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;actually guessed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As a former fed, I would wholeheartedly disagree.  There is a grand 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tradition of avoiding analysis by whatever means are available, including 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;hindsight knowledge&quot; invalidating the correlation.  In other words, you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shouldn't ever mine for data.  Thankfully, that admonition is routinely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ignored by many biostatisticians.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not saying you should never mine the data, I'm just saying if you want 
<br />
to do an actual calculation of the probability that a correlation would 
<br />
happen by coincidence, you can't use this type of hindsight knowledge in 
<br />
selecting the target whose probability-of-happening-by-coincidence you want 
<br />
to calculate. I've given several examples of how this leads to badly wrong 
<br />
answers, and again, you haven't really addressed those examples.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  If you don't want to discuss this specific issue then say so--I am not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;really interested in discussing the larger issue of what the &quot;correct&quot; way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to calculate the probability of the Heinlein coincidences would be, I only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;wanted to talk about this specific way in which *your* method is obviously 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thank you. (Finally!!!)   Whew!   That sentence has validated the entire 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;horrid exercise.  May I quote you???
</em><br />
<br />Is this supposed to be validating your claim that scientists prejudge 
<br />
issues? Note that I'm not a scientist, and I'm also not prejudging things, 
<br />
I'm just saying I'd rather not discuss this right now, just because I 
<br />
personally am not that interested in it, and also because it's a distraction 
<br />
from the topic that I originally brought up. If I were to use your post as a 
<br />
jumping-off point to talk about some totally unrelated issue like the 
<br />
mechanics of cumulus cloud formation, and you were not that interested in 
<br />
talking about this issue and wanted to get back to the topics you were 
<br />
originally talking about, could I use that to validate my view that you are 
<br />
guilty of prejudging the facts of meteorology?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Like I said before, any method that could be invented by someone who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;didn't know in advance about Heinlein's story would avoid this particular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;mistake. . .
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;. . .another money quote. . .
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;*although it might suffer from other flaws*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This one too!!!
</em><br />
<br />Uh, are you trying to mock these quotes, or use them to support some 
<br />
&quot;prejudgments&quot; of your own about my psychology? If so, please come out and 
<br />
say what you mean.
<br />
