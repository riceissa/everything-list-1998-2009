Ben, here is a comment to Stathis's post which can serve as a 
<br />
preliminary for the synthesis I will try to do this week and which 
<br />
should answer some of your comments.
<br />
<br />Le 10-janv.-06, à 01:46, Stathis Papaioannou a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you remain true to the Greek roots of the words, atheists lack a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief in the existence of God, as agnostics lack knowledge of whether 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God exists: &quot;a-&quot; = without, &quot;theism&quot; = belief in God (by later 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convention, a personal God), &quot;gnosis&quot; = knowledge.  It is not quite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same as saying that God definitely does not exist, or that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge about the existence of God is impossible, respectively, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; although a few atheists and rather more agnostics would go on to make 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these stronger claims.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK but this is perhaps too much etymological and it could be confusing 
<br />
to use &quot;knowledge&quot; already in tis setting, unless we give already some 
<br />
minimal theory of belief and knowledge right at the start. Even in that 
<br />
case we are at risk to mix a too much precise notion of knowledge with 
<br />
a too much imprecise notion of God.
<br />
And if you look at the page referred too by Jesse, it seems that the 
<br />
more common acceptation for the meaning of &quot;agnostic&quot; is:  &quot;I don't 
<br />
know/believe if G exists or not&quot;, and for &quot;atheist&quot; it is: I 
<br />
think/belief that God does not exists. Nobody will say &quot;I know that God 
<br />
does not exist&quot;, because it seems ridiculous or too much arrogant.
<br />
Also, the idea that &quot;knowledge about the existence of God is 
<br />
impossible&quot; can indeed be defended by some atheist and agnostic, but is 
<br />
also the favourite affirmation of many mystical theists, including some 
<br />
Neoplatonist, but also some Buddhist.
<br />
<br />In any case, it will be useful to agree on some axioms for belief and 
<br />
knowledge:
<br />
I hope everyone will agree that both knowledge and belief makes the 
<br />
following formula true.
<br />
I assume a classical (platonist) background, and by &quot;p -&gt; q&quot; I mean 
<br />
that either p is false or q is true. It is the IF ... THEN ... of the 
<br />
classical mathematicians.
<br />
<br />B(p -&gt; q) -&gt; (Bp -&gt; Bq)     (named K, for Kripke)
<br />
<br />In &quot;French&quot;:  if I believe that (p -&gt; q) then if I belief p then I will 
<br />
belief q
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if I know that (p -&gt; q) then if I know p then I 
<br />
will know q.
<br />
<br />Note that this axioms is already criticised in some AI approaches to 
<br />
knowledge, because it gives rise to a form of omniscience. This is not 
<br />
a problem given that I will extract the measure on the comp histories 
<br />
from the limitation of that omniscience, and Bp is really more &quot;p is 
<br />
believable&quot; or &quot;p is knowable&quot; instead of &quot;believes&quot; or &quot;knows&quot;. Having 
<br />
said that, I hope people will agree with the following axioms, again 
<br />
both for *believability* and *knowability*:
<br />
<br />Bp -&gt; BBp          (named 4, by modal logicians, in honour of C.I. 
<br />
Lewis)
<br />
<br />In &quot;French&quot;:   if I believe p then I will believe that I believe p
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if I know p then I will know that I know p.
<br />
<br />In the classical background all classical tautologies are accepted, and 
<br />
I will suppose, at least in the beginning that the theories are closed 
<br />
for the rule of modus ponens and the rule of necessitation, and some 
<br />
substitution rules. The first one means that if I have already prove p 
<br />
and (p -&gt; q), I am entitled to derive q. The second one says that if I 
<br />
have already prove p then I am entitled to derive Bp.
<br />
<br />What does, then, distinguish knowledge and belief (or better 
<br />
knowability and believability)?
<br />
By definition we just cannot know something false. Nobody will say &quot;I 
<br />
knew that (a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2, but I was wrong&quot;. People say: &quot;I 
<br />
believed that (a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2, but I was wrong&quot;, and this is a 
<br />
symptom that the most basic distinction between knowledge and belief is 
<br />
that we just cannot know a falsity. Of course we can believe falsity 
<br />
(in dreams, in the state of error, or in trusting misfortunately some 
<br />
liar for example). So to get an (axiomatic) theory of knowledge it is 
<br />
enough to add the axioms Bp -&gt; p (either you don't know p or p is 
<br />
true).
<br />
<br />To sum up the (very standard) notions of believability and knowability 
<br />
are given by the theories K4 and KT4 respectively:
<br />
<br /><br />K4  (believability, or introspective belief):
<br />
<br />K  B(p -&gt; q) -&gt; (Bp -&gt; Bq)
<br />
4  Bp -&gt; BBp
<br />
+ rules of modus ponens, necessitation and substitution
<br />
<br /><br /><br />KT4 (better known as S4, it is the fourth modal system of C.I. Lewis, 
<br />
knowability or introspective knowledge):
<br />
<br />K  B(p -&gt; q) -&gt; (Bp -&gt; Bq)
<br />
T   Bp -&gt; p
<br />
4   Bp -&gt; BBp
<br />
+ rules of modus ponens, necessitation and substitution
<br />
<br /><br />Then I propose, if only for the sake of the discussion to define 
<br />
agnostic by the ~B~g &amp; ~Bg clause, letting open the question if B if 
<br />
for belief or knowledge.
<br />
<br /><br />Exercises for those who want (I am so sorry, but it will be useful for 
<br />
a latter deepening):
<br />
1) What is your feeling about formal provability by a consistent or 
<br />
even correct (sound) machine: I mean does it follows K4, KT4. Is formal 
<br />
provability closer to knowledge or to belief?  (This is tricky!)
<br />
2) Remember and explain to your children or husband/wife or parents 
<br />
what is a Kripke multiverse and what it means for a proposition to be 
<br />
true at a world in a *illuminated* multiverse and what it means to be 
<br />
valid in a multiverse.
<br />
3) Show that K is valid in all Kripke multiverse
<br />
4) Show that 4 is valid in all transitive multiverse
<br />
5) Show that T is valid in all reflexive mutltiverse
<br />
6) Show that modus ponens and necessitation preserves validity
<br />
7) if that seems hard, don't panic we will come back on this but train 
<br />
yourself to ask questions (after having (re)read the definitions 
<br />
perhaps).
