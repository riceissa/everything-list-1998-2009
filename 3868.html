<br /><br />Yes but remember the remark he made about the mouse being multiplied, not
<br />
the universe, at least not at once, but only at the speed of decoherence
<br />
(in modern talk).
<br />
<br />My own interpretation of QM is better described by &quot;Many-Worlds&quot;.
<br />
In particular I don't appreciate Albert-Loewer many-minds because they
<br />
are obliged to postulate the probabilities.
<br />
<br />Now David Deutsch use the comp hypothesis explicitly, and, unless I have
<br />
been wrong comp entails that the laws of physics originates from what the
<br />
consistent (immaterial) machines/programs/relative-numbers are able 
<br />
to anticipate correctly.
<br />
<br />There is no magic there, just &quot;Theoretical Artificial Intelligence&quot; +
<br />
some amount of arithmetical platonism. (Very well defended by David also).
<br />
<br />Mind object are just object like the game of Bridge, numbers, programs,
<br />
software, and plausibly quarks and gluons too ...
<br />
<br />I would say every sentences in FOR is compatible with comp, but most of
<br />
them are deducible from a deeper theory which is just number theory +
<br />
inside views captured by the logic of incompleteness phenomena and variants.
<br />
The main point is that with comp I don't see how such a move is avoidable.
<br />
<br />I will try to write a longer and clearer English paper.
<br />
<br /><br />I insist I am not a defender of the comp hypothesis. I am just telling to
<br />
those who believes in the comp hyp, that the mind body problem is, for them,
<br />
twice as much difficult than usually thought. This because with comp you need
<br />
not only to solve the qualia/consciousness problem but also the problem of the
<br />
origin of empirical laws. This is not obvious!
<br />
Then I show also that comp + modern math gives non trivial hints for both part.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Beside I thought you said your theory had nothing to do with QM,sounds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; alot like you are trying to give a interpretation to it to me?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I just show that with the comp hyp Physics need to redefined as the study
<br />
of a---hard to make precise (it's part of the MP problem)---measure on all
<br />
computations. In fact with comp we will redo all physical discoveries
<br />
in the reverse direction. Comp gives first a machine psychology then many
<br />
histories &quot;interpretation&quot;, then it should gives gravitations, then 
<br />
weak force, then eventually electro-magnetism ... (perhaps in ten 
<br />
centuries).
<br />
&nbsp;From the comp view the classical Poisson part of physics will be the hardest
<br />
part to derive., and then geometry ... (I speculate a little bit here but it
<br />
is to give an idea).
<br />
<br />Of course we can dig on the two sides: machine psychology (eternal
<br />
self reference logic and variants) and human evolving physics; why not?
<br />
<br /><br />Hoping you are not too much confused, (I am also confused!, but it is too
<br />
early to pretend comp refuted, and with comp the psycho/physico reversal is
<br />
not an idea: it is a theorem(*)).
<br />
Regards, Bruno
<br />
<br />(*) if someone find a flaw or even imprecisions I would be grateful
<br />
letting me know it. (links  <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html</a> )
