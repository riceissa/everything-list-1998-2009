</em><br />
<br />Because such a dichotomy (&quot;and theories that don't&quot;) means the logic is 
<br />
ipso facto modal. The very form tells us that a modal (and hence 
<br />
intuitionist) assumption is at work: &quot;If it were the case that the 
<br />
parallel postulate were valid, then...&quot; and &quot;Suppose the parallel 
<br />
postulate is not true, then...&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />If the Fifth Postulate is independent of the others, then within the 
<br />
framework of the other postulates one may have one &quot;branch&quot; where the 
<br />
Fifth holds (Euclidean Geometry) and another branch where it doesn't 
<br />
hold (all of the various non-Euclidean geometries).
<br />
<br />Now this turns out to be a not very important example, as various 
<br />
geometries with various geodesics on curved surfaces are sort of 
<br />
mundane. And the details were mostly worked out a hundred years ago, 
<br />
starting with Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevsky, Riemann, and continuing to 
<br />
Levi-Cevita, Ricci, and Cartan. The fact that by the mid-19th century we 
<br />
could _see_ clear examples of geometries which did not &quot;obey&quot; the 
<br />
parallel postulate, e.g., triangles drawn largely enough on a sphere, 
<br />
great circles, figures drawn on saddle surfaces and trumpet surfaces, 
<br />
etc., meant that most people didn't think much about the modal aspects. 
<br />
But they are certainly there.
<br />
<br />(I believe it's possible to cast differential geometry, including the 
<br />
parallel postulate or its negation, in topos terms. Anders Kock has done 
<br />
this with what he calls &quot;synthetic differential geometry,&quot; but I haven't 
<br />
read his papers (circa 1970-80), so i don't know if he discusses the 
<br />
parallel postulate explicitly.)
<br />
<br /><br />Both category theory and topos theory have been used to prove some 
<br />
important theorems (e.g., the Weyl Conjecture about a certain form of 
<br />
the Riemann zeta function, and the Cohen &quot;forcing&quot; proof of the 
<br />
independence of the Continuum Hypothesis from the Zermelo-Frenkel 
<br />
logical system), but it is misleading to think that either will give 
<br />
&quot;different results&quot; from conventional mathematics. It is not as if 
<br />
Fermat's Last Theorem is true in conventional logic or in conventional 
<br />
set theory but false in intuitionist logic or category theory.
<br />
<br />I'm going to have to slow down in my writing. You ask a lot of short 
<br />
questions, but these short questions need long answers. Or, perhaps, I 
<br />
feel the need to make a lot of explanations of terminology and 
<br />
motivations. I'll have to tune the length of my responses to the length 
<br />
of your questions, I think!
