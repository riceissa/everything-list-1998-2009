</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Comp is a short expression made for &quot;computationalism&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Computationalism, which I called also &quot;digital mechanism&quot; is Descartes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; related doctrine that we are digitalisable machine. I make it often
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; precise by defining comp to be the conjunction of Church Thesis and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;yes doctor&quot;. The &quot;yes doctor&quot; assumption is the bet that there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; level of description of yourself such that you would survive from some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; digital reconstruction of your body (the 3-person &quot;you&quot;) made at that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  From this I don't think it is entirely obvious that materialism (evn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; weak materialism, i.e. physicalism) fails.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Er... Actually I was wrong here. Physicalism is a strong version of 
<br />
materialism. By &quot;weak materialism&quot; I mean the doctrine that substance 
<br />
exists in some primary way. Higher Animals and Aristotelian thinkers 
<br />
tend to believe in it, plausibly for Darwinian reasons. The opposite 
<br />
doctrine is counterintuitive, sure, and appears with Pythagorus and 
<br />
Plato (in Occident).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Actually it is the main
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; point that I try to convey, and it is the object of the Universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Dovetailer Argument (UDA).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We don't have to postulate physical laws, if comp is true they have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; emerge on even a tiny fragment of arithmetical truth. The UDA is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; constructive (so, after UDA,  it still  could be that the shorter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; derivation of the physical laws from number is intrinsically not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; feasible). But then I show how computer science and mathematical paves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the way of an actual short (but complex) derivation of at least the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessity of a quantum computer as an invariant of all universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine neighborhood: this should provide a path from bit to qubits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The quantum uncertainty emerges from the fact that once a machine look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; at herself below her substitution level, she has to find trace of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; entire set of computations going through its actual relative comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sounds interesting.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Under my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; version, remember, the primatives are Physical,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But I don't follow you here. Even without comp I don't take the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;physical&quot; for granted. Science (including theology) appeared when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; human took some distance with &quot;naive realism&quot;, despite billions of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; year
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of evolution which programmed us to take seriously our local
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; neighborhood. But you can understand intellectually that the existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of primary matter asks for an act of faith.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see that the existence of the material world is any more or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less an act of faith than the existence of the mathematical world.  So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these same remarks could be applied to *comp*.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Comp asks indeed for an act of faith, as any theory in which we want to 
<br />
believe in. But my point, the UDA point, is that if comp is correct, 
<br />
all appearance of matter, including the observation of measurement 
<br />
devices, has to be explained by pure number theoretical relations. With 
<br />
comp, the act of faith in matter is just *useless*, like the vital 
<br />
principle in 19th century biology, or the phlogistic and things like 
<br />
that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Nobody has ever prove that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that exists, and the very old dream-metaphysical argument put a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasonable doubt that such a proof can vere been presented. Now, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; comp, I pretend that matter is devoid of any explanation power. Even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you postulate the existence of matter, you will not been able to use 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to justify any belief, be them on mind or even matter. But I let you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; study the UDA which is supposed to explain that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we need to draw a careful distinction between the *process* of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasoning itself, and the external entities that reasoning is *about*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *(ie what it is that our theories are externally referencing).  When
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you carefully examine what mathematics is all about, it seems that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is all about *knowledge* (justified belief).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't see that at all. As a &quot;natural number realist&quot; I would say that 
<br />
99,999... of arithmetical reality is independent of knowers and 
<br />
ofepistemologies.
<br />
With comp, knowledge applies only to sophisticated observer themselves 
<br />
described by universal (and immaterial) machines, those capable to hold 
<br />
beliefs and to justified them.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is because math
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appears to be the study of patterns and when meaning is ascribed to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these patterns, the result is knowledge.  So:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so Math &lt;----&gt; Meaningful Patterns &lt;--------&gt; Knowledge.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Math has a big role for discovering and communicating knowledge (with 
<br />
and without comp), but this does not make math equivalent with 
<br />
knowledge.
<br />
I define knowledge, of any entity, axiomatically by the modal logic S4.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since math appears to be equivalent to knowledge itself, it is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surprise that all explanations with real explanatory power must use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or indirectly reference) mathematics.  That is to say, I think it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true that the *process* of reasoning redcues to pure mathematics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, it does not follow that all the entities being *referenced*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (refered to) by mathematical theories, are themselves mathematical.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. Now my point is that IF we assume the comp hyp (even through 
<br />
the very weak form I am studying) then the simplest explanation of 
<br />
matter is that the appearance of matter emerge from the relations 
<br />
between numbers. You can still believe in primary matter, like you can 
<br />
still believe that car are pulled by invisible hourse, despite modern 
<br />
thermodynamic + Occam discourages this move.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It appears to me that to attempt to reduce everything to pure math
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; runs the risk of a lapse into pure Idealism, the idea that reality is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'mind created'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />First, science is not wishful thinking: if comp leads to solipsism, you 
<br />
can still abandon comp, but the scientific fact would remains.
<br />
Second, although it is true that comp + occam (even a weak form of 
<br />
occam) leads to idealism, it does not necessarily leads to solipsism, 
<br />
and there are good technical reason that it doesn't. Indeed matter 
<br />
itself stabilizes through the coherence of &quot;many dreams&quot; and the rise 
<br />
of a notion of first person plural perspectives. Reality is not &quot;mind 
<br />
created&quot;, but indeed with comp, physical reality is &quot;lobian machine&quot; 
<br />
constructed, as it should (cf UDA).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since math is all about knowledge, a successful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attempt to derive physics from math would appear to mean that there's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing external to 'mind' itself.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Just that it is unnecessary to postulate more than natural numbers, 
<br />
with their additive and multiplicative structure, at the ontological 
<br />
level. That is enough for explaining the appearance of an 
<br />
extraordinarily big and rich and lawful plenitude from the many inside 
<br />
views.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I said, there seems to be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slippery slipe into solipsism/idealism here.  That's why I'm highly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; skeptical of your UDA.
</em><br />
<br />That's a sane reaction, and that could perhaps explain why you don't 
<br />
even try to study it,  hmmm?
<br />
It is really up to you to tell me where in the reasoning you stop to 
<br />
follow the argument ....
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think both yourself (Bruno) and (and you Max Tegmark!) need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carefully think through consider the implications of your postulate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that all is math.
</em><br />
<br /><br />To be sure, I am not an entire mathematicalist. I have often criticize 
<br />
Tegmark on the fact that *mathematics&quot; is a too large term, and that 
<br />
such a notion is well beyond ... mathematics itself. But if comp is 
<br />
true, then with occam, the arithmetical structure (N, +, *) is largely 
<br />
enough to derive the physics of the lobian machine possible 
<br />
neighborhood. It is enough to compare the empirical world with that 
<br />
comp-physics to test the comp hyp. Up to now, the quantum facts does 
<br />
confirm comp. To be sure we need only a tiny part of arithmetical 
<br />
truth, for the ontic. Then, the whole cantorian paradise is already too 
<br />
little to understand the behavior of most machines ... (I can say more 
<br />
in my conversation with David).
