Sorry about the previous post... I did it from the the Google
<br />
list....something weird happened.
<br />
---------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Hi folks,
<br />
Re: How would a computer know if it were conscious?
<br />
<br />Easy.
<br />
<br />The computer would be able to go head to head with a human in a competition.
<br />
The competition?
<br />
Do science on exquisite novelty that neither party had encountered.
<br />
(More interesting: Make their life depend on getting it right. The
<br />
survivors are conscious).
<br />
<br />Only conscious entities can do open ended science on the exquisitely novel.
<br />
You cannot teach something how to deal with the exquisitely novel because
<br />
you haven't any experience of it to teach. It means that the entity must
<br />
be configurted as a machine that &quot;learns how to learn something&quot;. This is
<br />
one meta-level removed from your usual AI situation. It's what humans do.
<br />
During neogenesis and development, humans 'learn how to learn how to
<br />
learn&quot;.
<br />
<br />If the computer/scientist can match the human/scientist...it's as
<br />
conscious as a human. It must be.
<br />
<br />cheers
