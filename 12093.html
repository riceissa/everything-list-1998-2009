<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I certainly have a methodological problem with such an idea. This is

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; due to my motivation in the subject. I am searching an explanation of

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; godlike or not) seems to me to beg the question...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my view, your motivation is not large enough.  I am also motivated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by a problem: the problem of evil.  I don't think the real problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evil is solved or even really addressed with comp.  This is because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp cannot define evil correctly.  I will try to explain this more.


</em><br />
I agree that the problem of evil (and thus the equivalent problem of 
<br />
Good) is interesting. Of course it is not well addressed by the two 
<br />
current theories of everything: Loop gravity and String theory. With 
<br />
that respect the comp hyp can at least shed some light on it, and of 
<br />
course those &quot;light&quot; are of the platonic-plotinus type where the notion 
<br />
of goodness necessitates the notion of truth to begin with. I say more 
<br />
below.





<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Note also that the major critics by the neoplatonists on Aristotle,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; besides their diverging opinions on the nature of matter, is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; non-person character of the big unnameable, but then for Plotinus the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;second God&quot; (the second primary hypostase is &quot;personal&quot;), and indeed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; G* has a personal aspect from the point of view of the machine. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (comp agree) with Plotinus  that the big first cannot be a person. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; second one can. To be sure Plotinus is not always completely clear on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that point (especially on his chapter on free-will).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; None of Plotinus' hypostases are both personal and free from evil (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well as infinite, which we agree is needed (but not sufficient, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maintain!) for the problem of meaning).


</em><br />
It is a key point. I agree. None of Plotinus hypostases are both 
<br />
personal and free from &quot;evil/good&quot;. Finding an arithmetical 
<br />
interpretation of the hypostases could then give a hope toward an 
<br />
explanation of goodness and evil.
<br />
Please note that 7/8 of the hypostases are &quot;personal-views&quot;.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; An impersonal origin results in everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; finally being equal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Why? This reminds me Smullyan describing two possible reactions of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; human in front of the comp hyp:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1) The human does not trust himself and believes that machine are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; stupid at the start. His reaction about comp is: &quot;I am machine thus I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; am as stupid as a machine&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2) The human trust himself: his reaction with the comp hyp is &quot;Cute, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; means machine can be as nice as me&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where you can really see that numbers are impersonal is in the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they don't solve the problem of evil.


</em><br />
Why do you say that numbers are impersonal?
<br />
The scientific discourse, be it on numbers, machines, humans or Gods 
<br />
has to be impersonal, but it would be an error to infer from that 
<br />
numbers or machines or humans or gods are impersonal.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, Man is finite and cf
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sartre, Plato etc. is not a sufficient integration point within himself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for meaning.


</em><br />
Why? Recall that although comp makes the body finite, the 1-person 
<br />
cannot be conceived as such, at least by the 1-person eself.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But man, as a person, is also noble and cruel in his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship with himself and other persons.  With an impersonal core,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe/multiverse is totally silent in this area.


</em><br />
As it should be. But with comp there is no universe/multiverse in that 
<br />
sense. Comp generates truly, for logical and arithmetical reasons, a 
<br />
conception of a highly interconnected whole where the difference 
<br />
between appearances (psychological, physical, sensible, ...) comes from 
<br />
the many person-point of view. Only the arithmetical truth is 
<br />
0-personal, the seven other main hypostases are based on the notion of 
<br />
person, which, thanks to the incompleteness theorem can be defined 
<br />
through the modal nuances: p, Bp, Bp &amp; p, Bp &amp; Dp, Bp &amp; Dp &amp; p (viewed 
<br />
from G (3-communicable) and G* (3-inferable but non 1-communicable).


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impersonal core, Man's alienation with himself and other persons is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only because of chance.  With an impersonal core, man is simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statistically out of line with the rest of the universe.   With an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impersonal core, the only possible definition of &quot;right&quot; vs. &quot;wrong&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statistical (e.g. the average), and ultimately there is no difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between cruelty and non-cruelty.


</em><br />
Yes I can agree, but then you should be glad with comp, it explains 
<br />
that the impersonal arithmetical core can generate the many personal 
<br />
point of views.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  As Marquis de Sade said, &quot;What is, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right&quot;.

</em><br />
This is because Sade makes the utterly devastating confusion between 
<br />
mechanism and materialism. With comp Sade is probably the most 
<br />
inconsistent philosopher we can imagine. I think Sade was not 
<br />
completely unaware of that.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we were all tied to a computer which takes the average and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spits it out as the current definition of &quot;right&quot;, then after a while,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if it weren't for meaningless random fluctuations, it would filter into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a constant and we would all end up flat-lining.


</em><br />
You are talking like if we knew what computers are. With comp it can be 
<br />
explained that we do not know, can not known, and will never know. We 
<br />
are forced to be modest. You are talking like you feel to be superior 
<br />
to computer.
<br />
Actually the &quot;feeling to be superior&quot; is one of the main comp source of 
<br />
... evil.
<br />
Local competence can be measured and compared, but &quot;goodness&quot; &quot;evil&quot;, 
<br />
&quot;consciousness&quot;, etc. are not measurable nor comparable.We have to be 
<br />
humble and modest.




<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Impersonal+complexity does not produce personal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would like to see a proof of that statement. The comp first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; seems to me to be a counterexample, unless you assume at the start the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; negation of comp (and weaker-comp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; See above paragraph.  Impersonal+complexity produces something with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evil intrinsically in the mix, and no real solution can exist.  See
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; below for more on this.


</em><br />
I am not even sure I grasp what you mean by &quot;solution&quot; in this context.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; This is the problem Plato had.  He knew that you need absolutes in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; order to have meaning.  Plato's gods weren't big enough to be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of reference needed to define a person.  The gods and fates were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; continuously fighting one another.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You are right, but Plato did not know about Church thesis, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; incompleteness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I know you get some nice relative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; forms, G*/G and all that.  But in the end it is all meaningless.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You are quite quick here. Why would machine's beliefs and hopes be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; meaningless?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are talking about relative meaning, meaning relative to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine.


</em><br />
OK.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is why I said *in the end* it is all meaningless.


</em><br />
Why? You beg the point I think. At this stage of the development you 
<br />
could be right, but you could be wrong.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Meaning has to address evil and nobility.  See below.


</em><br />
Of course,  &quot;meaning&quot; has to address all sorts of meaning in any honest 
<br />
TOE, but meaning like consciousness has a relation with the belief in a 
<br />
reality, something utterly undecidable for the machine (it is of type 
<br />
&quot;Dt&quot; (consistency) if you remember modal logic).
<br />
The GOOD exists because you can choose the path and this actually means 
<br />
something because some path are better than other. For the same reason, 
<br />
the evil exists because some path are worst.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Satre pointed out, no finite point has any meaning without an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; reference point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I totally agree with Sartre's point here. Church thesis is exactly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; gives an absolute infinite reference point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, even saying for the sake of argument Church's Thesis gives an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absolute infinite reference point.  This is not sufficient for solving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the problem of evil.


</em><br />
By itself no.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When you change the language or reference frame
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from one machine to the other, suddenly evil (in one machine's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective) gets redefined.  This is the problem that happens for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example in marriage.  The two person's see each other as a machine in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an impersonal universe,



</em><br />
This sentence just show that you have prejudice against machine. I mean 
<br />
(forgetting 1500 years of confusion between state and religion, the 
<br />
abandon of rationality in theology, etc.) you are using the word 
<br />
&quot;machine&quot; in its pregodelian sense were a machine is a pure 3-person 
<br />
construct. Thus I have to insist that this view of machines has been 
<br />
shown to be mathematically wrong. Once a machine has enough 
<br />
introspection power (precisely once she can prove the p -&gt; Bp with p 
<br />
sigma_1), then I don't see why two machines cannot make marriage where 
<br />
they will see themselves in a personal universe.


<br />
You talk like Bruno (in Sylvie and Bruno, by Lewis Carroll).  He said 
<br />
once: &quot;A good thing is that I hate spinach, because if I did like 
<br />
spinach I would eat spinach, and that is really an idea I can't bear at 
<br />
all.





<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the cycle of &quot;I'm withholding love or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respect until I get love or respect from you&quot; starts and doesn't end...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; until at least one person makes the choice to tap into (and hold onto)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ultimate Person who provides the infinite source of unconditional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; love), resulting in the manifestation of nobility rather than cruelty.


</em><br />
I can agree with you here (it is even a bit Plotinian), but such 
<br />
thought have nothing to do with comp and mechanism.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Everything that there is is there.  But this is the ultimate in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; begging
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the question. The question remains, why is everything (I see) there?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Why do I exist?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We have to accept something, if only because we cannot explain prime
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; numbers without accepting the numbers, then comp explains why numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; talk like if they were sensible person, like if they were not numbers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; like if they believe in a physical reality and beyond.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And above all, G* explains why those beliefs are correct.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I can indeed sum up a part of the interview by: machine will correctly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; discover their unnameable self and G* will correctly prove that such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; self is not a machine from the first and third person point of view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My view is that, yes because of the limitations of finite systems, cf
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Godel incompleteness, certain things are unnameable *relative* to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system, BUT that this does not necessarily imply that the absolute core
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Everything has to be unnameable by anyone.  I claim that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absolute core of Everything is nameable by the core Himself, a Person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And He has told us His name: &quot;I AM THAT I AM&quot;.

</em><br />
I am that I am too. I guess you too.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He is infinite (we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not), and He is absolutely good and loving (we originally were and will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be).  More below.


</em><br />
Because we are finite we cannot know if he is absolutely good and 
<br />
loving although we can hope for that. This depends of the idea that 
<br />
your personal God is really the third hypostase (the first person, the 
<br />
all-soul, etc.), not the first 0-personal one.
<br />
(It looks we could have just a vocabulary problem ...)



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Relative truth is ultimately useless when it comes to the end of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree with you. It is really the discovery of Church thesis, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; introduces a lot of &quot;absoluteness&quot; in math (Godel found this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; miraculous) that I have begin to take &quot;mathematicalism&quot; seriously.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Great.  But again, because of the problem of evil, &quot;mathematicalism&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insufficient for a theory of absolutely Everything.  The linguistics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophers confine themselves to too small of a territory.


</em><br />
But after Godel, well in this case I should better refer to Tarski, 
<br />
mathematicalism is far richer than &quot;linguisticism&quot;. Many things are 
<br />
unnameable, and there is root for absolute unnameability.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I would paraphrase Brent Meeker and ask, &quot;Why does 'blind' have to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; default?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If &quot;non blindness&quot; is introduced as an hypothesis, it will prevent at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the start any possible impersonal (blind) explanation of &quot;vision&quot;. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; putting consciousness in the neuron for explaining consciousness in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; brain: this does not explain consciousness. Not only this does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explain consciousness, but it makes the search of an explanation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; almost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; impossible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it not possible that reality indeed has a definite personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; character, even at the core?

</em><br />
Recall that G* &quot;knows&quot; that the first and third person are equivalent. 
<br />
Only the first person and the third person cannot know it (but they can 
<br />
guess it, or hope for it, or fear it etc.). Just as a scientist 
<br />
interested in understanding what a person is, I prefer to build on the 
<br />
impersonal arithmetical truth instead of building from the third 
<br />
hypostase (the first person, the most personal of all &quot;divine&quot; 
<br />
hypostases). It is also mathematically much more easy.





<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If so, then if you start with impersonal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; blindness, i.e. &quot;Everything is random&quot; no matter how orderly is appears
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; locally,


</em><br />
But I would say that with comp (or BTW also with Everett quantum 
<br />
universal wave) nothing is random. Randomness belongs in the first 
<br />
person (plural) perception and measure ...





<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then you will never find the definite personal character of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe, because if you take this blind approach absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seriously you will always ignore order and character and personality as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic. (Actually nobody does that consistently.  See story at end.)


</em><br />
I criticize physicalism for being blind. Eliminative materialism even 
<br />
vindicates such blindness. I show such &quot;blindness&quot; is just 
<br />
mathematically incompatible with the comp hyp which begin to ask 
<br />
persons if they are open for changing their body (and thus showing for 
<br />
themselves that they are not equal to treir body).
<br />
Tom, your critics is fine for older, pregodelian, conception of 
<br />
mechanism. But those old conception just don't fit what we have learned 
<br />
since.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; My response to Bruno addresses the assumption of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; impersonality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm not convinced. The assumption of a personal God, like the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assumption of an impersonal physical universe, explains nothing. Imo.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It explains neither mind nor matter, nor ... God.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now, I have much more evidence---empirical and theoretical--- for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (probably impersonal and immaterial) God, than for a primitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; impersonal physical universe, which I take to be a locally useful FAPP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; superstition which does not resist reflection and introspection, as I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; try to illustrate with machine's introspection.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is more on the problem of evil:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we assume that there as been a continuous line of intrinsic evil in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe (as the impersonal core has to), then there is an unbroken
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; line between what man is now and what he has always been, i.e. man has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always had a thread of cruelty.  With this assumption, then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusion would have to be that of French thinker Charles Baudelaire,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;If there is a God, He is the Devil&quot;.  For example in (impersonal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pantheistic) Hinduism, there is constructive Vishnu and destructive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kali.  Also, Albert Camus noted that with such a core there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason to stand against evil, for instance in helping widows and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; orphans in Christianity, because evil is just part of the way things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsically are.  Finally, with such an impersonal core, with no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ultimately good personal God, there is no hope of a qualitative change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in man, since cruelty is intrinsic to the way man has always been.


</em><br />
I think you are begging the question. If man can discover that he has 
<br />
some intrinsic cruelty then there is hope that he can progress.
<br />
As a platonist I certainly believe in things like Goodness, Justice, 
<br />
Beauty etc. But they belongs to the type of unnameable things so that 
<br />
even just naming it can generate Evil, Injustice, Uglyness, etc.... 
<br />
(they can be taught though, for example  ... by examples).


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;later Heidegger&quot; saw that this assumption that &quot;man, the way he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is, is normal&quot; leads to a dead end.  However, his attempted solution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was only an epistemological solution.  He put the discontinuity at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Aristotle, and called man's problem an epistemological abnormality,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather than a moral one.  By &quot;moral&quot; I mean a rejection of our origin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the ultimately good Person.  (I don't mean that evolution is false.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mean *ultimate* origin.)  However, Heidegger's solution was not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sufficient, since he did not define evil correctly, since evil can only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be correctly defined with respect to a Personal core.  I maintain that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any impersonal core has this same instrinsic limitation.


</em><br />
I am with you. I would add all universal machines are with you, here. 
<br />
But this refers  to &quot;eliminative&quot; conception of the &quot;impersonal core&quot; 
<br />
(like with many form of materialism). As you know, globally, 
<br />
self-referentially correct machines are immune against materialism 
<br />
(globally only, alas)).


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Plato searched for a place to root his absolutes.  Neither Plator nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the neo-Platonists found the solution because their impersonal gods
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were not immune from evil.


</em><br />
With the neoplatonist I would say the contrary is true. Recall that 
<br />
Plotinus' ONE is also called the GOOD, and although he cannot think 
<br />
(because he is above that: we could  say he does not think because it 
<br />
has no reason to think) it is &quot;good&quot; in the sense it is a universal 
<br />
attractor for all souls. But Plotinus has been criticized because its 
<br />
good (its unnameable God) is too much immune from evil.

<br />
Of course Plotinus can answer by referring to THE Classical Platonist 
<br />
theory of EVIL: which is simply that EVIL = MATTER. Of course today 
<br />
this seems ridiculous. Yet only the &quot;Matter Hypo&quot;, in the arithmetical 
<br />
translation, have  Df, DDf, DDDf as true proposition, so I am open this 
<br />
could leads to a theory of &quot;evil&quot;. Indeed some &quot;qualia&quot; related to 
<br />
those propositions are judged &quot;painful&quot; by the UTM (in a sense which I 
<br />
can make more precise). Evil *begins* by pain, apparently.





<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The impersonal gods ultimately cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguish between man's finiteness and his cruelty.  Only the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite personal good God has a character from which evil is totally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; excluded.  This is the only core for which a solution to the real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem of evil is possible, so that everything can ultimately be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brought back into unity and wholeness.


</em><br />
Like 1Z I find strange to solve the problem of the existence of EVIL by 
<br />
postulating an infinite personal Gods from which evil is excluded, and 
<br />
what would that means?
<br />
I can understand that the presence of evil in our life can make us hope 
<br />
for a just God capable of constating the people we see suffering. But 
<br />
this could also be used for justifying evil on earth. Some could be 
<br />
less worried by doing evil once they believe that there is a good God 
<br />
who will consolate their victims ...
<br />
Like the idea of HELL which makes it impossible to distinguish between 
<br />
a good guy and a coward.
<br />
In french we say that the hell is paved with good intentions, and this 
<br />
looks like the Godelian: BDt -&gt; Bf.
<br />
Comp is probably consistent with the idea of a personal God, but then 
<br />
it has to remain ... personal. Evil results sometimes from the 
<br />
definition of &quot;good&quot; by others ...



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Finally, regarding the unsolvable dichotomy in the impersonal (closed)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; naturalistic system, ....

</em><br />
Remember that comp is incompatible with the idea of a closed impersonal 
<br />
naturalistic system ...


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; .... Francis Schaeffer tells the following story:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;I remember sitting in a Lyons' Corner House near Marble Arch in London
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some years ago, talking to a brilliant young physicist.  I asked him
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the latest work he was doing, and he told me about a new idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that he thought might solve Einstein's problem concerning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electromagnetism and gravity.  He became very enthusiastic about this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because I knew enough about the subject to stimulate him, and he was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far away in his thought.  Then I brought him back by saying, 'This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fine for the Christian, who really knows who he is, to say that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; material universe may finally be reduced to energy particles moving in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opposite directions in a vortex, but what about your naturalistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; colleagues?  What happens to them when they go home to their wives and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; families at night?'  He paused for a moment and then said, 'Oh, Dr.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schaeffer, they just have to live in a dichotomy.'&quot;


</em><br />
OK but such things last since more than 1500 years. Subject like 
<br />
&quot;evil&quot;, gods, etc. are not tackle scientifically, by which I just mean 
<br />
rationally and modestly.
<br />
The correct answer the &quot;brilliant young physicist&quot; should have given to 
<br />
Schaeffer should have been that they exist problems not yet solved by 
<br />
the electron-vortex theory (like the origin of the taste of coffee, or 
<br />
the evil problem, etc.).
<br />
It is a know fact that scientist, mainly scientist today, feels the 
<br />
need to provide answer to every question. We would have to live in a 
<br />
dichotomy if there was a dichotomy, and perhaps there is, but in our 
<br />
state of current knowledge, any definite opinion on those matters is no 
<br />
more convincing that any authoritative argument. Good science (and 
<br />
theology) mainly ask questions and good scientist (theologian) always 
<br />
doubt (should doubt) any proposed solution. But I know that even some 
<br />
recent pope have reiterate that doubting is evil (if not: encouraged by 
<br />
the devil). With comp it is the contrary: evil like madness is 
<br />
certainty. Doubting is sanity, and provides hopes toward truth and 
<br />
good, etc.
<br />
To be precise, the first person can have some certainties, but those 
<br />
are so deep that the first person will keep them silent. I mean the 
<br />
first person will not present those certainties as such.

<br />
