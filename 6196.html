<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Here is my definition: a decision I make is &quot;free&quot; when I feel that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have decided otherwise.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is the question of &quot;free will&quot; just a matter of definitions?  Definitional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;arguments are sterile and have no meaning.  If I define &quot;free will&quot; to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a 14 pound bowling ball, then there, I've proven that free will exists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But it's not a very useful approach.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is important to understand that there is more to the free will problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than just definitions.  Before trying to define away the problem, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;necessary to clearly state it and understand it.  The page I pointed to,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&lt;<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/</a>&gt;, goes on to do so in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the very next paragraph after the one I quoted:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: 1.5 The Free Will Problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: If we are to understand compatibilism as a solution to the free
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: will problem, it would be useful to have some sense of the problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: itself. Unfortunately, just as there is no single notion of free will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: that unifies all of the work philosophers have devoted to it, there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: no single specification of the free will problem. In fact, it might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: more helpful to think in terms of a range of problems. Regardless, any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: formulation of the problem can be understood as arising from a troubling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: sort of entanglement of our concepts, an entanglement that seems to lead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: to contradictions, and thus that cries out for a sort of disentangling. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: this regard, the free will problem is a classic philosophical problem;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: we are, it seems, committed in our thought and talk to a set of concepts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: which, under scrutiny, appear to comprise a mutually inconsistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: set. Formally, to settle the problem - to disentangle the set - we must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: either reject some concepts, or instead, we must demonstrate that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: set is indeed consistent despite its appearance to the contrary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: Just to illustrate, consider this set of propositions as an historically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: very well known means of formulating the free will problem. Call it the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: Classical Formulation:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;:  1. Some person (qua agent), at some time, could have acted otherwise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;:     than she did.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;:  2. Actions are events.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;:  3. Every event has a cause.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;:  4. If an event is caused, then it is causally determined.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;:  5. If an event is an act that is causally determined, then the agent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;:     of the act could not have acted otherwise than in the way that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;:     she did.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
This is more or less the point I was trying to make: philosophical 
<br />
discussion leads to &quot;a troubling entaglement that seems to lead to 
<br />
contradictions&quot;. I return to what I called a definition but I should 
<br />
probably have called a description of the basic phenomenon we are 
<br />
discussing:
<br />
<br />A decision I make is &quot;free&quot; when I feel that I could have decided otherwise.
<br />
<br />Is this OK as a starting point, before we start analysing what it all means, 
<br />
and regardless of what the ultimate conclusion is going to be? I'm not 
<br />
saying anything controversial yet; I'm simply describing under what 
<br />
circumstances I get this &quot;free will&quot; feeling, whatever that is.
<br />
<br />Now, a philosopher comes along and tells me that in fact, I am mistaken. I 
<br />
could not actually have decided otherwise, because my brain was following a 
<br />
script predetermined by the laws of physics. Or, just as bad, I could have 
<br />
&quot;decided&quot; otherwise, but it would have been due to random events in my 
<br />
brain, and thus it have no more been my &quot;decision&quot; than if I had been 
<br />
enslaved to the outcome of a coin toss.
<br />
<br />First, I might point out that the philosopher is putting words in my mouth. 
<br />
I never claimed that my cerebral decision-making processes were not random 
<br />
or not deterministic. All I claimed was that I get the free will feeling 
<br />
when I *feel* I could have decided otherwise. I may not know much about 
<br />
physics or philosophy, but I certainly know how I feel! If I learn that my 
<br />
brain is actually based on an old poker machine, that is interesting, but I 
<br />
still feel the way I feel.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, I might aknowledge that my feeling of freedom is not 
<br />
actually consistent with the particular interpretation of the term &quot;freedom&quot; 
<br />
the philosopher is trying to foist on me. In other words, if &quot;freedom&quot; means 
<br />
&quot;not bound by determinism or randomness&quot;, then I could not possibly be free, 
<br />
simply because there is no third alternative to determinism or randomness! 
<br />
In this case, I would have to admit that my &quot;free will&quot; feeling is something 
<br />
quite peculiar, with no correlate in the real world. Fine: let's say this is 
<br />
what it is. My subjective experience of free will remains unchanged, my 
<br />
behaviour remains unchanged, and my attitude towards other people (also 
<br />
exercising this strange, non-free, non-random, non-deterministic free will 
<br />
thing) remains unchanged.
