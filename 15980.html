<br /><br />1.1 Mechanist Philosophies
<br />
<br />1.1.1 Different types of Mechanism
<br />
<br />I distinguish the following mechanist hypotheses:
<br />
<br />BEHAVIOURIST MECHANISM
<br />
<br />Some machines can behave as thinking beings (living, conscious etc.)  
<br />
(BEH-MEC)
<br />
<br />STRONG MECHANISM
<br />
<br />Some machines can think (living beings, conscious beings, have a  
<br />
private life etc.) (STR-MEC)
<br />
<br />INDEXICAL MECHANISM
<br />
<br />I am a machine (or - you are a machine, or again - human beings are  
<br />
machines) (IND-MEC)
<br />
<br />By replacing &quot;machine&quot; by &quot;digital machine&quot; one obtains the  
<br />
corresponding digital theses.
<br />
<br />The behaviourist digital mechanism BEH-DIG-MEC corresponds largely to  
<br />
that of Turing in his 1950 article. In the same way, the strong  
<br />
digital mechanism STR-DIG-MEC corresponds to what is called in the  
<br />
literature the strong artificial intelligence thesis (strong AI).
<br />
<br />In this work I am exclusively interested in indexical and digital  
<br />
mechanism (IND-DIG-MEC or just IDM). &quot;Digitality&quot; necessitates  
<br />
Church's Thesis, which is why the digital aspect is explained in its  
<br />
turn in the second part. There, I will show how a procedure, due  
<br />
essentially to Goedel, permits an indexical treatment of machines in  
<br />
general.
<br />
<br />Proposition:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IND-MEC =&gt; STR-MEC =&gt; BEH-MEC, and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BEH-MEC ≠&gt; STR-MEC ≠&gt; IND-MEC.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(with or without the hypothesis of digitality)
<br />
<br /><br />Reasoning:  One admits that humans know how to think (conscious  
<br />
beings, having private lives etc.) In this case IND-MEC entails STR- 
<br />
MEC and STR-MEC entails BEH-MEC. That BEH-MEC does not entail STR-MEC  
<br />
is supported by Weizenbaum (1976) (see also Gunderson {footnote 1}  
<br />
1971). STR-MEC does not entail IND-MEC, since the fact that machines  
<br />
are able to think does not entail that they alone are able to think.  
<br />
It is conceivable that machines are able to think without we ourselves  
<br />
being machines. Wang (1974) presents a similar reasoning.  
<br />
Nevertheless, numerous philosophers make implicit use of an opposing  
<br />
opinion: STR-MEC =&gt; IND-MEC, see for example Arsac 1987.
<br />
<br />{Footnote 1: Gunderson 1971 criticises the Turing Test. The Turing  
<br />
Test is a test for BEH-MEC. Simply put, a machine (hidden) passes the  
<br />
test if it is able to pass itself off as a human being during a  
<br />
&quot;conversation&quot; by means of a computer keyboard terminal.}
<br />
<br />1.1.2 Mechanist Philosophy: Historical Summary
<br />
<br />Contemporary digital mechanist philosophy is due in large measure to  
<br />
Descartes and Hobbes {footnote 2} (see Rogow 1986, Bernhardt 1989).  
<br />
Descartes wanted to distinguish Man from the animals. He argues that  
<br />
the animal, as much as Man's body (including the brain), is a machine.  
<br />
He understood by this a finite assembly of of material components that  
<br />
unequivocally determine the behaviour of the whole. Descartes surmises  
<br />
that the soul is not mechanical. In separating the soul from the body  
<br />
in this way, and thus the mind from matter, he is the originator of  
<br />
the dualist position, widely encompassed by the philosophy of mind.  
<br />
One speaks of Cartesian Dualism.
<br />
<br />There follows three arguments that Descartes presented in favour of  
<br />
his distinction of man from the animal-as-machine (We note that this  
<br />
distinction entails the negation of IND-MEC.)
<br />
<br />{footnote 2: One can detect some mechanist affirmations or questions  
<br />
among (pre and post-Socratic, though not necessarily materialist)  
<br />
philosophers, from Greek antiquity (cf Timaeus and Plato, see also  
<br />
Odifreddi 1989). Among Chinese philosophers, for example Lao-Tzu, a  
<br />
certain monk is admired for having passed off his &quot;automated&quot; servants  
<br />
as flesh and blood beings. Among Hindu philosophers for example, in  
<br />
the &quot;Questions to the King Milinda&quot;, the human body is compared to the  
<br />
chariot, and the human mind is compared to the different parts of the  
<br />
chariot, similar to Hume's (1739) manner of tackling the problem of  
<br />
identity with his boat. The temptation to set up artefacts in the  
<br />
image of Man is also a component of several myths, (for ex. the Golem  
<br />
in Jewish culture, see for ex. Breton 1990). It is no exaggeration to  
<br />
maintain that the very idea of mechanism appears wherever and whenever  
<br />
machines themselves are developed.}
<br />
<br />1) Animals are not endowed with reason and cannot engage in linguistic  
<br />
communication
<br />
<br />This argument is losing credibility since language and reason seem  
<br />
more accessible to today's machines than for example, emotion which is  
<br />
communally allowed in the case of certain animals (see for ex. Lévy  
<br />
1987). Here Descartes takes Aristotle's position which asserts that  
<br />
Man is a &quot;reasoning animal&quot;.
<br />
<br />2) Machines are finite beings. A finite being cannot conceive of the  
<br />
infinite. Now, I am able (said Descartes) to conceive of the infinite.  
<br />
Thus I am not a machine.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument against IND-MEC brings into relief two fundamental  
<br />
questions:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Can man conceive of infinity?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Can a machine conceive of infinity?
<br />
<br />Question a) differentiates Hobbes' point of view from Descartes'.  
<br />
Hobbes surmises that he cannot in effect conceive of infinity.
<br />
<br />3) A machine can only carry out particular tasks, as it turns out,  
<br />
those tasks for which it was constructed. In effect, Descartes is  
<br />
saying:
<br />
<br />&quot;Since, in the case that reason is a universal instrument that  
<br />
participates in every sort of encounter, these organs need a certain  
<br />
particular disposition for each and every action; from this comes the  
<br />
idea that it is morally impossible that a machine might possess  
<br />
sufficient diversity such that it might act in every living occurrence  
<br />
in the same way that our reason assists our actions (Descartes,  
<br />
&quot;1953&quot;, page 165).
<br />
<br />The idea of a universal machine had nevertheless crossed the mind of  
<br />
Raymond Lulle (1302) whom Descartes had studied. This same idea will  
<br />
reappear with Leibnitz, culminating in the work of Turing, and this  
<br />
will be explained in the second part.
<br />
<br />La Mettrie will rehash Descartes' animal-as-machine for the purpose of  
<br />
extending it to Man (La Mettrie 1748, see also Gunderson 1971).
<br />
<br />In parallel with Descartes, Hobbes himself develops the mechanist  
<br />
hypothesis (Rogow 1986). On can date Hobbes' motivation toward  
<br />
mechanism from the time of his discovery of geometry. Having been  
<br />
particularly impressed by the fact that he might have been convinced  
<br />
by a *finite communication* based on logical geometrical reasoning,  
<br />
Hobbes conceives of the mechanistic character of thinking. He then  
<br />
thinks that it should be possible to reduce thinking to addition and  
<br />
subtraction. (see Webb 1980). He is thus very close to the  
<br />
*functionalist* position in the philosophy of mind: that the additions  
<br />
and multiplications might be realisable by a *telegraphic network* , a  
<br />
*hydraulic system*, an *electromagnetic device* , or even *a  
<br />
windmill*, a *catapult* or a *calculating device* (ordinateur), citing  
<br />
Searle's enumeration (Searle 1984). Thought is thereby reduced to  
<br />
operations not necessarily equipment-dependent, and to the constituent  
<br />
matter employed to realise these operations. La Mettrie, after his own  
<br />
fashion, argues in something like the same sense:
<br />
<br />&quot;Thus a Soul of mud, discovering in the twinkling of an eye, the  
<br />
relations and the consequences of an infinity of ideas difficult to  
<br />
conceive, would be preferable evidently to an ignorant and stupid  
<br />
Soul, which might be made of all the more precious Elements&quot; (La  
<br />
Mettrie 1748).
<br />
<br />Similarly, Lafitte engages us on the subject of Babbage, precursor of  
<br />
19th century information processing, to which we will return in the  
<br />
second part:
<br />
<br />&quot;For Babbage, all machines being a composition of different organs  
<br />
linked together in a complex manner, the important thing to fix is  
<br />
less the very form of the organs than the sequencing of their  
<br />
functions, which relates to organic linkages that cause the ensemble  
<br />
to function.&quot; (Lafitte 1930).
<br />
<br />Differing with Descartes, Hobbes concludes that it is not possible  
<br />
that Man - whom he considers to be a finite being - might conceive of  
<br />
the infinite. Hobbes' motivation, being finitist and indexical (human  
<br />
thought is mechanisable) is therefore opposed to Descartes' animal-as- 
<br />
machine and is, in this sense, much closer to the contemporary  
<br />
motivation in the direction of artificial intelligence. Soon I will  
<br />
return to the relation existing between mechanism and functionalism.
<br />
<br />1.1.3 What is a machine?
<br />
<br />Given the familiar connotations of the word &quot;machine&quot; - locomotives,  
<br />
electric kettles, automobiles, computers, microscopes, dish-washers,  
<br />
sewing machines, rice-cookers, time-pieces, mechanism may well seem  
<br />
grotesque.
<br />
<br />Even if machines are considered to be artefacts of exclusively human  
<br />
construction, in other words artificial, the concept of the machine is  
<br />
difficult to define. Lafitte, in 1911 argues that just such a  
<br />
definition can only be made in vain:
<br />
<br />&quot;To claim to be able to define the concept of a machine is to suppose  
<br />
that the science of machines has come about, or that it might one day  
<br />
come about in all it's perfection. Other than what is chimerically- 
<br />
speaking, to assign limits to the development of mechanical forms, is  
<br />
to suppose in the first place an entire and complete knowledge of the  
<br />
character of every individual present and future mechanism, followed  
<br />
by the perfection of a measuring instrument capable of situating each  
<br />
into a definitive category according to their ensemble of  
<br />
characteristics. But, this again implicitly admits to a massive  
<br />
division of sorts, conforming to those contours we can cleanly  
<br />
envisage and having no link whatsoever with other bodies.&quot; (see also  
<br />
further on 2.3)
<br />
<br />Similarly, La Mettrie, in &quot;Man as Machine&quot; writes:
<br />
<br />&quot;Man is a Machine so composed that it is frankly impossible to  
<br />
initially get a clear idea of it and consequently to arrive at a  
<br />
definition&quot;
<br />
<br />What Hobbes and Descartes have in common is that a machine is a  
<br />
locally finite being. Its global behaviour is determined by the  
<br />
behaviour of its elementary constituents, these being finite in number  
<br />
at each instant (call this the &quot;digital aspect&quot;). The number of  
<br />
components can nonetheless grow according to the work performed by the  
<br />
machine.
