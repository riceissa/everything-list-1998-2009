<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Having said all this, it is interesting to reconsider your formulation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;the brain did its thing without us understanding it, creating its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; context&quot;.  What is it about *being* the brain that causes this context
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to be self-referentially available, but hides it beyond possibility of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; recovery from 'observation'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whether it can be hidden beyond the *possibility* of recovery is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting question. Certainly it would be very difficult to figure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out what an alien brain is thinking about from observation, like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cracking a very difficult code, but could it be made so that it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible to figure out? We would be able to figure out something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about an alien code, such as a written language, by observing various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regularities, but we would be unable to figure out the actual meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of words unless we had some extra-language information; that is, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could figure out the syntax, but not the semantics. Similarly with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain, we might be able to figure out certain patterns and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regularities, but without further information obtained by connecting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I/O devices or perhaps by obtaining the instruction manuals, we would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have no idea what the brain activity means, let alone what it feels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like from the brain's point of view. But would it be possible for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain's activity to be deliberately obscured such that not even the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; syntax can be guessed at, the equivalent of encryption using a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one-time pad?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I quite follow you - and this is what I meant by &quot;2) Any meaning
<br />
recoverable by an observer would be bounded by her own historic and
<br />
current interpretative context&quot;.  IOW we might succeed in thus
<br />
recovering some such meaning for ourselves - but it would necessarily
<br />
be bounded by our own interpretative resources.  And - in the limit -
<br />
we may suppose that there would be insufficient clues to permit any
<br />
intelligible, or at least more than conjectural, interpretation to be
<br />
made.   After all, we still can't unambiguously read ancient Etruscan,
<br />
nor do more than conjecture about the meaning of distant cultural
<br />
symbols whose connection with us have been largely obscured.  When you
<br />
think about it, this local reinterpretation is what we resort to in
<br />
our everyday interactions with the aliens by whom we are surrounded -
<br />
each other!  What we're doing in this very discussion is taking purely
<br />
relational data, delivered by some process of transmission that is in
<br />
itself neutral vis-a-vis the source context, and reinterpreting it in
<br />
terms of our local resources of meaning.  Only then can we attempt to
<br />
'match sense' with each other.
<br />
<br />I'll essay a response to my own question - &quot;what is it about *being*
<br />
the brain that causes this context to be self-referentially available,
<br />
but hides it beyond possibility of recovery from 'observation'?&quot; -
<br />
because it is again central to my discussion with Peter.  IMO it is
<br />
next-to-impossible to make sense of the distinction between
<br />
interpretation-in-context and information-taken-out-of-context unless
<br />
one recasts the fundamental senses of epistemic and ontic along the
<br />
lines I've proposed to Peter.  As I also remarked to him, there's
<br />
nothing new about this proposal - it's essentially the 'eastern'
<br />
viewpoint, as opposed to that more typical of the west, in which
<br />
interpretation tends to be cast as the subjective 'observation' of the
<br />
objective - thus creating the epistemic-ontic divide.
<br />
<br />In the eastern view, 'observe' and 'be' are merely
<br />
functionally-polarised aspects of a single *ontic* category.  IOW, to
<br />
say that we 'observe' is just to identify a mutual relation between
<br />
aspects of what is foundationally embodied-in-context - essentially
<br />
what is meant by 'what exists'.  To make this intelligible in terms of
<br />
the MBP, we can say, very loosely, that 'minds' - i.e. interpretative
<br />
contexts - consist in localised instantiations of  'observations'
<br />
which stand in some consistent co-varying relation to differentiable
<br />
'observables' (i.e. 'bodies') situated 'external' to this context
<br />
purely with respect to some functionally-defined horizon.  It follows
<br />
quite naturally from this that a) the relation of the context of mind
<br />
to its horizonally-defined 'externalised' referents, and b) the
<br />
context of mind itself when seen from an 'externalised' viewpoint, are
<br />
both purely *relationally* defined.  Such relation data is
<br />
intrinsically abstracted from context and is thereby stripped of
<br />
contextual correlation until reinstated in terms of an appropriate
<br />
interpretative environment - IOW another mind.
