Hi Bruno,
<br />
<br />I mean logical implication and definitely -not- in the sense of production
<br />
and -most definitely not- causation.
<br />
<br />I sat down for once and wrote something down and here's basically what the
<br />
statement of my idea (which could easily be &quot;wrong&quot;):
<br />
[+1] If x is a (Wolpert) device, then (if &quot;x is complex in a sense&quot; then &quot;x
<br />
is conscious in a sense&quot;).
<br />
<br /><br />[+1] is just a label for this forum of scant formatting power...    ;)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Now I must describe what is meant by &quot;x is complex in a sense&quot; and &quot;x is
<br />
conscious in a sense.&quot;  The definitions are pretty dismal in terms of how
<br />
insightful they are at encapsulating complexity (or, loosely speaking,
<br />
-pseudo-randomness-) and consciousness; however, the definitions I will give
<br />
will be open-ended enough so that someone can certainly come along, like a
<br />
cognitive scientist who knows enough about the language we're using, and
<br />
narrow down these to-be-general definitions.
<br />
<br />(So instead of random, which is a quite loaded term, I am using complexity
<br />
now though the notation I use for complexity will be a predicate R &lt;for
<br />
random but it's more akin to pseudo-randomness&gt; also since C is a predicate
<br />
reserved for consciousness.)
<br />
<br /><br />First, let x be a Wolpert device.  At this point, the least number of
<br />
'axioms', defining traits, should be placed on what a device is so as to
<br />
more readily prove facts about our world (e.g., that a human mind is
<br />
conscious).  Second, consider the aggregate of all possible outputs x can
<br />
&quot;produce&quot; if it is fed all possible, relevant, inputs and notate this
<br />
aggregate (which may not be a set, but a class) as [x].
<br />
<br /><br />[x] is the aggregate of all outputs of x.  Let's call this the -range- of
<br />
the device x.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Second, let t be the set of all truth values one is using for the moment.
<br />
The only assumptions on t are that t is a carrier (truth set) of an
<br />
MV-algebra, that {0,1} is a subset of t (so the contextual logic either is
<br />
classical logic or generalizes classical logic), and that t is a (not
<br />
necessarily proper) subset of [0,1].  One example is t is {0,1}, the
<br />
classical case, the entire interval [0,1] the fully fuzzy logic, and another
<br />
is this set, denoted L_n after Łukasiewicz's rational logics:
<br />
L_n = (by definition) {0, 1/(n-1), ..., (n-2)/(n-1), 1} , so, L_2 = {0,1},
<br />
L_3 = {0, 1/2, 1}, and L_6 = {0, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 1}.
<br />
Again, t is just some truth set -in an MV-algebra- that contains {0,1} and
<br />
is a subset of [0,1].
<br />
Further abstractions are possible but I believe especially in light of
<br />
Chang's theorems regarding the connection between arbitrary MV-algebras and
<br />
the real unit interval, no further abstract MV-algebras would be needed for
<br />
this discussion.
<br />
<br /><br />Device measures
<br />
Call a function a device measure if it can accept as input any set or class
<br />
of the form [x] where x is a device and whose range is t.  Device measures
<br />
say -something- about a device.  Examples: R, C, S, and O, meaning
<br />
complexity/randomness, consciousness, self-awareness, and omniscience will
<br />
all be device measures.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />In the literature, t can be partitioned into three disjoint pieces called
<br />
the set of designated truth values, anti-desgniated truth values, and a
<br />
possibly empty set of elements of t that are neither.  For example, on
<br />
{0,1/2,1}, one can say that 0 is anti-designated and the designated truth
<br />
values are 1/2 and 1.  There is flexibility here but all designated truth
<br />
values must be lattice-larger than all other types of elements of t and all
<br />
anti-designated truth values must be lattice-less than elements of t that
<br />
are designated or neither.  Let D_t be any such partitioning of t into three
<br />
pieces.
<br />
<br />My intuition is that if the truth value of a statement is designated, it is
<br />
-essentially true-, anti-designated is -essentially false-, and neither
<br />
means -essentially- neither.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Device Typing
<br />
Let f be a device measure with a partitioning of t, called D_t.  Then define
<br />
the (f, D_t)-type of x to be either -1, 0, or 1, as follows:
<br />
T(x; f, D_t) = 1 iff (   f( [x] ) is a designated truth value   ),
<br />
T(x; f, D_t) = 0 iff (   f( [x] ) is a non-designated truth value   ), and,
<br />
lastly,
<br />
T(x; f, D_t) = -1 iff (   f( [x] ) is an anti-designated truth value   ).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />So the typing scheme brings everything back to classical logic, aka crisp
<br />
logic.
<br />
<br /><br />Senses
<br />
Say that device x has property (related to) f -in a sense- iff x is a type 1
<br />
device for some partitioning D_t of t.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />What I mean here can be stated now:
<br />
Let R be a device measure pertaining to complexity, such as akin Kolomogorov
<br />
complexity and C be a to-be-determined device measure about consciousness.
<br />
For all devices x,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;if T(x; R, D_t) = 1, for some D_t, THEN
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />On Wed, May 14, 2008 at 6:55 AM, Bruno Marchal &lt;marchal.domain.name.hidden&gt; wrote:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I must admit to a little hand waving.  OK, maybe a lot.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually you are not. Not necessarily so, I mean. *I* could have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong. Let me explain:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When you said:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;&lt;Randomness implies consciousness.&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I interpreted as:  &quot;Randomness causes or produces consciousness&quot;. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA (the first three steps) shows that it is consciousness (or first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person awareness) which causes, or produces, or makes it possible that,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; randommess feeling. Just think about the iterated self-duplication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought experiment. In that case randomness implies not only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness or at least first person apprehension.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the question is: what do you mean by &quot;implies&quot;. Is it &quot;material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implication&quot; like the classical logical implication, or do you mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there is some third person (&quot;objective&quot;) notion of randomness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; playing some role in the rise of consciousness. Something like that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could also exist, but not at the same level of the first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeterminacy which is a form of subjective uncertainty occurring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *thanks* to the third person, objective determinacy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, your repeating non ending post, has made still more obscure the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason why you want a universal set. If such a set &quot;exists&quot; (in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set theoiry?) it should be used to cut out such infinite behavior,  in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some theory of meaning, not to produce them. If not, then the best
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;universal set&quot; is the universal machine. It seems to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And then you seem to distinguish awareness and consciousness, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-awareness and self-consciousness. Am I right? What is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relevance of that distinction (and which one?) for your message?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I try to get your point, You should perhaps try to write a short
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; informal text &quot;for the children&quot;.  That could help.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You could also make some economy of thought by first studying the UDA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps. It shows that he comp hyp put very strong constraints on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible mind-body relationships. If you dfend a non-computationalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hyposthesis, it is ok, but even in that case the UDA can help you to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learn something, I  sincerely think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be sure, I will be more and more busy, and so expect my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aswers/comments/questions to be more and more delayed. I'm sorry for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that.
