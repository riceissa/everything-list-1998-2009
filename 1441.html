<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All worlds are real, whether or not they will be ours.  Therefore, you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot assign probabilities to how likely it is a world will exist; every 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world has a 100% probability.
</em><br />
<br />But we can define probabilities for how likely it is that we, or any other
<br />
SAS, will experience a given world.  These probabilities vary.  Not all
<br />
worlds are equally likely to be experienced.  Do you agree?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; define probabilities for worlds, we are simply saying which SAS's we are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most likely to end up as.
</em><br />
<br />We are saying more than this, we are describing which SAS's we are most
<br />
likely to START as, too.  The probability says more than, given that you
<br />
start as A, how likely will you be to end up as B, C, or D?  It gives a
<br />
numeric ranking to every world in the multiverse.  Each world has a real
<br />
number associated with it.  We sometimes call it a &quot;measure&quot;, sometimes a
<br />
&quot;probability&quot;, but the point is, all worlds have such a numeric ranking.
<br />
<br />When you start as A, the reason why the probabilities to end up as
<br />
B, C, or D differ is because those worlds differ in their measures.
<br />
All the various continuations of world A have lower measures than A,
<br />
and the sum of all their measures equals the measure of A.  The relative
<br />
proportions of their measures produce the variant probabilities for how
<br />
likely a SAS in A is to experience B, C, or D as its continuation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you can imagine a split, which creates world A 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and world B.  World A is the expected world, where we observe the universe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to act as it should.  World B is the unexpected world, where we observe the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe to act strangely. Both worlds are real, both exist.  So whenever 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our world splits into a world we expect, there is another world, just as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real, which for all of time acted as expected, for which we had no reason to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expect anything different from.  But all of a sudden, that world went 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; haywire, leaving us baffled.
</em><br />
<br />This is true, some people experience such things.  The same thing happens,
<br />
BTW, in a spatially infinite universe.  Somewhere someone is astonished
<br />
to see water freeze on the stove and boil in the freezer.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The three important things to remember here are:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.  Both worlds are real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2.  The SAS's within each world are real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3.  Both worlds acted exactly the same for all of time until that one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment.  Therefore, the SAS's within the unexpected world had observed the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same physical laws, with the same degree of stability, as the expected 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world, right up until that moment.  They too expected to be in the likely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world; they had no reason to expect anything different. But, to their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incredible surprise, they didn't end up in that world.
</em><br />
<br />Sure, they are surprised.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given these three conditions, I see no reason why our world is any more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely to be one than the other.
</em><br />
<br />Some worlds have higher measure than others.
<br />
<br />Another way to think of it that some prefer, is to say that the reason
<br />
why some worlds have more measure than others is that there are multiple
<br />
copies of each one, and the worlds with higher measure have more copies.
<br />
<br />In your example, the universe doesn't split into just A and B, it splits
<br />
into 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999 copies of A and and 1 copy
<br />
of B.  Now we have 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000 SAS's and
<br />
all of them are equally real.  All three of your points are valid except
<br />
instead of 2 worlds there are 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000
<br />
of them, and an equal number of SAS's.  Only 1 was surprised, the others
<br />
saw business as usual.
<br />
<br />Personally I don't find the multiple-world-copies model that helpful,
<br />
as I am happy to think of each world as having a little tag with it that
<br />
tells what its measure is.  Either way, though, the important point
<br />
is that the total measure of the SAS's who see unlawful universes is
<br />
very small compared to the measure of SAS's who see lawful behavior,
<br />
and that explains why we see the universe as lawful.
