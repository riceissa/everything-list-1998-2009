</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ron
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am sorry but you seem to contradict yourself below!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You state, quite correctly as far as I can tell, what the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outcome of the most recent cosmic observations on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our universe is. But them you state that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Neither dark energy nor dark matter has been proven by experiment 
</em><br />
<br />or
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; measurement to exist. Both seem as pure postulates at this 
</em><br />
writing.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Both &quot;dark matter&quot; and &quot;dark energy&quot; express little more than our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; puzzling with two sets of consistently observed effects which we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aren't able to accommodate in the so-called &quot;concordance model&quot; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standard cosmology. What these terms designate are not (yet) 
</em><br />
definite
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities so it is a bit early to even call them postulates. 
</em><br />
Theorists
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have sought to explain these effects along several distinct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothetical lines but the word is still out on which one of those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will prevail.
</em><br />
<br />Correct, and I did not define my terms. By &quot;postulate&quot; I mean the 
<br />
expression of an idea not yet represented by a defining mathematical 
<br />
statement. By theory I mean an idea supported by mathematical 
<br />
statement but not yet verified in all possible ways by apparent 
<br />
empirical evidence. By law I mean an idea supported by a mathematical 
<br />
<br />statement that can not be ruled out by empirical evidence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; To me, dark energy seems to be the more important postulate. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; appears to me that if the universe will forever keep expanding at 
</em><br />
<br />an
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ever increasing rate then within a non infinite time period no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; elementary particle of matter will be able to interact with 
</em><br />
another.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What makes you think so?
</em><br />
<br />The supposition that redshift is an observable component of inflation 
<br />
<br />of the universe. It is not the distance that contributes, it is the 
<br />
relative rate of expansion that contributes to the apparent redshift 
<br />
(all other factors that can contribute to redshift being ignored for 
<br />
the purpose of concentrating only on the affect caused by inflation 
<br />
itself). The further something is away from us, relatively speaking, 
<br />
then the faster it is moving away from us. With inflation being on an 
<br />
<br />ever increasing rate, there comes a point in finite time when the 
<br />
expansion rate reaches a level that causes the entire universe to 
<br />
appear dark and at absolute zero in temperature in reference to all 
<br />
its matter relative to itself.
<br />
<br />In other words, the redshift at all points within the universe will 
<br />
have shifted to a level of absolute zero observable energy at some 
<br />
future time because the universe is then expanding (at every point 
<br />
within itself) at or beyond a rate that would allow energy to find 
<br />
anything in the universe that it could be relative to. In that 
<br />
situation a particle would never be able to travel from any point A 
<br />
to any point B, although it might try to do so for as long as it 
<br />
existed.  Eventually the particle could no longer exist, because it 
<br />
itself would loose coherency as its integral parts moved away from 
<br />
each other as a consequence of the space it occupies continuing to 
<br />
inflate, and thereby move its parts away from each other until 
<br />
nuclear forces could no longer maintain the attraction that keeps the 
<br />
<br />particle (of any type whatsoever) from totally disintegrating.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That condition seems to indicate that relativity would thus be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; meaningless when that point in time occurs. To my logic this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; appears to violate conservation of energy law. If the argument is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; nonetheless true, then it follows that said law is not a real law
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that our entire theory structure is faulty at a fundamental 
</em><br />
level.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That may very well be the case but it is again, to early to tell. 
</em><br />
As
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you have probably heard General Relativity has always had an &quot;open
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place&quot; for something like Dark Energy, namely the cosmological 
</em><br />
term.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So it may be worth our while to re-examine its implications. If our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Universe is already dominated by Dark Energy as it seems than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continued acceleration may very well express the peculiar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; de-localization of energy that made GR suspect for so many years.
</em><br />
<br />If you refer to the disputed cosmological constant, then I would say 
<br />
that it might indeed exists but perhaps not as a constant. It might 
<br />
instead be an expression related to the ever increasing rate of the 
<br />
expansion of the universe. If that be the nature of reality then the 
<br />
laws of physics as we know them are predictable but not knowable at a 
<br />
<br />distance, unless all points of the universe are inflating at the same 
<br />
<br />exact rate (something that doesn't seem likely considering the 
<br />
apparent lack of homogeneous matter distribution in the universe - 
<br />
and for which we owe our very existence).
<br />
<br />And now the rest of the story, a postulate by my above terms! Our 
<br />
universe is indeed one of potentially many universes within a so 
<br />
called meta-universe. No new thoughts there! But, a meta-universe 
<br />
that is at a temperature of absolute zero. Still, virtual particles 
<br />
do form within it much as they do in our own universe. Sometimes 
<br />
enough form, simultaneously and in one place and by pure chance with 
<br />
more &quot;normal&quot; matter being at point A than is at point B, and an 
<br />
expanding bubble results with a universe being born in the process.
<br />
<br />But this is no free lunch, the apparent abundance of energy in our 
<br />
observable universe is an illusion from the viewpoint of the meta-
<br />
universe. The expansion and resultant heat death of our universe is 
<br />
one method of how the zero energy balance is maintained in the meta-
<br />
universe. This dark energy is the vehicle by which energy in our 
<br />
universe is returned to the meta-universe.
<br />
<br />Our universe is not flat, it is open. Energy can not be returned to 
<br />
the meta-universe if a bubble were flat, because it would require 
<br />
that a very precise number of particles exist in a universe for it to 
<br />
<br />actually be a flat universe. That number of particles is equivalent 
<br />
to zero because it requires that equal amounts of both normal and 
<br />
anti matter virtual particles exist within the bubble, so when a 
<br />
&quot;flat&quot; universe spawns then the meta-universe becomes the universe 
<br />
that just spawned (in result, it never happened). And in a closed 
<br />
universe the energy is returned to the meta-universe by the other 
<br />
available path for it to do so by - a big crunch. In our universe 
<br />
some energy is returned that way, by way of black holes.
<br />
<br />Black holes are always shrinking to a singularity, effectively 
<br />
increasing distance between themselves and everything else that 
<br />
exists in our universe. It's just a localized area of space/time 
<br />
inflation. The matter that goes into a black hole becomes energy 
<br />
returned to the meta-universe. What remains is not a &quot;black hole&quot; as 
<br />
we think of one being, but a sort of energy potential portal into the 
<br />
<br />meta-universe. These portals are what exhibit the affect that is 
<br />
being labeled dark matter. It's an attraction by the meta-universe, 
<br />
its attempt to reclaim its zero energy balance.
<br />
<br />Dark energy is the expansion of the universe into a state of zero 
<br />
energy. They are but different sides of the same &quot;thing&quot;, with the 
<br />
meta-universe being what the interior of what the &quot;thing&quot; is made up 
<br />
of. The meta-universe is made up of absolutely nothing. Only the 
<br />
bubbles that it spawns contain something. A something that we call 
<br />
matter/energy and space/time.
<br />
<br />There, now I feel better after having gotten that all out of me!
