<br />
In this note I try to outline my current thoughts on quantum physics,
<br />
for your comments. I am sending this to a few mailing lists with
<br />
overlapping memberships, so you may have received this twice or more.
<br />
I apologise if this is the case and also for the very imprecise
<br />
language and gross simplifications and analogies that I am using to
<br />
make my point. While this is really a sketch of a sketch, I wish to
<br />
discuss the core idea with people who understands these things better
<br />
than I do, so please let me have your comments (even &quot;go back to your
<br />
first year textbook and stop wasting my time&quot;).
<br />
I think that, while Everett's Relative State formulation of quantum
<br />
mechanics makes a lot of sense, its popular interpretation as &quot;Many
<br />
Worlds&quot;(MWI) should be taken only as a simple pictorial device useful
<br />
for a first understanding of the theory.
<br />
As a more accurate interpretation, I propose thinking of perceived
<br />
realities as shadows of a more complex reality. I suspect this is what
<br />
some authors, perhaps including Everett himself, were trying to say,
<br />
and that others may have said it explicitly (perhaps Lockwood), so I
<br />
would appreciate any pointer to relevant works.
<br />
I will use poor Schroedinger's cat as an example. Following Everett,
<br />
the cat is in a superposition of [cat dead] and [cat alive] states
<br />
before an observer opens the box and looks inside, and stays so after
<br />
(there is no collapse). After opening the box and looking inside, the
<br />
observer is in a superposition of [observer who remembers having seen
<br />
the cat dead] and [observer who remembers having seen the cat alive].
<br />
The MWI says that after the act of observation (measurement) the
<br />
universe is split in two branches where the first has [cat dead] and
<br />
[observer who remembers having seen the cat dead], and the second has
<br />
[cat alive] and [observer who remembers having seen the cat alive].
<br />
The difficulty that I have is: on the one hand we are saying that
<br />
fundamental reality contains no such things as cats dead or alive, but
<br />
on the other hand we are describing the world(s) with cats dead and
<br />
cats alive.
<br />
To clarify the first part of the statement: as we can choose any two
<br />
directions to form a basis to use for the description of a particle's
<br />
spin, all
<br />
choices generating equally valid descriptions, besides [cat dead] and
<br />
[cat alive] we should be free to use another basis to describe the
<br />
cat. While any pair of independent linear superpositions of [cat dead]
<br />
and [cat alive] will do, of course I have no idea of what such a
<br />
superposition would &quot;look like&quot;.
<br />
Since I cannot remember having ever seen one, I do not know what a
<br />
superposition of [cat dead] and [cat alive] would look like, so
<br />
probably I would not recognise one if I saw it. Perhaps this is the
<br />
reason why I cannot remember having ever seen one.
<br />
In other words, perhaps since reality is One Big World too complex for
<br />
our minds to process efficiently, we use a simplified representation
<br />
as Many (small) Worlds for our processing. This is not so surprising
<br />
when we remember that our best computer programs use data compression
<br />
and segmentation techniques, throwing most of the information away, to
<br />
perform complex tasks such as face recognition efficiently. Perhaps
<br />
reducing a complex reality to parallel worlds is a successful trick
<br />
that sentient beings have developed to process reality more
<br />
efficiently.
<br />
I believe thinking of shadows may be a better mental device than
<br />
thinking of parallel worlds. Using this model the realities that I,
<br />
and my doubles in other branches of the MWI model, perceive can be
<br />
thought of as shadows of a more complex reality. Observing a shadow
<br />
permits saying certain things about its source, like size and overall
<br />
shape, but not other things like colour and smell. The shadow does not
<br />
contain such information. Also, much of what we can say about shadows
<br />
has more to do with illumination and the surface where the shadow is
<br />
cast than with the actual source.
<br />
Thinking of multiple worlds as shadows brings us back to Plato's cave,
<br />
but there are two important differences: First, each of us observes
<br />
shadows of the *real* world in a very large number of caves in
<br />
parallel. Second, we are shadows ourselves, our mental computational
<br />
processes being shadows of other, possibly much more complex,
<br />
computational processes.
<br />
In my view of the world, saying &quot;my mental computational processes&quot; is
<br />
just another way to say &quot;I&quot;. So what am I a shadow of? I don't know,
<br />
but perhaps by observing the shadow I can develop some plausible
<br />
assumptions on the source.
<br />
I know that I am a conscious being: though I am not able to put my
<br />
finger precisely on what consciousness *is*, I know that it is a
<br />
property that I posses. I also think that consciousness must have
<br />
something to do with complexity: if a computational process is complex
<br />
enough, it may become a conscious process.
<br />
So, since it seems reasonable to think that a source must have a
<br />
degree of complexity not lower than its shadow, we should consider the
<br />
possibility that we are shadows cast by conscious sources.
<br />
Following Greg Egan who outlined something similar in his novel
<br />
&quot;Quarantine&quot;, we can use the term &quot;smeared self&quot; to indicate such a
<br />
source. Your smeared self is simultaneosly conscious of a very large
<br />
number of Everett branches, and you, who can only perceive one, are
<br />
the shadow that your smeared self is casting on this specific branch.
<br />
The mental activity of your smeared self may well be much more complex
<br />
than yours, and perhaps the interaction between I who wrote this very
<br />
speculative and imprecise note, and you who are reading it, is the
<br />
shadow of a much more complex interaction between our smeared selves.
