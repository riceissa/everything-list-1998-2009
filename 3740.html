I have not begun a detailed review of the paper myself, but it appears to hinge on the concept of decoherence as the 'point' where the worlds split.
<br />
<br />The experiment assumes the ion does not decohere along with Silvia/photon/emitter since it is sufficiently isolated. If the ion is not truly isolated from Silvia/photon/emitter, then the experiment will not prove anything. If quantum isolation is impossible, then the interworld communication is impossible.
<br />
<br />I realized the paper was kind of dated, and wasn't sure where to find reviews of it or references to it. So the link was helpful. Thanks.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formation of distinct parallel worlds as a result of a quantum

<br />I would be extremely skeptical that this experiment will work.  It is

generally accepted that the MWI produces the same predictions as

other interpretations, except where the other methods invoke &quot;magic&quot;
<br />
(i.e. nonphysical interactions with consciousness, etc.).  I found

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; John Gribbin brought this one to my attention and asked me what I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought about it.  Basically, the idea here is to isolate an ion from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its environment in an &quot;ion trap&quot;, and then perform a measurement on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with two possible outcomes on another quantum system, and to excite the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ion only if the first outcome occurs, before the ion has had time to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;decohere&quot; or get &quot;entangled&quot; with the environment.  Then one checks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to see if the ion is excited.  The idea is that even if we didn't see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the outcome that made us excite the ion, we might see the ion excited,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because it was excited in the other &quot;world&quot; or &quot;branch&quot; --- the one in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which we *did* see the outcome that made us excite the ion.  The author
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gets fairly excited himself, suggesting that &quot;outside physics, interworld
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication would lead to truly mind-boggling possibilities&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does this idea really make sense?  First of all, I don't think of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort of thing as a test of the many-worlds interpretation; I think that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all sufficiently sensible interpretations of quantum mechanics (not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily *very* sensible, either!) give the same concrete predictions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for all experiments, when it comes to what we actually observe.  They may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make us tell very different stories about what is happening behind the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scenes, but not of any testable sort.  As soon as one comes up with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something that makes different predictions, I think it is (more or less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by definition) not a new &quot;interpretation&quot; of quantum theory but an actual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; new theory.  And I don't think the many-worlds interpretation is that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the question as I see it is simply, will this experiment work?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Will we sometimes see the ion excited even when we didn't excite it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems hard; usually the decoherence between the two &quot;branches&quot; prevents
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this kind of &quot;inter-world communication&quot; (not that I'm particularly fond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of this way of talking about it).  What exactly is supposed to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this case different?  The problem is that the paper is quite sketchy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the crucial point... just when the rabbit being pulled from the hat,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as it were.  I haven't put much time into analyzing it, but some people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interested in this sort of thing might enjoy having a go at it.
</em><br />
<br />If this kind of inter-world communication were possible, quantum
<br />
computers would be much more powerful.  You wouldn't have to rely on
<br />
tricks like the Shor and Grover algorithms which manage to make the
<br />
results available in every branch.  You could just do straightforward
<br />
N-way parallelism and whichever branch got the result, they could tell
<br />
the others.  This would allow quantum computers to solve NP complete
<br />
problems, which I believe they have been proven not to be able to do.
<br />
If this is correct then that would prove that this experiment can't work.
<br />
<br />I think it might also be possible to measure a photon's quantum state with
<br />
more accuracy than is theoretically possible, by sending it into a bunch
<br />
of universes and letting each one do a slightly different measurement,
<br />
then using Plaga's technology to broadcast their results to the other
<br />
universes.  This would violate more quantum theorems, and allow for
<br />
faster than light communication to boot.
<br />
<br />I'm no physicist so I don't know for sure that these implications would
<br />
follow, but I am very doubtful that interworld communication is consistent
<br />
with the basics of quantum mechanics.  The fact that this paper has not
<br />
been published in peer reviewed journals in 7 years indicates that it
<br />
probably doesn't work.
