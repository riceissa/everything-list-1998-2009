</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; One major argument against the idea that qualia and/or consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be substrate-dependent is what philosopher David Chalmers refers to as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;dancing qualia&quot; and &quot;fading qualia&quot; arguments, which you can read more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about at <a href="http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html">http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html</a> . As a thought-experiment,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; imagine gradually replacing neurons in my brain with functionally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; identical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; devices whose physical construction was quite different from neurons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (silicon chips emulating the input and output of the neurons they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; replaced,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; perhaps). If one believes that this substrate is associated with either
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; different qualia or absent qualia, then as one gradually replaces more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; more of my brain, they'll either have to be a sudden discontinuous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (and it seems implausible that the replacement of a single neuron would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cause such a radical change) or else a gradual shift or fade-out of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; qualia my brain experiences...but if I were noticing such a shift or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fade-out, I would expect to be able to comment on it, and yet the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that the new parts are functionally identical means my behavior should 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; indistinguishable from what it would be if my neurons were left alone. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if we suppose that I might be having panicked thoughts about a change in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; perceptions yet find that my voice and body are acting as if nothing is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; wrong, and there is no neural activity associated with these panicked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; thoughts, then there would have to be a radical disconnect between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; subjective experiences and physical activity in my brain, which would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; contradict the assumption of supervenience (see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; <a href="http://philosophy.uwaterloo.ca/MindDict/supervenience.html">http://philosophy.uwaterloo.ca/MindDict/supervenience.html</a> ) and lead to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possibility of radical mind/body disconnects like rocks and trees having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; complex thoughts and experiences that have nothing to do with any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; activity within them.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It's a persuasive argument, but I can think of a mechanism whereby your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;qualia can fade away and you wouldn't notice. In some cases of cortical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;blindness, in which the visual cortex is damaged but the rest of the visual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pathways intact, patients insist that they are not blind and come up with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explanations as to why they fall over and walk into things, eg. they accuse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;people of putting obstacles in their way while their back is turned. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;isn't just denial because it is specific to cortical lesions, not blindness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;due to other reasons. If these patients had advanced cyborg implants they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could presumably convince the world, and be convinced themselves, that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;visual perception had not suffered when in fact they can't see a thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps gradual cyborgisation of the brain as per Hans Moravec would lead 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a similar, gradual fading of thoughts and perceptions; the external 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would not notice any change and the subject would not notice any change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;either, until he was dead, replaced by a zombie.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<br />That's an interesting analogy, but it seems to me there's an important 
<br />
difference between this real case and the hypothetical fading qualia case 
<br />
since presumably the brain activity associated with inventing false visual 
<br />
sensations is different from the activity associated with visual sensations 
<br />
that are based on actual signals from the optic nerve. Additionally, we'd 
<br />
still assume it's true that their reports of what they are seeing match the 
<br />
visual qualia they are having, even if these visual qualia have no relation 
<br />
to the outside world as in dreams or hallucinations. In the case of 
<br />
replacing the visual cortex with functionally identical computer chips, the 
<br />
activity in the remainder of the brain would be identical to what it would 
<br />
be if the visual cortex were left intact, and if the &quot;fading qualia&quot; picture 
<br />
were true they'd be continuing to report visual sensations even when they 
<br />
weren't having any whatsoever, not even hallucinatory ones. So basically 
<br />
you'd be forced to conclude that even in normal people with unmodified 
<br />
brains, the fact that we talk about having various sensations and 
<br />
perceptions has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that we actually do 
<br />
have them. Of course anyone who sees qualia as &quot;epiphenomal&quot;, and who sees 
<br />
physically identical zombies as a logical possibility, will say that our 
<br />
qualia don't have any *causal* effect on the physical brain, but they still 
<br />
usually assume some set of &quot;psychophysical laws&quot; which insure that the 
<br />
association between physical activity in the brain and qualia is a sensible 
<br />
one (somewhat akin to Leibniz's 'pre-established harmony' solution to the 
<br />
mind-body problem--see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-established_harmony">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-established_harmony</a> 
<br />
), so that  the causal relation between the brain processing visual 
<br />
information and the brain creating verbal descriptions of what one is seeing 
<br />
is mirrored by a relation between visual qualia and the qualia associated 
<br />
with verbal thoughts about what one is seeing. If you don't assume such 
<br />
&quot;sensible&quot; psychophysical laws, then you have no basis for believing even 
<br />
now that you should trust any verbal thoughts about what you are seeing. I 
<br />
might say to myself that I can trust my visual experiences themselves before 
<br />
I translate them into verbal terms, but the very act of *saying* that to 
<br />
myself seems to undermine it since I can't be sure if the words 'visual 
<br />
experiences' even refer to anything--a bizarre paradoxical situation.
