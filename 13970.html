Le 14-sept.-07, à 00:17, John Mikes a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno, that was quite a response. Let me just include those part to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which I have something to say - in most cases your 'half-agreement' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cuts my guts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ==============
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;...I like very much David Deutsch's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea that if we are scientist we are in principle willing to know that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our theory is wrong, but to discover this we have to take them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seriously enough.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I never said I am a scientist, I just speculate (and allow to change 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my mind).
</em><br />
<br /><br />That's what I call, with Popper, a scientist, more or less... Perhaps 
<br />
the scientist just try to be as clear as possible, and submit papers 
<br />
from time to time.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I brought together is in my distsinction a 'narrative', not a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory, not even a hypothesis.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think this corresponds to the points of view (both in the UDA and 
<br />
after in the arithmetical UDA). I think I agree with you, but I know we 
<br />
disagree on this!
<br />
It just happen that I am enough open minded toward machine that I am 
<br />
listening to their many points of view.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;(JM)&gt; And i still did not get an acceptable explanation why 'numbers' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the basics of everything (and WHAT they may be).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (BM) Nobody can KNOW that. The fact is that ONCE you take the comp hyp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seriously enough into consideration, then you can, by work, be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually convince that our own immateriality (which follows easily by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp) has to be &quot;contagious&quot; on our possible neighborhoods.&quot;&lt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (JM):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why don't I take the 'comp hyp (whatever it is) seriously BEFORE I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know about numbers?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I see it circular: unless 'comp' has nothing to do with numbers. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot take seriously a 'thing' to get to that 'thing'. As you wrote:
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sure! You have perhaps a good intuition about numbers, we cannot define 
<br />
them without using them. That is why there are a good starting point. 
<br />
Now comp and numbers are related because comp concerns notably 
<br />
transformation of finite things into finite things, like when you are 
<br />
using your computer, and numbers give the most easy and known way to 
<br />
represented finite things. But you should not fix yourself too much on 
<br />
numbers; if you insist I will come back to the combinators! (One reason 
<br />
to use numbers, beside that with + and * and logic, is that  they are 
<br />
enough for the ontic view, another is that we learn numbers in primary 
<br />
school; combinators belongs to mathematical logics, and are less 
<br />
known).
<br />
Anyway, once you have the combinators and their relations you got the 
<br />
numbers, and vice verça.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (BM):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;...we are not talking about those numbers humans
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (re)invented, but on those which have to exist independently of us once
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we accept some minimal amount of computer science, without which we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  could infer nothing fron comp (our, well mine, working 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothesis)....&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (JM):  -RE-invented? if we agreed (D. Bohm) that the numbers we use as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are human inventions, how did they exist independentloy of us?
</em><br />
<br /><br />As I discussed a lot with Peter D. Jones, I just mean that the 
<br />
propositions about numbers, and about  relation between numbers, are 
<br />
true or false independent of me. Do you sincerely believe that the fact 
<br />
that you cannot build a rectangle at least two row large with the 
<br />
following items IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII depends of you? (yes, there are 17 
<br />
strokes, well normally).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is even the 'littlest' computer science feasible without numbers?
</em><br />
<br /><br />According to Hartree Field, the whole science can be done without 
<br />
numbers, but his prospects fails for number theory (!) and computer 
<br />
science indeed. So we agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I would not accept something to exist before it came into 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence just to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a 'hyp' workable - which I don't see feasible without such circularity.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't think there is any circularity: I make clear the distinction 
<br />
between the hypothesis and the consequences.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:  (Bohm) denies comp -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (JM): I do not. I don't know what it is.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Comp is :
<br />
- Church thesis (a scientific (= refutable) hypothesis in the 
<br />
foundation of math and computer science)
<br />
- The assumption of the existence of a level of description of myself 
<br />
such that I can say &quot;yes&quot; to a doctor who proposes me an artificial 
<br />
body made at that level, without which I would die in the ordinary 
<br />
sense. Ex: 1) Ray Kurzweil is a comp practionners (hopers, ...).  2) 
<br />
All scientist except Penrose (but even Searle and Rosen although this 
<br />
is not obvious and I guess debatable). Comp is a very weak hypothesis, 
<br />
but with &quot;devastatting consequences&quot; once we take it seriously enough, 
<br />
due to CT, mainly.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I hope it is not that embryonic digitality-churner we have on our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; desk (don't even mention 'binary'), but if it is named ptoperly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (comp?) it has 'something' to do with computationality (involving 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers to handle). Now this may be your mystical unknowable 'number' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what I was willing to call (not condoning) the Almighty Creator, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything else - of course not emulable by an (embryonic level) Turing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine.
</em><br />
<br />Yes; although &quot;almighty creator&quot; has some connotations ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I just wonder WHY NUMBER? because Plato talked numbers? That was 2500 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years ago at the epistemic cognitive level of that time!  OK, our mind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is still not capable of thinking beyond the level it can think, but to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitute the ORIGIN by something invented in the course much much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; later on, because we have some idea about THAT, does not seem to me 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'scientific' enough.
</em><br />
<br />You can say that for dinosaure, electrons, etc.  Of course I hope that 
<br />
the theories of numbers we have invented reflect the number reality. 
<br />
Numbers are also what you put on any numerical disk. If you have 
<br />
conceptual problem with the notion of natural number (beyond not liking 
<br />
them) I am afraid I cannot help ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unless you give me a better explanation - if you care.
</em><br />
<br />I don't know people who does not believe in numbers (despite I know 
<br />
people who pretends not to believe in numbers, but there is always some 
<br />
word play at play there imo). Generally people believe (rightly on the 
<br />
epistemological level) in *more* than numbers. All what I say is that 
<br />
if comp is true, anything you add to numbers is provably useless at the 
<br />
ontic level. And the epistemological level need more than the whole 
<br />
cantor paradise to be approached: it is the first person plenitude, 
<br />
something not mathematically definable by a machine, about itself (but 
<br />
definable but simpler machine than itself).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (BM):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All proof in math are particular case of thought experiments. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophy-of-mind, theology, theoretical physics and math, the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tools available are the thought experiments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (JM):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I wrote: &gt; I also keep away from ANY thought experiences, they are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; products of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; OUR state of the mind at the time they are 'invented'....&lt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which &quot;experience&quot; is a typo, it should read &quot;experiment&quot;. Sorry 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about it)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was referring to those 'thought experiments' (EPR, teleportation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc.) which imagined physical tests on imaginary (unreal?) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circumstances to prove a position. To &quot;test&quot; ideas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in mental domains is a mental  effort, not what I would call a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'thought experiment'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (JM):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am in subconscious trouble with the machine, which is differently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; identified by Robert Rosen and I find a lot acceptable in his ideas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (BM):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Imo, Rosen is wrong on Church thesis. But this could wait when I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; succeed to explain more about CT later ..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (JM):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was referring to his nomenclature of the 'formal' (reductionist, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conventional) terms vs his tems in the impredicative view of the total 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interconnective 'cpmplexity'. &quot;His&quot; machine is computer-emulable while 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his 'natural systems' always have noncomputable elements.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is exactly why I say comp is a vaccine against reductionism. 
<br />
Universal machine can be shown to be necessarily confronted with many 
<br />
uncomputable elements. (and both the geographical part of the &quot;physical 
<br />
world&quot; and its lawfull charcter comes from that). Then Lobian Machines 
<br />
(which grosso modo are the universal machine* knowing* that they are 
<br />
universal) *know* that they are confronted with uncomputable elements, 
<br />
always...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I consider the latter as part of the world,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Me too. The beauty I try to convey to you, is that with the discovery 
<br />
of the universal machine notion we know now that we have to consider 
<br />
the uncomputable elements as part of the &quot;world&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; while the restricted view - mostly topically selected within 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; boundaries we set for our presently accessible observations - is what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I call  &quot;model&quot;, encompass the conventional sciences.
</em><br />
<br />What you call &quot;models&quot; here could correspond to incomplete internal 
<br />
views by relative numbers or relative machines (relative to possible 
<br />
computational histories).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; He worked in math and theor. biology as well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I am looking forward to reading your explanatory piece about the CT. )
</em><br />
<br /><br />Few people understand CT I realize.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Interesting match in your par:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Just keep track of the definitions. By angels and gods (note the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plural) I mean things which are not turing-emulable, or if you prefer,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any entities which are provably not machines.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (JM):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;provably&quot; is ambiguous. i would accept &quot;per definitionem&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No, I am always referring to a well defined notion of provability by 
<br />
ideally correct machine. There is no ambiguity at all, thanks to Godel 
<br />
Turing and Co.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (BM): What is conventional sciences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (JM): basically: what you and Nietzsche described. I consider it the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; historical figment of the ever changing (advancing?) observational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; skills and explanational levels, built upon the previous flight of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge-base in the human (scientific) establishment. It applies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; math to calfculate the quantities deduced from the developing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations on the 'model-view' (see above). Such incomplete 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information may lead to paradoxes. Thinking is 'reduced' to the actual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level of epistemic content viewed as &quot;all that there is&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think honestly that you are confusing the scientist's work and what 
<br />
he says at the pause-café, or during the week-end, or when pressed by 
<br />
unscrupulous media. Science by nature cannot be reductive, only 
<br />
&quot;religious-in-the-pejorative-sense&quot; interpretation of some 
<br />
pseudo-scientist 'narrative'..
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I call it reductionistic, (the only way we can think!)
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say that it is only the only way we can communicate our 
<br />
thinking in finite time to others. Certainly not the way we think, not 
<br />
even the way the first person canonically associated to the lobian 
<br />
machine can think!).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; building an ingenious edifice of a physical world and its mental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attributes. I disagree with conclusions drawn from 'within boundaries' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (i.e. models) and applied to 'beyond boundaries' (the 'totality?) - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what (conventional science) has a habit to do.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, it is really here that CT can help you to understand how lobian 
<br />
machines can think beyond the boundaries.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (BM):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Science = doubt and modesty. When scientist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pretend to know the truth, they are mad, that's all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (JM): i think - while doubt and modesty are good attributes - there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be some more to it. I could not identify, what, but some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding and ordering of signs(?) we perceive
</em><br />
<br /><br />I hope so!    Indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and i am also realist enough to believe in such)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Me too.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; has also its place in it. There is no &quot;truth&quot; only &quot;my truth&quot; or &quot;your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth&quot;. Experience is (1P) interpretation, even 3P communication.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You confuse perhaps the first hypostasis (0-person pov) and the third 
<br />
one (first pov). Once you are realist enough to admit some reality 
<br />
independent of yourself, you can accept a notion of 0-person point of 
<br />
view, independently of our own inaccuracy in our attempt to describe 
<br />
it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (BM): (on atoms - molecules):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Plotinus (+300) did already understand that such notions were 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistent with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more primitive platonic ideas. Now, I could accept that atoms (the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modern one), like the spherical hypothesis about the earth are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; excellent local theories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (JM):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I try to keep out of comparisons in long obsolete levels in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge-development.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course here we agree, I think, that we disagree. We have discovered 
<br />
many pearls like Newton, Einstein, Godel, the moon, the QM, etc. But 
<br />
that has been made possible by an aristotelian simplification 
<br />
concerning the nature of matter, which has helped scientist to forget 
<br />
for a time the mind body problem. Alas the scientists, without much 
<br />
choice, have abandoned the mind body problem to the  
<br />
&quot;religious-in-the-pejorative-sense&quot; authoritative authorities since 
<br />
+525, about. But things evolve, slowly ... (that's normal!).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Those elements I try to think within are products of the most recent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; advancement. In old times the guys were smart, logical, even wise and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their underdeveloped circumstances may disturb our mind in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speculations in novelties FOR the future development.
</em><br />
<br />OK then,
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I ;ove your distinction of the &quot;local theories&quot; - it may save our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sanity.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Absolutely:  any sound lobian machine has to make those distinctions to 
<br />
