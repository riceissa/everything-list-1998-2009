<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is linked to something said by Russell Standish in his paper

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and in some posts. Russell Standish pretends that (I quote him):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Each self-consistent mathematical structure is completely described
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by a finite set of symbols, axioms and rule.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is totaly incorrect, I'm afraid. It is known that you cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find a recursively enumerable (RE) set of axioms to specify the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (N,+,x) structure (N) of the natural numbers with addition and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiplication. Each RE description of N admit plenty of non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isomorphic models which belongs to any reasonable set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical structures. 
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand this.  Do you have a reference?  I thought that
<br />
such a system as N with operations of addition and multiplication
<br />
are easily definable as a formal system.  I must be missing what 
<br />
you mean by &quot;structure&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And things are worst with sets,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; categories, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course you can guess this from the fact that the set of RE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories are countable, and the set of possible mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure is ... much much bigger, to say the least.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; People should realize that notion like &quot;definability&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;provability&quot; etc. are highly relative mathematical concept, by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which I mean that they are formalism-dependent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;computability&quot; is the first and the last (until now) purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absolute concept, which doesn't depend on the formalism choosed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Godel said that with the computability concept there is some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of miracle. The miracle is the apparent truth of Church's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thesis.
</em><br />
<br />If this hadn't been a reference to Goedel, I'd have been tempted
<br />
to dismiss it.  As it is, I'm merely quite skeptical.  It seems
<br />
to me that computability is just a mathematical formalism like 
<br />
any other, where you define symbols, axioms, and rules.  Whenever
<br />
I hear anyone say that mathematical truths are &quot;relative&quot;, my
<br />
guard goes up.  It's one of the things I didn't like about David
<br />
Deutsch's book.
<br />
<br />IMO, mathematical truths are fundamentally tautologies.  They are
<br />
equivalent to &quot;If A then A&quot;.  I am not one to question formal 
<br />
propositional calculus (the rules for making sylogisms) and 
<br />
therefore I adhere to the belief that mathematical truths are
<br />
absolute, because they are tautologies.  I.e. any correct proof
<br />
of a theorem T based on axioms A, B, and C could be stated 
<br />
simply, &quot;If A, B, and C, then T&quot;.
<br />
<br />So I certainly don't see that computability theory could be in
<br />
any way more fundamental.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is why Tegmark or GSlevy approach, although very interesting,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is still ill-defined. Tegmark will need some powerfull constructive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axiom to give a sufficiently precise sense to the &quot;whole set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of mathematical structures&quot; so that he can make the white
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rabbit disappearing, by isolating the right prior.
</em><br />
<br />His axiom was explicit:  there is one of each structure, up to
<br />
isomorphism.  Making anything useful out of that might be difficult.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schmidhuber has chosen the &quot;right&quot; (absolute) objective realm:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe of computations, but still doesn't realise that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with comp, the prior cannot be defined on the computation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but only on the relative continuation, and this in a &quot;trans-universe&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manner (cf the UDA).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Universal Dovetailer Argument (UDA as I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now call it, hoping Chris appreciates)
</em><br />
<br />Much better!   =:-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; shows also that we must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take into account the continuum.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems that the UDA makes some links between Tegmark and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schmidhuber approach, indeed. Because it shows that with comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some prior needs non RE mathematical structures.
</em><br />
<br />Which brings me to my question:  what is your basis for establishing
<br />
the measure?  I think I understand Juergen's now, that it's based on
<br />
what he calls a &quot;universal prior&quot;, that the measure of each program
<br />
is related to the chance of guessing it -- and is therefore 
<br />
directly related to its length.
<br />
<br />I don't think I understand Hal's post of several weeks ago where he
<br />
discussed that the measure must be related not only to the structure
<br />
but also to the ability to locate that structure within the 
<br />
universe.  But this question is motivated by his post.  I thought 
<br />
that I was comfortable with the idea that a Universal Program, or a
<br />
Universal Dovetailer, or a Great Programmer, would naturally result
<br />
in our witnessing a coherent universe.  I was thinking that Hal and
<br />
others weren't giving enough consideration to the explanatory power
<br />
of the principle of computational indeterminacy.
<br />
<br />But I've since changed my mind.  I am now completely stumped to the
<br />
core.  
<br />
<br />For one thing, I reject Juergen's principle because it is ad hoc.
<br />
I insist that any measure must result from zero information -- that 
<br />
is the whole appeal of the AUH, after all.
<br />
<br />I also reject James Higgo's contention that the WAP can explain it
<br />
all.  After all, I can think of plenty of scenarios where I survive
<br />
but the universe nevertheless acts chaotically.  This doesn't 
<br />
explain the very deep connections I see between my memories and
<br />
what I experience now -- such as the fact that my dog responds to
<br />
the name &quot;Steve&quot;.
<br />
<br />Tegmark says &quot;one of each structure up to isomorphism&quot;.  But now I
<br />
keep thinking that that won't do at all, either.  As the newcomer
<br />
Fritz just recently said:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that every possible state does exist in some world, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it seems safe for me to conclude that there is only one world 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corresponding to every state, and the chance of finding 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ourselves in any possible universe is just as likely as any 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other.  The result would be total chaos.
<br />
<br />If there's one of each, and each has an equal measure, then how come
<br />
I don't find myself embroiled in a chaotic universe?
<br />
<br />Same problem, as far as I can see, with any computational theory.
<br />
Tegmark recently wrote that (paraphrasing) any Turing machine could
<br />
be described as a function on the natural numbers, f(n).  It's 
<br />
state at any time would be n.  Then, it's state at the next time
<br />
interval would be f(n), then f(f(n)), and so on.  This is just a
<br />
HLUT (Huge Look-Up Table).  Now, if all Turing machines exist in
<br />
equal measure, then it seems to me, once again, that we should
<br />
expect chaos.
<br />
<br />I think you've probably written on your solution to this before,
<br />
Bruno, so perhaps I should look back through the archives.  Perhaps
<br />
you could send me a keyword or two to use.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have still a question for Russell, what is the meaning of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; giving a &quot;physical existence&quot; to a mathematical structure ? This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not at all a clear statement for me.
</em><br />
<br />I don't have a problem with this at all.  Tegmark, again, was pretty
<br />
clear:  ME == PE   (Mathematical Existence == Physical Existence).
<br />
