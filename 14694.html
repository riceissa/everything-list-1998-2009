Dear Günther,
<br />
<br /><br />Le 06-mai-08, à 21:19, Günther Greindl a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; - CRH implies COMP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - COMP implies the negation of CRH
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Universality, Sigma_1 completeness, m-completness, creativity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (in Post sense), all those equivalent notion makes sense only through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; complementary notion which are strictly sepaking more complex (non RE,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; productive, ...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The self-introspecting universal machine can hardly miss the inference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of such &quot;realities&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and once she distinguishes the 1, 1-plural, 3-person points of view,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; she has to bet on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the role of the non computable realities (even too much getting not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just randomness,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; like QM, but an hard to compute set of anomalous stories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (white rabbits, coherent but inconsistent dreams).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why does the machine have to bet on these complementary non-RE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; histories? I do not quite see how this arises from 1 and 1-plural POV;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after all, it could be just rec. enumerable continuations?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmmm.... The UDA should just show that, and I am not sure which points 
<br />
you are missing. Suppose there is a physical concrete universe and that 
<br />
a UD is running in it without ever stopping (like in step seven of 
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004Slide.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004Slide.pdf</a>).
<br />
Now, if you agree with the preceding steps, it should be clear that 
<br />
your personal immediate future first person experience is determined by 
<br />
the set of all computations going through your actual state. I agree it 
<br />
is reasonable to consider such computations as equivalent with 
<br />
recursively enumerable sets, but this does not mean that the set of 
<br />
such continuations/computations is recursively enumerable. Actually, 
<br />
such set is not even enumerable, because the UD, stupidly enough, 
<br />
dovetails on some product of each computation with the real (oracle), 
<br />
even the non computable reals. And, given that from a first person 
<br />
point of view we cannot be aware of the infinitely many delays,  we 
<br />
have to take into account, to eliminate white rabbits (or to refute 
<br />
comp) all the possible computations at once, including those 
<br />
dovetailing on the reals or on any non enumerable structure. I have 
<br />
discussed this with Schmidhuber on the list some time ago. The non 
<br />
enumerability of the reals cannot prevent the UD to dovetail on all the 
<br />
reals. From a third person point of view, everything is and remains 
<br />
enumerable, but from the first person point of view, the subjective 
<br />
indeterminacy has as domain something vastly bigger.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schmidhuber's/Tegmarks Computable Universe Hypothesis seems very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attractive: it gives rise to structure, _evolves_ self-aware
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sub-structures, and gives reasonable (?) measure, for instance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schmidhuber's speed prior.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This also takes care of the white rabbit.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Any constructive version of Feynman Integral will take care of the 
<br />
third person white rabbits, but not of the first person white rabbits. 
<br />
When we dream, although we loose soundness (depart from truth) we 
<br />
remain consistent. The problem with comp is that there are a priori to 
<br />
many dreams, too many consistent extensions ... unless *physical 
<br />
reality* emerges from some gluing of *all* the dreams. I am just 
<br />
arguing that for comp to be true, you have to extract a theory of 
<br />
matter/body from first person coherence notions, eventually reducible 
<br />
to notions from computer science/mathematical logic.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It's a bit like &quot;understanding&quot; (putting in a RE set) the (code of) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the total computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; functions, forces us to accept the existence of only partially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable functions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which sometimes (most of the time, see the thesis by Terwijn) have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non recursive domain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK, the ontic part of a comp TOE can be no *more* than Sigma_1 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; complete,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but a non self-computable part of Arithmetical truth and analytical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is needed to get the *internal* measure, we can't even give a name
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to our first person plenitude and things like that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this answers part of my question above. The ontic part is only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Sigma_1 complete stuff; we assume the others for our measure ...
</em><br />
<br /><br />We don't assume the others, we are just confronted to them, like we are 
<br />
confronted to the non stopping programs when we try to capture all 
<br />
stopping programs (successfully, with Church thesis). The very notion 
<br />
of Sigma_1 completeness forces us to accept machine Pi_1 incompleteness 
<br />
(and then machine Sigma_2 incompleteness, etc...). And then the UDA 
<br />
shows that our 1-indeterminacy domain (hopefully plural) is determined 
<br />
by all that non computable stuff.
<br />
In the Whashington-Moscow self-duplication experiment, everything is 
<br />
computable from a third person view, yet you cannot give an algorithm 
<br />
predicting with certainty what precise experience you will feel to have 
<br />
in your immediate future when you undergo it. Why do you expect a 
<br />
computable reality when confronted with the whole deployment of the UD, 
<br />
where you are reconstituted infinitely often in all consistent 
<br />
extensions?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  ... but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my claim is that they do not give rise to first person experience.
</em><br />
<br /><br />By assumption (comp), first person experiences rise from some amount of 
<br />
computations. But then the UD shows that you cannot know in any way 
<br />
which computations generate your mind, and that your 1-expectations is 
<br />
determined by all such computations. Now, empirically our expectations 
<br />
are given by &quot;physical laws&quot;. But if that is true, and if comp is true 
<br />
too, those two ways to infer realities have to fit, so we have to 
<br />
derive the physical laws from a sort of sum/mean/average-calculation on 
<br />
*all* computations (even those with non computable oracle).
<br />
What I try to explain is that to solve the mind body problem, with comp 
<br />
you have to justify the apparent computability of the observable 
<br />
reality. You have to reduce somehow the body (physics) to the mind 
<br />
(which, assuming comp is more easy: it is mainly computer 
<br />
science/mathematical logic).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the central question is this: _what_ does the Arithemetic Truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of whatever simulate? Reality at a granular level (like in the CA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach, Zuse's Rechnender Raum) - that is what I would assume - that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality at the lowest level is a number-relation; but that awareness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only arises in these domains as a higher oder abstraction.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I can agree with this. The devil is in the details. Well, things get 
<br />
more complex when you realize that the ontic has to be universal, and 
<br />
that the physical (first person plural) has to emerge from all 
<br />
computations. Each computation is computable (of course), but the 
<br />
problem is in the *all*.
<br />
Even between two discrete steps of any computation going through your 
<br />
actual experience, there will be infinitely many computations going 
<br />
through those steps.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you assume that the Sigma_1 sentences give the OMs directly, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ....
</em><br />
<br />Yes, in the sense that the UD generates succesively all 3-OMs.
<br />
No, in the sense that, by being unaware of any delays raised by the UD, 
<br />
our 1-OM are never generated. We can only experience them, personnally, 
<br />
and they depends on the whole structure bearing on *all* 1- OMs.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that correct? So in your view there is no underlying reality; QM and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stuff like that is only an &quot;illusion&quot;. Am I correct in how I interpret
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your theory?
</em><br />
<br />Well yes ok, with the proviso repeated just above. And then a 
<br />
vocabulary remark. In general &quot;illusion&quot; is a bit a pejorative. I would 
<br />
prefer to say that QM and stuff like that are &quot;emerging&quot; . Given that 
<br />
dreams and illusions are related to complex (uncomputable) sets of 
<br />
computations, they obey rational principles, and, from a deep and 
<br />
important perspective, they kick back and are not all illusionary. But 
<br />
you are right, physics emerge from dream multiplication in the 
<br />
universal deployment.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Perhaps this is why the Intelligible has been discovered (Plato) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; before the &quot;ONE&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (Plotin). It is far bigger. With comp you can restrict the ontic to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Universal Machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (the baby ONE),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ok, I'm with you this far.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but its intelligible realm is well beyond its grasp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For me, the intelligible can be only a (proper?) subset of the ontic.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ok, this is a bit subtle. I have been wrong myself often on things like 
<br />
that. I mention one example: the set of total computable functions is a 
<br />
proper part of the set of all (strictly partial and strictly total) 
<br />
computable functions. But the set of total computable functions (TOT) 
<br />
is far more complex than the set of partial computable functions (PFC). 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;PFC is Sigma_0, TOT is Pi_2.
<br />
A simpler example: nothing is more simple than a dense rectangle. The 
<br />
Mandelbrot set if far more complex. yet, the Mandelbrot set is a proper 
<br />
part of that rectangle. A subset can be more complex that a superset.
<br />
Another example; Everett universal wave is very simple (not only 
<br />
computable but linear!), yet it generates branches with observers 
<br />
confronted to the ten thousand non linear and even non computable 
<br />
(1)-stories.
<br />
Yet another example: there is no program capable of generating Chaïtin 
<br />
Omega number, and generating *only* Chaïtin Omega number; yet, the UD, 
<br />
or even simpler programs,  generates it easily ... *among* all the 
<br />
binary sequences.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How could something that does not exist (ontic) be intelligible?
</em><br />
<br />James Watson, a reductionist,  says that only atoms exist. For him 
<br />
molecules are already a construct of the mind. Yet molecules are 
<br />
certainly intelligible for him (given that he has discovered the double 
<br />
helix DNA).
<br />
Does a Bridge Play exist? Does a nation exist?
<br />
I prefer to say, contra Watson, that molecules, Bridge Plays, and 
<br />
Nations, and People exist. The doubt is about the bottom, and I need no 
<br />
more than numbers with addition and multiplication to explain how 
<br />
stable and lawful illusions *exist* in the emerging and epistemic 
<br />
sense. But then this move predicts that if I look at the bottom, and if 
<br />
I want to say precise things about it (with all &quot;decimals&quot; correct), 
<br />
then I have to take into account almost everything, both ontic and 
<br />
epistemic (to be short).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would you say that this is mathematical imagination?
</em><br />
<br />If you agree that imagination exist, or at least follows laws.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; All this is related to the fact, already understood by Judson Webb,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that comp is truly a vaccine against reductionist theories of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have the Webb book on my desk and have glanced occasionally inside, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   looks like a wonderful book, but I have not yet had the time to study
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it in detail.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I wonder - why do you say that comp is not reductionist?
</em><br />
<br /><br />In Philosophy of mind the term &quot;reductionist&quot; is often used for the 
<br />
reduction of mind to matter. Comp forbids this (assuming com, assuming 
<br />
I am correct, etc.). Of course you are left over with a reduction of 
<br />
matter (physics) to mind (computer science/mathematical logic).
<br />
Comp is also non reductionist in insisting that &quot;saying yes to the 
<br />
doctor&quot; has to be an act of faith, which eventually has to be a purely 
<br />
personal decision. If you bet on comp, and if you &quot;understand&quot; comp, 
<br />
you know you cannot be proselyte about it. It *is* a personal 
<br />
&quot;religion&quot;, despite its pure scientific consequences which can only be 
<br />
used to refute it, never to make it a definitive statement. (I know we 
<br />
will be in trouble when we will practice comp because some of us will 
<br />
take their own survival as some kind of proof of comp, but personal 
<br />
survival is (scientifically) never communcable.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For me comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is reductionist - mind as the working of computation (I am pro
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reductionist, that is not a negative word in my view).
</em><br />
<br />No problem as far as you see that computation has to be used in a 
<br />
mathematical sense, contra Landauer and Deutsch who believes that 
<br />
computation has to be reduced to the natural science.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, two questions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) At what level do your Sigma_1 sentence operate? OM's directly (I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would interpret your paper in this way) or low level (more like a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classical physical/digital physics view)?
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is a bit ambiguous. The true (and thus provable by universal 
<br />
theorem prover machine (universal for computability, not provability, 
<br />
but Sigma_1-provability universal) Sigma_1 sentences can correspond to 
<br />
the 3-OMs, or to the &quot;mental state&quot; generated by the UD. But their 
<br />
relative uncertainty first person measure (cf RSSA) are given by the 
<br />
density (for some topology I try to derive with the lobian interview) 
<br />
of their proofs-computation (those things are isomorphic because we 
<br />
restrict ourselves to the Sigma_1 sentences).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) You say that the ontic part is computable (in this sense, I would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   COMP does _not_ refute CRH?) Because what &quot;is&quot; that is not ontic? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be contradiction in terms?
</em><br />
<br />Well, this is related to the (rather hot) debate on &quot;emergence&quot;.  I 
<br />
have a Pythagorean-Kroneckerian slogan. All what exist &quot;ontically&quot; are 
<br />
the natural numbers, together with their additive and multiplicative 
<br />
structures. All the rest, including physics, exists as well, but not 
<br />
ontically. It emerges epistemically from the way the intrinsical 
<br />
ignorance of numbers about numbers (and sequences of numbers, etc.) 
<br />
structure itself.
<br />
<br />Now, that &quot;intrinsical ignorance&quot; is (with comp) what Godel has 
<br />
discovered, and others (Lob, Solovay, + Post, Church, Turing ...) have 
<br />
seen its structure; rather well captured by the modal logic G and G*, 
<br />
and especially G* \minus G. That led to the Lobian interview ...
<br />
<br />Please ask any questions. Be sure you have completely grasp the first 
<br />
person comp indeterminacy before anything else (but the 1-3 distinction 
<br />
of course). I do not pretend that all this is easy stuff, nor that I am 
<br />
always clear about it. The problem is that what is simple for some is 
<br />
difficult for others and vice versa.
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
