&quot;Comp is false&quot;. Let's see where *that* leads. I'm erecting
<br />
this as a signpost to indicate a direction, and I would beg the
<br />
list's indulgence in helping me to look in this direction, rather
<br />
than confining its comments to the ramshackle construction of the
<br />
signpost itself. My hope is that you will help me to expose whatever is
<br />
untrue or confused about what follows (I'm sure you will!). But I
<br />
hope you will also 'catch my drift'.
<br />
<br />1)	The bit-stream
<br />
<br />Comp deals with a bit-stream representation of appearance. The theorems
<br />
of comp process this bit-stream in terms of a formal system, creating a
<br />
framework within which 'true or 'false' theorems may be
<br />
evaluated. This system is by its nature closed, or tautological. The
<br />
statements that can be made, their 'truth' or 'falsehood', are
<br />
inherent in the axiomatic and operational characteristics of the formal
<br />
system as applied to the bit-stream.
<br />
<br />2)	The instantiation
<br />
<br />In order to implement the comp approach, an instantiation is required
<br />
that will represent the bit-stream and enact the formal operations. The
<br />
Turing machine is an idealised version of such an instantiation. A
<br />
digital computer is a physical version of a TM. Consequently comp may
<br />
be instantiated in a digital computer, and copied in innumerable media
<br />
that suitably preserve its informational structure.
<br />
<br />3)	Dimensionality
<br />
<br />The bit-stream is 'pure' information and as such is 0-dimensional.
<br />
Multi-dimensionality emerges only at the level of the active
<br />
instantiation of the bit-stream. Consequently what is Turing-emulable
<br />
is the bit-stream (which includes a statement of the required formal
<br />
operations - i.e. the program) and because this emulation is
<br />
0-dimensional, it is indifferent to form ('substrate-independent').
<br />
Also because it is 0-dimensional, it is inherently powerless to
<br />
interact directly with multi-dimensional reality. All such interaction
<br />
takes place because what is implicit in the bit-stream is rendered
<br />
explicit by its multi-dimensional instantiation. Although we may speak
<br />
metaphorically (i.e. 'as if' projecting 'form' on to it) of the
<br />
bit-stream as 'representational' in a virtual 0-dimensional sense,
<br />
this is powerless as such to cause any interaction with the
<br />
multi-dimensional environment. To do this requires that additional
<br />
information, merely implicit in the bit-stream, is rendered explicit by
<br />
the instantiation.
<br />
<br />If we consider an 'intelligent program' instantiated in a digital
<br />
computer, 'explicit form' - multi-dimensionality - is 'added
<br />
back' at the interfaces where the machine interacts with the external
<br />
environment. For example, a display device transforms the bit-stream
<br />
into pixels in a 2-dimensional arrangement. At the next 'layer' up,
<br />
a user decides whether to interpret the 2-dimensional arrangements
<br />
semantically (i.e. 'these are symbols') or graphically (i.e.
<br />
'this is a quasi-3-dimensional scene'). Up another layer, and the
<br />
user transforms these judgements into direct interaction with a
<br />
multi-dimensional environment.
<br />
<br />All pure bit-stream representations rely on implicit environmental
<br />
assumptions in order to 'execute' as intended. DNA, for example,
<br />
relies for its expression both on its multi-dimensional orientation in
<br />
space, and the materials present in the local environment. This
<br />
information is not present, though implicit, in the codons, but is
<br />
*made explicit* by the environment that instantiates them.
<br />
<br />4)	Form
<br />
<br />The 'physical' description of the world, as I was rightly reminded
<br />
by Peter, has no significant layering (well, perhaps it does, but more
<br />
later). Appearance, however, displays complex layering, and as we have
<br />
seen, this also 'appears' to extend to the intelligibility of the
<br />
world in which we 'appear' to participate. 'Form' and
<br />
'layering' somehow emerge from whatever the physical model
<br />
describes as a bit-stream. When we experience and interact with the
<br />
world, we do so in a way that is inherently multi-dimensional. What is
<br />
represented in this way is directly 'grasped' or 'enacted'
<br />
(i.e. represented, structured) in multi-dimensional 'form' and
<br />
unfolded by multi-dimensional 'motor units' into action in a
<br />
multi-dimensional world. This is both what makes it non-invariant to
<br />
Turing-emulation, and gives it its direct multi-dimensional linkage to
<br />
enaction in multi-dimensional environments. Certainly, 0-dimensional
<br />
bit-stream representations and pathways are entailed in such processes,
<br />
but they serve to store and transmit information, not to enact its
<br />
meaning or its consequences in the world  - i.e. its intentionality
<br />
as information-put-into-action.
<br />
<br />5)	Correlation
<br />
<br />How is the above to be correlated with the physical or bit-stream
<br />
representation? Through appropriate forms. We already know this from
<br />
the fertility of 'laws of form' that are intrinsic to science as
<br />
practised - whether physical, chemical, biological, physiological,
<br />
psychological, sociological, and so on up the 'levels'. At each
<br />
level, 'laws of form' are abstracted that render this world-view
<br />
intelligible, although they are not directly implied at the level below
<br />
- hence Peter's comment about the 'lack of layering'. So,
<br />
consider the brain. We can approach this through the lens of a variety
<br />
of forms - squidgy grey mass, neural network, bio-electrical
<br />
circuitry, neuro-chemical pathways, etc. - even 'digital
<br />
computer'. None of these has yet succeeded in capturing a 'formal
<br />
decomposition' that yields appearance, or even a mechanism that seems
<br />
capable of enacting the construction of  multi-dimensional
<br />
representation as experienced.
<br />
<br />However, as the above analogies indicate, this is not a fruitless task,
<br />
but an empirical one. There have been, and still are, innumerable
<br />
'formal decompositions' of the world that have served only to
<br />
multiply mystery. The world, as we know, stands on the backs of an
<br />
infinite stack of turtles, and motion is accomplished through the
<br />
efforts of an innumerable insensible angelic host. ????? .......... We
<br />
should be looking for a 'formal decomposition' of the brain that
<br />
embraces both isomorphic representation of, and direct
<br />
multi-dimensional interaction with, the external environment of the
<br />
body, and beyond it the world. We should expect these forms to
<br />
'construct boundaries', the 'lines of cleavage' that do not
<br />
exist in the 0-dimensional physical description. We should ask - from
<br />
either side of this cleavage - 'who is looking, listening, tasting
<br />
what lies on the other side?' The 'side' that is able to answer
<br />
these questions intelligibly by enacting its responses in the world is
<br />
the 'perceiver'. The other is the 'perceptual model'.
<br />
<br />The explicit multi-dimensional 'grasp' of form is what I contend
<br />
makes all this non-invariant to Turing emulation. Note that I've not
<br />
said 'non-Turing emulable', since anything that can be represented
<br />
as a bit-stream may be Turing-emulated, but the issue here is whether
<br />
multi-dimensional experience and enaction is invariant to such
<br />
emulation. My claim is that it can't be, because it requires the
<br />
instantiation to explicitly 'add back' the missing information that
<br />
is only implicit in the 0-dimensional  emulated bit-stream. It is this
<br />
that makes multi-dimensional environments 'non-invariant to
<br />
computation', as opposed to 'non-computable'.  This is IMO the
<br />
'understanding' - the multi-dimensional enaction of
<br />
multi-dimensionally-represented information - to which, for example,
<br />
Penrose appeals as the source of mathematical intuition. It isn't
<br />
Platonic reality to which the mathematician, or any of us, has direct
<br />
access, but rather the multi-dimensional forms from which these
<br />
'perfect' concepts are abstracted.
<br />
<br />6)	Indexical existence
<br />
<br />Missing information? Surely this isn't the dreaded 'hidden
<br />
variables'? I don't think it is. The missing information is what
<br />
(some of us) are trying to express by 'I assert my indexical
<br />
existence as a necessary fact'. This 'information' is entirely
<br />
absent from the physical or other formal (virtual, or what we've
<br />
sometimes rather unfortunately called 3rd-person) accounts of
<br />
appearance/ reality. It expresses itself self-referentially, and this
<br />
expression has 'qualities' (again what we perhaps unfortunately
<br />
call 'qualia', but  let it serve). I contend that qualia carry the
<br />
meaning *like this!*, or more simply *this!*. From such 'codons'
<br />
worlds of  'thisness' emerge. Since 'thisness' is at the same
<br />
time the instantiation of the multi-dimensional environment, the
<br />
'thisness' of experience' can transform directly to the
<br />
'thisness' of enaction in the world. This is what we call meaning
<br />
and intentionality. The project of mapping and correlating our accounts
<br />
of the world-as-appearance-and-meaning and the world-as-structure has
<br />
been well-termed 'Dual-aspect Science'. Let's get on with it.
<br />
<br /><br />7)	Mass, space, gravity
<br />
<br />If the foregoing is speculative, what follows is ruminative. Having
<br />
dismissed 'form' as significant in a physical decomposition of
<br />
reality, does this perhaps force a re-appearance at the point where QM
<br />
collides with General Relativity - i.e. where the bit-stream hits the
<br />
instantiation? Curved space, gravitational interaction - these seem
<br />
intrinsically geometrical/ topological/ 'shaped' ideas. Is there
<br />
any analogy here to the relationship of formal description to
<br />
instantiation? I wonder.....
