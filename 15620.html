<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nobody

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; predicted that would happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; How do you know that?  Maybe it was quite predictable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Except nobody did predict it. That's my point. It was perfectly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; obvious why only after the event. Police checks, medical checks etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; revealed the pattern that pointed to the causation. Before the event,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this information was available too. Nobody saw anything tending or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pending in the information beforehand.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some people saw it.  For example W saw a report titled &quot;Bin Laden to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strike in U.S.&quot;  An FBI agent was told that some middle eastern guy  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taking lessons in flying an airliner but wasn't interested in learning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to land it.  I'd say that in this case the difficulty is that while  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relevant information was available, so was irrelevant information and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the irrelevant information was so much greater it swamped the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relevant.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yessir!. So - we are surely in agreement that we MUST get some  
<br />
technique happening for looking at information with more effective  
<br />
starting concepts! If we just say - &quot;give me all the data and I'll  
<br />
sort through it&quot; we've got ten years of bloody work ahead of us.  
<br />
Meanwhile, the terrorists have struck and we haven't even left the  
<br />
starting gate. That's what I mean by &quot;the evolving and accelerating  
<br />
universe&quot;. In fact, the guy who murdered his co-worker with the shovel  
<br />
was a fundamentalist Islamic. His co-worker said to him as they dug  
<br />
the trench &quot;did you hear about that guy who stuck a copy of the Koran  
<br />
down a toilet in the USA and filmed it to post on YouTube? What a  
<br />
lark!!!!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;ALLAHU AKHBAR!!!!&quot;  - DOING!!!!!!!!!! (with the shovel)
<br />
<br /><br />The police knew this guy attended a dodgy, fundamentalist Madrassah  
<br />
when he was a kid, and even that he had pinups of Bin Laden in his  
<br />
bedroom. But then - so what? Lots of Islamics have pinups of Bin Laden  
<br />
in their bedroom.....are they all murderers?
<br />
<br />The problem is that information arrives PIECE by PIECE - one item at a  
<br />
time. Even if it arrives as a tsunami of data on your computer, you  
<br />
can only successfully review it piece by piece (if you appreciate the  
<br />
limitations of how the brain works) and you are doing your job  
<br />
properly. The temptation to shove it all into some &quot;wonder  
<br />
(Microsoft?) application&quot; which will sort through all of it and find  
<br />
the patterns, becomes overwhelming, once the data reaches a critical  
<br />
volume. I mean - fuck!!! - what were computers invented for??????
<br />
<br />One can only make the optimum use of the AVAILABLE information at any  
<br />
one moment. You have a massive problem here where you are drowning in  
<br />
the available information - as the 9/11 observers were.
<br />
<br />There are TRILLIONS of web pages floating around in cyberspace. Which  
<br />
are the good ones and which are the dodgy ones? How can you tell? Do  
<br />
you actually have the TIME to sort through all this shit, dear Brent?  
<br />
Your boss wants an outcome and a decision by YESTERDAY
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Schoolteachers have to do &quot;Risk assessments&quot; to evaluate the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; possibility of harm to students on excursion. Studies have shown that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; risk assessments do nothing to reduce the incidence of accidents or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; misadventure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course predictions an analyses, however accurate, are useless if no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one acts on them.  If the schoolteacher notes that sunburn is a likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hazard but she doesn't bring any sunblock is it an accident?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes, where the teacher was instructed to fill out a risk assessment  
<br />
accurately and that was the end of the matter (it usually is). NOBODY  
<br />
told her she actually had to READ the bloody Risk Assessment and ACT  
<br />
on what it suggests. Teachers aren't taught to THINK for themselves or  
<br />
to &quot;join up the dots&quot;. They merely do what they are told in their  
<br />
Diploma of Education which is usually taught by over-superannuated  
<br />
academics with no experience of life or teaching ability themselves,  
<br />
lecturing off yellowing handwritten notes they slung together in the  
<br />
1960s. They then pass this servile, dickhead mentality on to the kids  
<br />
they teach. And the world goes down the toilet....but I can see from  
<br />
later on that you probably agree with me on this!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I'm very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; familiar with risk assessments and how worthless they are. I work at a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; major missile test range where risk assessments are required for every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; test.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I love people who get down and get their hands dirty - you are my hero  
<br />
Brent (truly - no condescension implied here)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The main reason they are worthless is that they *necessarily*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; include only risks we've thought of.
</em><br />
<br /><br />EXACTLY dear boy! So - how can we do the &quot;quantum leap &quot; (love that  
<br />
term) in our thinking and simulate alternative pending futures????  
<br />
GUARANTEED:  ONE of them is going to grab our present like a bloody  
<br />
Star Wars tractor beam and haul us toward it...there is no guarantee  
<br />
that the one that wins the gravitational tug-of-war is the one we  
<br />
would want - (from our present perspective) to win it.
<br />
<br /><br />&quot;If you don't create your future, you will end up somewhere  
<br />
else&quot; (Somebody or Other)
<br />
<br /><br />The conclusions reached from of all of our data analyses can never be  
<br />
more correct than our starting concepts. No logical processing, no  
<br />
matter how technologically miraculous, can justify an arbitrary set of  
<br />
starting premises. All starting premises are dodgy or arbitrary. Why?  
<br />
They are based on WHAT WE BELIEVE.
<br />
<br />People choose their starting premises based on how they feel when they  
<br />
get up in the morning. Nobody should EVER ask me to solve a problem in  
<br />
the morning before I have downed at least one cup of strong coffee
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Any risk we've thought of has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already been the object of efforts to reduce it's probability to a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; low level, typically 0.001.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Go on
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Of course the probability there is some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; risk we haven't thought of is greater than 0.001 - so it's almost  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the risk we hadn't thought of that bites us.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Like when the school teacher falls under a bus and the class has to  
<br />
find their own way home on public transport  ;-)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Accidents simply happen. Accidents are still determined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; by something. We call it an accident only because we have no way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; before it happens of knowing that the cotter pin in the driving arm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; was about to shear off leaving the train without an effective brake
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; system. Once the plane crashes, the black box reveals most of what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; wish we had known beforehand.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The problem is TIME - the sequence of the arrival of information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; determines how we look at it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is also TIME as in the man hours it takes to know about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Already commented on this syndrome, above. You &quot;have my deepest  
<br />
sympathy&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  We have a way to knowing whether that cotter pin was about to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shear off - but it's expensive and time consuming to implement; so we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't go around x-raying cotter pins for micro-cracks.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Why not? Do you think you have something more important to do or  
<br />
something? Next time I get on a bloody Qantas jet and the bloody wing  
<br />
falls off I'll give you a call, Meeker!!! (that's if I survive the  
<br />
bloody flight)
<br />
<br />Get a good lawyer, engineer man!!!!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  We may require
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; replacing the periodically, but that can be expensive to.  So a some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level we decide things are *good enough*.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All it takes is one well-fought litigation and you will be spending  
<br />
your bloody Sundays doing quadruple-checks on aircraft maintenance  
<br />
routines
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  For example, do you know how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many people were killed in accidents, hijackings, and terrorist events
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on U.S. airlines and airliners flying in U.S. airspace between Nov  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2001
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Oct 2005?   The answer is zero.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Good point. Analogy: every time some idiot jumps into the Pacific  
<br />
Ocean and gets their leg bitten off by a fish, people go out in boats  
<br />
and try to find and kill the poor fish. Well - I've never seen a shark  
<br />
walking down Main Street biting people's heads off. The sea is the  
<br />
fish's domain. You jump into it at your own risk, surely
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We can 'determine' the reasons for this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; event only AFTER it happens, even though it was determined by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something that we might have noticed prior to the event if only we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been able to. All action can be seen as logically determined in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hindsight.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; You must not have heard of quantum mechanics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I have. I am clearly speaking about the macro world where time  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; travels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (apparently) in one direction only and there is this tendency for an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; action to be followed by an effect or another action. 'Action' in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; context refers mainly to the activity of conscious agents, humans. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; may yet be shown that protons and quarks have 'agency' but that is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; really at issue here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may also be that random atomic events may be amplified by chaotic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamics, in the weather or in brains, to have macro consequences.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is truly an exciting thought, Brent. You have just raised my  
<br />
blood-pressure pleasingly
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; And how can you know the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; causes seen in hindsight are correct.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Not causes - merely that there existed a logical pattern of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; connections that led from A through to D that we were blind to at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; time. If, in hindsight we do not spot the logical connections then we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have no way of understanding the event at all. I guess there may well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be examples of that, too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;logical pattern&quot; may just be our rationalization of what  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happened.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Humans are good a seeing patterns in activities and also in clouds.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is so true. Why we need to study this thing more. I just saw the  
<br />
Virgin Mary in the pattern created by my cat's vomit on the living  
<br />
room rug...
<br />
<br />The mind acts to create patterns, to receive patterns, to recognize  
<br />
patterns and to use patterns but NEVER to CHANGE patterns. Why we all  
<br />
need to learn Japanese in our 80s to keep our neurons healthy.
<br />
<br />Lateral Thinking is the ONLY tool man has ever invented to swap patterns
<br />
<br />NO idea can make the best use of available information; an idea arises  
<br />
from a sequential patterning system
<br />
<br />To change petterns (or de-wire neuronal connections) you need  
<br />
DISCONTINUITY which is what Lateral Thinking offers
<br />
<br />HUMOUR is an act of discontinuity. Laughter is the natural human  
<br />
response to a pattern switch in the brain

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hitler, in his bunker a few days before he killed himself,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complained to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Speer, &quot;You know, Albert. This is all the Jews' fault. They  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deliberately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; started this war just so they could destroy the German people.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />In his own logic bubble he was perfectly right. If you were Hitler,  
<br />
you would have understood his logic. He had this EMOTIONAL NEED to  
<br />
make the Jews responsible for his egregious actions. Hitler was a  
<br />
solipsist. He was also a one-testicle fuckwit who happened to be  
<br />
running Germany
<br />
<br />Hitler was the victim of the patterns of recognition installed in his  
<br />
mental software. So too Saddam. So too Mugabe, So too W. So too

(insert name of favourite despot)
<br />
<br /><br />SO TOO YOU AND ME!!!!!!

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Modeling the past is hard too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; In what sense do we know why the terrorists flew planes in the WTC?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Because everything we already knew about them before the event was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; still available to us after the event. After the event, everyone  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; see the powerful pattern in the data that they were blind to before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the event. In a sense we knew this COULD happen. We simply could not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; predict that they would make the decision to act on what everybody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (intelligence agancies, CIA etc.) already were aware of.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; None of that answers the &quot;why&quot; question.  What motivated them?  Did  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;hate our freedom&quot;?  Or did they act out of revenge for something we

<br /><br />They are simply JEALOUS

<br />How dare we rule the world with our non-existent Christian deity???!!!
<br />
<br />The Islamic non-existent deity is much more deserving than the  
<br />
Christian one!!!!
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Before something happens is where we would like to be more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on top of things. Intelligence exists on terrorism but usually this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; usually fails to determine our actions to prevent terrorist acts,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interestingly enough. If you look closely at what I am saying, it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the rather messy human consciousness part of the equation that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; SPOILS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the mathematical modelling in most cases.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure.  Humans and even most animals are extremely complicated.  Even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; things like weather and viscous flow over an aircraft are to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; complicated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to model except approximately over a limited range.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am saying that a full
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perceptual scan of the situation often takes us way beyond what the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; data suggests. Just like the Mumbai massacre - intelligence WAS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; available that suggested it could happen. Yet the massacre was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;allowed&quot; to happen, because nobody could see the looming pattern  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the data until after it happened by which time it was bleeding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to one and all. It seems that in many situations the sheer volume  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; information available is as much a part of the problem as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; decision-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; making process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Right.  The &quot;obvious&quot; pattern is picked out in hindsight and some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;obvious&quot; pattern would have been picked out in hindsight no matter  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had happened.  I don't see how lateral thinking is going to do  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to solve the problem of too much data.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />The paradox of the human mind is that because it has such a poor  
<br />
memory for data, it has an excellent processor. The absence of hard  
<br />
information has never been an obstacle to the human mind to having a  
<br />
good story or theory about what is going on. Hence myth, hence  
<br />
story=telling, hence the Bible, hence astrology. The patterns of  
<br />
recognition really DO work. We could not get by without them. If the  
<br />
mind was unable to make the optimum use of the available data at any  
<br />
given moment we would be annihilated whenever we crossed the road. We  
<br />
have to have an understanding, or at least a theory about what is  
<br />
going on at any given instant. That is how we live from moment to  
<br />
moment. The bummer about all of this is that we cannot CHANGE patterns  
<br />
easily, as Johnny Mikes mentions. We are unable to adapt to the  
<br />
evolving universe easily. We are mired in our own history. It is as  
<br />
though we were constantly driving the car with our eyes fastened on  
<br />
the rear view mirror.
<br />
<br />Something new is only ever understood in the light of something  
<br />
already known and filed away. Lateral Thinking is the solution.  
<br />
Lateral thinking jumps off the rails and shows us the sidetrack that  
<br />
leads straight to the desirable outcome that we missed because we were  
<br />
being oh so logical.
<br />
<br />There is a great logic in being illogical at critical moments.
<br />
<br />The 9/11 bombers did precisely that. In some respects 9/11 was a  
<br />
grandiose display of Lateral Thinking.
<br />
<br />When is a jetliner not a jetliner? When it's a bomb....
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How do we decide? Data alone are incapable of making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; decisions. You still need a wet, messy human brain with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perceptually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; skilled mind to do that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; And apparently that doesn't work all that well either.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No it doesn't, if we only feed information and data into computers  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; expect the computer to do our thinking for us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's a strawman.  Nobody was feeding data to a computer and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expecting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it to anticipate the 9/11 or Mumbai attacks. Those oversights were  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by wet, messy human brains.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />You seem to love begging the question, but that's OK. This whole  
<br />
discussion is about the problems caused by wet, messy human brains  
<br />
(WMHB) in the face of genius mathematical analyses and solutions
<br />
<br /><br />Better get used to the WMHB amigo, you cannot leave home without it
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Creativity is not a matter of whether a particular idea is right or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; wrong. Creativity is not a matter of finding the best way of putting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; certain things together. Creativity is a matter of trying to get at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what has been left out of the original way of looking at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; situation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But you don't know that anything significant has been left out until  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are surprised by events.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The greatest of life's tragedies, surely. What I have been saying all  
<br />
along
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  There's nothing creative in just pointing to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things that have been left out - there are always an infinite number  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things that are left out.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, if there are an infinite number of omissions, we might as well  
<br />
stay in bed and refuse to go to work.
<br />
<br />Surely we can work out how to process data more efficiently than just  
<br />
throwing our hands into the air and saying &quot;It's too hard&quot; like this
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In calculating flow over an aircraft I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leave out ionization of the air because it's not going to fly Mach  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can leave out the gravitational pull of the Moon because it's too  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weak.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are there other things I've left out?  Sure.  The question is are they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significant.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The effort you make in looking at all these things is worth it, in the  
<br />
long run. Don't judge prematurely the value of things. Maybe the  
<br />
moon's gravitational pull is negligent, but there will be other  
<br />
&quot;negligent&quot; things like this that stack up. Try to separate  
<br />
information gathering from information processing. A hundred negligent  
<br />
things will, in total, add up to one big fat effect. We are in too big  
<br />
a hurry - but then, the boss is breathing down our necks
<br />
<br />I'm trying to help, not hinder, Brent. I know you are deeply concerned  
<br />
by the efficacy of your information processing. My life depends on  
<br />
your information processing ability every time I get on a flight.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; One can never get at this simply by judging the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; effectiveness of a particular way of looking at the situation. All of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; our mathematical formalities of calculating and predicting things are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; marvellous, wonderful and highly effective methods. I would be a fool
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to suggest otherwise. I in no sense advocate that we get rid of them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I suggest though, that we supplement them with creative thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because this allows us to avoid or at best sidestep the traps of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; purely logical, vertical thinking. It is not a question of stopping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; doing something we are already doing. It is not a question of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; changing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something we are already doing. It is a question of starting to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something we are not yet doing - or doing at best, only half- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; heartedly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe you do it half-heartedly, the test engineers I know make a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; career
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of it.  Nothing makes them happier than to discover a potential  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nobody else thought of.
</em><br />
<br /><br />See my last comment, above
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;  Calculations about what humans will do is hard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; because knowing what's in their brains is hard and because there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; good models
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So it appears then that we are in perfect agreement. Don't try and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MINIMISE the problem, Brent! The &quot;wet, messy, human brain/mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; problem&quot; is THE problem!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A few paragraphs above, it was the solution: &quot;You still need a wet,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; messy human brain with a perceptually skilled mind to do that.&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computers and calculation was the problem.
</em><br />
<br /><br />We are simply STUCK with the WMHB. It is the problem AND the solution.  
<br />
If you can get anything happening without a WMHB then I want you to  
<br />
stop holding back and tell us how you do it!!!
<br />
<br /><br />(Big snip follows where we seem to agree with each other)
<br />
<br /><br />Love talking to you Mr Get Down and Get Dirty Engineer Man. Where  
<br />
would civilisation be without hunks like you!!!
<br />
<br />You have my deepest respect
<br />
<br /><br />Kim
