<br />
Hello indeed, I'm new here, having just recently found Max Tegmark's paper
<br />
on Theories Of Everything.  I was kind of enthralled, because that's
<br />
roughly speaking, my 'religion'.  I wasn't previously entirely sure how to
<br />
phrase it, but having read the aforementioned paper clarified things.
<br />
<br />Now Max supposes that 'mathematical existence' is equivalent to 'physical
<br />
existence', or at least 'mathematical existence' implies 'physical
<br />
existence'.  I basically agree, but have a few small(?) problems with it,
<br />
but also solutions.  My main objection is this - how do we know that *our*
<br />
mathematical system is the only such system?  What would it mean if there
<br />
were other systems?  To be a little more concrete, we know that there are
<br />
axioms which are independant of the basic set theory axioms (such as the
<br />
axiom of choice (right?)) which allows *us* to build diffent mathematical
<br />
systems.  Isn't this rather strange and worrying for Max's supposition?
<br />
<br />As I said, I propose a possible way out of this pickle.  I realised that
<br />
the important thing about all our mathematics is that their underlying
<br />
structure is *invariant* of the precise description chosen.  Max gives the
<br />
example of boolean algebra with differing number of symbols.  So suppose
<br />
we presume:
<br />
<br />(S) Structure which exist are precisely those structures which are
<br />
invariant of their description.
<br />
<br />Okay, this is a little vague, but we have to be vague somewhere to bridge
<br />
the gap between 'I' and 'everything else'.  At least this puts the vague
<br />
bits in the same place.  We also presume that our universe exists.  An
<br />
immediate question which would need addressing is:
<br />
<br />If the structure X exists, is X a description of X?
<br />
<br />I'm not sure this is a good idea, it would need some serious thinking
<br />
about... but anyway.  Now things get interesting, since we can pretty much
<br />
deduce Max's supposition from the above (the weaker version at least) as
<br />
follows.
<br />
<br />Say we have some mathematical structure X which we have *actually*
<br />
described (the structure is described in papers/books/electronically or
<br />
whatever).  The point about such structures is that we can demonstrate
<br />
that, as far as it is possible for us to tell, such structures are
<br />
invariant of description (if we are talking about isomorphism classes,
<br />
perhaps).  Also, and importantly, because
<br />
<br />(i) Our universe exists
<br />
(ii) Our universe contains a substructure which describes X
<br />
(iii) X is (as far as we can tell???) invariant of its description
<br />
<br />we may deduce, assuming (S) of course that X exists (in it's 'own right').
<br />
<br />The good thing about this approach is that it *doesn't* assume there is
<br />
only one system of mathematics (if mathematics is the art of describing
<br />
structures which are invariant of their description??).  Nor does it
<br />
presume that because *we* can demonstrate something, it is impossible for
<br />
something to be demonstrated (ie proven).
<br />
<br />I've got lost more thoughts on this, but lets leave it there for now.  I
<br />
ought to be tidying my room for my house inspection tomorrow.  *doh*.
<br />
<br />Comments welcome.
<br />
<br />PS okay I'm just going to have to say a little more: suppose there exists
<br />
some intelligent entity whose brain is non-finite, in the sense that it
<br />
has no trouble carring out, say, infinitely (countably) many arithmetic
<br />
operations in parallel in a fixed unit of time, regardless of the
<br />
complexity thereof.  Then Qu1: Can this being use proof systems which we
<br />
could not? (I suspect yes)  Qu2: Would Godel's theorem apply to this
<br />
system? (I suspect no;  since the being could, given any statement about
<br />
the natural numbers, compute every instance of the statement to determine
<br />
its truth of falsity). 
<br />
<br />PPS I'm off for real now.
<br />
<br /><br />Chris Simmons.
<br />
Don't bother, the web page is crap ;)
