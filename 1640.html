<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discretising the analogue quantities in a suitably fine way. Note,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that there is still instrinsic randomness in the behaviour of the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;neurons, which can be discretised also with digital devices.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I then asked you whether by digital device, you meant a &quot;Universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Turing Machine&quot;. This is where I part company with you, as I suspect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that (1-)randomness has something to do with free will.
</em><br />
<br />In that case you abandon Church thesis. With Church thesis all
<br />
digital device are Turing emulable, and reciprocally.
<br />
<br />I'm afraid I don't see how 1-randomness is related with free-will.
<br />
<br />Suppose you are annihilated at some place and reconstituted in
<br />
three different cities: A B and C. You know that you are the
<br />
subject of that experience and you try to concentrate yourself,
<br />
'exercising your free-will' to be the one reconstituted in A.
<br />
I suppose that the right level of substitution has been choosed.
<br />
Then, although the one reconstituted in A will tell me: &quot;you see
<br />
my free will has worked out&quot;, I, as a computationalist (here) will
<br />
say to the A-you: let us hear what the B-you and the C-you will
<br />
say. And of course they will at least appear to be less sure
<br />
they free-will has work.
<br />
Unless, like Niklas has suggested, the B-you and the C-you will
<br />
be so much disappointed that they will become zombie :-)
<br />
<br />You are consistent because you are willing to accept zombie.
<br />
But that is a too big price for me. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Therefore, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;predict that Robot beings based on classical turing machines will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;never have free will (although how one can establish this from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;outside via a Turing-like test I don't know).
</em><br />
<br />OK, OK, same remark.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, if we relax the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;requirement that Robots be strict Turing machines, then I fully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suspect a machine could be built that had free will, as I believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;human beings are no more than machines built from proteins.
</em><br />
<br />Then you must explain me what is not turing-emulable in the proteins.
<br />
You are slipping dangerously into Penrose-like non computationalism
<br />
again here!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, you are saying that the level of substitution implied in COMP is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;running the whole plenitude on a computer - Schmidhuber style. How
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does this relate to substitution of analogue brains by Turing machines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;within the individual observer world? It seems to me a case of chalk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and cheese - two things that have nothing to do with each other.
</em><br />
<br />This is really what the UDA explain. I remember that in one of the post
<br />
you were adressing to me, you ask me to explain the white rabbit
<br />
problem and it is fair enough because I have been rather short in
<br />
my explanation of it (cf PE-omega in the list).
<br />
<br />See below. I prefer first to answer your last remark to prevent
<br />
a misunderstanding concerning the relation between Schmidhuber's work
<br />
and mine.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It seems to me (although I haven't followed you argument to the nth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;degree), that you are claiming in your thesis that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;COMP=&gt;Schmidhuber. That may be true, however, I would very much doubt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that Schmidhuber=&gt;COMP. You haven't advanced a poof of this.
</em><br />
<br />I give you two proofs.
<br />
<br />Remember that by COMP I mean there is a level of description of my
<br />
&quot;generalized brain/body&quot; such that I survive a digital substitution of my
<br />
&quot;generalized brain&quot; at that level. 
<br />
Note that Digital = Turing machine, with Church thesis.
<br />
(To get the full power of Church thesis I accept also a minimal
<br />
amount of arithmetical or mathematical platonism).
<br />
<br />By definition my &quot;generalized brain&quot; is the portion of the universe
<br />
(if that exists) which is necessary to emulate to make my 
<br />
consciousness exists. 
<br />
<br />1) First Schmidhuber clearly believes in a stronger version of comp,
<br />
as he told us:
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;According to the computability-oriented view adopted in this 
<br />
paper, life after death is a technological problem, not a religious 
<br />
one. All that is necessary for some human's resurrection is to record 
<br />
his defining parameters (such as brain connectivity and synapse 
<br />
properties etc.), and then dump them into a large
<br />
computing device computing an appropriate virtual paradise.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />This is at the end of his paper. He does not emphasize on it, but 
<br />
clearly he believes in the existence of a level of substitution.
<br />
Of course I explain and insist that it is both a technological
<br />
problem and a religious one. Comp is not provable as self-duplication
<br />
experiments illustrates. It need some act of faith.
<br />
<br />2) But even if you forget he is telling us that explicitely
<br />
you can derived it from the rest (non philosophical part) of
<br />
his paper. Indeed, suppose comp is wrong, then there is no level
<br />
of substitution such that I survive ..., then the universe or
<br />
multiverse cannot be computable or turing-emulable and the
<br />
'great programmer&quot; will never generated it (because I belong to
<br />
it). Schmidhuber's approach would not even be a plausible 
<br />
candidate for an everything theory at all in that case.
<br />
<br /><br />Note also that COMP =&gt; Schmidhuber is ambiguous, because 
<br />
Schmidhuber postulates there is a (computable) universe.
<br />
I do not. (the existence of such a computable universe
<br />
follows from comp only in the case my &quot;generalised brain&quot; is the
<br />
&quot;entire universe&quot;).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***
<br />
<br />The Universal Dovetailer Argument.  (UDA)
<br />
<br />UDA is a proof that:  COMP entails REVERSAL physics/psychology.
<br />
<br />The reversal will be be epistemological: the branch &quot;physics&quot;
<br />
will be a branch of machine's psychology, and ontological: matter 
<br />
will emerge from consciousness, in some sense, hopefully clearer
<br />
later.
<br />
<br />Indeed such a reversal will change the meaning of term
<br />
like &quot;psychology&quot; and &quot;physics&quot; and the meaning is given ultimately
<br />
by the proof itself. By 'proof' here, I mean argument which either
<br />
should convince you, which means you are the only judge (no
<br />
authoritative argument) or you should find an error. 
<br />
Of course if you belief that the REVERSAL
<br />
is an absurdity, you are free to interpret the proof as a
<br />
refutation of COMP (like Gilles Henri, BTW are you still here Gilles?). 
<br />
<br />COMP is the hypothesis that there is a level such that I 
<br />
survive a digital functional substitution of my generalised body/brain 
<br />
(see above)
<br />
made at that level, + Church Thesis (digital = turing) + Arithmetical
<br />
Platonism (= the belief that arithmetical propositions obeys
<br />
classical logic, and this independently of my own cognitive ability).
<br />
<br />To sum up: COMP = \exists n SURV-SUBST(n)    + CT   + AR
<br />
<br />Note also that I'm assuming a minimal amount of folk psychology (FOLK)
<br />
without which such an enterprise would be meaningless. It is the
<br />
minimal amount of psychology to understand that you or someone else
<br />
could, in some situation, accept an artificial-digital brain graft,
<br />
and to understand the intuitive difference between first and third
<br />
person. (See below).
<br />
<br />(the modal 'chapter 5' of my thesis can be interpreted as an
<br />
attempt (at least) to eliminate FOLK by substituting it by the
<br />
godelian provability logics and its thaetetical variants). 
<br />
But the real goal of the  chapter 5 is to make the derivation of 
<br />
physics real and concrete.
<br />
<br />To make the reasoning easy I introduce supplementary hypotheses.
<br />
I will eliminate these hypotheses in due course.
<br />
<br />a) NEURO: The neurophysiologist hypothesis. This is a supposition that
<br />
the level of substitution is high, or that my generalised brain is
<br />
my biological brain (the one in my skull) relevantly described at the
<br />
molecular level (let us say).
<br />
<br />b) CU: there is a Concrete Universe, whatever it is. This is need
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the decor.
<br />
<br />c) CUD: there is a Concrete running of a UD in the concrete universe.
<br />
<br />d) 3-locality: computations are locally implementable in the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concrete universe. That is it is possible to separate two 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementations of two computations in such a way that the result
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of one of these computations will not interfere with the result
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the other one. Computations can be independent.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More generally the result of a computation is independant of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any event occuring a long way (out of the light cone) from that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computation.
<br />
<br />e) Conceptual OCCAM razor. I will not insist. That should be easy
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for many-worlder. The movie-graph argument in my thesis is really
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an elimination of occam razor. See also Maudlin's paper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk about that in the discussion list (key word: Maudlin,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;movie, crackpot).
<br />
<br />The proof.  (Apology for those who 'knows').
<br />
<br />1) By COMP and NEURO you survive with an artificial digital (turing
<br />
emulable, with TC) brain. OK?  (CU is used implicitely).
<br />
<br />2) By COMP and NEURO you survive classical teleportation. This 
<br />
follows from 1) where the building (reconstitution) of the brain is
<br />
done a long way from the 'reading device' and the annihilation of the
<br />
original body. (CU is used implicitely).
<br />
<br />3) By COMP and NEURO (and implicitely CU, I will not mention it again)
<br />
you survive teleportation with a delay. After the annihilation, your
<br />
body and brain description is keep intact during one year, and then you
<br />
are reconstituted. An important point is that you (from your first 
<br />
person point of view) will not see the difference with the simple
<br />
teleportation case (case 2). But an exterior observator (third person)
<br />
will see the difference. Indeed for him the delayed teleportation 
<br />
last one year.
<br />
<br />4) You are teleported from the center of the galaxy to its border.
<br />
At the opposite border a star explodes. This changes nothing: you still
<br />
survive. This follows easily from 3-locality.
<br />
<br />5) You are teleported from the center of the galaxy to its border.
<br />
At the opposite border you are reconstituted. (For exemple the scanned
<br />
information has been send in opposite direction from the center of 
<br />
the galaxy, and reconstituting machines has been put on the edge of
<br />
the galaxy). You still survive, by COMP and 3-locality.
<br />
<br />6) You are duplicable. (Direct consequence of 5).
<br />
<br />7) Although your surviving does not depend on the faraway events,
<br />
from the first person perspective the event &quot;I survive at the
<br />
left edge (let us say) of the galaxy&quot; could depend on the faraway
<br />
other reconstitution. The duplicability entails first person
<br />
indeterminisme, although everything is determinate for a third
<br />
person. (It is really the computationalist 3-determinateness 
<br />
which entails the computationalist 1-indeterminateness).
<br />
<br />(exercise: show that the duplicability entails the unprovability
<br />
of COMP. Hint: consider teleportation without annihilation of the
<br />
original, with a delay, applied to a non-computationalist)
<br />
<br />8) You are 'read' and annihilated in Brussels and the information
<br />
is send to Washington and Moscow. You are reconstituted at Washington
<br />
and the information is keep intact at Moscow during one year. Then
<br />
you are reconstituted at Moscow. (Duplication with assymmetric
<br />
delay). The point is the following: whatever the way you choose for
<br />
quantifying the 1-indeterminisme in the symmetric duplication, you
<br />
must quantifify in the same manner the assymmetric duplication.
<br />
This follows from COMP and 3. The first person cannot be aware of
<br />
the delays.
<br />
<br />9) There is also a form of 1-non-locality. Although your surviving
<br />
does not depend on faraway events, your expectation of personal
<br />
experience does depend on faraway events. Here also, it is the
<br />
strict 3-locality which entail the 1-non-locality.
<br />
<br />10) Here is an old argument you can find in all idealist school
<br />
of thought (Hindouist, Boudhist, Platon, Descartes, Berkeley, etc.)
<br />
It is based on the notion of dream, but today it is more easy
<br />
(especially with COMP)
<br />
to convey it with the notion of virtual reality. The point is:
<br />
For any neigborhood and any time interval, you can build a computing
<br />
machine simulating  that &quot;space-time&quot; at such a level that a first 
<br />
person will not be able to see any difference. 
<br />
(The computing machine preserves the relevant counterfactuals).
<br />
Roughly speaking a first person cannot
<br />
distinguish 'real neigborhood' with virtual (digitally simulated)
<br />
neighborhood (for all level 'below' its own substitution level).
<br />
<br />11) To sum up: the way you quantify the indeterminisme is independent
<br />
of the time, the place and the nature (real/virtual) of the
<br />
reconstitution.
<br />
<br />Note: the indeterminism is pure 1-indeterminism. Nevertheless, by
<br />
duplicating entire population, the indeterminism can be made
<br />
third person 'verifiable' inside each multiplied population. This
<br />
leads to what I call first person of the plural indeterminism. 
<br />
(I would like to know a better english expression for that!).
<br />
<br />12) A Universal Dovetailer exists. (Extraordinary consequence of
<br />
Church thesis and Arithmetical Realism). The UD simulates all 
<br />
possible digital devices in a quasi-parallel manner).
<br />
<br />(Adding a line in the code of any UD, and you get a quasi-
<br />
computation of its Chaitin \Omega number).
<br />
<br />13) So let us assume CU and CUD, that is let us assume explicitely
<br />
there is a concrete universe and a concrete running of a UD in it.
<br />
This need a sort of steady state universe or an infinitely expanding
<br />
universe to run the complete infinite UD.
<br />
Suppose you let a pen falls. You want predict what will happen.
<br />
Let us suppose your brain is in state S at the beginning of the 
<br />
experiment. The concrete UD will go to that state infinitely often
<br />
and compute all sort of computational continuations. This is 
<br />
equivalent to reconstitutions. It follows from 11 that your 
<br />
expectation are undetermined, and the domain of the indeterminism
<br />
is given by the (infinite) set of reconstitutions. To predict,
<br />
with COMP, what will happen you must take into account all
<br />
possible histories going through the state S of your brain. 
<br />
And here clearly the NEURO hypothesis is not used. Even if your
<br />
real brain state is the state of the actual concrete universe, 
<br />
with COMP that state will be generated (infinitely often) by the 
<br />
UD. Same reasoning if your brain state is the quantum state of
<br />
the universe, so the reasoning works even if the brain is a
<br />
non local quantum object (if that exists). So the physics is
<br />
determined by the collection of your computational continuations
<br />
relatively to your first person actual state.
<br />
<br />14) If 'that' physics is different from the traditional empirical
<br />
physics, then you refute COMP. But with COMP you will not refute
<br />
COMP, isn't it? So with COMP you will derive the laws of physics,
<br />
i.e. invariant and similarities in the 'average' continuations of
<br />
yourself (defining the measure on the computationnal continuations).
<br />
<br />Exercice: why should we search a measure on the computational
<br />
continuations and not just the computational states? Hint: with
<br />
just the computational states only, COMP predicts white noise for
<br />
all experiences. (ok Chris ?). With the continuations, a priori 
<br />
we must just hunt away the 'white rabbit' continuations. 
<br />
You can also show that Schmidhuber's 'universal prior' solution 
<br />
&nbsp;works only in the case the level of substitution
<br />
is so low that my generalised brain is the entire multiverse.
<br />
<br />15) Once you explain why arithmetical machines are statistically right 
<br />
to believe in physical laws without any real universe, such a real 
<br />
universe is redundant.
<br />
By Arithmetical Realism and OCCAM razor, there is no need
<br />
to run the concrete UD, nor is there any need of a real concrete
<br />
Universe.
<br />
(Or you can use the movie graph argument to show that a first
<br />
person is not able to distinguish real/virtual/and *Arithmetical*
<br />
nature of his own implementations, and this eliminates OCCAM.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QED
<br />
<br /><br />16) Oh la la, I get tired. I'm sure I have forget things. I
<br />
would appreciate any comments, especially skeptical one.
<br />
<br />The 'philosophical' proof really stop here. It is not a 
<br />
derivation of physics from the psychology of machine, it is
<br />
a proof that physics MUST be derived from the psychology of
<br />
machine OR COMP IS FALSE.
<br />
<br />Later I will show you how to eliminate the FOLK psychology
<br />
assumption, by substituting folk psychology by the
<br />
godelian provability logics and 'simulating' the first and
<br />
third person variants with the Thaetetical variations...
<br />
... and I will show how, by simulating the UD by the
<br />
Sigma_1 arithmetical sentences, the arithmetical version
<br />
of the present proof leads naturally toward an 
<br />
arithmetical version of quantum logic (almost).
<br />
<br />With an unexpected gift : a theorisation of the non
<br />
communicable part of the theory.
<br />
Explaining qualia as uncommunicable part of the observable. 
<br />
<br />This will also show that George Levy is valid in his recent
<br />
answer to James Higgo :-)
<br />
<br />Am I dreaming ?
<br />
<br />Have a nice weekend,
<br />
<br />Bruno.
