<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why would you need to change the goal structure  in order to improve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yourself?
</em><br />
<br />Improving yourself requires the ability to make more effective
<br />
decisions (ie take decisions which which move you toward goals more
<br />
efficiently).  This at least involves the elaboration (or extension,
<br />
or more accurate definition of) goals, even with a fixed top level
<br />
structure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Evolution could be described as a perpetuation of the basic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program, &quot;survive&quot;, and this has maintained its coherence as the top level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axiom of all biological systems over billions of years. Evolution thus seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to easily, and without reflection, make sure that the goals of the new and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more complex system are consistent with the primary goal. It is perhaps only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; humans who have been able to clearly see the primary goal for what it is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but even this knowledge does not make it any easier to overthrow it, or even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to desire to overthrow it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Evolution does not have a 'top level goal'.  Unlike a reflective
<br />
intelligence, there is no centralized area in the bio-sphere enforcing
<br />
a unified goal structure on the system as the whole.  Change is local
<br />
- the parts of the system (the bio-sphere) can only react to other
<br />
parts of the system in their local area.  Furthermore, the system as a
<br />
whole is *not* growing more complex, only the maximum complexity
<br />
represented in some local area is.  People constantly point to
<br />
'Evolution' as a good example of a non-conscious intelligence but it's
<br />
important to emphasize that it's an 'intelligence' which is severely
<br />
limited.
