I tried Salvia for the first time yesterday.  Very similar to
<br />
dreaming, but more intense, with a lot more sounds.
<br />
<br />At first I thought, &quot;Nothing's happening&quot;.  Then I thought, &quot;I seem to
<br />
be about to slide sidewise...I need to stop&quot;.
<br />
<br />Then, I was sitting somewhere...in a tilled field I think, and I
<br />
couldn't remember who I was.  Then I thought, someone's going to be in
<br />
trouble...I need to tell my sister.
<br />
<br />Then, for the next 30 minutes it was 1978, and I was in Arkansas, and
<br />
I was a kid again.
<br />
<br />Every now and then I'd think, &quot;What's going on???  Did I take
<br />
something?&quot;
<br />
<br />But I could never remember for sure.  A couple of times I would think
<br />
of the Salvia extract, but I couldn't remember if it was just
<br />
something I'd heard of, or if I'd actually used it.  And I'd decide,
<br />
&quot;Nah, couldn't be salvia...reality doesn't work that way.  That would
<br />
be like magic.&quot;
<br />
<br />After about 30 minutes of dreaming it was 1978, and I was 7, and in
<br />
Arkansas,  I came to enough to look at the clock, and I remember
<br />
thinking, &quot;It didn't work...&quot;
<br />
<br />THEN, I was underwater looking up towards the surface, and there was a
<br />
giant squid passing over me.
<br />
<br />About 20 minutes later, I got up and starting writing up what I'd
<br />
seen, but I was still drifting in and out, like I was having day-
<br />
dreams.  And they were still about Arkansas 1978, but it was like I
<br />
was there, and there was a plan, and I was part of it.  Something was
<br />
about to happen, and I was like part of a group that knew about it.
<br />
<br />Over the next hour the day-dreams stopped, and within 2 hours of
<br />
starting it was over.
<br />
<br />Very interesting.
