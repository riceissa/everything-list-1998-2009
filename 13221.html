<br />
I hope you guys will forgive my irreverence, but in the last 
<br />
couple of hours for the first time I have managed to read this 
<br />
thread to here. Having done so, and in the spirit of this 
<br />
everything-list wherein it is assumed everything is not only 
<br />
possible but _will_ happen and indeed may already have happened 
<br />
in a universe near you [and of course is that possibility 
<br />
exists, then it definitely already always has happened], I get 
<br />
the feeling that comp could lead to madness. But then, of 
<br />
course, it already has hasn't it ... in another universe 
<br />
somewhere/when else ... of course ... :-)
<br />
<br />The thing is Brent and Stathis have been going around and around 
<br />
this critical point of duration and continuity for some time 
<br />
now, without wanting to admit that *our experience of being 
<br />
aware of being here and now [respectively] is intrinsically 
<br />
paradoxical*. Well I have felt compelled to that viewpoint for 
<br />
more than a decade or so now, and I find from reading this 
<br />
discussion that comp does not solve this. OK, it may well be 
<br />
that Loebian machines, whether modest or not in other universes, 
<br />
or just modest but smarter than me - the latter not hard :-) can 
<br />
get on with the computation of their ontology and somehow 
<br />
transcend the apparent paradox. The paradox I have thus far 
<br />
asserted to be primary is the comparatively simple thought that 
<br />
we are constantly mistaken in taking our experience to be more 
<br />
or less _all of what is happening_ when it is really only our 
<br />
brain's construction of its model of self in the world, which is 
<br />
nothing to sniff at of course but then the processes for doing 
<br />
this have been scores of millions of years in the making.
<br />
<br />Comp makes the whole thing much more Comp-licated! AFAICS under 
<br />
Comp, we are each and every one of us confined to an anthropic 
<br />
view which does not even have a consolation that we are 
<br />
participating in a genuine continuity. Pre-comp, one could 
<br />
assume that, no matter how deluded one might be, as long as 'I' 
<br />
am able to be coherent long enough to recognise that it doesn't 
<br />
make sense to say 'I don't exist' then the chances were very 
<br />
good that the world is going on independently of me and I have 
<br />
the chance of really contributing. In a pre-comp universe a wise 
<br />
person will recognise that, well, things are always what we 
<br />
believe them to be until we discover otherwise so we have no 
<br />
guarantee that our attempts to do the right thing are 
<br />
necessarily the best. However we have a right to believe that so 
<br />
long as we have tried to sort out the facts of our situation and 
<br />
purposed not to cause avoidable harm to others then we are being 
<br />
as ethical as we know how to be and this counts for something 
<br />
and at least we tried. But with comp, assuming there are no 
<br />
intrinsic barriers to the formation of worlds and experience 
<br />
wherein we can come to truly believe we and our world have a 
<br />
coherent history, we have no reason to assume that this current 
<br />
experience _and the whole noumenal world we believe to exist_ 
<br />
cannot just wink out of existence. By definition it seems, it 
<br />
must always be possible that everything we take to be an 
<br />
indication of duration 'out there' is a transient artefact of 
<br />
this slice of multiverse.
<br />
<br />That is a pretty rugged conception to present to people as 
<br />
_necessarily_ possible. I therefore take comfort in the 
<br />
difficulties that people have in integrating Comp into a 
<br />
coherent explanation of the universe we perceive. I realise that 
<br />
much can be done with higher mathematics but just because people 
<br />
can create a formal language system in which algorithmic 
<br />
processes can be referred to with simple symbols, and sets of 
<br />
such symbols can be syntaxed together with indicators that mean, 
<br />
effectively, 'and so on so forth for ever and ever', this does 
<br />
not mean that the universe outside of peoples' heads can ever 
<br />
reflect this. I think it behoves contributors here to consider 
<br />
whether the universal dovetailer can ever be more real than Jack 
<br />
and his Beanstalk. Jack and his magic vegetable have been around 
<br />
for a couple of centuries now. The universal dovetailer may do 
<br />
likewise. We just need to keep in touch with the idea though 
<br />
that 'It Ain't Necessarily So!'.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     No.  I'm talking about a sort of program/data division - which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     recognize is arbitrary in computer program - but I think may have an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     analogue in brains.  When I write a simulation of a system of ODEs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the time evolution of the ODEs define the states.  But in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     simulation, what actually evolves them is passing them to another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     program that takes them and the current state as data and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     integrates; thus producing a sequence of states.  When you talk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     about isolated OMs, what we are conscious of, I think of them as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     states.  They are what we write into memory; they form the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;narrative&quot; of the simulation.  The integrator is like a simulation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     at a lower level, perhaps at the level of neurons.  We're not aware
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     of it and in fact many different integration algorithms could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     used with little difference in the outcome (as in the comp idea of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     replacing neurons with chips).  But the integrator, even conceived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     as an abstract 'machine' in Platonia, is performing a function,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     connecting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     one state to the next.  I'm not denying that you can simulate all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     this and that you can take a block universe view of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     simulation.  I'm just saying that the block can't be made of just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the conscious parts, the OMs, it needs to include the unconscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     parts that connect the conscious parts. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The integrator is just a device to generate the next state. Perhaps 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without it there would be no continuity because there would be no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation, but if you had the DE's all solved beforehand you could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply plot the states and have continuous motion, or whatever it is you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are simulating. In any case, what could it possibly mean for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unconscious part binding my OMs together to be disrupted? Suppose that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this happened every minute on the minute: would I feel any different? If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I did feel different, that would mean my consciousness was affected, so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it would be the OMs that differed, not just the unconscious part; while 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if I didn't feel any different by definition my continuity of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness has been maintained and the unconscious disruption is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irrelevant.
