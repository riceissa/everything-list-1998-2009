<br /><br /><br />I think it is difficult because there is a conflict between pedagogy

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />OK. But is not &quot;theology&quot; less esoteric than psychomechanics. Everyone 
<br />
knows what theology is all about: immortalilty/mortality issues, soul's 
<br />
fate in possible consciousness states, where do we come from, 
<br />
cosmogony, etc.
<br />
&quot;Scientific&quot; theology is of course 100% agnostic on all this; yet it 
<br />
can provide theories and with comp (or weaker) even testable or 
<br />
partially testable theories (indeed with comp, physics is an integral 
<br />
part of theology: physics is given somehow by the mathematical 
<br />
structure describing the border of the intrinsic ignorance of machines.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and actually I am not sure we are not in, well *perfect* perhaps not, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but at least in an a larger matching area than you think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Perhaps, like so many, you have not yet really understand the impact 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the discovery by Turing and its relation with Godel's theorem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; When I talk on Platonia, it is really &quot;Platonia&quot; updated by Godel's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and Lob's theorem. I hope you are open to the idea I could perhaps 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; progress in my way of communicating that. It really concerns machines 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and even many non-machines. I think about abandoning comp for ind, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; where ind is for indexical, given that G and G* applies to almost 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; anything self-referentially correct.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I knew this for long, the comp hyp just makes the reasoning and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; verification easier.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I can already say that I disagree the word &quot;quantum&quot; should be in it. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The name should not issue what will or should be derived by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do not fully understand the full ramification of how indexical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relates to this field.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Indexical is used in philosophy to designate term like &quot;now&quot;, &quot;here&quot;, 
<br />
&quot;modern&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;this&quot; etc. Their meaning change with the situation of 
<br />
their uses. For example &quot;I&quot; means Bruno for me and George for you. 
<br />
&quot;here and now&quot; means Brussels and 10h54 am, here and now, but the time 
<br />
I finish the sentence it already means something else (Brussels and 
<br />
10h55 am). The approach I follow is based on the logic of 
<br />
self-reference. &quot;Bp&quot; is really an indexical: it means &quot;I prove p&quot; where 
<br />
&quot;I&quot; is put for a third person self-reference by the machine M, and 
<br />
strictly speaking the meaning of &quot;I&quot; is different for each machine (but 
<br />
by Godel Lob, still obeys similar laws of the  self-referentially 
<br />
correct machine).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I think that to use Indexical now is like Heisenberg using 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Entanglement instead of Quantum. Nobody would have understood what he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was talking about. It was hard enough already to understand Quantum.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right, but &quot;quantum&quot; still does not work for this field because it 
<br />
would give the wrong impression that the quantum hyp. is assumed, where 
<br />
the UDA shows it must be derived.
<br />
the comp hyp is neutral about which type of machine we would be. It 
<br />
could be a quantum one or not. All what matters is that the machine 
<br />
should be Turing emulable (or weaker: some Turing oracle can be assumed 
<br />
without changing the self-reference logics G and G*).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW, COMP is not very good, because you have to explain what it is.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, that is the name of the hypothesis. The point is to have some 
<br />
short acronym to put results in short formula like: COMP -&gt; REVERSAL. 
<br />
But we were discussing the name of the entire field. What *is* G* \ G  
<br />
from a machine point of view? It is the self-referential truth which we 
<br />
cannot prove, but which can be hope or fear or just bet upon, like Dt, 
<br />
DDt, ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; At first glance it appears to be the Mechanist Philosophy and this is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what I originally thought.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. Comp is the DIGITAL or numerical or computational mechanist 
<br />
hypothesis. The mechanist philosophy is logically weaker due to the 
<br />
(mathematical at least) existence of non Turing-emulable analogue 
<br />
machine. The UDA, as it is now, does not work on such analogue machine. 
<br />
Of course comp is a natural modern sister of the mechanist philosophy.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the best approach is to use a compound expression to bridge 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the gap between different fields. (i.e., Quantum electro-chromo 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamics, electro-magnetism, physical chemistry)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; There is nothing surprising that quantum physics could be derived 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from quantum psycho mechanics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course it is surprising...not to you or me or others on the list 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because we have been talking about it for so long... but to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; average scientist in the street... or the university. And these are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the people you intend to communicate with.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I don't follow what you say. Quantum mechanics assumes the quantum hyp 
<br />
, and some mechanics, by definition. &quot;Quantum X&quot; presupposes the 
<br />
quantum. But comp should entails the quantum.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Plato is the one who introduced the word &quot;theology&quot; with the meaning 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of &quot;Science of Gods&quot;, and by extension I take it as the science of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what we can hope or bet upon.  It is just the truth *about* machine, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and we can talk and reason about it without ever knowing that truth, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; given that no scientist at all can *know* the truth, at least as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; knowed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this science relates primarily to the &quot;self.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes. And G and G* are the logic of self-reference. G is really the 
<br />
machine science of self-reference. It describes what machine can prove 
<br />
in a third person way on themselves. And G* describes still that same 
<br />
self. G* is just able to prove more than G: G* proves some true 
<br />
statement about &quot;I&quot; that &quot;I&quot; cannot prove. G and G*  handle the same 
<br />
type of &quot;I&quot; than the word &quot;me&quot; in the sentence &quot;after my 
<br />
self-duplication you can find me both at Moscow and Washington&quot;. And 
<br />
then there is a third version of the &quot;I&quot;, like in &quot;I will find myself 
<br />
either at Moscow or at Washington after the self-duplication&quot;. This one 
<br />
is handled neither by G nor by G* but by the Theaetetical variants 
<br />
which merge in some way the role of G and G*. It will appear that the 
<br />
lobian first person has no name at all (and I am collecting evidence 
<br />
that strictly speaking the lobian first person is just 
<br />
NON-computationalist!).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I said before, I think that it it the &quot;I&quot; that creates the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (orderliness in the) world.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah but this is the main statement in the Platonic theology of Plotinus!
<br />
With comp, that statement is made testable: the worlds are creation of 
<br />
the first person plural &quot;I&quot;, probably the one given by the second 
<br />
theaetetical variant. Their math are entirely defined and thus 
<br />
comparable with the math of the empirical worlds.
<br />
I have promised to Kim to recall the theaetetical variants, and this is 
<br />
good opportunity.
<br />
<br />Let us write B0 for the G or G* modal box. (and D0 for the diamond; in 
<br />
particular D0p is the same as ~B0~p). B0 captures the (Godel, Lob) 
<br />
provability predicate when the sentence letter p is a proposition in 
<br />
arithmetic (or set theory, or more generally any language of a 
<br />
self-referentially correct machine); and I recall G describes what the 
<br />
machine can prove about its own provability and consistency; and G* 
<br />
proves what is true about that. And given that I limit the interview to 
<br />
sound machine (like PA or plausibly ZF), we know we talk to sound 
<br />
lobian machine. (A sound machine is a machine which proves only true 
<br />
statement). So G is included in G*, and all the theatetical variants 
<br />
applied on G leads to a theatetical variant extended on G*).
<br />
The first theaetetical variant consists in defining a new box B1 by B1p 
<br />
= B0p &amp; p.
<br />
Of course, when the lobian machine is simple enough, WE know that B1p 
<br />
is equivalent with B0p &amp; p, and the machine's G* proves it accordingly, 
<br />
but the machine's G does not, and the equivalence (B1p &lt;-&gt; B0p &amp; p) is 
<br />
a member of the machine's G* \ G (it belongs to G* but it does not 
<br />
belong to G). So the logic of B0 and B1 differs. For example G does not 
<br />
proves (B0p -&gt; p), but G proves of course  (B1p -&gt; p) that is ((B0p &amp; 
<br />
p) -&gt; p) is a classical tautology (ok?).
<br />
The following can be shown:
<br />
1) The logic of B1 is given by the modal system S4Grz, typical for a 
<br />
temporal theory of knowledge à-la Bergson/Brouwer but also Dogen 
<br />
(japanese &quot;theology&quot;).
<br />
2) Here, G* does not add anything. S4Grz = S4Grz*. The knower, or the 
<br />
first person, conflates, from her point of view, truth and provability.
<br />
3) the box B1 does not admit a translation in arithmetic (or any 
<br />
Machine language). You can say the machine &quot;knows&quot; 1+1=2, by saying 
<br />
that the machine can prove &quot;1+1=2&quot; and &quot;1+1=2&quot; is true. But you cannot 
<br />
define a truth predicate (by Tarski theorem). So you can just do the 
<br />
trick of defining Knowing &quot;1+1=2&quot;, by saying just:   provable(&quot;1+1= 2&quot;) 
<br />
&amp; 1+1=2, without using exclusively the godel code of the proposition. 
<br />
Like truth, the knower is not definissable
<br />
in the language of the machine.
<br />
The second theatetical variant is B2 with B2p defined by B0p &amp; D0p.
<br />
The third theatetical variant is B3 with B3p defined B0p &amp; D0p &amp; p. It 
<br />
is really a combination of the first two theatetical variant.
<br />
Again G* proves that B0 and B1 and B2 and B3 are equivalent. From a 
<br />
third person perspective they describe machines proving the same third 
<br />
person propositions. Here too, G does not prove those equivalence, and 
<br />
indeed G* does prove that their logic are quite different.
<br />
More on this latter. You see that it is the gap between truth and 
<br />
provability, i.e. G and G*, which provides the room necessary for those 
<br />
nuances. B0 and B1 admit Kripke semantics (multiverses with 
<br />
accessibility relation). B2 and B3 does not. They get richer semantics 
<br />
coherent with the continuum present in the unravelling of the Universal 
<br />
Dovetailer (UD*).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I said before, I think that it it the &quot;I&quot; that creates the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (orderliness in the) world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not a new idea. Some philosophers have asserted this idea 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before.  Does this makes &quot;I&quot; a god?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Let us be very careful here. G is the *provable* part of the logic of 
<br />
provability/consistency of a self-referentially correct machine. It can 
<br />
be shown that G itself inheritates that self-referential correctness: 
<br />
that is G is a (mini, non Turing-universal) lobian machine. I.e. G is 
<br />
self-refrentially correct. That is the technical reaéson why Raymond 
<br />
Smullyan can explain the logic G just true visists to the Knight-Knaves 
<br />
Island (cf Forver Undecided). Now, G* is the *true* part of the logic 
<br />
of provability/consistency of a self-referentially correct machine. If 
<br />
you really want to introduce a Machine's God at this stage, G* could be 
<br />
a candidate, although I would prefer to consider G* as a machine 
<br />
theology, not as a God, you know I call it frequently a machine's 
<br />
guardian angel. The point is that G* is NOT self-referentially correct, 
<br />
it is just referentially correct whenthe reference is tmade toward the 
<br />
machine (or G) about which he is talking. For example G* does prove D0t 
<br />
meaning that the machine he talks about is consistent. G* proves B0p -&gt; 
<br />
p, meaning that he knows the machine is sound. But G* does not prove 
<br />
B(Bp -&gt; p) nor BDt. On the contrary G* proves ~BDt. If G* was talking 
<br />
about itself the proves of Dt and of ~BDt would make him unsound (but 
<br />
still consistent!).
<br />
By this, deriving that &quot;I&quot; is a God because &quot;I&quot; plays a so fundamental 
<br />
role in the building of the (physical) reality, would be a confusion 
<br />
between proof and truth, like if the G* \ G gap was empty.
<br />
Well, we know the gap *is* empty for the 1-person (S4Grz = S4Grz*), and 
<br />
so there is a sense to say &quot;I&quot; is a God, for the first person. OK, but 
<br />
then, like the notion of Truth and Knowledge,
<br />
for the first person &quot;God&quot; is just utterly not definissable, not 
<br />
nameable, not this, not that,... etc, etc.
<br />
Somehow here the machines I am considering, which I recall believe in 
<br />
Plato-Aristotle excluded middle law, are making the move from Plotinus 
<br />
to Proclos, that is a move from a fuzzy &quot;I&quot; who build reality to a 
<br />
purely negation-based notion of God. Proclos is the one who argued that 
<br />
a scientific theology can only approximate God by negations: God is not 
<br />
finite, God has no description, etc. Actually lobian machine's 
<br />
ignorance behaves like that to if you &quot;modelize&quot; ignorance by some 
<br />
1-person view of incompleteness.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not in the traditional sense of &quot;Theology&quot; which carries too much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; baggage.
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, but note that the term &quot;mathematics&quot; carries also much negative 
<br />
connotation baggage, especially for those working in the human 
<br />
sciences. I am not sure that is a reason for not using a term. Perhaps 
<br />
the contrary. perhaps we should use the term &quot;theology&quot; just for 
<br />
helping people to forget the term has got negative baggage due to its 
<br />
historical institutionalisation by the (Roman) Church.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  This is my own emphasis which may not be shared by everyone on this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am aware of the popular meaning of &quot;psycho&quot; = crazy as John 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mentioned. We could draw from other language than the Greek (auto, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psyche) or Latin (anima, spiritus) but we lose the ability to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; widely understood: Hebrew: nefesh, neshamah Japanese: tamashii.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Neshamah Mechanics is not going to fly. Tamashii Mechanics sounds like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sushi to the average westerner.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To talk on immortality issues (cf: quantum immortality or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; comp-immortality) without accepting we are doing theology is perhaps 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a form of lack of modesty. Nobody would dare to try to help me making 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a case for the use of the word &quot;theology&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course we are doing theology but don't say it too loud or you'll 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get involved in a religious war.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />A war? Why not. A war is better than an hidden conflict. Well I'm not 
<br />
sure. Science has always been in conflict with institutionalised dogma 
<br />
(being it dialectical materialism or christianism: science is deeply 
<br />
anti-dogmatic because science is above all modesty and doubts).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I think theology has too much baggage and is populated by people with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; faith - a virtue for them, a vice for us. :-)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />No, no; here I disagree. Comp needs an act of faith too. A &quot;doctor&quot; who 
<br />
would say that science has proved that we survive an artificial digital 
<br />
brain graft surgery is lying. Comp has this in common with the 
<br />
Pythagorean, and perhaps with the neoplatonist (but unlike the muslim 
<br />
neoplatonist) which is that they believe (hope for) a form of soul 
<br />
transmigration possibility. This follows from the &quot;yes doctor&quot;, and 
<br />
that explains why I recall you the comp hyp. all the times. It is an 
<br />
hypothesis which justifies by itself its necessarily *hypothetical 
<br />
character&quot;. This is subtle and eventually clear through the G G* gap. 
<br />
The whole of G* \ G can be considered as a collection of possible act 
<br />
of faith. Note that given the fact that comp is necessarily 
<br />
hypothetical and needs in practice some act of faith, a 
<br />
computationalist is bound up to tolerate non-comp people. The funny 
<br />
thing is that the comp 1-person is already non-computationalist 
<br />
(probably: I mean it is still an open problem). It will be probably as 
<br />
hard for machines than for us-human to believe they are machines, and 
<br />
if they want to practice comp explicitly (by managing their own backup 
<br />
for example) they will need an act of faith too.
