<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If you meet somebody who insures you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that he is you, would you believe him and if not, why?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	It depends on the definition you use.  If he is implementing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same conscious computation as me, then he's the same as me in that sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(And this is the one that's involved in the duplication thought experiment.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But he's not me in the sense that there are still two of us.  If he's just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implementing ones that are very closely related to mine, such as my future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self would do, or my counterparts in other MWI 'worlds' would do, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;he's close enough to me for many practical purposes.  For legal purposes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(e.g. property rights), he's not me.
</em><br />
<br />I agree basically that the fact that two implementations are considered as
<br />
&quot;identical&quot; depends on the definition of identity that you assume (as I
<br />
said previously, you could &quot;assume&quot; that you are identical to your twin, or
<br />
any human being, or even an animal following what you mean by &quot;close enough
<br />
for many practical purposes&quot;). But &quot;COMP&quot; is (if I understood it correctly)
<br />
a stronger hypothesis: it is that at some finite level, you could reproduce
<br />
or duplicate EXACTLY your conscious state, or at least you could simulate
<br />
it &quot;to an arbitrary degree of accuracy&quot; (which is already somewhat
<br />
different!) (James):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;that's necessary. I built an arificial neurone out of integrated circuits in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1984; I have no doubt that if I had enough of them I could simulate myself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. To deny this is to bring in sprit by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;another name.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;James
</em><br />
<br />I apologize to insist, but what I ask is: what do you mean exactly by that?
<br />
Jacques, how do you define &quot; If he is implementing the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same conscious computation as me?&quot;, James, which features of yourself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would you try to simulate &quot;to an arbitrary degree of accuracy&quot;, how long,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and how would you check it?
</em><br />
<br />I wouldn't like to appear to be too fussy. However, it seems that we
<br />
discussed a lot of paradoxes or original theories based on the possibility
<br />
of &quot;duplicating&quot; a conscious being, and that it deserves a careful
<br />
definition of what we mean by that. As a matter of fact, theories like
<br />
relativity and QM have emerged only when somebody began to ask : how would
<br />
you PRACTICALLY measure that? (simultaneity of events, or position and
<br />
momentum of the same particle) and realized that it was not THAT obvious.
<br />
<br />Again the reason why it doesn't seem THAT obvious for me is that
<br />
consciousness in the usual sense does exist only because we have a
<br />
representation of ourselves as &quot;subjects&quot;, and that this representation
<br />
requires a particular place in space and time (whatever these things are).
<br />
If you think that you have built a neural network almost identical to
<br />
yourself, you know that YOU have built A MACHINE. But what does YOUR
<br />
MACHINE know?
<br />
<br />Again I'm not saying at all that we are made with a &quot;spirit&quot; of any sort. I
<br />
mean that the computation that makes us conscious is so peculiar that it
<br />
can't be anything else than unique in a given &quot;classical&quot; world, because
<br />
the analog input it uses (our physical environment) is unique at the place
<br />
and the time we occupy. And if you succeed in building an intelligent
<br />
machine (which IS possible in my opinion), this machine SHOULD know that it
<br />
is a machine, and hence that it is not you, exactly for the same reason why
<br />
you know that you are you, and not anybody else.
<br />
