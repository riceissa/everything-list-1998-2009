<em class="quotelev1">&gt; final choice. So let's consider a different flavor of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prediction. Suppose every time you make a choice, I can predict
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the decision, write it down before you do it, and then show it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to you afterwards. Neither the infinite recursion argument nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the no fixed point argument work against this type of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prediction. If this is actually possible, what would that imply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for free will?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you are an AI, this would be fairly easy to do. I'll just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make a copy of you, run your copy until it makes a decision,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then use that as the &quot;prediction&quot;. But in this case I am not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; able to predict the decision of the copy, unless I made another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copy and ran that copy first.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The point is that algorithms have minimal run-time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complexities. There are many algorithms which have no faster
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalents. The only way to find out their results is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually run them. If you came up with an algorithm that can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predict someone's decisions with complete accuracy, it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably have to duplicate that person's thought processes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly, perhaps not on a microscopic level, but probably on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level that still results in the same conscious experiences. So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now there is nothing to rule out that the prediction algorithm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself has free will. Given that the subject of the prediction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the prediction algorithm can't distinguish between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves from their subjective experiences, they can both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identify with the prediction algorithm and consider themselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to have free will. So you can have free will even if someone is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; able to predict your actions.
</em><br />
<br />I think &quot;free will&quot; is an incoherent concept and useless as a
<br />
basis for aruguments about how the world works.  Most people
<br />
would say that the existence of a deterministic algorithm which
<br />
modelled and predicted one's decisions would contradict free
<br />
will.  On the other hand, they would not accept a randomness in
<br />
the decision process as free will either.  Both viewpoints
<br />
neglect the fact that a person is in almost continuous
<br />
interaction with their evironment and to regard them as isolated
<br />
computers is only an approximation.  
<br />
<br />I suppose that the brain's function is something close to
<br />
deterministic chaos.  One's behavoir is unpredictable, to some
<br />
degree, because the brain has a large amount of stored
<br />
information that interacts with the stream of new information
<br />
that has provoked the need for decision.  All most all of this
<br />
is below the level on consciousness.  Although the brain must be
<br />
almost completely deterministic, it is certainly possible that
<br />
quantum randomness could play a part.  
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The more obvious fact that you can't predict your own actions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really has less to do with free will, and more with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; importance of the lack of logical omniscience in decision
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory. Classical decision theory basically contradicts itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by assuming logical omniscience. You already know only one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choice is logically possible at any given time in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deterministic universe, 
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand &quot;logically possible&quot;.  Decision theory at most
<br />
provides a quantification that identifies a certain choice as
<br />
logically optimum and this optimality is only probabilisitic.
<br />
But the optimality is relative to some value system of the
<br />
decider.  The value system is not logically entailed by anything
<br />
in decision theory.  
<br />
<br /><br />and with logical omniscience you know
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly which one is the possible one, so there are no more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decisions to be made. But actually logical omniscience is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself logically impossible, because of problems with infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recursion and lack of fixed points. That's why it's great to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see a decision theory that does not assume logical omniscience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So please read that paper (referenced in the first post in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thread) if you haven't already.
