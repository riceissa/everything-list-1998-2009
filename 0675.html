<br />
Should one make decisions based on objective or subjective consequences of
<br />
his actions? By objective, I mean one should consider how one's actions
<br />
affect the external world, and by subjective I mean one should only
<br />
consider one's future subjective experiences. This is very much related to
<br />
the quantum suicide debate, since the QS advocates argue (as I understand
<br />
it) that a decrease in one's measure (which is definitely a feature of the
<br />
objective universe) should be ignored as a part of decision making since
<br />
it is not directly subjectively detectable.
<br />
<br />Evolution must have had two &quot;choices&quot; when it programmed our brains to
<br />
make decisions as they relate to death. It could have made death or
<br />
circumstances leading to death painful and made us avoid actions that lead
<br />
to the subjective experience of pain, or it could have made us consider
<br />
the effect of each of our potential actions on our measure and avoid
<br />
actions that lead to a decrease in measure. Apparently it chose the
<br />
former, presumably because it's easier for evolution to accomplish. But
<br />
because of this our genes are now in trouble because we have found ways to
<br />
kill ourselves painlessly.
<br />
<br />So what does this mean for us? Since subjective decision making is a
<br />
legacy of our evolutionary past, and can be shown to be less general than
<br />
objective decision making, it should no longer be used. Therefore, QS
<br />
advocates will have to come up with a new justification for ignoring one's
<br />
measure. I don't think there is one. That doesn't mean one should care
<br />
about one's measure, just that there is no reason why one shouldn't.
