Hi Bruno,

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; By now you should have understood that I will not be taunted, so no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use in trying. I do not pretend anything. What I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; have told you and maintain is that I can sketch an argument that &gt; 
</em><br />
shows that your YD is incompatible with QM being the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; correct physics of the world and I will do so as soon as you admit &gt; 
</em><br />
that this will invalidate ALL your thesis (not just the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; part of it you feel like conceding). This was my proposal all along 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I have not changed it. So there is no point in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; challenging me in these terms. I made clear already.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought you said you get a proof that YD is false. (Confirmed by my 
<br />
looking at your posts).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This would have invalidate the Universal Dovetailer Argument (but not 
<br />
its arithmetical translation as I explained before).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you are saying that YD is just inconsistent with QM. This is a far 
<br />
much weaker statement, which would not refute anything at all. On the 
<br />
contrary, given that my UDA-point says that comp entails verifiable 
<br />
physical statements (a whole comp-phys). And for me it is still an open 
<br />
problem if comp-phys is compatible with QM or not, or is even equal to 
<br />
QM or not.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never claimed to have a proof that YD is false only that I can 
<br />
give you an argument that &quot;QM can shoot down YD&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and this being the case, from what I understand from your previous 
<br />
post, means that your &quot;proof&quot; that physics is necessarily
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;reducible to computer science&quot; is incorrect in the CT and AR are true. 
<br />
I quite sure you have stated that much in your
<br />
&nbsp;previous post.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To be more specific my argument aims to show you that if QM is the 
<br />
correct microscopic description of the world (in which
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;you apply YD) than YD is contradicts it. I am quite sure that I never 
<br />
stated anything different. I might have used the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;expression &quot;if YD is false&quot; as a condition but that means &quot;if my 
<br />
argument is correct&quot;.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, if you read my thesis you will see that I arrive at a point 
<br />
where I conclude that comp (thus YD) seems to be in contradiction with 
<br />
QM, because it gives a priori much more relative computational 
<br />
continuations than QM (the white rabbit problem), but then I explain 
<br />
that computer science and incompleteness phenomena force us to add many 
<br />
nuances, and this is what has lead me to make a complete translation of 
<br />
UDA in arithmetic.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is news to me! If I read you right it means that you already 
<br />
proved my point! That is reassuring. I had some lingering
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;doubts about my argument, of course, but seems that my intuitions are 
<br />
correct at least since you have anticipated them.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Now which one of those nuances that you speak of salvages an 
<br />
hypothesis that contradicts QM? I'm curious...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this means you could just be *in advance* of my thesis! That would 
<br />
still be very interesting of course, so, please make your point.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah yes you want to make it only if it demolishes the whole of a thesis 
<br />
that you admitted not having read (I don't understand at all why you 
<br />
don't want to give a (perhaps interesting) argument unless it refutes a 
<br />
thesis that you admitted not having read).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno, you are just too kind! I would describe it the other way round: 
<br />
I am &quot;way behind your thesis&quot; since you already argued
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;my point out affirmatively! I guess that is the problem with us &quot;White 
<br />
Rabbits&quot; always arriving late...
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Please make your point, we can still discussed its impact after, isn't 
<br />
it?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Bruno

<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I am kind of discouraged now. It would no longer be my point 
<br />
since you already proved it and made it yours.
<br />
&nbsp;Let me think about it.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Best regards,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Godfrey
