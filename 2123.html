<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I though you were.  In
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m560.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m560.html</a> you say: [snip] You also
<br />
said in that post you weren't sure how to combine the QM probabilities with
<br />
the SSA, but in your last post to RS you seemed reconciled to doing so.
<br />
<br /><br />Consider first a partially analogous case, where we assume MWI is false.
<br />
Suppose there are a trillion planets (analogous to different branches on the
<br />
wavefunction), and an Adam and an Eve doing the experiment on each of these
<br />
planets. On the vast majority, no deer turns up, but on one in ten thousand
<br />
planet, the trick works. Now, if Adam knows that this is the setup, then he
<br />
should not think that the trick will work. The reason is that the no
<br />
outsider requirement is not satisfied: to apply SSA with a reference class
<br />
consisting only of the humans living on his planet would be wrong. Once we
<br />
take the reference class to contain all these actual observers living on
<br />
some planet or other, then it is easy to see that applying SSA will not give
<br />
Adam any reason to think that a wounded deer will appear.
<br />
<br />If this is a good analogy to the MWI-case, then the paradox would not arise
<br />
under that assumption. But that is not clear to me at all. For the branches
<br />
of the wavefunction aren't simply so many different actual worlds, but they
<br />
come with a measure. I take it that we need to assume that this measure is
<br />
related to SSA by assigning sample densities to observer-moments that is
<br />
proportional to the measure of the branches on which they are living. This
<br />
means that observers living on small-measure branches will only weakly
<br />
contribute to the violation of the no outsider requirement; that is, if one
<br />
of the alternative hypotheses under consideration is only true on branches
<br />
which have a small measure, then the no outsider requirement can for all
<br />
practical purposes be regarded as satisfied.
<br />
<br />Therefore, if Adam is uncertain whether his world is one where the
<br />
deer-branch has a high or a low amplitude (but thinks that with 99,99%
<br />
probability it has a low amplitude), then when he considers his position, he
<br />
gets reason to think that the deer-branch has high amplitude, since that
<br />
would concentrate a greater sampling weight on observers that are observing
<br />
what Adam observes. (On the other hand, if Adam were certain about the shape
<br />
of the wave function, then the above argument would not show that he should
<br />
think that he will next observe a wounded deer. But why assume that Adam
<br />
knows the shape of the wave function? If he doesn't, then it seems to me
<br />
that my paradox obtains also in the context of the MWI.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">		&gt;Even if it did, I don't think it would be very relevant
</em><br />
since
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">		&gt;we are concerned with what is a sound methodology,
</em><br />
something which, one &gt; may 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">		&gt;think, should be independent of specific assumptions about
</em><br />
the world. In 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">		&gt;particular, If one is advocating a general principle (such
</em><br />
as SSSA-R) then 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">		&gt;a single genuine counterexample, even if it is
</em><br />
hypothetical, would suffice 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">		&gt;to refute it or force us to restrict its scope.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure what you mean in this context.
<br />
<br /><br />I mean that few people would think that SSSA-R stands or falls with MWI.
<br />
Just as it is no good reply to the Adam&amp;Eve paradox that Adam and Eve
<br />
probably never existed, so it also seems to be unsatisfactory to dismiss the
<br />
paradox by saying that it doesn't obtain if MWI happens to be true (even if
<br />
that were true, which for the reasons above doesn't seem the case).
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DA is not counterintuitive as far as I am concerned.
<br />
It's common 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sense.
<br />
<br /><br />Not very common, in my experience.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I said SSSA I meant SSSAR.
<br />
<br /><br />Ok.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 'coin toss' case, the answer is obvious.
<br />
<br /><br />Yes, but different answers appear to be obvious to different people.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">		&gt;The main motivation is that it avoids certain consequences
</em><br />
that most people 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">		&gt;regard as highly counterintuitive and unacceptable.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I've already stated that I regard those
<br />
consequences as obvious 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and intuitive.
<br />
<br /><br />So you accept that Adam should think that a wounded deer will turn up?
<br />
(Let's assume here for the sake of the argument that MWI is false.) You
<br />
would probably be the only person who thinks that that is obvious and
<br />
intuitive.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would follow any advice I would give to Adam if I were
<br />
in his 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;situation.
<br />
<br /><br />It's quite interesting to know that there is someone who would do that. I
<br />
though I would for a while, but after thinking more about this and making
<br />
the situation vivid to my imagination, I came to the conclusion that this
<br />
seemed crazy and that if there were any consistent way of avoiding it, then
<br />
it should be avoided. Of course, everything I say in the thesis is
<br />
compatible with accepting R=Ru (i.e. setting the reference class equal to
<br />
the class of all observers) provided one is also willing to accept the
<br />
Adam&amp;Eve paradox.
