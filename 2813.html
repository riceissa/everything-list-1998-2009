<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't think Bruno's conclusion is weird. I come to essentially the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same conclusion in &quot;Occam&quot;, without the need for formalising

</em><br />
<br />The fact that you come to the same conclusion does not mean these
<br />
conclusions are not weird. I hope you realise these conclusions run
<br />
against the average materialistic aristotelian current scientific
<br />
paradigm.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would like to think that my exposition is easier to follow than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno's, but this could simply be a biased viewpoint on my part. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;welcome comment and criticism on that paper.
</em><br />
<br />I still believe my general remarks apply to your &quot;why Occam's razor&quot;.
<br />
(I reprint it and I will reread it once I have more time).
<br />
You put to much for me in the hypothesis. Like all physicist you seem
<br />
not to be aware of the mind body problem. With comp, what the UDA shows
<br />
(and what the graph movie or Maudlin works &quot;proves&quot;) is that it is
<br />
not possible to attach awareness to worlds or histories. The reversal
<br />
means really that you need first a theory of consciousness, or a 
<br />
psychology for deriving the existence of physical beliefs.
<br />
I agree that there are similarities in some of our conclusion, but
<br />
I am not sure we mean the same by &quot;psychology&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Incidently, I didn't mean to imply that this sort of modeling of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Knowlegde was inappropriate, only that there was no discussion as to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;why one would want to model it in this particular way.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The word &quot;model&quot; is tricky. It means different things for logician
<br />
and painters (who are using it in the sense of reality) and physicist
<br />
and toys builder (who are using it as &quot;theory&quot; or approximation, or 
<br />
reduction). 
<br />
Soemtimes I use it in the physicist sense ...
<br />
But my approach is more axiomatic. I hope I will be able to give 
<br />
enough illustrations to help understanding ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Its really the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same as when Hal Ruhl (and I admit I'm putting words in his mouth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;here, although its consistent with my understanding of his position)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;models the universe by cellular automata.
</em><br />
<br />Hal Ruhl, like Toffoli, and even like Schmidhuber-2, seems indeed
<br />
to search for such &quot;modelisation&quot;.
<br />
But I do not (and apparently Schmidhuber-1 don't do it either).
<br />
<br />The UD does NOT depend on the choice of a particular formal systems.
<br />
The UDA really shows that my &quot;awareness&quot; will be linked with all
<br />
implementation of my computationnal extension.
<br />
By implementation here I just mean the giving of a program and its
<br />
relative UTM interpretation.
<br />
<br />And the provability logics (G and G*) is correct and complete for ALL 
<br />
sound
<br />
classical Universal Machines. In that sense there is no modelisation
<br />
at all. And comp is not the hypothesis that my brain can be modelised
<br />
by a Turing Machine, it is the act of faith of telling &quot;yes&quot; to the
<br />
(mad) surgeon.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I notice Bruno has posted a more detailed discourse on this issue,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which I will digest in due course.
</em><br />
<br />It is an important one, but it will be fully clear only after 
<br />
I explain Godel and Lob theorem with enough rigor.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps all he was doing was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assuming a cultural background of philosophy I have not been exposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to. Just as an example, he says most philosophers would agree that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[]A-&gt;A, where []A is interpreted as knowing A. This is clearly a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different meaning of the word &quot;to know&quot; that we use here in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Australia. I know of plenty of people who know that God exists. And I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;know of a number of other people who know that God doesn't exist. So,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by this application of Modal logic, we can conclude that God both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exists and doesn't exist at the same time, which seems kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;illogical.
</em><br />
<br />To say the least. I must say that I am quite astonished that 
<br />
Australian can &quot;know&quot; falsities. What is the difference between
<br />
knowledge and belief for an Australian ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps the way out of this mess is to say that I'me really talking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about belief, ...
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I think indeed you were talking of &quot;belief&quot;. The nice thing
<br />
with axiomatic approach is that we will &quot;define&quot; knowledge or 
<br />
knowability by axiom like K, T, 4. Except that formal provability
<br />
will be defined in arithmetic and then we will look at which
<br />
formula it obeys. And It does not obeys to knowledge axiom (see
<br />
below).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;...rather than knowledge, however that would imply that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;knowledge is devoid of meaning, since it is impossible to establish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with certainty whether any particular fact is true.
</em><br />
<br />But, at least for a non intuitionnist, or a non constructivist, a
<br />
proposition could be true independently of our belief or knowledge.
<br />
A platonist (as I am for arithmetics) has no problem with that.
<br />
Of course the nuance between truth, provable, believable, knowable, ..
<br />
are subtil. The crazy thing is that Godel (Lob Solovay) will 
<br />
eventually put an immense light on those nuance.
<br />
<br />In metaphysics the &quot;royal argument&quot; for explaining that indeed we
<br />
cannot distinguish knowledge with belief is the dream argument.
<br />
When we are awake, we cannot know for sure that we are not dreaming.
<br />
Socrate uses it in his reply to Thaetetus. Descartes, Berkeley and
<br />
almost all &quot;idealist&quot; use it also.
<br />
The beauty of comp is that it gives a non solispsistic idealism.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Even Mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proof is contingent upon belief of the efficacy of the formal proof,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something that has been called into doubt, particularly for more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complex proofs like Fermat's last theorem, or the 4 colour theorem.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I definitely and infinitely agree. And *that* is part of the big
<br />
Godelian surprise. Godel's result is that there is no possible
<br />
formal proof of the fact that a formal proof of p entails p.
<br />
&quot;p&quot; being arbitrary.
<br />
The formula (with [] representing formal provability):
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[]([]p -&gt;p)
<br />
<br />cannot be proved formaly for all sentences p.
<br />
With p equal to the constant sentence FALSE, it is a direct
<br />
consequence of Godel's second theorem. It says that a consistent
<br />
machine cannot prove its consistency. A machine cannot 
<br />
prove &quot;not provable FALSE&quot;, that is: -[]FALSE, that is: 
<br />
[]FALSE-&gt;FALSE.  Remember that -p &lt;-&gt; (p -&gt; FALSE).
<br />
A formal proof acts indeed like a belief, for the formal
<br />
system.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't mean to be picky, but its just these sorts of considerations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and misunderstandings that throw me off the track every time.
</em><br />
<br />All that will be transparent with G and G*, ... It is because
<br />
such matter is not obvious *at all* that the modal detour is
<br />
useful.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-reference is really the land of counter-intuition and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surprise.
<br />
<br />Bruno
