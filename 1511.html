<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But if deductions from the SSA can only be made from a first person perspective

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then that makes all deductions from the SSA completely bankrupt because all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deductions I've seen made from the SSA are very *general* statements (e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your one about Life universes not subjectively existing). You can't say that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deductions are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective unless what they are *about* is also subjective. Or do you believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is no fact of the matter about whether the probability of finding oneself in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a Life universe is 0? Is there one probability as far as Chris Maloney is concerned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and another as far as, say, Al Gore is concerned? Hmmm.
</em><br />
<br />The above makes no sense.  Yes, I believe in objective facts.  And I also
<br />
believe that it is possible for me to make some deductions about those
<br />
objective facts by using a first-person reasoning from the SSA.  My
<br />
deductions would only be probabalistic, of course.  That is, they'd only
<br />
have a certain probability of being true.  But then again, any deductions
<br />
I make from empirical evidence is probabalistic.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So, I think, yes, if my argument is correct, it doesn't matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that a life-SAS would deduce the same thing.  I would be correct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and (s)he would be wrong.  That is, I still do believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; different sorts of SAS's have different measure.  Taking Hal's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; approach and doing away with infinite sets, spoze that there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a total of one billion SAS's in all the universes everywhere, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that ten of them are green, but the rest are blue.  Any one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; them would be justified in assuming that most SAS's are of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; same color, but the green ones who made that assumption would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But you are not putting forward an argument, just speculating that there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might *be* an argument, as far as I can tell. There may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an argument for saying that 'one' is less likely to be an SAS in a Life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe but I don't think that one can simply say that *I* am not in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Life universe therefore it is unlikely.  On the same grounds I could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argue that is extremely unlikely that one is an American citizen.
</em><br />
<br />There were two quite good posts on this topic recently by Jacques Mallah:
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1192.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1192.html</a>, and 
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1194.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1194.html</a>.  The difficulty arises
<br />
in the confusion between a priori and a posteriori probabilities.  For
<br />
example, I know that my license plate number is AFT-058.  It's not now
<br />
valid for me to compute the odds of the car in my driveway having the 
<br />
license plate AFT-058 as 1/(26^3 10^3).
<br />
<br />Likewise, it should not be surprising to me that I'm an American, even
<br />
though Americans only make up 1/20 the population of the world.
<br />
<br />So this just shows that any conclusions to be derived from the SSA must
<br />
have a suitable prior.  In my example above, the prior was the assumption
<br />
that the any *ratio* of green/blue SAS's was equally likely.  Fine.  Now
<br />
if I were a blue SAS, I would have a sample set of one, from which I could
<br />
compute a probability distribution on ratios of colors.
<br />
<br />Let R be the ratio of blue to green SAS's,  R = b/g.  I want to compute
<br />
the probability distribution as a function of R on the domain [0,1]:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(R) P(1 blue | R)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;P(R | 1 blue) =   ----------------------
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(1 blue)
<br />
<br />Now, P(R) is the prior, and I said above that the assumption is that 
<br />
this is constant over [0,1], and P(1 blue) = 50%, so P(R)/P(1 blue) is
<br />
a constant, and is just a normalizing factor.  
<br />
<br />Clearly, P(1 blue | R) = R.  Therefore, with the normalizing condition
<br />
that the integral of P from 0 to 1 = 1, we get
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;P(R | 1 blue) = 2R
<br />
<br />Which has an expection value for R of 2/3.  That is, given a sample of
<br />
one blue SAS, and the prior mentioned above, I would compute that the
<br />
probablity of any SAS being blue is 2/3.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So if the set of life-SAS's is not isomorphic to the set of (3+1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dim. pseudo-Riemannian manifold quantum field)-SAS's, then we'd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have no a priori reason to assume that the measures of these sets
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are the same.   If the measures are different, then one is larger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; than the other.  My money will be on our set having the larger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; measure.  If the measures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are transfinite but of different orders, then I conclude that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probability of finding oneself to be a life-SAS is zero.
</em><br />
<br />I stand by this.  Note that I explicitly give a new prior:  *if* the 
<br />
measures of each set are of different orders of transfinite numbers.
<br />
Using blue and green again, that would mean that either R=0 or R=1.
<br />
<br />We still have the ratio of prior probabilities, P(R)/P(1 blue), is a 
<br />
constant.  But now P(1 blue|R=0) = 0, and P(1 blue|R=1) = 1.  The
<br />
normalization integral becomes a sum, and we get, simply,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;P(R=0 | 1 blue) = 0
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;P(R=1 | 1 blue) = 1
<br />
<br />Which is pretty easy to interpret.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't personally believe that our universe *is* a 3+1 dim. pseudo-Riem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manifold quantum field, but that's another story.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where your argument falls down is betting on our set having the larger measure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based (I'm presuming) on the evidence that *you* are in the latter sort of world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you wanted to construct a Bayesian proof of your statement you would end up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; showing that you are *minutely* more likely to be in this world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Once you start talking about transfinite measures I give up. The Bayesian arguments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that underpin all these anthropic arguments are based on *probability* and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore on *natural* numbers, counting etc.
