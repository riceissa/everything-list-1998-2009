</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; You are correct! But only from the third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; point of view. I define 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; &quot;third person point of view&quot; as a perspective which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; does not affect the survival of the observer!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      You still haven't defined 'the observer'.  
</em><br />
<br />I did. &quot;I think&quot; is both faith and fact - assumption and experimentally data. 
<br />
My approach requires one single assumption:
<br />
<br />1) I am a conscious observer. (I &quot;think&quot;). 
<br />
<br />This is the basis for the relativistic view of the world and the existence of 
<br />
other observers and of the world follows from this basic assumption.
<br />
<br />I think therefore I am (By definition)
<br />
I am therefore the world is (Anthropy)
<br />
The world is therefore the Plenitude is (Acausality: Unless there is a reason 
<br />
for something NOT to exist then it does)
<br />
The world is therefore other observers like myself are. (Acausality)
<br />
<br />Come to think of it YOU haven't defined observer DEPENDENTLY of your basic 
<br />
objective absolute world view.
<br />
<br />The (your) objective absolute view of the world requires three assumptions:
<br />
1) There is an absolute objective world
<br />
2) This world gives rise to conscious observers
<br />
3) I am one of the conscious observers.
<br />
<br />Occam would certanly not vote for your approach
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; There are two kinds of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; white rabbits. The rational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; ones which I shall discuss now, and the irrational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; ones which I shall discuss 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; in the next section. Different people &quot;similar to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; us&quot; do see rational white 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; rabbits. They win the lottery, are hit by lightning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; and sometimes even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; receive a meteorite on the head. The number of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; people, however is very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; small. Their measure RELATIVE TO AN UNINVOLVED
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; OBSERVER is very low. For very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; very very few in the whole observable universe, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; second law of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; thermodynamics may even revert temporarily.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; However, their own measure RELATIVE TO THEMSELVES is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; unity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      Just one problem with that: it doesn't make any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  damn sense.  Measure is measure.  
</em><br />
<br />Yes it doesn't make any sense if you refuse to look at it from the first 
<br />
person point of view! We are going in circles.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  On the other hand if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  by &quot;measure relative to themselves&quot; you mean some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  measure *ratio*, the important thing to realize is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  that measure ratios don't play the role of measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (foe effective probabilities) unless the denominator
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  is the same fixed constant for all.
</em><br />
<br />You seem to be suffering from the same hardening of the brain arteries as 
<br />
those who embraced Ether and refused to accept the fact that motion can be 
<br />
relative. A FRAME OF REFERENCE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THE SAME FOR ALL. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Furthermore, because of anthropic considerations, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; rationality of the mind requires a rational physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; environment. Hence, if someone exists he must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; able to make sense of his surrounding and observe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; the cause for his own existence. So irrational White
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Rabbits cannot be observed.  [...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Hence any conscious entity must be capable of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; observing the reason for his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; own origin, Darwinian or Design
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      That does not follow.  Given the physical laws we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  know, there is no reason a being can't come into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  existance just due to thermodynamic or quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  'random' events.  It's just not very common, to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  the least.
</em><br />
<br />Yep, it's not very common to say the least. According to some theories, the 
<br />
Big Bang is just a quantum fluctuation. Not very common to say the least. How 
<br />
do we explain it? Classical QT just says it happened - no cause. The AUH says 
<br />
it must happen just because everything happens. 
<br />
<br />Third person point of view exclude White Rabbits. First person point of view 
<br />
demand them! Look at all the billions of anthropic coincidences that occured 
<br />
to make YOUR life possible, starting with the Big Bang and ending with that 
<br />
particular sperm fertilizing that particular egg to make Jacques Mallah! 
<br />
<br />As I mentionned before, White Rabbits could be rational (rare coincidences 
<br />
explainable by physical laws) such as one sperm meeting one egg, or 
<br />
irrational such as quantum fluctuations, such as the Big Bang. 
<br />
<br />Our universe is 99.99999...999 percent rational. (If it was 100% rational it 
<br />
would be deterministic, which it is not). If our universe was any more 
<br />
irrational, the stable physical substrate required for conscious life would 
<br />
not exist and we would not be around (Anthropy). I am also guessing that 
<br />
there is no need for the world to be more rational than it is. Consciousness 
<br />
can sustain (maybe require) a small amount of irrationality in the physical 
<br />
world.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; I repeat, from the third person point of view,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; everyone does not have the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; same measure. From the first person point of view,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; our own measure is unity. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      Again with this 'POV' stuff.  That's the best you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  can do, huh?  I have explained countless times that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  the total measure of some set of observer-moments is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  the sum of the measures of the constituent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  observer-moments.  If you want to take some such set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  and call it a 'self', that's your business.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      But the problem comes when you deny the results of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  calculations, based on your ideology, that show that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (for example) when a measure distribution decays
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  exponentially with time, an observation at an early
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  time is more effectively probable than one at a later
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  time.  You insist, with zero justification, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  because the set you want to designate as 'self'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  contains a long time tail, there is no decrease in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  measure with time.  Then you try to cloak that BS with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  mumbo jumbo about '1st vs. 3rd person POVs'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Again your hardening of your brain arteries. Let me give you an analogy with 
<br />
motion: When you decelerate, your speed may decrease with respect to an 
<br />
earth-bound observer. But your speed relative to yourself is always zero. 
<br />
There is nothing inconsistent about this.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; 3)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt;    I already explained this to you: cardinality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; isn't the issue.  Just take a limit in the right
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; I know, I know. You just take the limit. As if it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; was that simple. It's not! 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Let me give you an example. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; [snip]
</em><br />
<br />Gosh, &quot;snip&quot; is not an answer.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Taking the sum of an infinite set depends on the way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; the element of that set are SEQUENCED!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; I think that when infinite sets are involved, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; concept of limit must be applied very carefully.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      No kidding.  Any high school kid is supposed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  know that.  What's your point?  As I said, take it *in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  the right way*.  Don't know the right way?  Use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Occam's razor to guess Nature's preference.  In the TM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  UD case, N-&gt;inf seems fine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
I am not a good enough mathematician to bridge the gaps between Limit Theory, 
<br />
Infinite Sets and MWI. However, my point is that if you are going to take a 
<br />
limit, implicit in the process is the ordering of your terms. If the ordering 
<br />
is defined by the context of your world (embedded in an infinite Plenitude), 
<br />
then the result obtained by the limiting process may be controlled by 
<br />
anthropic considerations.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; insure the existence of the rational conscious experience. We could 
</em><br />
define 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; person as a set of observer-moment points logically linked together. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Trying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; to define the measure of a person is like trying to find how many points 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; there are in a given region of space. The answer: an infinite number. 
</em><br />
You 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; could compare two regions and say that one region is larger than 
</em><br />
another. 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; However, from the transfinite point of view, both regions contain the 
</em><br />
same 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; cardinality of points. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Time is an illusion brought about by the anthropically constrained links 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; between the observer-moments. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; This approach is definitely not &quot;classical MWI.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Please clarify your approach for me. Where do these logical connections
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  come from? I.e., what causes or implies or governs them? What does it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  mean that they are anthropically constrained to ensure (only?) rational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  conscious experience? Does it mean that if you follow a series of links
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  you are guaranteed to obtain a rational conscious experience? Why?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  After some more thought I am going to guess that your approach is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  start out with the points, and then for any series of points that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  constitute a rational conscious experience,  draw links between them. Is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  this correct?  If so what determines which series of points constitute a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  rational conscious experience and which ones don't? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
These are difficult questions going to the root of consciousness. The logical 
<br />
links are just imaginary. I use them to explain how consciousness flows from 
<br />
point to point. You are on the right track when you say that we can &quot;start 
<br />
out with the points, and then for any series of points that constitute a 
<br />
rational conscious experience,  draw links between them.&quot; 
<br />
<br />But the reverse is also true. Rational thoughts implies logical links between 
<br />
the points and logical links implies possible rational thoughts.
<br />
<br />So I would rephrase your statement as follows: 
<br />
&quot;Any series of logically connected points constitute a rational conscious 
<br />
experience and any rational conscious experience consists of logically 
<br />
connected points..&quot;
<br />
Another way of saying it is that the HISTORY OF ALL CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE 
<br />
CONSTITUTE A LOCUS of logically connected points in the Plenitude. A 
<br />
particular conscious experience is a path along this locus. Time is an 
<br />
illusion caused by the connectivity from conscious point to conscious point.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Anthropy is a filter imposed by our consciousness on our perspective of the 
<br />
Plenitude. The logical property of the mind constrains and causes the 
<br />
determinism of the world. I think, therefore I am, therefore the world is.
<br />
<br />As to what is the real nature of logic itself....I have no idea.
<br />
<br />Have a good weekend
