<br />I see what you mean. Francis Bacon described our enterprise as to 'vex
<br />
Nature', an expression that has always rather tickled me, and I simply
<br />
meant that there comes a point at which Nature resists even the notion
<br />
of being vexed, and we're reduced to talk of something skulking 'behind
<br />
the scenes'. It was to this that Wittgenstein addressed his notorious
<br />
admonishment. So I'm (or rather grandma is) simply asking Bruno
<br />
whether, rather than invoking 'Number', or whatever, as lurking in this
<br />
shadowy region, it makes any real difference were we to re-cast comp in
<br />
something more like the form of words suggested - i.e as derived from
<br />
the (1st person) observables - 'nuff said.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can you see how riddled with historical baggage our thinking is, how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biased our language is? This crazy situation has been going on for 2500
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years. enough already!
</em><br />
<br />Yes, and I despair (almost) of remedying this, even if I knew how. My
<br />
own attempts at linguistic 'clarity' seemed destined only to muddy the
<br />
waters further, especially as I'm really trying to translate from
<br />
personal modes that are often more visual/ kinaesthetic than verbal,
<br />
gestalt than analytic.
<br />
<br />That said, I rather like your 'adverbial' mode, which I think has also
<br />
cropped up in other contexts (didn't Whitehead attempt something of the
<br />
sort with his process view?) Nominalisation/ reification creates
<br />
conceptual confusions, embedded assumptions spawn others, as in all
<br />
language to do with time, which is already loaded with the assumption
<br />
of experiential dynamism, and hence can do nothing to help explain it.
<br />
<br />My own hastily contrived usages were an attempt to expose the implicit
<br />
(and hence generally conceptually invisible) holding of the world 'at
<br />
arm's length' by the objectifying effect of 3rd person language, which
<br />
simultaneusly relegates 1st-person to a subsidiary role, to the extent
<br />
that some even feel impelled to deny its existence, or resort to
<br />
bizarre ontolgies in an attempt to 'reintroduce' it. Where McGinn and
<br />
Chomsky hold that it is the analytic/ synthetic modes of language that
<br />
puts 1st person beyond our ability to conceptualise, I feel that the
<br />
unacknowledged consensual projection of an 'objective model' as
<br />
'reality' has more to do with it.
<br />
<br />My belief has been that restoring 1st person to some sort of centrality
<br />
would be part of the antidote, and I haven't yet (quite) lost hope on
<br />
this score. I look forward to the fruits of your own efforts in this
<br />
regard.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; If grandmother asks for recalling the main difference between Plato and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Aristotle's theories of matter, I would just say that in Plato, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; visible (observable, measurable) realm is taken as appearances or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shadows related to a deeper unknown reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW Plato followed Heraclitus, who was already onto this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Surely Plato's view more astute model to assemble an understanding of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural world than the assumption of Aristotlian/atomism thinking... that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe is made of chunky bits of stuff that literally are the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearances we get and our descriptions of it....furthemore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The arisotlian view is clearly anatomically untenable anyway! If the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe was literally made of appearances then when we opened up a brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we would see them. We do not. What we see is the brain in the act of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delivering appearances. No 'appearance' of a brain is in any direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation to the appearances it delivers to us in the 1st person. Ergo the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure and the appearances are not the same thing or at least are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; validly explored on that basis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is empirical proof that at least in this small piece of thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Plato's position was correct and Aristotle is just plain wrong. And Kant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too. The noumenon is most definitely real and scientifically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tractible.(see below)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The practical upshot of this is that the universe does not,  for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have atoms in it. It is made of some underlying structure behaving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;atomly&quot; within our appearances. It is only us that insist on making it a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'thing'. That structure also behaves 'neutrino-ly' outside the scope of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our direct perceptions (qualia). The appearances (qualia) are likewise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delivered as behaviour of the very same structure. Plato's position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unifies matter and qualia as different behaviours of the same underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure. So simple and obvious and practical and fits the evidence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A question from grandma:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Since this deeper, unknown reality must forever be inaccessible to our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direct probing, I agree when you suggest that this may better be thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of as theology, or at least metaphysics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Juicy stuff here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Since this deeper, unknown reality must forever be inaccessible to our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direct probing&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The words 'direct probing' assume that indeed we are at some point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;directly probing&quot;. If you can justify any account that we directly probe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (whatever that means!) anything I'd like to see it! I would hold that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'apprearances' we have and the 'underlying structure' are on an _equal_
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemological footing in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a) Depictions of regularity in appearances
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; b) Depictions of structure of a putative underlying natural world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both have equal access to qualia as evidence. It is the underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure that delivers qualia into the brain. The two descriptive realms:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearances and structure are on an equal footing and qualia unifies them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into a consistent set. The 'evidence', qualia, is evidence for BOTH
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; domains. Whatever the structure is, it must simultaneously a) deliver
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualia and all the rest of the structure in the universe and b) deliver
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the contents of qualia (appearances) that result in our correlations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearances that we think of as empirical laws.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore we have not one but 2 scientifically accessible realms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific description of the natural world:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) Statistics that are correlation of appearances
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Statistics that are depictions of structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Qualia are produced by 1) and enable 2) and tie both descriptions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intimately together as a consistent set. Currently we call 1) science and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slag off at 2) as 'mere metaphysics' or theology. This is just soooo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong! Indeed at least in a linguistic sense 2) is physics and 1) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meta-physics (about it)! :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Since this deeper, unknown reality must forever be inaccessible to our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direct probing&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...is quite correct, but that does not stop us doing valid science on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure! Put another way this limitation in access does not justify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calling attempts to formulate theories of the structure as non-science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can you see how riddled with historical baggage our thinking is, how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biased our language is? This crazy situation has been going on for 2500
