I like him very much because he looks sincere and he tries very much

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;when it obviously isn't an intrinsic process of any physical system?

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To clarify:  There is a distinction between intrinsic and

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that are logically independent of the intentional attributions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers, such as the molecular structure of the object I am sitting on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The latter are properties that exist only relative to such attributions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such as being a chair.  The problem here is that computation, to quote
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Searle, is &quot;not a machine process that like neuron firing or internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;combustion;  rather, computation is an abstract mathematic process that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exists only relative to conscious observers and interpreters&quot;  (*The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mystery of Consciousness*, 17).
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure that the distinction between intrinsic and 
<br />
observer-relative is not itself observer-relative. You take &quot;the
<br />
molecular structure&quot; as intrinsic and I will tell you below why
<br />
I don't. It seems you take the notion of &quot;physical things&quot; as granted,
<br />
but I don't. 
<br />
<br />But even if there were intrinsic features of physical reality, it is
<br />
hard for me to understand how consciousness would rely on it.
<br />
What in the brain/body/universe do you think to be intrinsically
<br />
necessary for consciousness ?  Sodium ions? Carbon atoms? Quark?
<br />
Quantum phenomena in microtubules?
<br />
(Searle's comparison between aware-thinking and photosynthesis is 
<br />
really a philosophical category mistake, I think).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Computation and all other syntax is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-relative, and in one sense exists only from a 1. person point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;view.
</em><br />
<br />Computation has almost nothing to do with syntax, and is not 
<br />
observer-relative, at all.
<br />
To my knowledge it is even the less &quot;observer-relative&quot; thing I can
<br />
think about. Perhaps you confuse a computation with your own possible
<br />
interpretations of that computation? or with a possible concrete 
<br />
implementation of that computation.
<br />
<br />But before we come to blows, let me try to explain you briefly
<br />
my &quot;methodology&quot;:
<br />
<br />First I *assume* computationnalist as a working hypothesis. I am
<br />
open to the idea that comp is false. Perhaps biological naturalism
<br />
is the correct approach, despite Searle!
<br />
<br />By comp I mean: 1) the idea that there is a level of substitution
<br />
such that I survive with a functionnal and digital substitution made
<br />
at that level. Unlike so-called functionnalist I don't put any 
<br />
restriction on the level. My 'brain' could be the whole quantum 
<br />
multi-universe, my reasoning will still go through;
<br />
2) the classical Church thesis. This is very important because it is
<br />
Church thesis which make computations intrinsical and
<br />
&nbsp;syntax independent; 3) a minimal amount of arithmetical platonism. I 
<br />
guess this is maybe unnatural for a biological naturalist. It is
<br />
nevertheless the simple idea that arithmetical truth is independant of
<br />
me. For exemple the idea that the statement &quot;there is an infinite 
<br />
number of primes&quot; is true independently of me.
<br />
<br />Then with 1), 2) and 3) I prove that physics is necessarily a branch
<br />
of the psychology of machine (a science which does not depend on 
<br />
the choice of the machines thank to Church's thesis).
<br />
<br />And this gives us a realm where we can begin to ask, if not
<br />
understand, where the laws of physics come from.
<br />
<br />I am aware that this entails a complete reversal of the general
<br />
current paradigm : it is not consciousness which emerges from
<br />
the physical activities, but the exact contrary: matter is a 
<br />
high emergent concept.
<br />
Poetically 'physical realities' are a product of dream sharing, where
<br />
a dream is an immaterial (arithmetical) computation viewed from 
<br />
the 1-points of view.
<br />
<br />Bruno.
