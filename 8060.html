Hi Bruno,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From the bottom....
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;About the links: I know them. Thanks anyway.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Maye you know the links but you surely have not read what they point 
<br />
to otherwise
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;you would not go on claiming that there are no NON-computable 
<br />
processes in the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;physical world! You probably also have heard of books such of that by 
<br />
Pour-El and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Richards which catalogue a good number of them from both classical and 
<br />
quantum
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;physics but declined to read them as they don't agree with your 
<br />
proclivities...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of the general NON-computability of the results of individual 
<br />
measurements
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is somewhat more grievious than all of these because, not only QM does 
<br />
not in general
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;compute them (but computes their statistical distributions quite 
<br />
generally) but because we
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;know that NO other conceivable local theory does compute them and 
<br />
furthermore,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;no other such theory computes their distribution as well as QM! In 
<br />
fact the only
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;other &quot;mechanistic&quot; (non-local) theories that can claim to compute 
<br />
anything like the QM distibutions
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;must contain &quot;faster-than-light&quot; propagations and other features that 
<br />
violate other
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;well supported physical theories! This later result was proved by 
<br />
George Svetlichny
<br />
&nbsp;but I am sure you know the link so I need not include it.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote &quot;compute&quot; above where I would normaly write &quot;predict&quot; because 
<br />
physical theories
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;are really analogue algorithms for computing predictions. Turing 
<br />
machines are very general
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(but very slow and ineficient) ways of discretizing and encoding such 
<br />
algorithms and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;implementing them in special physical systems called digital computers 
<br />
to generate
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;approximate predictions. This means that no UTM, no UD or UDA or any 
<br />
model of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;digital computation (or any physical, calssical or quantum computer by 
<br />
that matter)
<br />
&nbsp;that is CT equivalent to them, can compute what QM cannot!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;So if your UDA produces a &quot;huge amount of non-locality&quot; (whatever that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;means) I can only understand that as meaning that it computes 
<br />
(predicts) a whole lot less
<br />
&nbsp;than QM and so, why should I care for it anyway?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;I know this sounds &quot;didatic&quot; but so do you when you run out
<br />
&nbsp;of arguments and send people to your papers...

&nbsp;Hi Godfrey,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I answer some relevant (imo) comments in one post (for avoiding 
<br />
mailbox abuse).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For your others paragraphs, I can only suggest you study the UDA 
<br />
theorem

<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; How does this affect Bruno's UDA? As far as I can tell, steps 1-6 go

&nbsp;through as before, but after that the conclusions are not so clear.

</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Good remark! (And Russell's answer does not really answers).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Glad to see you are going from step 0 (YD hypothesis mainly) to step 1 
<br />
(classical teleportation). What about step 2?

<br /><br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tsk, tsk Bruno! Now you are getting petty and condescending. I take it 
<br />
as a sign that this exchange as lasted longer
<br />
&nbsp;than it should...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I would leave the &quot;soul&quot; out of my statements. The soul-body problem 
</em><br />
was solved long time ago.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;? What is the solution?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;The body perishes, the soul (and the damnation) is eternal! What else?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Sorry, but I don't follow here! You get physics but you loose 
</em><br />
theology!!! Why do you need the theology?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not comp, through the YD, not already a hope in a form of 
<br />
reincarnation?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;For sure! If not a last grip on the myth for immortality. You tell me.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can have a scientific attitude (modesty, right of 
<br />
questioning hypotheses, methodological agnosticism) in the fundamental 
<br />
matter. I'm just interested in &quot;theology&quot; and particularly in 
<br />
&quot;cosmogony&quot;: where and why information, sensations, space and time come 
<br />
from.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds very much like what the proponents of the &quot; Theory of 
<br />
Intelligent Design&quot; argue in this country. The question seems
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;innocent enough but what is being asked is really whether one can 
<br />
disguise religious doctrine with just enough scientific verbiage to 
<br />
make it pass for a rival theory and fit it in school books? As I 
<br />
suggested before, that seems to be your real
<br />
&nbsp;calling, &quot;father&quot; Bruno (;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I guess you are right. I think I am more confused about what you are 
</em><br />
saying than when we started this exchange.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all normal. I see you don't grasp the point. More in my answer 
<br />
to Lee Corbin, about &quot;computationalism&quot;.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Bruno
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I read your answer to Lee and it cleared my confusion, thanks! 
<br />
You are indeed in a solo last crusade to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;save the COMPutationalist avatar with its promise of salvation, 
<br />
reincarnation and immortality! The more positive
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and pathetic aspect of it, as I see it, is that, if you are right and 
<br />
have indeed proven that the only way that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;COMP can be true is if physical world DOES NOT exist, than you 
<br />
produced one the best indictments of COMP
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have ever heard! Good enough for me! I kind of suspected it but it 
<br />
is good to have a proof.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Best regards,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;-Joao
