<br />
Sometimes I really don't understand how some people, in the literature, 
<br />
did not see what I have seen, and I begin to harbor doubt on my work.
<br />
The most famous case was the case of Einstein and Godel, who met at 
<br />
Princeton, but seems not having try to really understand each other on 
<br />
some of the most fundamental question. Eventually I discovered that 
<br />
Einstein was a quasi-&quot;conventionalist&quot; in math, and this could explain 
<br />
his lack of interest in logic and in Godel's work.
<br />
<br />A more vexing case was the case of Smullyan. Indeed all his technical, 
<br />
recreative or not, books on logic turn around Godel's theorems. But 
<br />
Smullyan wrote also books on religious/theological (in a wide sense). 
<br />
Still he never tried to connect them. I am thinking about his books 
<br />
&quot;The Tao is Silent&quot;, &quot;5000 BC&quot;, and &quot;Who knows&quot;.
<br />
<br />I have recently discovered that Smullyan never talk on Church's thesis. 
<br />
He does not seem aware of the &quot;simple&quot; proof of Godel's incompleteness 
<br />
which follows almost directly from Church's thesis, nor does he use it 
<br />
to motivate some link between computer science and mathematical logic. 
<br />
In particular his book &quot;Forever Undecided&quot;, although mentioning two 
<br />
times the &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; motivation is rather striking in 
<br />
that respect: indeed his chapter &quot;the heart of the matter&quot; is almost 
<br />
presented without motivation. He presents his &quot;Godelized Universe&quot; like 
<br />
if it was just a new kind of game or puzzle, not really more motivated 
<br />
than the *fairy* Knight-Knave Island.
<br />
<br />So, there is a sort of missing paragraph or section before the &quot;heart 
<br />
of the matter&quot;, and I am working on it, so that &quot;Forever Undecided&quot; 
<br />
could be use more easily by those interested in the comp reversal.
<br />
<br />But then, what I got makes a bridge between his work on Godel's 
<br />
incompleteness and his philo/theo-logical writings, and I feel now 
<br />
sufficiently confident in that link to recommend those books. They does 
<br />
not present a metaphysical system, unlike Plotinus, but present rather 
<br />
many interesting short reasonings in the religious field, arguably 
<br />
converging toward Plotinus, notably through his comment on &quot;cosmic 
<br />
consciousness&quot; in the second part of &quot;Who knows&quot;.
<br />
<br />I will, soon or later, expand a little bit on all this, especially on 
<br />
the importance, not just for comp, but for theoretical computer 
<br />
science, of Church's thesis. Meanwhile you could still study the 24 
<br />
first sections of the FU book, i.e. until page 206. Particularly 
<br />
interesting for the &quot;consciousness thread&quot; is the succession of more 
<br />
and more self-aware sort of reasoners (type 1, type 1*, type 2, type 3, 
<br />
type 4) in his chapter &quot;logicians who reason about themselves&quot; (page 
<br />
89) all that driven toward the &quot;well known&quot; type G). My approach to 
<br />
consciousness adds &quot;inductive inference ability&quot;, with the automated 
<br />
(unconscious) bets on personal self-consistency, or of any proposition 
<br />
belonging to the corona G* \minus G. We can come back on this later.
<br />
<br />To be sure, all this is not necessary for the understanding of the UDA 
<br />
reversal argument, but it is necessary for the translation of that 
<br />
argument in the language of an introspective universal machine, and 
<br />
this is necessary for the actual derivation of the comp &quot;propositional 
<br />
physics&quot; (and then for  its comparison with quantum logic).
