<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this apple?&quot;  Actually the apple is the whole of observed reality  for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worm, so it is equivalent to our observed universe.  However the  observABLE 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe for the worm is the same as our observable universe.   Then the worm comes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up with a multiverse theory along with a Wormopic  Principle, saying that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole observable universe is just complex enough to  sustain the inside of an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apple.  Surely this must be true, since the worm  can grasp all of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics?
</em><br />
<br />The worm would come up with a multiverse theory that says that everything
<br />
exists, including universes like ours with people, apple trees, apples and
<br />
worms, and also including other universes which consist of just a single
<br />
apple, possibly with a worm in it, and every other possibility besides.
<br />
<br />Among these possible universes there are a certain fraction which contain
<br />
worms-in-apples consistent with the experiences, observations and memories
<br />
that the worm has experienced in his own apple.
<br />
<br />He knows that he is one of those worms.
<br />
<br />He applies some kind of measure, such as the Universal Distribution, over
<br />
all of these worms-in-apples and is able to come up with a probability
<br />
distribution for which one he is.  This results in first-person
<br />
indeterminacy and uncertainty.
<br />
<br />It may well be that the simplest and most likely case is not a universe
<br />
containing a single apple, but a universe like ours.  The reason is that
<br />
apples and worms are actually very complex objects at the cellular level,
<br />
even more complex at the atomic level, and enormously complex at the
<br />
sub-atomic Planck scale.  The physics going on in the apple is every
<br />
bit as complex as the physics of our own universe.
<br />
<br />Our universe has the advantage in that its initial condition was very
<br />
simple - some say it was completely smooth and uniform in the initial
<br />
instances of the Big Bang.  Then we went along in a very natural and
<br />
simple way and developed planets, where life evolved into apples and
<br />
worms.
<br />
<br />The apple-only universe must create all this by fiat.  It must be
<br />
hard-wired into the initial conditions: everything about the apple,
<br />
about the worm, and about the physics.
<br />
<br />It's very plausibly would take a more complex program to run a universe
<br />
consisting of just an apple and a worm, than our whole universe where
<br />
apples and worms evolve out of much simpler initial conditions.
<br />
<br />Hence the worm might well conclude that he is likely to be in a giant
<br />
universe with billions of other apples and worms, as well as many other
<br />
forms of life.  Even though he has not yet observed any of these things,
<br />
not yet having come to the surface of the apple, he can deduce it.
<br />
<br />But perhaps not.  Suppose that this super-intelligent worm deduces
<br />
that universes like ours are actually less likely than ones which
<br />
are all apple.  In that case, assuming that his reasoning is sound,
<br />
then he is probably right.  From the first-person perspective, when he
<br />
chews up to the surface, he will probably find that he is indeed in
<br />
an apple-only universe.  The multiverse has many kinds of universes
<br />
with worms in apples, and it may be that our own universe has only a
<br />
small fraction of all the worms in apples, that most worms do in fact
<br />
find themselves in other kinds of universes.  That would be a possible
<br />
conclusion of multiverse theory, and it might well be right.
<br />
<br />In short, there is no reason to expect a super-intelligent worm in an
<br />
apple to come up with a different multiverse than the one we would, if
<br />
we were also super-intelligent.  We might be in different components of
<br />
the multiverse than the typical worm, but that is not evidence against
<br />
the theory or an example of a flaw in its explanatory power.
