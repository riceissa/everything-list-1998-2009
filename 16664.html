Hi Bruno.
<br />
Thanks for the link. As an physicist and computer researcher I have
<br />
knowledge of some of the fields involved in UDA, but at the first
<br />
sight I fear that I will have a hard time understanding it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and my subjective experience is  the most objective fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that I can reach.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; t
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I see what you mean, but the subjective experience, although real and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true, and undoubtable, is subjective. It exists as far as you cannot  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prove to an other that it exists.  To communicate you have to bet on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tools and on others, and other many doubtable (yet plausible) mind  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Hence, qualia are subjective and , as such,  I cannot assure that you
<br />
have it. But I'm sure that you have it and therefore that my knowledge
<br />
of qualia is objective simply for one causal reason: natural
<br />
selection; Our brains, shaped by very similar genetic programs, share
<br />
the same architecture and therefore produce very similar
<br />
phemomenologies.
<br />
<br />This follows of course if you admit matter-&gt; mind (or better math-
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;matter-&gt;mind)  and admit natural selection as the &quot;entropic pump&quot;
</em><br />
that creates structure and function (and computer structures) in
<br />
living beings. I know no other testable alternative.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I cannot support this Kantian notion consciousness -&gt; matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is that if you are ready to attribute consciousness to a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; device, by its virtue of simulating digitally a conscious brain at  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some correct level of description, you will be forced to attribute  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that consciousness to an infinity of computations already defined by  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the additive and multiplicative structure of the numbers (by UDA). A  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quasi direct consequence is that if a machine look at herself below  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its substitution level, it will build indirect evidences of a flux of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many (a continuum) of computational histories (a typical quantum  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feature, I mean for QM without wave collapse). But comp forces the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure of those many realities (or dreams) to be determined by  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specifiable number theoretical relations.  Those relations are either  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extensional relations (like in number theory), or intensional  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relations (like in computer science, where number can also points  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; toward other numbers, and effective set of numbers). It makes  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalism testable. The genral shape of QM confirm it, but  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cosmogenesis remains troubling ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I cannot understand this until I read your paper, but, just one
<br />
question ¿what is the nature of the process that reduces local entropy
<br />
(sculpt chaos, poetically speaking) so that in creates life and
<br />
intelligence starting from unanimated matter along the arrow of time?.
<br />
Is it of a mathematical nature; is it some general principle of
<br />
change? Is it natural selection with some additional principle? I just
<br />
want to know what your context in relation with mine is. Of course if
<br />
you support Mind-&gt; matter -&gt; math, then you mechanism for such
<br />
evolution should be quite different.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The final words that I can say about the &quot;hard problem&quot; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness is that any conversation with a robot, with the self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; module that  I described in the previous post, will give answers about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; qualia indistinguisable from the answers of any of you. He would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; indeed doubt about if you are indeed robots and he is the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conscious being on earth.  Just as any of you may think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Its self module would not say &quot;I perceive the green as green&quot; because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; he has this as an standard answer, like a fake Turing test program,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but because it can zoom in the details of every leaf, grass etc and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; verify that the range of ligh frecuencies are in the range of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; frequencias that  a computer programmer assigned  to green and a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; trainer later told him to call it &quot;green&quot;.  He even can have its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; philosophical theories about qualia, the self etc. He even may ask
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; himself about the origins of moral  and self determination, and even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all of this may force him to believe in God.  So we must conclude that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; he have its own qualia and all the attributes of consciousness. in no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; less degree  than I could believe in yours.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A priori I have no problem, although I could pretend you have solved  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only the easy problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The hard problem is: why do *we* (and not just a robot)  have those  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualia, if robot can have the same talk and behavior? You have still  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to explain the nature of the qualia, and why we have to experience  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them, given that a mechanical explanation seems to make them  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unnecessary, especially if you invoke Darwinian natural selection. And  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then, by UDA you have to (re)explain what is matter and how to relate  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them with the qualia. Eventually matter will appear to be a sort of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sharable qualia (or comp is false).
</em><br />
<br />Yes I said that this is all that I can say without pretending to solve
<br />
the problem. That is because the problem qualia is so interesting.
<br />
But in the absence of natural selection, as I said, I can not be sure
<br />
if you have such qualia. I cannot be sure either you are zombies or
<br />
not. In fact the main school of sociology , based on cultural
<br />
determinism, persist in the error of thinking that people of different
<br />
cultures have completely different qualia.
<br />
<br />Yes, matter is a sort o sharable qualia, and the objectivity of
<br />
knowledge is assured by our common brain architecture (and this is the
<br />
base of evolutionary epistemologists notion of objectiveness) . The
<br />
mind perceive in a specie-specific way an external reality that has no
<br />
meaning without such brain processing.. In fact trees, persons, atoms
<br />
and so on are shared creations of our minds because they have an
<br />
adaptive/utilitarian nature. The external reality, at the deepest
<br />
level, may be just mathematical, so are our bodies. Mind maybe then
<br />
the process where the reification of matter from math occurs.
<br />
<br />Then, math-&gt;mind-&gt; matter. Has this last point of view something in
<br />
common with yours?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do appreciate your willingness of not treating a self-referentially  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct machine as a zombie, but providing a machine with the correct  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behavior and the relevant discourse does not yet explain the *meaning*  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of those discourses. Some could argue that on the contrary it makes  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those meaning illusory.  Theories remains to be done, and if something  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is true and unexplainable, this has to be justified too. Amazingly  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can extract both the communicable and incommunicable part of that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discourse from an interview of the machine , and this has  already be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; done (thanks to Gödel Post Turing ... and computer science/logic). It  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the AUDA part: the (admittedly rough, concerning only ideally  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct machines) translation of UDA in the language of a universal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine, like (Peano) Arithmetic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And given that physics is testable, this makes comp testable (well in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AUDA the definition of the internal points of view are debatable, and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better solution could be imaginable, I have used the old definition  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can find in the Theaetetus of Plato. They work very well thanks to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the subtleties of the Gödel-Löb self-reference logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA is easy (except the step 07 and 08 which asks for more work).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AUDA is difficult because you have to study Mathematical Logic to get  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the point, and Quantum Mechanics to believe it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA+AUDA leads to McGuin Mysterianism, as explained and justified by  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;betting, praying&quot; machine. There is a gap of explanation, which  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be justified almost completely from the first person point of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view.  From the third person point of view there is no gap at all.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Machines can already see this, and this should please you, if I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand you well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Matter then pay a special role in the dreams, especially those  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;collective dreams&quot;, but it is part of the dreams. We are in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number matrix, if you want a short description. My point is not that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is true, but that this is Popper-refutable. It is not a question  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of liking it or not, but of making the math and the experiments. All  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in all,  it makes many fundamental question less obvious that many  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think.
</em><br />
