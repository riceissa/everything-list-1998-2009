What are people's ideas about the problem of a global measure on 
<br />
&quot;everything?&quot;  It seems to me that a lot of the TOE's I've seen make an 
<br />
assumption like &quot;one structure, one vote.&quot;  For example, if one assumes that 
<br />
&quot;everything&quot; is the set of all computations, then one strategy might be to 
<br />
look at the behavior of an average large turing machine and see what the 
<br />
computation might look like &quot;from the inside&quot;, treating it as a simulation 
<br />
of a universe of some kind.  But the notion of &quot;average&quot; seems to assume 
<br />
that each possible turing machine is given equal weight...how do we know 
<br />
they shouldn't be weighed by kolmogorov complexity or something else?  
<br />
Similarly, Max Tegmark's TOE involves looking at all possible mathematical 
<br />
structures, dividing them into equivalence classes, and then seeing what 
<br />
kind of universe the majority of self-aware observers will find themselves 
<br />
in.  But again, this assumes that if one possible mathematical structure 
<br />
contains 10 observers and another contains 100, then an observer is ten 
<br />
times more likely to find himself in the second structure than the 
<br />
first...but why should this necessarily be the case?  Are we assuming that 
<br />
the land of Platonic forms contains exactly one &quot;copy&quot; of each distinct 
<br />
structure?  Again, isn't it possible that some other measure would make 
<br />
sense?
<br />
<br />The main appeal of TOE's is that they reduce the amount of arbitrariness in 
<br />
our basic assumptions about reality.  If all possible universes are real to 
<br />
observers inside them (or all possible observer-moments are real, to cut out 
<br />
the middleman), then we can escape the problem of &quot;why these laws of physics 
<br />
and not some others?&quot;  But I think we do need some kind of global measure on 
<br />
the set of &quot;everything&quot;, since everything obviously includes worlds (or 
<br />
observer-moments) that seem to be identical to this one up to a certain 
<br />
point but in which the laws suddenly break down, and we want to be able to 
<br />
say that this is less probable somehow (I've never been sure what people 
<br />
were talking about when they referred to 'white rabbits' but I think it's 
<br />
another version of this problem...isn't white actually a pretty common color 
<br />
for rabbits though?  Is it an Alice in Wonderland reference?)  The problem 
<br />
is that in introducing a global measure we run the risk of bringing back 
<br />
exactly the same arbitrariness that we had before--&quot;why this global measure 
<br />
and not some other?&quot;  It seems to me that this is really the central problem 
<br />
in divising a good TOE.
<br />
<br />One solution is to say there is no global measure...this is what James Higgo 
<br />
believes, if I understand him correctly, and possibly Hans Moravec as well.  
<br />
James Higgo's picture of reality is a pretty honest look at what &quot;no global 
<br />
measure&quot; implies--basically we can't talk about the probabilities of any 
<br />
future events at all, and our knowledge is limited to the particular things 
<br />
we're experiencing in this observer-moment and the statement &quot;all possible 
<br />
thoughts exist.&quot;  Another solution is the &quot;one distinct structure, one vote&quot; 
<br />
idea that Max Tegmark seems to use, and possibly some others as well.  A 
<br />
third solution might be to try to show that given some other more basic 
<br />
assumptions, there is only one possible measure consistent with the 
<br />
assumptions--this is the one I'm in favor of, and I have a rough idea about 
<br />
how a kind of formalized version of anthropic reasoning might provide the 
<br />
necessary constraints.  The last solution I can think of would be to treat 
<br />
the many-worlds theory as a measure on the set of all computations (assuming 
<br />
that all computations actually end up being instantiated in some branch or 
<br />
another) and then work backwards to see what the properties of this measure 
<br />
are...perhaps it will be elegant enough that we can think of some kind of 
<br />
philosophical &quot;justification&quot; for it.
<br />
<br />A lot of people have a lot of different ideas about TOE's on this list, so 
<br />
maybe the global measure issue could help clarify where we all stand in 
<br />
relation to each other...do people have specific proposals about this?  I 
<br />
guess the other relevant question is, what is the set of &quot;everything&quot; that 
<br />
you're putting the measure on...all computations?  All mathematical 
<br />
structures?  All observer-moments?
<br />
<br />Let me know what you think...
<br />
<br />Jesse
