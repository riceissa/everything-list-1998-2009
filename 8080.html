Norm writes
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You [Hal Finney] say, &quot;. . . the Church Thesis, which I would paraphrase
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as saying that there are no physical processes more computationally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; powerful than a Turing machine, or in other words that the universe could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in principle be simulated on a TM.  I wouldn't be surprised if most people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who believe that minds can be simulated on TMs also believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything can be simulated on a TM.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm out of my depth here, but this doesn't make sense to me.  My 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding is that the Turing Machine is a hypothetical device.
</em><br />
<br />Unfortunately, the &quot;Turing Machine&quot; is often taken to be either one
<br />
of *two* possibilities.
<br />
<br />One is, as you say, a &quot;device&quot;.  All the usual paraphernalia of a normal
<br />
computer is abstracted away, leaving the least possible behavior that
<br />
could still do computing. Turing, of course, began with the simplest
<br />
operations that he could conceive of a human &quot;computer&quot; doing.
<br />
<br />In this first view, we arrive at the usual picture of a little box on
<br />
wheels which scans a tape one square at a time, and either writes a
<br />
zero or a 1, and then moves left or right on the tape depending also
<br />
on what it scanned.
<br />
<br />But there is a second meaning to &quot;Turing Machine&quot; that is also used
<br />
extensively in the literature. This has utterly nothing to do with
<br />
devices. Mathematically, a Turing Machine is a set of quintuples
<br />
(quadruples in many treatments, e.g. Boolos and Jeffrey). These 
<br />
quintuplets have only mathematical or platonic existence. Yet one
<br />
can see that by their nature were they implemented in the flesh, so
<br />
to speak, they could accomplish a specific computation as spelled
<br />
out by the entries in the five slots of each quintuplet. (Four
<br />
slots, slightly simpler, are composed of two that specify the 
<br />
current state you're in and the current symbol you're reading,
<br />
and two composed of the output: the symbol you write and the next
<br />
state you go to.)
<br />
<br />Sometimes discussions ensue when one party is talking about an
<br />
actual (though theoretical) device, and the other is talking about
<br />
the mathematical description. So beware the term &quot;Turing Machine&quot;,
<br />
unless it's clear which interpretation is meant.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If one could be built that operated at faster-than-light or infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speed, maybe it could, in principle, simulate the universe.  However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this isn't possible.  Does this mean that the Church Thesis, hence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalism, is, in reality, false?
</em><br />
<br />No, this doesn't affect Church's Thesis, as probably some here will
<br />
explain better than I.  Sometimes one does encounter &quot;Zeno machines&quot;
<br />
in the literature, which can solve a harder class of problems because
<br />
it's assumed that they can complete an infinite number of steps in
<br />
finite time.
<br />
<br />But Church's Thesis merely says that every effective computation (that
<br />
anyone has been able to think of) can be calculated by a Turing machine.
<br />
It turns out that this specification of Turing machine is completely
<br />
equivalent to several other reasonable ways calculations can in principle
<br />
be done, e.g., Post-production strings, recursive functions, &quot;abacus
<br />
computable functions&quot;, and so on.  The &quot;thesis&quot; part is that this whole
<br />
class of equivalent capability is *all* that a computation can be.
<br />
<br />&quot;Computationalism&quot; is yet another claim.  It's the notion that all of
<br />
our own thoughts as well could be implemented on a Turing Machine in
<br />
a way that would deliver to us just as much experiential satisfaction.
<br />
