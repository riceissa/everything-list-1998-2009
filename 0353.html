<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would support my position than yours, but that's not saying much.
</em><br />
<br />Let's see if there isn't a reasonable way out of this stalemate. First of
<br />
all it's obvious that consciousness must have something to do with
<br />
information. Now a binary string is the simplest kind of object that can
<br />
contain information, but any discrete structure that can contain
<br />
information can also be encoded as binary strings. Therefore binary
<br />
strings are a universal container of information. If pure structure can
<br />
sustain consciousness, then binaries strings can sustain consciousness. Do
<br />
you agree so far?
<br />
<br />You don't seem to think that pure structure is sufficient for
<br />
consciousness. Why? Clearly we experience dynamics and decisions, but
<br />
could they not just be illusions? Is there a deeper reason why dynamics
<br />
and decisions are necessary for consciousness?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	No, that's not what I said.  For the shortest program, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulated environment would no doubt be vastly simplified compared to what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we observe.  But the basic elements of competition for survival and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the advantages of communication would be there.  It will take many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generations to evolve intelligence, of course.
</em><br />
<br />But there is no reason to think that intelligence will easily evolve in
<br />
any competitive environment. Neural networks have been in existence a lot
<br />
longer than intelligence. Some people even argue that the evolution of
<br />
intelligence on earth is a pure coincidence. I wouldn't go that far, but
<br />
the evolution of intelligence clearly depends on a fairly small set of
<br />
environments.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	You know as well as I do that an approximate solution is good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough for our purposes and much easier to find.  To be fair, the length
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of both the form you proposed (and which I had earlier rejected), and of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the competitors such as the neural nets in the simple environment, should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be estimated.  Maybe a good (and neutral) computer scientist could give us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those estimates without too much work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	My proposal to find a definition of implementation of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation is much more conservative than your approach, since it also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; applies to regular theories of physics, and is in the established
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tradition of computationalism.  I admit it requires more work but I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think it's hopeless; and if it is, that's just as important to know.
</em><br />
<br />I think your approach is an interesting one, and not hopeless (as far as I
<br />
can see). But then it's quite difficult to discuss an approach that
<br />
is missing the definition for a basic concept.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Just that it would take a big program.  Of course the neurons must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also be numbered in some sensible way.
</em><br />
<br />Ok, you have your estimate, and I have mine. The numbering of course can
<br />
be based on spatial position.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	On the contrary.  Some programs will just rewrite the same part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the tape, and those we can neglect for now.  But some will keep printing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out copies of the same string end on end, and the ones that halt will have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zero measure compared to those, since more copies means more measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This gives a slight advantage to short strings.
</em><br />
<br />No I assume that each tape only contributes to the measure of the entire
<br />
string on the tape, not to the measures of substrings. (I.e., you can only
<br />
be an entire tape, not part of a tape, if you want to think of it that
<br />
way) Otherwise the measure will be completely dominated by simple counting
<br />
programs that write out 0's and 1's as fast as they can. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Here is a serious problem for you.  The Turing machines start out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will all possible programs, that is, with all possible infinite strings on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the tapes.  At any finite time, no matter how large [and therefore in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; limit], the fraction of the tape that even the repeat printers have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; covered is equal to zero.  So the printed strings have zero measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compared to the infinity of random strings on the as yet untouched part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the tape, even though the fraction of those that are conscious is small.
</em><br />
<br />That is not the model I have in mind. It doesn't seem sensible to think of
<br />
a universe with a continuous infinity of Turing machines. Instead I assume
<br />
that the universe starts with one Turing machine with a blank (read-only) 
<br />
input tape, then before each clock cycle each existing Turing machine is
<br />
cloned, with 0 appended to the input tape of one copy, and 1 appended to
<br />
the input tape of the other.
