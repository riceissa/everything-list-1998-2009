I don't think there are many intelligent beings per cubic Plank length in
<br />
our universe at all! In fact, string theorists don't know how to get to the
<br />
standard model from their favorite theory, yet they still believe in it.
<br />
Simple deterministic models could certainly explain our laws of physics, as
<br />
't Hooft explains in these articles:

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;But let me ask if you agree that considering Conway's 2D

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that conscious life would be extraordinarily rare?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I certainly agree that it would be &quot;extraordinarily rare&quot;, in the sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the size of the lattice would need to be very big, and the number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clock-ticks required would need to be very large. But &quot;big&quot; and &quot;large&quot;
</em><br />
are
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such relative terms! Clearly, our own universe is very, very big. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question is, how can we sensibly determine whether life is more likely in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our universe or in Conway's Life universe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't believe we have anywhere near enough data to answer this question,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I don't think it's unanswerable in principle. Fredkin actually
</em><br />
believes
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that our universe is a 3+1D cellular automata, and if anyone ever found
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such a description of our physics (or some other fundamentally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational description), then we could directly compare it with
</em><br />
Conway's
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Life, determining for each one how big the lattice needs to be, and how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many clock-ticks are required, for life to appear with (say) 90%
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability. (Of course, this determination might be difficult even when
</em><br />
we
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know the rules of the CAs. But we can try.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One thing that you'd have to take into account is the complexity of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules you're comparing, including the number of states allowed per cell.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not only are the rules to Conway's Life extremely simple, but the cells
</em><br />
are
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; binary. All things being equal, I would expect that an increase in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complexity of the rules and the number of cell-states allowed would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decrease the necessary lattice-size and/or number of clock-ticks required
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for SASs to grow out of a pseudo-random initial state. I mention this to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point out a problem with our intuitions about our universe vs. Conway's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Life: the description of our universe is almost certainly more complex
</em><br />
than
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the description of Conway's Life with a simple initial state. If Fredkin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually succeeds in finding a 3+1D CA which describes our universe, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will almost certainly require more than 2 cell-states, and its rules will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly be more complex than those of the Life universe. We have to take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this difference into account when trying to compare the two universes, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we have nowhere near enough data to quantify the difference currently. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really don't know what size of space in the Life universe is equivalent to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (say) a solar system in this universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a way, this is all beside the point, since I have no problem believing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that one CA can evolve SASs much more easily than some other CA whose
</em><br />
rules
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and initial state are exactly as complex. (In fact, this must be true,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since for any CA that supports life at all, there's an equally complex one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that isn't even computation universal.) I have no problem believing that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Life universe is, in some objective sense, not very conducive to SASs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps it's less conducive to SASs than our own universe, although I'm
</em><br />
not
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convinced. What I have a problem believing is that CAs as a class are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somehow less conducive to observers than quantum-physical models as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; class. In fact, I think it's substantially more likely that there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relatively simple CA models (and other computational models) that are much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more conducive to SASs than either Conway's Life universe or our own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Models in which, for instance, neural-net structures arise much more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; naturally from the basic physics of the system than they do in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, or the Life universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;In many ways, our universe seems tailor made for creating observers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand this perspective, but for what it's worth, I'm profoundly out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of sympathy with it. In my view, computation universality is the real
</em><br />
key -
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life and consciousness are going to pop up in any universe that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation universal, as long as the universe is big enough and/or it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lasts long enough. (And there's always enough time and space in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathiverse!) When I think about the insane, teetering, jerry-rigged
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contraptions that we call life in this universe - when I think about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tortured complexity that matter has to twist itself into just to give us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single-celled replicators - and when I think about the insane reaches of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space we see around us (even if we end up finding life in practically
</em><br />
every
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solar system, there's a crazy amount of space even between planets, not to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mention stars) - I find it easy to believe that our universe is just one
</em><br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those countless universes out there in Mathspace which isn't especially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conducive to life at all, but is simply computation universal, so life
</em><br />
pops
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up eventually.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because of the above conclusions, the problem of measure is a serious one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for me. I don't have a clue why I would be more likely to find myself in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe like this one instead of some CA universe. Regarding your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggestion that we might judge universes not only by the complexity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their rules and initial states, but also by the complexity of the simplest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program which &quot;finds&quot; SASs within them: as I understand the proposal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes (or observer-moments within the universes) which have simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules and initial states and yet generate SASs easily would have greater
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure, because the program needed to &quot;find&quot; these very common SASs would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also be simple. This is an intriguing idea, but it doesn't help me,
</em><br />
because
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't (yet) see why simplicity or complexity of any kind should affect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure. I can imagine a CA world which is sparsely populated with SASs,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and one that's densely populated with them, but the number of SASs (or the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of observer moments) in both worlds seems exactly the same -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (countably?) infinite. So why would I be more likely to find myself in one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of those universes rather than the other?
