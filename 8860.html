<br />Thanks, Bruno, for the above and also your more lengthy response, and 
<br />
also to Jef for your response below.  After I posted the question below 
<br />
about Bruno's a) and b) I realised that I had set up a false dichotomy, 
<br />
and I was bracing for the appeal to Godel which Bruno and in a way also 
<br />
Jef responsed with.  I've been trying to figure out how best to pose 
<br />
what I was actually trying to get at and I've been busy, but I wanted 
<br />
say thanks for the response.  For now, I think that there's a problem 
<br />
with defining what a machine is.  As Bruno said, now we really don't 
<br />
know what a machine is.  So in the absense of a precise definition, 
<br />
perhaps we end up running away from ill-defined words like &quot;machine&quot;, 
<br />
&quot;reason&quot;, &quot;soul&quot;, &quot;faith&quot;, etc., for who knows what personal &quot;reasons&quot;. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize that part of the problem is a difference in philosophy, 
<br />
the prime example being the Platonic vs. Aristotelian.  I guess this 
<br />
underscores the importance of Jeanne's original question about the 
<br />
place for philosophy in subjects like Artificial Intelligence.  Perhaps 
<br />
this is obvious to most of us here, but it is an interesting question.  
<br />
In fact, the very question &quot;Why philosophize?&quot; is actually 
<br />
philosophizing.  We humans just can't get away from it.  It's what we 
<br />
do naturally.  And perhaps this is part of what I'm trying to get at.  
<br />
A machine has to be interviewed by a human in order to philosophize.  
<br />
We humans are somehow the source of something from nothing in a way 
<br />
that a machine is not (Jef's &quot;something special about the human 
<br />
experience&quot;).  This is part of the definition of a machine, as I see it.
<br />
<br />Back to thinking.
<br />
<br />Tom

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;So Bruno says that:

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;a) &quot;I am a machine.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;b) &quot;...no man can grasp all aspect of man&quot;
</em><br />
<br />A and b above both make sense to me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;Jef and Brent say that we are machines

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;who (that?) philosophize.
</em><br />
<br />I'll agree that was implied by my statement.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suggest we start out by concentrating on the fact that Brent and Jef
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't agree with Bruno's b) above.
</em><br />
<br />Note that I would in fact agree with both a and b above.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; (And also perhaps Bruno doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree with himself (Bruno's a) vs. b) above)).  If we truly are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines, then by definition we should be able to (in theory) figure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out the &quot;list of instructions&quot; that we follow.  But wouldn't this be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grasping all aspects of ourselves?  If not, then what part of 
</em><br />
ourselves
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is outside of the realm of being able to grasp, and if so, how can we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say we are machines in a totally closed rationalistic/naturalistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world?  Brent and Jef's paragraphs sound mystical to me, as mystical 
</em><br />
as
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any other &quot;first truth&quot; assumption.
</em><br />
<br />I intentionally adopted a mystical tone in response to Tom's assertion
<br />
about &quot;modern philosophy&quot; being the &quot;death of humanness&quot; since I was
<br />
trying to relate to someone who appeared to be saying that there's
<br />
something essentially special about the human experience.
<br />
<br />So I agreed, trying to show that from the subjective point of view,
<br />
the human experience certainly is extraordinary, but that it's all a
<br />
part of an objectively knowable, but never fully known, world.
<br />
<br />My viewpoint is mystical to the extent that Albert Einstein and
<br />
Buckminster Fuller were mystical, acknowledging the mystery of our
<br />
experience while remaining fully grounded in an empirical but never
<br />
fully knowable reality.
<br />
<br />To go to the heart of Tom's assertion about complete self knowledge,
<br />
in order for a system to fully &quot;know&quot; something, it must contain a
<br />
complete model of that something within itself, therefore the system
<br />
that knows must always be more complex than that which it knows.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that much endless discussion and debate about the
<br />
nature of the Self, Free Will and Morality hinges on a lack of
<br />
understanding of the relationship between the subjective and objective
<br />
viewpoint, and that each tends to expand in ever-increasing spheres of
<br />
context.
<br />
<br />Expanding the sphere of subjective understanding across an increasing
<br />
scope of subjective agents and their interactions provides
<br />
ever-increasing but never complete understanding of shared values that
<br />
work.  Expanding the sphere of objective understanding provides
<br />
increasing scope of instrumental knowledge of practices that work.
<br />
Combining the two by applying increasingly objective instrumental
<br />
knowledge toward the promotion of increasingly shared subjective
<br />
values is the very essence of moral decision-making.
<br />
<br />Paradox is always a case of insufficient context.
