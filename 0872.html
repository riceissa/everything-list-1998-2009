</em><br />
<br />In Theoretical Computer Science, 
<br />
there is a traditional way to handle self-reference. 
<br />
Basicaly self-reference is builded upon the so called 
<br />
&nbsp;second recursion theorem by Kleene 1938 see (1).
<br />
This theorem says that for any computable 
<br />
&nbsp;transformation, you can build
<br />
a program which applies that transformation to itself.
<br />
The theorem is constructive. Given the 
<br />
the code of the transformation T you can build the 
<br />
program which applies T to itself. For exemple, in case T 
<br />
computes the identity function, you get a self-reproducing program.
<br />
<br />The second recursion theorem is also true about the set of
<br />
metaprograms and the metametaprograms ... This has been
<br />
shown by John Case, a modern 'specialist' on self-reference: see his
<br />
WEB pages for more links to self-reference:
<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cis.udel.edu/~case/index.html">http://www.cis.udel.edu/~case/index.html</a>
<br />
This makes for exemple possible the building of self-referential 
<br />
collection
<br />
of machines, like self-regenerating nets of machines, similar
<br />
to hydra or planaria.
<br />
<br />In that sense the machine can be an object to itself.
<br />
Suppose a machine has some ability to prove, like an automatic
<br />
proving machine or an automated deduction system. 
<br />
What can an automated deduction system proves about itself ?
<br />
What can a consistent automated deduction system says about itself ?
<br />
<br />An incredible use of, still the second recursion theorem (or his 
<br />
formalised version known as the diagonalisation lemma) has make 
<br />
it possible for Solovay to settle that question, in 1985, after 
<br />
&nbsp;Godel 1931 and Lob 1955 deep breaktroughs. At least he settles 
<br />
that question concerning sound machines (or theories) which believe 
<br />
(or proves theorems) in 
<br />
&nbsp;classical logic and elementary arithmetic.
<br />
The results are astonishing : not only there is a decidable
<br />
axiomatic system (G) which formalises completely what the machines 
<br />
can prove, but there is also an axiomatic system (G*) which formalizes
<br />
completely what is true about the machine (including what the
<br />
machine is unable to prove). (all this at the propositional level!).
<br />
<br /><br />NOW THE BIG PROBLEM: we have hardly talk on 
<br />
&nbsp;any suject here. The classical
<br />
theory of self-reference talks only about what a 
<br />
&nbsp;machine-object can correctly tell
<br />
about itself seen as an object. It is a sort of third-person
<br />
self-reference.
<br />
Only intellect and object are at work until here.
<br />
So, how to define an subject coherently with the classical 
<br />
self-reference theory ?
<br />
<br />Believe it or not, Romanos, but an answer 
<br />
can be found in Plato's Thaetetus.
<br />
Or at least an attempt toward an answer. 
<br />
The basic idea is to define the subject 
<br />
as the one who knows (as opposed to the intellect 
<br />
who proves or communicates convincingly), and then 
<br />
to define &quot;knowing p&quot; by &quot;justifying (proving) p    AND     p&quot;.
<br />
<br />Another basic motivation for this strategy can perhaps be provided by
<br />
some interpretation of
<br />
Descartes' first meditations or by the traditional idealist use of
<br />
the dream (the old natural virtual reality!), in Pythagore's 
<br />
and Platon (still the Thaetetus) philosophy
<br />
or in some Indian idealist philosophical school (think 
<br />
about the yogavasistha(2).
<br />
... or Lewis Carroll.
<br />
<br />I am aware that such a definition of knowledge is still very
<br />
debated among philosophers.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, in that case, with such definition, 
<br />
it is an exercice, even an easy
<br />
one for those who read at least that wonderfull recreative book 
<br />
&quot;Forever Undecided&quot; by Raymond Smullyan (another professional of
<br />
classical self-reference), to show that 
<br />
the subject cannot be a object for itself.
<br />
<br />This, I hope provide an answer to your question, and a path 
<br />
(the godelian one) toward some communicable light bearing on
<br />
similar question.
<br />
More details and references are given in <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal</a>.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Note also that it is not necessary to believe in Thaetetus' strategy
<br />
to use it  to invalide arguments, as I do for Lucas-Penrose
<br />
type of argument in <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal</a>.
<br />
Even for non-computationalist such an approach can provide an
<br />
*etalon philosophy* useful for possible comparisons between
<br />
various philosophies.
<br />
<br />What about &quot;the observer&quot; ? I give reasons to *define* it
<br />
by *I observe p* = &quot;I justify p   AND   p is consistent&quot;, for
<br />
a class of atomic &quot;verifiable&quot; proposition p (in computer
<br />
science those are the sigma-1 propositions).
<br />
This is a way to internalise the Many-Consistent-Worlds 
<br />
idea, including the fact that we are searching a probability
<br />
defined on the set of those worlds (or states).
<br />
<br />In that case we find indeed a sort of probability
<br />
logic rather similar to classical Birckhof-Von Neumann Quantum
<br />
Logic.
<br />
This gives tools for extracting a precise measure on the 
<br />
*set of relative
<br />
computational histories* having a welcome Quantum smell.
<br />
Thanks to the difference between G and G*, we get two Quantum
<br />
Logics, one for the observable and communicable propositions,
<br />
i.e. *the physical propositions*, and one for the observable
<br />
but non communicable propositions. This last logic is a good
<br />
candidate for a Logic of Qualia.
