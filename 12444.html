<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Maudlin starts off with the assumption that a recording being  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conscious is obviously absurd, hence the need for the conscious  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; machine to handle counterfactuals. If it were not for this assumption  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then there would not have been much point to the rest of the paper.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Actually, Putnam and Chalmers also think that the idea of any physical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; system implementing any computation is absurd. I am not sure of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Mallah's position (he seems to have disappeared from the list after I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; joined), but Hal Finney seemed to give some credence to the idea, and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; outside the list Hans Moravec and Greg Egan seem also to at least  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; entertain the possibility that it is true. I would be interested if  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; anyone is aware of any other references.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hans Moravec has defended in this list indeed the idea that even a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teddy bear is conscious. You could perhaps search in the archive my  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reply to him. I will try to sum up what I think about this, but other  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things need to be clarified, perhaps.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Although you have clearly stated that the two ideas - consciousness  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; supervening on all physical processes and consciousness supervening on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; no physical process - are completely different I think they are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; related in that in both cases matter is irrelevant to consciousness,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If consciousness supervenes on all physical processes a case can be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made that matter could be relevant for consciousness. (I see Peter  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jones makes a similar remark).
</em><br />
<br />Except that you could say the same for the Maudlin example, in which it is shown 
<br />
that conscious can differ in two objects which do not differ in physical activity: it 
<br />
does not strictly show that physical activity (or more generally, matter) is unnecessary, 
<br />
just that the usual definition of supervenience does not apply. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ... and we may as well say that what is important is computation as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; platonic object, not its accidental correlation with (putative) real  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; world processes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's the point indeed. A consequence. Not something I assume. You put  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it right below.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; They are also closely related in that the main argument against them  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is &quot;that's absurd&quot;. A second argument against them is also the same:  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the difficulty explaining why we don't suddenly find ourselves in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;white rabbit&quot; universes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My point was to show that comp transforms partially  the &quot;mind-body  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation&quot; problem into an explanation of why such white rabbits are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rare. The non triviality of the mathematics of computers gives more  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than a hint: in acomp (arithmetical translation of the UDA) we can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already show how a &quot;quantum like quantization&quot; occurs for the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations having &quot;probability one&quot;.  I will insist on this later  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps. I must find a way to explain more the math without frightening  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the inumerates :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Academically it has been the inverse: I had to motivate the mind-body  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem to mathematicians who are known to be generally allergic to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything just looking like metaphysics. This has been far more  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficult!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Throwing out comp throws out physical supervenience as well, so it can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; eliminate the problem. Keeping comp and throwing out physical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; supervenience is the tricky thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see why throwing comp throws out physical supervenience. On the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contrary, if my reasoning is correct, throwing comp is even the only  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way to keep a physical supervenience, for example by asking for a non  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational physical process (like Penrose BTW but for very different  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasons).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Keeping comp we just have to throw out physical supervenience. It can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; look tricky because, we are used to associate a particular mind/person  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with (what we see as) a particular body. My opinion is that this is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just an aristotelian prejudice. Technically there is a priori no  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem (except the mathematical rarity of the white rabbit) given that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a computational supervenience thesis remain available. Consciousness is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; associated with the infinity of equivalent (non distinguishable)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical-computations. Time and space appears then to be internal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relatively stable constructions.
</em><br />
<br />You take comp and supervenience as two separate theories, but I would bet 
<br />
that most computationalists take them as a package deal. This is what I mean 
<br />
by &quot;standard&quot; computationalism. It is not to say that comp and supervenience 
<br />
cannot be separated, but some people are just going to respond &quot;that's absurd&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I wonder if we are talking about the same thing, because it doesn't  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seem to me that an empirical proof is needed to show that any physical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; process could be seen as implementing any computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not obvious at all. You need both empiry + a physical theory  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about that empiry, just to say that there is a physical process  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implementing if only one computation (to say nothing about all  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations).
</em><br />
<br />All you need is one physical process. If consciousness is in no way dependent on the 
<br />
details of this physical process, then the actual physics is irrelevant. Do you see how, 
<br />
aside from one small detail, this is equivalent to saying that consciousness is not 
<br />
dependent on any physical process at all? 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; For example, it is no problem if the physical process under  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consideration lacks a sufficient number of distinct states, because  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the one state can be reused to perform as many computations in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; parallel as you want, in the same way as a certain value in a given  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computer processor register will be the same in the course of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; countless possible computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the state of the universal machine doing the computation will be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different. If the computer comes back to an earlier state it will loop,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and as such it will lose its universality. A state makes sense only  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relatively to a universal machine (&quot;material&quot; or arithmetical say)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; getting through that state.
</em><br />
<br />It doesn't matter if the machine loops, because the one physical state can 
<br />
map to many different computational states. Semantics is arbitrary. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course this is completely useless as far as practical computation  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; goes because to keep track of random 1's and 0's which, looked at the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; right way, are implementing a word processing program, you need to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; write the program and implement it on a conventional computer to keep  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; track of everything. It is like saying that a page covered in ink  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; contains any given text: true in a trivial sense, useless as far as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; helping you write a letter goes. However, what if computation can give  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rise to consciousness?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A computation is not just a collection of states. It is better  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described as an ordering of discrete states relatively to a (universal)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine computing producing those states. The &quot;produce&quot; here does not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to have to be a temporal or material processes, but can be described in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; term of atemporal arithmetical relations. That is why we can expect non  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trivial probabilities for going to one state to another.
</em><br />
<br />But if you consider a physical computer the actual states corresponding to the 
<br />
steps of the computation can be arbitrary. They will be ordered in a certain 
<br />
consistent way, so we can utilise the machine, but that is just a practical 
<br />
requirement. The natural number 3 does not have to be written as &quot;3&quot; nor 
<br />
even as &quot;III&quot;; it could be written as &quot;II&quot; on a Wednesday, &quot;IIII&quot; if the moon 
<br />
is full and &quot;I&quot; the rest of the time. This has no effect on the platonic object 3, 
<br />
but it does affect our ability to communicate and do arithmetic unless we keep 
<br />
track of the notation. Similarly with a computation, we need to be aware of the 
<br />
meaning of the states on a physical computer in order to use it, but our awareness 
<br />
of the computer semantics does not &quot;create&quot; the computation or imbue it with 
<br />
consciousness (if computations can be conscious) any more than our awareness 
<br />
of mathematical notation creates the number 3.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This would be like saying, what if a particular page of text were  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conscious? You would still need to remove all the unnecessary ink in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; order to read and perhaps interact with the text, but if you just left  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it alone it would still be conscious, dreaming away on the black page.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, but in that sense, assuming also a very speculative sort of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical infinity, all computations will be there in a trivial sense:  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all pieces of that paper contains not only UD* but the whole of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonia (a non comp object). Without that infinity speculation I could  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argue that most physical theories today will justify that among the UD  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accessible states only a finite numbers of them will be accessed. That  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is literaly nothing compared to what the whole of UD* needed for both  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness and then physical laws (assuming comp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps you believe in physical real number (almost all real number  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contains arithmetical truth coded in a non readable way). If physically  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real numbers exist (why not, they don't really exist in loop gravity,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but they do exist in string theories), then any analog (non static)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine embed arithmetical truth (much more than all computations) in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all of its activity. But now, it can be shown that such machine are not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turing universal: there are many problem that such machine cannot even  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; address. This is not an obvious result. Tarski showed it by proving  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the first order theories of the reals can be made complete and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decidable (and are thus logically poorer than Peano Arithmetic).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This can also be explained in term of Polynomial Equations with integer  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coefficient. That is, equation like the following:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3xyzt + 24yx^3 -7x^45 - 4u - 12 = 0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the variables or unknown x, y, z, t u belong to the reals, it can be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shown (by Sturm + Tarski) that there is an algorithm capable of finding  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the solutions; but if you ask that the variables are natural number or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integers then there is no such algorithm. If this seems weird just  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think about Fermat which is trivial on the reals and very difficult  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the natural numbers (but recently solved by Wiles &amp; Co.).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you want, the problem with the &quot;black pages&quot; is that there is no way  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or all ways!) to distinguish (internally or externally) the difference  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between an &quot;incarnation/implementation&quot; of the number 1 and the number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 0000000000 ... 000100000....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This changes once you add the sinus function. Trigonometric or periodic  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functions are a way to reintroduce the natural numbers in the frame of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the reals (by sinus(2PIx) = 0 for example). But to show that the black  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; page implements the sinus in a genuine computational (even in not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external user friendly way) is again not obvious and presuppose many  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical things. We can come back on this later perhaps.
</em><br />
<br />Why can't the black page contain everything that can possibly be written, i.e. 
<br />
it can be a superposition of an infinite number of pages with an infinite amount 
<br />
of ink? 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; One argument against this idea is that it is not enough to leave the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computation (or the text) hidden in randomness, because it is only  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; through interaction with the environment that consciousness manifests  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and only conventional brains and computers can interact with the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; environment. But this excludes the possibility that the conscious  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; entity is dreaming or interacting with a virtual reality, isolated  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from the substrate of its implementation due to the impenetrable  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; randomness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sensible: the best theory of consciousness and the most promising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; candidate for producing artificial intelligence/consciousness'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; What Bruno calls comp isn't standard computaitonalism, it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; an element of Platonism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Standard computationalism involves the idea that consciousness can be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; captured by a computer program running on a computer. Bruno keeps the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; first part but challenges the second, suggesting that the idea of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physical process in the computer actually causing the conscious  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience is flawed, as per Maudlin's paper. Thus he does not begin  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with the idea that conscious computations exist as Platonic objects  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (although I think he did suspect this all along) but ends with it as a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conclusion from examining the claims of standard computationalism.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Always risky to summarise someone else's ideas when they're watching,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but perhaps Bruno could comment if I have it wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No you are right. By comp I really mean &quot;standard computationalism&quot;. It  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is equivalent with the &quot;saying yes to the doctor who proposes some  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; artificial digital (generalized(*)) brain substitution for some level  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of description&quot;. To make the &quot;digital&quot; condition transparent and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine or formalism independent, I put Church thesis in &quot;comp&quot;. Then  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the arithmetical realism (platonism) is just the acceptance of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; excluded middle principle (A or ~A) for the arithmetical propositions A  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   (actually I need only the Sigma1 one, those with shape A = ExP(x) with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P decidable).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   It is the platonism of the usual working classical mathematician.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So comp is really &quot;standard computationalism&quot;,  probably made a little  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more precise than usual. The idea that Matter (primary matter) has no  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; role at all in science and consciousness is just an (admittedly non  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obvious) consequence of standard comp (cf. UDA). Of course I did  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suspect this all along. I am also glad with it in the sense than  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physicist does not presuppose primary matter except in a meta-heuristic  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way when they want to explain their subject matter without digging too  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much in the theoretical interpretation problems. But most physicist  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does use, without any problem of conscience, the excluded middle  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle on arithmetical propositions. In acomp (arithmetical version  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of comp where it is explained &quot;how&quot; to derive the physical laws from  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the number theoretical truth) I don't even need any &quot;ontological&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonism: I interview at the start machine who &quot;believes&quot; (= prove  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here) the excluded middle principle, that is I am using a more  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemological weaker form of &quot;platonism&quot;. But for the UDA (which  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explains *why* we have to derive the physics from the number) you have  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to accept that for all natural number i and n, either Fi(n) is defined  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or Fi(n) is not defined. The UD itself would have no sense in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contrary case. Fi = the ith one-variable program in an universal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enumeration of all partial computable function (cf Church thesis).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (*) The concept of generalized brain (the portion of whatever is needed  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be Turing emulated so that my consciousness is locally recreated) is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary to prevent the Colin Hales (but see also Johnson Laird in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literature) move consisting in saying that &quot;the environment&quot; plays a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; role in my consciousness: if that is the case put the environment in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the brain (by definition). If the environment is both needed and not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turing emulable then comp is just *already* false.
