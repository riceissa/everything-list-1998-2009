<br />
I'd be surprised if an idea similar to quantum suicide hadn't occured
<br />
to most of the members of this list before you read Tegmark's paper.
<br />
I first started thinking about it about ten years ago, I think.
<br />
<br />Being prone to depression most of my life, it seemed like an obvious
<br />
plan: a way to force God's hand, in a way.  Who says my arms are too
<br />
short to box with God?  Quantum suicide offers a way to choose which
<br />
environments are acceptable to us.  We can truly become masters of
<br />
our destiny.
<br />
<br />I'm an electical engineer, so I have (had) the means to carry out the
<br />
experiment.  As I mentioned, I was prone to depression.  I can't
<br />
remember if a specific incident triggered the desire to carry out the
<br />
plan, or if the desire just built in me over time.  It seems like an
<br />
awfully long time ago, now. Things weren't going my way.  At least,
<br />
not the way I thought I wanted them to go.  So I made the decision to
<br />
go through with it.
<br />
<br />The whole time, I knew that only one thing would be certain: that I
<br />
would survive.  But I didn't know by which avenue I would escape.  So
<br />
the whole time I was planning and designing and plotting, I tried to
<br />
figure out which would be the most likely.  The answer is obvious:
<br />
the most likely scenario for my survival would be that would change
<br />
my mind, and not go through with it.
<br />
<br />But I was unhappy, and a part of me desperately wanted to go through
<br />
with it, so I tried to make a firm resolve, whenever I could, that I
<br />
would complete the plan, and step through the device.  This of course
<br />
had an undesired affect: I was selecting out those versions of me
<br />
that had a weak resolve. For, as you've probably guessed by now, the
<br />
avenue that my survival did take was that I changed my mind.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, my life has gotten dramatically better.
<br />
Coincidence?  I'm not sure.
<br />
<br />Let me explain &quot;the project&quot;.  Again, the only thing I knew for sure
<br />
was that I would survive.  Well, I wanted to get something in those
<br />
worlds in which I did survive, and I figured out a way that I could.
<br />
I could set it up so that I would be killed if and only if I didn't
<br />
win the lottery on a particular day.  It was a sort of Russian
<br />
roulette with one player.
<br />
<br />Doing a rough estimate, I figured that I could find a game that would
<br />
offer a reasonable jackpot and that would have odds of winning at
<br />
about a million to one.  I could, of course, buy extra tickets to
<br />
reduce the odds. I wanted to minimize the chances of surviving and
<br />
*not* winning the lottery, so that meant that I had to design an
<br />
extremely reliable killing device.  I shot for there to be odds of
<br />
device failure on the order of a billion to one - so that if I
<br />
survived, chances would be roughly one in a thousand that I *didn't*
<br />
win the lottery.
<br />
<br />To recap:  from the bird perspective, for every billion copies of me
<br />
that went through the experiment, one thousand would have a winning
<br />
lottery ticket.  So the device would &quot;attempt&quot; to kill 999,999,000
<br />
copies.  But it would fail about once  with this number of kills, So
<br />
that one of those copies, that didn't win the lottery, would survive.
<br />
<br />How to design a device with that kind of reliability? Satellite
<br />
engineers know the answer to that one: redundancy. If you have a
<br />
single device that will fail about once in a thousand operations,
<br />
then three such devices, operating in parallel, will fail only about
<br />
once every billion.  That assumes that *everything* in the system is
<br />
in parallel, which is impossible.  There will be &quot;weak spots&quot; in the
<br />
design - single points of failure.
<br />
<br />But I also figured that I could make the device more reliable by the
<br />
following technique: if anything went wrong, the default behavior of
<br />
any of the mechanisms should be &quot;kill&quot;, instead of switching off.
<br />
Remember, I wanted to minimize the chances that I survive and don't
<br />
win the lottery.  If there's a small chance of something in an
<br />
individual mechanism malfunctioning, then that won't affect the
<br />
overall odds much, as long as the default behavior is to kill.
<br />
<br />There are two basic failure modes of the system: A, the device kills
<br />
when I do win the lottery; and B, it doesn't kill when I don't win
<br />
the lottery.  I figured that I wanted to reduce the likelihood of B
<br />
as much as possible, and that I didn't care that much about A, as
<br />
long as it was reasonably low (say one in a hundred).  Again, from
<br />
the bird perspective of the ensemble of one billion copies of me:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of 1,000,000,000:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,000 win the lottery, of which:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 get killed anyway, 990 survive.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;999,999,000 don't win the lottery, of which:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;999,998,999 get killed, 1 survives.
<br />
So a total of 991 &quot;me&quot;s survive, of which 990 have won the lottery.
<br />
Good odds, I think.
<br />
<br />Another failure scenario is that I only get maimed instead of killed
<br />
when the device goes off.  This is a grisly outcome, so I wanted to
<br />
design the likelihood of this to be as small as possible.  I decided
<br />
to use high-caliber pistols aimed at the base of my brain.  I needed
<br />
to ensure that when the time came, my head was restrained so that
<br />
there was no chance of the bullet missing the critical target.  I
<br />
didn't finish this portion of the investigation, but I'm pretty sure
<br />
that there's an optimal aim at close range which would ensure a very
<br />
low probability of a bullet doing damage, but not killing me.
<br />
<br />So I designed a system with three independent electronic kill
<br />
devices.  Each device consisted of a timer which, when it counted
<br />
down to zero, would discharge a capacitor through a solenoid, which
<br />
would pull the trigger of a .45 caliber pistol, which would shoot
<br />
through my head.  The counter would only be stopped by a signal from
<br />
a computer, indicating that I had won the lottery.  That signal would
<br />
come from one of three trusty helpers that I had hired (who had no
<br />
idea of what they were really doing, of course), to type in the
<br />
winning lottery number and send it to my computer by modem.  My
<br />
computers already knew the numbers of the tickets that I had bought,
<br />
so it could check to see if any of them matched.
<br />
<br />Nearly everything would be redundant - the timers, the guns, the
<br />
computers, and the helpers.  I had to shoot for (excuse the
<br />
expression) a one in a thousand failure rate or less for any one of
<br />
those individual systems.  Difficult, but possible.
<br />
<br />Leading up to the day of the actual lottery, I would do several trial
<br />
runs to verify the reliability.  The weakest link is probably the
<br />
people who are hired to type in the lottery number.  So I would hire
<br />
them to do that for several days in a row, and on the days leading up
<br />
to the target date, I would verify that they were performing
<br />
correctly.
<br />
<br />Also, prior to the target date, I would allow a long window of time
<br />
for each of the electronic mechanisms to charge up from the wall
<br />
sockets.  After they are charged, they can be disconnected and will
<br />
operate independently, thus eliminating a power outage as a source of
<br />
failure.  Then I would set the timers, verify that each is working,
<br />
and secure myself into the chair.  The probability would be high that
<br />
something would go wrong at this point.  These preparatory steps are,
<br />
in effect, a single point of failure.  Nothing can be done to
<br />
eliminate this completely, though.
<br />
<br />The chair would have a simple electronic locking mechanism that would
<br />
secure my head and arms.  When the counters got to zero, each gun
<br />
would either go off or not.  It's designed in such a way that if any
<br />
one of the three guns goes off, I would almost certainly be killed
<br />
instantly.  If none of the three guns goes off, then the electronic
<br />
lock would be released, and, hopefully, I'd be somewhat richer.
<br />
<br /><br />When you're talking about odds like one in a million, it's ridiculous
<br />
to think that the avenue of my survival would be to actually go
<br />
through with this plan.  I knew that it was much more likely that I
<br />
would change my mind.  Another possibility also occured to me: that
<br />
someone would find out and would stop me.  I thought that most people
<br />
would think that this plan of mine was insane, and would probably
<br />
have me commited as a hazard to myself, if they knew how serious I
<br />
was.  So I took precautions to prevent anyone from finding out.  I
<br />
kept it a secret.  This is actually the first time I've told anyone
<br />
about the details of my plan.
<br />
<br />I called it &quot;the project&quot;, so that no one would see something written
<br />
by me that would give away what it was really about. Later, I changed
<br />
the name to &quot;the Lathe&quot;, after an Ursula K. LeGuin story called &quot;The
<br />
Lathe of Heaven&quot;.  It seems to me that this device is a little bit
<br />
like that story - where we can choose what worlds we will live in.
<br />
Of course, we can't ever actually change the past, but we can select
<br />
our future.
<br />
<br />I never went through with it, obviously.  My life just inexplicably
<br />
got better, and I ceased being depressed.  As I mentioned above, I'm
<br />
not sure this was a coincidence.  Perhaps I did select my future,
<br />
just by planning and having that firm resolve to go through with it.
<br />
Perhaps I can continue to select my future, by &quot;threatening God&quot; that
<br />
I'll go through with it unless I get my way.  But now I doubt it.
<br />
Now I actually care too much about somebody else -- my wife.  I
<br />
couldn't kill myself now, knowing how much it would hurt her.
<br />
<br />So now I take my lumps as they come.  That sounds like maturity, and
<br />
when I write about the Lathe, it sure does sound pretty immature.
<br />
But lots of people kill themselves.  I'm certainly not in a position
<br />
to judge any of them.  We're all just shooting arrows in the dark,
<br />
after all.  I just thought I could deflect my arrow by purpose.
