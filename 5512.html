Hi Kory,
<br />
<br />So we met two important theories or machines:
<br />
Classical Logic CL and Peano Arithmetic PA.
<br />
<br />As collection of theorems, the first is a subset of
<br />
the second:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PA
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CL
<br />
<br />Now I have chosen PA to set the things. Any theory or
<br />
machine rich enough to prove elementary theorems about
<br />
numbers will do.
<br />
What will be important is that anybody (including possible
<br />
machines) should be able to verify &quot;mechanically&quot; if a given
<br />
proof is a proof, at least in principle (in case a given proof
<br />
is 2^64 steps long).
<br />
<br />We will interview PA about its possible (consistent) extensions.
<br />
<br />It is Godel who showed how to make such an interview,
<br />
by showing how to translate the meta-predicate of &quot;provability&quot;
<br />
into an arithmetical sentence.
<br />
<br />Let me be a little more specific. Don't hesitate to tell me you know
<br />
all this, but it could help some others, and it could help
<br />
in front of futur misunderstandings.
<br />
<br />PA has a language. Here it is:
<br />
<br />L_PA  =   {v, &amp;, -&gt;, not, t, f, A, E, =, +, *,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUC, 0, (, ), x,y,z,x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, ...}
<br />
<br />We could code those symbol by the odd integer above 1. So
<br />
the Godel number of &quot;v&quot; is 3, and this I abbreviate by ng(v)=3.
<br />
So ng(&amp;)=5, ng(-&gt;)=7, ng(not)=9, ng(t)=11, ..., ng(x)=33, ng(y)=35, etc.
<br />
<br />So exactly in the sense that you can define the divisability predicate
<br />
Div(x,y)  (which is true when x divide y) only with the available symbol
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;as in
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Div(x,y) =  Ez(x*z = y)  (there exist a number z such that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x multiplied by z gives y)
<br />
<br />you can define the meta-predicate IS-A-VARIABLE(x), which is
<br />
true when x is a number representing a variable, as Godel number.
<br />
Actually, with the code we have chosen:
<br />
<br />IS-A-VARIABLE(x)  = ODD(x) &amp; BIGGER-OR-EQUAL(x,3)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= Ey(x=2y+1) &amp; Ez(x = z+33)
<br />
<br /><br />Now we want to talk about formula also with PA. I recall
<br />
that there are precise formula formation rule like
<br />
if A is a formula then (not A) is a formula
<br />
if A and B are formula then (A &amp; B) is a formula,
<br />
etc.
<br />
<br />To code a formula by a number, a traditional way relies
<br />
on the well known fundamental theorem of arithmetic
<br />
saying that all number have a unique decomposition
<br />
in product of prime numbers.
<br />
<br />So the formula &quot;Ez(x*z = y)&quot; will be coded by the number
<br />
<br />2^(ng(E))*3^(ng(z))*5^(ng(())*7^ng(x)*11^(ng(*))*13^(ng(z))* ...
<br />
(I let you continue)
<br />
(I have also avoid the quotation mark for not wasting ink,
<br />
but ng('(') is more readable than ng((), mmhh..
<br />
<br />Now, a proof in, or by, PA  [&quot;in&quot; if you think as PA
<br />
being a theory; &quot;by&quot; if you think as PA as a machine
<br />
(a theorem prover)]  is just a sequence of formula
<br />
such that they are either axioms or has been obtained
<br />
from the axioms by a finite number of application of
<br />
the inference rule.
<br />
So, although it could be hard to *find* a proof (as
<br />
unpedagogical exercice try to prove the formula (A -&gt; A)
<br />
in the systeme send yesterday), it is easy to verify
<br />
a proof once the proof is given.
<br />
<br />The point is that we can translate a proof into a number
<br />
by relying a second time on the fundamental theorem
<br />
of arithmetic. A proof is just a finite sequence of
<br />
formula F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 ... FN  (actually it will be proof
<br />
of FN if F1, F2, ... are axioms or comes from axioms
<br />
and preeceeding formula by application of the inference
<br />
rule). Its (Godel) number will be
<br />
<br />2^ng(F1)*3^ng(F2)*5^ng(F3) ....
<br />
<br />Now, like we have define in PA language IS-A-VARIABLE(x)
<br />
we can translate meta-predicates like IS-AN-AXIOME(x),
<br />
HAS-BEEN-DERIVED-FROM-MODUS-PONENS(x,y,z), meaning
<br />
z is derivable from x and y by modus ponens.
<br />
<br />Etc. Etc.   So that we can defined in PA arithmetical language
<br />
<br />IS-A-PROOF-OF(x,y)  saying that y is a translation (a godel
<br />
number of) of a proof of formula (with Godel number) x.
<br />
<br />This was the B(x,y) of yesterday.
<br />
<br />And then the Godel formula BEW(x), that is PROVABLE(x),
<br />
is just EyB(x,y) i.e. it exist a number y such that y is a proof
<br />
of x, to make it short.
<br />
<br />Now, a machine will be said to be consistent,if the machine
<br />
does not prove f.    &quot;f&quot; is a symbol with the intended meaning of
<br />
an absurdity, or a contradiction. in arithmetic f could be defined
<br />
by the formula  (1 = 0), well actually (SUC(0) = 0).
<br />
<br />So the consistency of the machine, or of the theory, or
<br />
of PA (here) can be defined by the formula (not BEW(f)).
<br />
<br />Godel second incompleteness theorem is that
<br />
if a machine is consistent then the machine cannot prove
<br />
she is consistent. Now I will explain in which sense we can
<br />
say that to be consistent is the same has having a consistent
<br />
extension, so you see that Godel second incompleteness
<br />
explain why, as I said to John, when we ask the machine
<br />
if she *do* have at least one consistent extension, she
<br />
remains silent.
<br />
<br />Well that is a little bit discouraging isn' it? How could we
<br />
hope the machine to be able to give us the geometry
<br />
of its consistent extensions when she remain silent on
<br />
the very question of having consistent extensions at all?
<br />
<br />But if you are patient enough with PA, she will justify
<br />
her silence by proving that: if she is consistent then she cannot
<br />
prove her consistency:
<br />
<br />PA proves (not BEX(f))  -&gt;(not BEW (not BEX(f))
<br />
<br />I will prove Godel's theorem on the way, but I think
<br />
I will first give you a map of the territory including
<br />
two paths which make possible to sum up
<br />
the &quot;mathematical confirmation&quot; in one precise
<br />
mathematical formula. Well I don't know.
<br />
Any question or comment?
<br />
<br />Bruno
