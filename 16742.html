Very good answer, Kim,
<br />
<br />Just a few comments. and then the sequel.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Exercice 4: does the real number square-root(2) belongs to {0, 1, 2,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 3, ...}?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No idea what square-root(2) means. When I said I was innumerate I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wasn't kidding! I could of course look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it up or ask my mathematics teacher friends but I just know your  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation will make theirs seem trite.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well thanks.
<br />
The square root of 02 is a number x, such that x*x (x times x, x  
<br />
multiplied by itself) gives 2.
<br />
For example, the square root of 04 is 2, because 2*2 is 4. The square  
<br />
root of 09 is 3, because 3*3 is 9. Her by &quot;square root&quot; I mean the  
<br />
positive square root, because we will see (more later that soon) that  
<br />
numbers can have negative square root, but please forget this.
<br />
At this stage, with this definition, you can guess that the square  
<br />
root of 2 cannot be a natural number. 1*1 = 1, and 2*2 = 4, and it  
<br />
would be astonishing that x could be bigger than 2. So if there is  
<br />
number x such that x*x is 2, we can guess that such a x cannot be a  
<br />
natural number, that is an element of {0, 1, 2, 3 ...}, and the answer  
<br />
of exercise 4 is &quot;no&quot;. The square root of two will reappear  
<br />
recurrently, but more in examples, than in the sequence of notions  
<br />
which are strictly needed for UDA-7.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A set is entirely defined by its elements. Put in another way, we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; say that two sets are equal if they have the same elements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Exercise 6. Let S be the set {0, 1, 45} and let M be the set  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; described
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; by {45, 0, 1}. Is it true or false that S is equal to M?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; True - unless integer position within a given sequence in a set  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plays a role. I will guess that it does not.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are right.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Exercise 7. Let S be the set {666} and M be the set {6, 6, 6}. Is is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; true or false that S is equal to M?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; False - the commas separate each natural number
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are right. Also note that there is only one element in the set {6,  
<br />
6, 6}. It is just a redundant description of the set {6}.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Very excited about doing this. If you can make it all as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approachable as this I am over the moon!
</em><br />
<br /><br />I will try, and it is very kind to play such a candid role. I  
<br />
appreciate that you have the ability to say &quot;I don't know  
<br />
&lt;something&gt;&quot;. It is very helpful for me to remain approachable, and  
<br />
eventually it will help everybody.
<br />
<br />So let us continue.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />=============== Intension and extension ====================
<br />
<br /><br />Before defining &quot;intersection, union and the notion of subset, I would  
<br />
like to come back on the ways we can define some specific sets.
<br />
<br />In the case of finite and &quot;little&quot; set we have seen that we can define  
<br />
them by exhaustion. This means we can give an explicit complete  
<br />
description of all element of the set.
<br />
Example. A = {0, 1, 2, 77, 98, 5}
<br />
<br />When the set is still finite and too big, or if we are lazy, we can  
<br />
sometimes define the set by quasi exhaustion. This means we describe  
<br />
enough elements of the set in a manner which, by requiring some good  
<br />
will and some imagination, we can estimate having define the set.
<br />
<br />Example. B = {3, 6, 9, 12, ... 99}. We can understand in this case  
<br />
that we meant the set of multiple of the number three, below 100.
<br />
<br />A fortiori, when a set in not finite, that is, when the set is  
<br />
infinite, we have to use either quasi-exhaustion, or we have to use  
<br />
some sentence or phrase or proposition describing the elements of the  
<br />
set.
<br />
<br />Definition.
<br />
I will say that a set is defined IN EXTENSIO, or simply, in extension,  
<br />
when it is defined in exhaustion or quasi-exhaustion.
<br />
I will say that a set is defined IN INTENSIO, or simply in intension,  
<br />
with a &quot;s&quot;, when it is defined by a sentence explaining the typical  
<br />
attribute of the elements.
<br />
<br />Example: Let A be the set {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ... 100}. We can easily  
<br />
define A in intension:  A = the set of numbers which are even and more  
<br />
little than 100. mathematician will condense this by the following:
<br />
<br />A = {x such that x is even and little than 100}  = {x ⎮ x is even &amp; x  
<br />
&lt; 100}. &quot;⎮&quot; is a special character, abbreviating &quot;such that&quot;, and I  
<br />
hope it goes through the mail. If not I will use &quot;such that&quot;, or s.t.,  
<br />
or things like that.
<br />
The expression {x ⎮ x is even} is literally read as:  the set of  
<br />
object x, (or number x if we are in a context where we talk about  
<br />
number) such that x is even.
<br />
<br />Exercise 1: Could you define in intension the following infinite set C  
<br />
= {101, 103, 105, ...}
<br />
C = ?
<br />
<br />Exercise 2: I will say that a natural number is a multiple of 4 if it  
<br />
can be written as 4*y, for some y. For example 00 is a multiple of 4,  
<br />
(0 = 4*0), but also 28, 400, 404, ...  Could you define in extension  
<br />
the following set D = {x ⎮ x &lt; 10  &amp;  x is a multiple of 4}.
<br />
<br />A last notational, but important symbol. Sets have elements. For  
<br />
example the set A = {1, 2, 3} has three elements 1, 2 and 3. For  
<br />
saying that 3 is an element of A in an a short way, we usually write 3  
<br />
∈ A.  this is read as &quot;3 belongs to A&quot;, or &quot;3 is in A&quot;. Now 4 does  
<br />
not belong to A. To write this in a short way, we will write 4 ∉ A,  
<br />
or we will write ¬ (4 ∈ A) or sometimes just NOT(4 ∈ A). It is  
<br />
read: 4 does not belong to A, or: it is not the case that 4 belongs to  
<br />
A.
<br />
<br />Having those notions and notations at our disposition we can speed up  
<br />
on the notion of union and intersection.
<br />
<br />The intersection of the sets A and B is the (new) set of those  
<br />
elements which belongs to both A and B. Put in another way:
<br />
The intersection of the sets A with the set B is the set of those  
<br />
elements which belongs to A and which belongs to B.
<br />
This new set, obtained from A and B is written A ∩ B, or A inter. B  
<br />
(in case the special character doesn't go through).
<br />
With our notations we can write or define the intersection A ∩ B  
<br />
directly
<br />
<br />A ∩ B = {x ⎮ x ∈ A and x ∈ B}.
<br />
<br />Example {3, 4, 5, 6, 8} ∩ {5, 6, 7, 9} = {5, 6}
<br />
<br />Similarly, we can directly define the union of two sets A and B,  
<br />
written A ∪ B in the following way:
<br />
<br />A ∪ B = {x ⎮ x ∈ A or x ∈ B}.    Here we use the usual logical  
<br />
&quot;or&quot;. p or q is suppose to be true if p is true or q is true (or both  
<br />
are true). It is not the exclusive &quot;or&quot;.
<br />
<br />Example {3, 4, 5, 6, 8} ∪ {5, 6, 7, 9} = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.
<br />
<br />Exercice 3.
<br />
Let N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
<br />
Let A = {x ⎮ x &lt; 10}
<br />
Let B = {x ⎮ x is even}
<br />
Describe in extension (that is: exhaustion or quasi-exhaustion) the  
<br />
following sets:
<br />
<br />N ∪ A =
<br />
N ∪ B =
<br />
A ∪ B =
<br />
B ∪ A =
<br />
N ∩ A =
<br />
B ∩ A =
<br />
N ∩ B =
<br />
A ∩ B =
<br />
<br />Exercice 4
<br />
<br />Is it true that A ∩ B = B ∩ A, whatever A and B are?
<br />
Is it true that A ∪ B = B ∪ A, whatever A and B are?
<br />
<br />Now, I could give you exercise so that you would be lead to  
<br />
discoveries, but I prefer to be as simple and approachable as  
<br />
possible, and my goal is not even to give you the taste for doing  
<br />
research, so I will do the discovery by myself here and now. Indeed a  
<br />
natural question occurs. What will happen if we try to find the  
<br />
intersection of two sets which have no elements in common? For  
<br />
example, what is the intersection of A = {x ⎮ x is even} with B = {x  
<br />
⎮ x is odd} ? At first sight we could say that there is no  
<br />
intersection, given that A and B have no elements in common. But a set  
<br />
is just a bit more than its elements. And if there is no elements in  
<br />
the intersection, it means simply that the set A ∩ B has no elements.  
<br />
So we are very inspired if we let that bizarre set to exist, so we  
<br />
give it a name, and call it the empty set, and we can describe it  
<br />
easily in exhaustion by { }, although many describe it as ∅. So, if A  
<br />
and B have no elements in common, A ∩ B is still well defined and is  
<br />
equal to ∅. having a new toy, we can play with it:
<br />
<br />Exercise 5, with A and B the same as in exercise 3.
<br />
<br />∅ ∪ A =
<br />
∅ ∪ B =
<br />
A ∪ ∅ =
<br />
B ∪ ∅ =
<br />
N ∩ ∅ =
<br />
B ∩ ∅ =
<br />
∅ ∩ B =
<br />
∅ ∩ ∅ =
<br />
∅ ∪ ∅ =
<br />
<br /><br />-----------------------
<br />
SUBSET
<br />
We will say that A is a subset of B (A and B being sets) if, whatever  
<br />
object x represents, each time x belongs to A, it belongs to B. Put in  
<br />
another way it means that IF x belongs to A, THEN x belongs to B. It  
<br />
means that all the elements of A are also elements of B. We can write,  
<br />
with
<br />
<br />x ∈ A -&gt; x ∈ B.
<br />
<br />And this we abbreviate as A ⊆ B, and we read it: A is included in B.
<br />
<br />Example:
<br />
1) Let us look if the set A = {1, 2} is included in the set B = {1, 2,  
<br />
3}.  Here A has two elements. To see if A is included in B, we have to  
<br />
look at each element in the set A, and we have to see if they belongs  
<br />
to B. Now A has two elements, 1, and 2, so we have two tasks to  
<br />
accomplish, or two questions to answer:
<br />
does 01 belongs also to B. The answer is yes.
<br />
does 2 belongs also to B. The answer is yes.
<br />
We have thus verify that all elements of A are also elements of B, and  
<br />
thus we can conclude that A is indeed included in B.
<br />
<br />2) Let us look if the set A = {1} is included in B = {1, 2, 3}.  Now,  
<br />
A has only one element. So we are lucky, we have only one task to  
<br />
accomplish! Is 1 an element of B? The answer is yes. Thus we have {1}  
<br />
is included in {1, 2, 3}.
<br />
<br />3) Let us look if the set A=  { }, the empty set ∅,  is included in B  
<br />
= {1, 2, 3}. Now A has no element. So we are even more lucky, we have  
<br />
no task to accomplish at all. The condition is trivially satisfied. So  
<br />
the empty set is included in {1, 2, 3}. And this shows that the empty  
<br />
set is included in any set. In particular we have that ∅ ⊆ ∅.
<br />
Note that all set is a subset of itself. Trivially, all elements of A  
<br />
is an element of A.
<br />
<br />Exercise 6
<br />
We will say that a set A is a subset of a set B, if A is included in B.
<br />
Could you give all the subsets of the set  {1, 2}.
<br />
Could you give all the subsets of the set  {1}
<br />
Could you give all the subsets of the set  { }.
<br />
<br />The post is long enough, so I spare you the seventh exercise. Also I  
<br />
have to go, I hope there are not to many typo errors and spelling  
<br />
mistakes, and well, I pray for the special symbols going trough. It is  
<br />
possible that they go through for most mailing systems, but not all.  
<br />
Let me know.
<br />
<br />Bon courage,
<br />
