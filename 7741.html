AP: Any two deterministic, reversible automata with state space of the same
<br />
cardinality are isomorphic, no?
<br />
<br />BH: If so, wouldn't that involve an isomorphism whose information content is
<br />
potentially the same size as the state space itself?
<br />
<br />AP: I am not sure how the information content of the isomorphism matters
<br />
here.  Surely it's a question of degree.  In some cases, there will be very
<br />
little content.  In others, a lot.  I do not think one can draw a line
<br />
between &quot;most trivial&quot; and &quot;less trivial&quot;.  
<br />
<br />Making comparisons doesn't require drawing lines, it only requires a
<br />
comparison operator. For the purpose of the induction problem, we only care
<br />
whether the fact of isomorphisms would undermine our conclusions drawn about
<br />
the relative frequencies of two kinds of worlds -- those with noticed
<br />
irregularities, and those without. I don't see how it would.
<br />
<br />BH: the straightforward bitstring encoding of an automaton stands as a
<br />
first-class instance of a world, and cannot be waved away as just one of the
<br />
many ways that the &quot;concrete&quot; world in question can be described.
<br />
<br />AP: Very well, but if it is not up to isomorphism, then we get a lot of
<br />
contingent and utterly inscrutable facts, such as what encoding was used for
<br />
the bitstrings.  Reality becomes complex in uninteresting ways.
<br />
<br />I would make the same guess for alternative encoding methods as for
<br />
isomorphisms: that they don't undermine our frequency calculations above. At
<br />
any rate, the problem of uninteresting complexity probably applies to any
<br />
notion of modal realism.  If the only criterion for being a world is that it
<br />
is a causal closure without internal contradiction, then there will be lots
<br />
of uninteresting ways for worlds to differ from other, and lots of worlds
<br />
that are hard to decide if they are interestingly different.
<br />
<br />BH: I noted earlier that my perspective &quot;depends on the thesis that
<br />
physicalism is right and that qualia and consciousness are epiphenomena&quot;.
<br />
<br />AP: You need a stronger claim.  Physicalism is compatible, e.g., with the
<br />
idea that no simulation can be conscious, because it might turn out that
<br />
consciousness is an epiphenomenon of some but not other physical processes.
<br />
It is logically compatible with physicalism and epiphenomenalism, though
<br />
intuitively absurd, that no anti-matter-based beings could be conscious.  It
<br />
is less absurd to suppose that no simulated beings could be conscious.
<br />
<br />That depends on what you mean by simulation. In this context, a simulation
<br />
can be just the infinite collection of facts that together say all that can
<br />
be said of a world, including e.g. all the facts about my mental state(s) as
<br />
I write this sentence. My speculation is that the phenomenological
<br />
experience associated with those facts is the same regardless of whether the
<br />
world in question is &quot;real&quot; as scored by people who distinguish worlds as
<br />
&quot;real&quot; or not in some non-indexical way. (For my part, I don't see how we
<br />
can know that we have such a way.) But yes, I wouldn't dispute that my
<br />
perspective requires claiming e.g. the systems reply to Searle's Chinese
<br />
Room argument.
<br />
<br />BH:  irregularity doesn't undermine induction if the irregularity is
<br />
unnoticed.
<br />
<br />AP: It depends on how ambitious the inductive claims are.  If you merely
<br />
want to get the claim that you will not SEE any irregularity, maybe.
<br />
<br />Right, the claim here is about irregularity that is either undetectable or
<br />
undetected (or perhaps even so tenuously detected that it's reasonable to
<br />
doubt the detection).
<br />
<br />AP: But normally in science we want to know that the things we infer are
<br />
really so, and not merely appear so.
<br />
<br />If the undetectedness and indefectibility of the irregularities can be
<br />
statistically guaranteed to the same extent as the sorts of guarantees we
<br />
get in thermodynamics and quantum mechanics, then that's scientific enough
<br />
for me. :-)
