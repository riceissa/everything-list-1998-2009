A bit of an end-of-year ramble. For the multi-lingual, illogically- 
<br />
minded, lateral thinkers:

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; new research has shown that reading the mind is literally possible.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can now assemble an image seen via an optical system transmitted only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; via the electrical impulses read in a brain system (NewScientist last
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ed.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Perhaps it is not too far from here to the thought that you and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; might &quot;swap instantiations&quot; for a short time? Maybe it would be fun  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; think, walk, talk and act like Bruno Marchal, if only for 5 minutes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In fact, I would pay a princely sum to have that experience. In an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; age
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; when some people will spend gazillions on a &quot;space tourist&quot; (virtual)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reality experience, I would go for the &quot;Be Bruno for Five Minutes&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; option long before I would want to see the globe from orbit....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kim, if you really insist you can borrow my mind and body, and all  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my hypostases actually, for as long as you want.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just follow the following tips to prevent complications:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - always: eat bread or rice and drink water (that's my body, really.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I need it to say &quot;hello&quot;).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Love bread - having lived and worked in France for 3 years - love  
<br />
rice; my partner is Japanese and she has all of that wonderful  
<br />
imagination for rice cooking the Japanese have - drink water  
<br />
constantly in coffee, tea, beer, wine, gin, whisky, vodka, sake,  
<br />
shōchū - you name it
<br />
<br />I also drink plenty of H2O neat as well - I am not of the mindset of  
<br />
W.C. Fields who famously said &quot;I never drink water. Fish fuck in it&quot; -  
<br />
although the taste of chlorine in the Sydney water supply adds little  
<br />
to the experience I must say...
<br />
<br />I wonder whether Boltzmann Brains need anything to keep them going?  
<br />
Have never read anything about the &quot;energy needs&quot; of Boltzmann Brains...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; - in the morning: drink as much coffee or tea up until you remember  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your 1 times table multiplication. It is enough.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Yes, I am a caffeine lover too and do precisely this. Doesn't appear  
<br />
to help with mathematical understanding though. Merely allows me to  
<br />
feel real enough to confront &quot;the world&quot;. Nobody should even dare to  
<br />
say &quot;hello&quot; to me before I have raised the caffeine levels to where  
<br />
they must be.
<br />
<br />Hmmmmmm - might need something more artificial here, like a surgically- 
<br />
embedded nano-chip with Newton's &quot;Principia&quot; imprinted in it or at the  
<br />
very least &quot;Mathematics for Dummies&quot;. Your response to this thought in  
<br />
the &quot;Kim 2.1&quot; thread was:
<br />
<br />&quot;The pleasure is in the (long) path (I'm afraid). Note that a math  
<br />
book, a course or a conversation is already a good approximation of  
<br />
this.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Bien sûr - It was, after all, moi who was saying recently that we all  
<br />
need to learn Chinese or Medieval Mongolian in our dotage to keep our  
<br />
brains healthy! I agree - it's the journey (of learning) that is more  
<br />
important than the arrival. Where do we arrive at, anyway? I imagine  
<br />
you would probably expect to continue to learn new things about  
<br />
numbers until you expire, so there is *no* arrival, no endpoint to  
<br />
learning.  Nevertheless, the monsters of time and entropy are starting  
<br />
to bear down on me and my brain cells at age 51 (the digi-brain you  
<br />
supplied unfortunately needs to be replaced every three years or at  
<br />
the very least requires an exorbitantly costly hardware upgrade. In  
<br />
this respect, wet, messy biological brains are still the better option  
<br />
for the foreseeable future if you can only be satisfied with their  
<br />
puny processing power).
<br />
<br />Although a devotee of &quot;life-long learning&quot; I need to optimise my  
<br />
efforts toward practical ends as death approaches and processing power  
<br />
wanes. Is not the long path the path for the young learner? Even COMP/ 
<br />
MEC plus quantum immortality doesn't help here; there appears to be no  
<br />
carry-over of knowledge between instantiations. If I die of natural  
<br />
causes, I have to start the learning all over again in my neophite  
<br />
self. If I go to Gaza and get a bullet in my head during a firefight I  
<br />
will default to a parallel self or instantiation elsewhere in the MV,  
<br />
but, once again - there is no carry-over.
<br />
<br />Also, by the time I have mastered récherché math by age 81, the  
<br />
technology of instantaneous learning will almost certainly have  
<br />
arrived by then which means I could have devoted the intervening time  
<br />
to something just as pleasurable but maybe considerably less  
<br />
difficult. You seem to be suggesting that particular something next:
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; - in the evening: smoke as much Cannabis up until you forget your 1  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times table multiplication. It is needed for re-creation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Have been doing precisely this for at least the last 20 years. I would  
<br />
welcome any interesting digression from posters on the topic of  
<br />
&quot;Cannabis and the Multiverse&quot;. Cannabis does definitely help in  
<br />
forgetting things, so I am very aware of its re-creational power. What  
<br />
amazes me is why the opponents of cannabis are so fearful of losing  
<br />
their memories? Occasionally we need to lose information in order to  
<br />
rediscover it in a different light, surely? In fact, it's not like in  
<br />
Alzheimer's or degenerative brain disease where parts of the brain die  
<br />
- with &quot;le shit&quot; there is a simple chemical veil that is drawn across  
<br />
the (short term only) memory that is twitched away when the effect of  
<br />
the drug expires.
<br />
<br />What were we talking about?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; - I would be pleased if you could continue my conversation with Mary  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (you know, God's Mother, the most gentle lady of the multiverse).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, OK - but I don't think everyone's favourite &quot;Atheist Theologian&quot;  
<br />
Richard Dawkins is going to like this!!!!!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You will have to meditate two month each day OR smoke Salvia  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Divinorum (more easy). Mary is gentle but she has her mood, so be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; careful.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Never tried Salvia but you know me - I'll try anything. You've  
<br />
obviously tried it, Doctor! Is this the only way (apart from the long- 
<br />
haul meditation) that I can get to talk to her? What has she got to be  
<br />
moody about anyway?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; - If you want to continue my conversation with the Kanabo Gods,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ancient Japanese club-wielding demons????? SHIT NO!!!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and deepen the Bahanarotu,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ancient Venezuelan shamanistic ritual. Less scary, could be interested  
<br />
there
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; take Nicotiana Tabaccum. The secret of Tabaccum (or tabacum)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consists in NOT smoking it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes, not smoking THAT seems to guarantee a lack of death from lung  
<br />
cancer. Interestingly, Cannabis (or Salvia) doesn't seem to be (as)  
<br />
fraught with that danger. I charged up Himalayan mountains to 5,000  
<br />
metres last year and watched the Nicotiana Tabaccum lovers in my party  
<br />
sweat, suffer and - eventually climb on the Tibetan pack horse &quot;taxi&quot;  
<br />
to ride up to the summit.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suggest the excellent african oral tobacco &quot;Makla Ifrikia&quot;. Very  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; useful to make your enemy disappear. Be careful the Kanabo Gods are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not gentle and needs a lot of diplomacy.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I've got a statuette of one. He doesn't look very happy at all and is  
<br />
threatening me with a very dangerous-looking weapon
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Be super-cautious with Kava Kava,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Have to go to Fiji to get that - might save it for a holiday cruise- 
<br />
ship experience.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ayahuasca,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Will never touch DMT!! Scary stuff....
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Alcohol
</em><br />
<br /><br />Tu rigoles, toi!!!!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Eggs,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Why is it then that if you go to hospital you get EGGS with every  
<br />
meal? (Having said that, I have never been to hospital but others who  
<br />
have report this astonishing fact)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or please keep your own liver.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ma foi, je vais bien garder ma foie! En effet, je préfère le shit à  
<br />
l'alcool, hein?? Le cannabis opère à un niveau complètement  
<br />
différent à l'alcool. Mais - tu sais bien...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; - For the leisure, try hunting the Snark, but beware everything  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beginning by the letter &quot;B&quot;, like Baker, Butcher, Belgian, Brussels,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno, Bugs and other Boojums. Never take what they propose  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literally, they lie or joke half the times.
</em><br />
<br /><br />&quot;Humour is by far the most significant activity of the human mind&quot; -  
<br />
Edward de Bono. He is right. Study him.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you follow those tips, everything will be fine until the next  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brane collision.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Chèr Bruno - je suis déjà à mi-chemin!!!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that not everything is legal in all universes, so you will have  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to move, or you will have to vote for the relevant local politicians  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and wait.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Je n'en ai rien à foutre avec les politiconnards - ils sont tous les  
<br />
toxicomanes de pouvoir - les hypocrites et les cinglés!!!
<br />
<br />We only live once - but we live forever...
<br />
<br /><br />Kim
