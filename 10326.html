...but I send it anyway .... It is a way to recall that I think the 
<br />
main point I want to convey has already be defended by many thinkers a 
<br />
long time ago.
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Hi,
<br />
<br />Interrupting a thread which was going much too technical, George asked 
<br />
me to explain the main points like if I was talking to a grandmother. I 
<br />
guess he means someone with some motivation but with no background in 
<br />
math, physics or computer science. Now this is not so much difficult, 
<br />
but I guess it will be disappointing for those who asks a little more. 
<br />
So I will begin by a short explanation to the &quot;grandmother&quot; and I will 
<br />
finish by extending the grandmother to ...well, hopefully you all :), 
<br />
and that will be a roadmap, that is not only a summary, but a plan for 
<br />
progressing (in my work and in our discussion).
<br />
<br /><br />Now if the grandmother knows about Aristotle and Plato, I can sum up by 
<br />
saying that about the nature of matter, we can show that if we assume 
<br />
that we are (numerical, digital) machine then Plato's theory of Matter 
<br />
is correct and Aristotle's theory of Matter is incorrect.
<br />
<br />If grandmother asks for recalling the main difference between Plato and 
<br />
Aristotle's theories of matter, I would just say that in Plato, the 
<br />
visible (observable, measurable) realm is taken as appearances or 
<br />
shadows related to a deeper unknown reality. Aristotle's theory is more 
<br />
subtle. Matter corresponds to what can take any shape, and as such is 
<br />
defined by its indeterminateness. This is an impressive progress, but 
<br />
alas, Aristotle will reify that indeterminateness, and will suppose the 
<br />
independent existence of a substrate (defined as something entirely 
<br />
determinable by its parts when we act upon it), and in that manner will 
<br />
be at the origin of naturalism, physicalism, materialism, and we know 
<br />
the success this idea will have.
<br />
<br />And now if Grandmother is interested, probably I would offer her an 
<br />
exemplar of Plotinus Enneads, and suggest she read the Ennead 3 
<br />
treatise II, where he corrected Aristotle theory's of matter 
<br />
(indeterminateness, obscurity, privation, ...) with respect to the 
<br />
Plato theory. And that's it.
<br />
<br />&quot;And what about the formidable success of modern physics?&quot; asks the 
<br />
grandmother.
<br />
No doubt that as a methodology, Aristotle hypothesis has been a clever 
<br />
simplification which has without doubt played a key role in the 
<br />
development of &quot;modern&quot; science. But if you look in the details, modern 
<br />
physics does not even rely on Aristotle's reification of matter, it 
<br />
just ease the mind for the ontological background.  Now, when you do 
<br />
that reification, even just in &quot;modern physics&quot; you will suffer many 
<br />
form of &quot;hallucinations&quot;, like wave packet collapsing at infinite speed 
<br />
or like proliferation of &quot;classical physical worlds&quot; (some &quot;naïve&quot; view 
<br />
on the many worlds), etc.
<br />
<br />But what if grandmother does not care about history, and would like a 
<br />
sketch of the &quot;modern&quot; reasoning? OK that's for tomorrow ...
<br />
<br />Bruno
