used cannabis as a very efficacious harm reduction technic in that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmmmmm - might need something more artificial here, like a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surgically-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; embedded nano-chip with Newton's &quot;Principia&quot; imprinted in it or at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very least &quot;Mathematics for Dummies&quot;. Your response to this thought in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;Kim 2.1&quot; thread was:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The pleasure is in the (long) path (I'm afraid). Note that a math
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; book, a course or a conversation is already a good approximation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bien sûr - It was, after all, moi who was saying recently that we all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need to learn Chinese or Medieval Mongolian in our dotage to keep our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brains healthy! I agree - it's the journey (of learning) that is more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important than the arrival. Where do we arrive at, anyway? I imagine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you would probably expect to continue to learn new things about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers until you expire, so there is *no* arrival, no endpoint to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learning.  Nevertheless, the monsters of time and entropy are starting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to bear down on me and my brain cells at age 51 (the digi-brain you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supplied unfortunately needs to be replaced every three years or at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the very least requires an exorbitantly costly hardware upgrade. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this respect, wet, messy biological brains are still the better option
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the foreseeable future if you can only be satisfied with their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; puny processing power).
</em><br />
<br /><br />The pleasure is in the walk, but perhaps even more in the pause, when  
<br />
looking at the panorama.
<br />
Like the pleasure in research is given by the pause coffee :)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Although a devotee of &quot;life-long learning&quot; I need to optimise my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; efforts toward practical ends as death approaches and processing power
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wanes. Is not the long path the path for the young learner? Even COMP/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MEC plus quantum immortality doesn't help here; there appears to be no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carry-over of knowledge between instantiations.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Well a priori there is. Which a priori is rather unpleasant,  
<br />
especially in &quot;bad&quot; form of death, like violent accident, or  
<br />
Alzheimer. Fortunately, looking at the (more technical alas) details,  
<br />
things are ... far more complex.
<br />
When you arrive at the panorama, you have the time to wonder how big  
<br />
the mountain is. Science points on a mountain which appears bigger and  
<br />
bigger as we climb on it. Assuming comp this is necessary. (As you  
<br />
will perhaps see one day).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I die of natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causes, I have to start the learning all over again in my neophite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self. If I go to Gaza and get a bullet in my head during a firefight I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will default to a parallel self or instantiation elsewhere in the MV,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but, once again - there is no carry-over.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, by the time I have mastered récherché math by age 81, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technology of instantaneous learning will almost certainly have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arrived by then which means I could have devoted the intervening time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to something just as pleasurable but maybe considerably less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficult. You seem to be suggesting that particular something next:
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well I am not offering you a technology for doing new things, I am  
<br />
offering you a tool for understanding that we have not yet solve the  
<br />
mind-body problem and that we are really ignorant, and that, in a  
<br />
sense, science has not yet begin, if only due to that Aristotelian  
<br />
tendency to put the mind under the rug. We (humans) still avoid the  
<br />
main data, probably by fear of the unknown.
<br />
The UDA is already a terrible shortcut, you will not have to wait the  
<br />
age of 86 for understanding how possible truth can be ... well,  
<br />
perhaps just disappointing?
<br />
<br />The time when we will share our experience directly by brain  
<br />
manipulation will come, but it is really the continuation of  
<br />
conversation, book reading, and software downloadings and uploadings.
<br />
<br />You want to know more, but I want you to know less. To abandon  
<br />
knowledge so that you can recall the universal machine in you, the  
<br />
universal machine you are, which is more like a baby god, full of  
<br />
potentiality and empty of prejudices.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - in the evening: smoke as much Cannabis up until you forget your 1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; times table multiplication. It is needed for re-creation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have been doing precisely this for at least the last 20 years. I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; welcome any interesting digression from posters on the topic of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Cannabis and the Multiverse&quot;. Cannabis does definitely help in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forgetting things, so I am very aware of its re-creational power.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Without cannabis I would be a drunk man loss in complaints concerning  
<br />
the event I talked to you some post ago. Cannabis saved my life almost  
<br />
literally, and i don't regret that, even if that was a mean to live a  
<br />
remake of those events 20 years later.
<br />
At some point a long time ago, logic, for me, was synonymous with  
<br />
nausea. cannabis has helped to abstract away the bad connotations and  
<br />
to cure the nausea.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amazes me is why the opponents of cannabis are so fearful of losing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their memories?
</em><br />
<br />In algebra and category theory there is the famous forgetful functor  
<br />
which can be used to explain how losing memories plays a fundamental  
<br />
role in the functioning of the creative mind.
<br />
The process of &quot;Abstraction&quot; itself is related to a forgetting of  
<br />
information. Both in the intuitive sense and in many technical sense  
<br />
(like in lambda calculus where everything is build from abstraction  
<br />
and &quot;concretization&quot;).
<br />
People who are clever in finding solution of problems are usually  
<br />
gifted in abstracting from the non relevant information. It is an art.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Occasionally we need to lose information in order to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rediscover it in a different light, surely?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact, it's not like in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Alzheimer's or degenerative brain disease where parts of the brain die
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - with &quot;le shit&quot; there is a simple chemical veil that is drawn across
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the (short term only) memory that is twitched away when the effect of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the drug expires.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Alzheimer seems to be a lottery. Depending on the path of the brain  
<br />
dissolution, the first person experience can be paradisiac or hellish.
<br />
It is something which can be very hard for those who live and care in  
<br />
the neighborhood.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What were we talking about?
</em><br />
<br />Hmmm.... You are either smoking or joking or both ... Perhaps we are  
<br />
talking about natural computationalism (and memory loss). The use of  
<br />
plants to act on the brain. Could be a necessary path toward the  
<br />
computationalist practice.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - I would be pleased if you could continue my conversation with Mary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (you know, God's Mother, the most gentle lady of the multiverse).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, OK - but I don't think everyone's favourite &quot;Atheist Theologian&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Richard Dawkins is going to like this!!!!!
</em><br />
<br /><br />You could be astonished, but after having participated on thread on  
<br />
atheism in salvia divinorum forum, I could conclude that Richard  
<br />
Dawkins could indeed not like it, or be obliged to change its main  
<br />
vocabulary interpretation.
<br />
<br />Cannabis is an euphoric product acting, like you said, on short term  
<br />
memory. It is fun and it explains it recreational success.
<br />
Salvia is a dysphoric product capable on high concentration to act on  
<br />
your *whole* memory and identity. You get complete total amnesia, you  
<br />
begin to go out of space and time, feeling your previous life as a  
<br />
dream, and then you forget that dream, up to forgetting what space and  
<br />
time could even be. Some people can live this as the most blissful and  
<br />
completed experience in their life (completed means they feel no need  
<br />
to do the experience again, once is enough). Other people lives the  
<br />
experience as the most terrifying experience of their whole life.  
<br />
Dysphoric is the opposite of euphoric: it is never a pleasant  
<br />
experience. It is not fun. Yet it is considerably interesting for  
<br />
those who have the taste in theology (say).
<br />
<br />The interesting thing is that, notably, you realize that you can be  
<br />
conscious without any memory. Most of the time the experience can be  
<br />
felt as a big &quot;déjà vu&quot;: not only you forget the meaning of &quot;to be&quot;,  
<br />
but you feel this as if it was your familiar &quot;home&quot;. Like a coming  
<br />
back that you have already done an infinity of times. It is  
<br />
paradoxical and hard to describe. You get also some information  
<br />
&quot;there&quot;, but you forget them as you come back. It is quick: the voyage  
<br />
last for 2 to 6 minutes (based on all experiences I have done, and on  
<br />
the people which I have been a sitter°).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You will have to meditate two month each day OR smoke Salvia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Divinorum (more easy). Mary is gentle but she has her mood, so be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; careful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Never tried Salvia but you know me - I'll try anything. You've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obviously tried it, Doctor! Is this the only way (apart from the long-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; haul meditation) that I can get to talk to her? What has she got to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moody about anyway?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Although very poorly known in Europa, and only known by young people  
<br />
in America and Australia, the plant is very well documented on the  
<br />
net, through 5000 youtube videos, and many written reports (Salvianet,  
<br />
Sagewisdom, Erowid).
<br />
If you decide to try it, I suggest you consult and study the plant  
<br />
through those sites before.  I have read many reports and look at many  
<br />
videos before testing it, which I have done plenty of times in last  
<br />
June, July and Augustus. If you read the reports you will see how many  
<br />
times expressions like &quot;reality&quot;, &quot;realities&quot;, &quot;overlapping realities&quot;  
<br />
are mentioned, which I found intriguing.
<br />
It is a plant known and cultivated by Shaman Mexican since 700 years.  
<br />
After the Spanish Christianization of South America, the Mazatec  
<br />
called Santa Maria, some divine entity they met or invite with the use  
<br />
of the plant.
<br />
<br />The most amazing fact, reported by many users (but not all) including  
<br />
me, is the meeting, as described both by man and woman, of a &quot;female  
<br />
entity&quot;, although, I did met, and others have met, other entities.  In  
<br />
my case once the &quot;female entity&quot; appears, the other disappeared almost  
<br />
completely.
<br />
Sometimes it could be male, and sometimes neutral too. That &quot;lady&quot; is  
<br />
known or felt as being shy---- one noise in the streets and she can  
<br />
vanish away. Despite this, on another occasion she can slice you in  
<br />
million pieces and send them in dimensions apart, making you feel lost  
<br />
as you would not have been able to imagine possible before.
<br />
About what is she moody?  Well, curiously enough (or not!),  she is  
<br />
moody about your state of mind. I would say she seems to measure a  
<br />
degree of self-honesty, so that if you are OK with yourself and honest  
<br />
with her you got some &quot;teaching&quot;.
<br />
<br />It is an amazing plant. I have searched for a naturalist explanation,  
<br />
and I think she could have had a long time trouble with some insect.  
<br />
Probably she was obliged to be fertilized by its predator, so as to  
<br />
generate an insecticide (like many plants) but one depending on the  
<br />
&quot;intention&quot; of the insect (that is to fertilize the plant or to eat  
<br />
the plant). This is a speculation I provide for illustrating that a  
<br />
naturalist explanation of subtle psychoactive product could exist, and  
<br />
here I tried to describe experiences, not an interpretation. Freudian  
<br />
interpretation could possibly throw light on some features,  
<br />
neurochemistry can certainly helps a lot, and indeed the main action  
<br />
of the main psycho-active molecules (salvinorin A) have been well  
<br />
studied. A confirmation of the speculation above is that the plant  
<br />
blossoms very rarely, and when it does, the seeds are poorly numbered  
<br />
and mostly inefficient. She reproduces herself mostly asexually by  
<br />
natural cuticles. Eventually the predator-fertilizer was send away  
<br />
apparently.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - If you want to continue my conversation with the Kanabo Gods,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ancient Japanese club-wielding demons????? SHIT NO!!!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah! Actually I am talking about the way shamanic extase is obtained  
<br />
through the use of a tobacco by the Warao Indian of Venezuela.
<br />
<br />Of course, psycho-active substance, like cafeine and nicotine and  
<br />
entheogen in general, acts differently from one individual to another,  
<br />
and generally depends also a lot of the way you consume it.
<br />
<br />All the South-Americans shaman consider tobacco as a powerful  
<br />
medicinal plant, but the Warao consider it as the most powerful  
<br />
hallucinogenic plant. Now, to consume it, they feast (= does not eat)  
<br />
for many days, and then they dance and smoke days and nights very long  
<br />
tobacco cigare, and that is how they invoke the Kanabo Gods.
<br />
<br />And you may as well say ... SHIT NO!!! because those are unpleasant  
<br />
gods you can invoke when you have to kill your enemy.
<br />
<br />I have stopped smoking tobacco one year ago, and I consume the snus  
<br />
makla ifrikia instead. The benefits for the lungs was big and quick,  
<br />
and I discovered salvia divinorum by searching for an &quot;oral cannabis&quot;.  
<br />
In this respect that was a failure, you can consume salvia orally but  
<br />
you need to take a lot, and the trip lasts far longer, and is more  
<br />
mild (which could be nice but is more expensive).
<br />
But the fact is that salvia has nothing to do with cannabis. The  
<br />
experience are not even comparable. If you take both you have the  
<br />
frustrating feeling that although they augment their respective  
<br />
intensities, they contradicts on the quality and the purpose. Cannabis  
<br />
push you to do what you like (listening to music, videos, doing math,  
<br />
walking, dancing, actually doing something), Salvia asks for your  
<br />
complete attention, in the dark, and in silence. Cannabis makes you  
<br />
think and act, Salvia makes you disappear and reappear.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and deepen the Bahanarotu,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ancient Venezuelan shamanistic ritual. Less scary, could be interested
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there
</em><br />
<br />Yes, the Bahanarotu is the ritual above.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; take Nicotiana Tabaccum. The secret of Tabaccum (or tabacum)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consists in NOT smoking it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, not smoking THAT seems to guarantee a lack of death from lung
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cancer.
</em><br />
<br />Evidences exists that not smoking that diminishes the probability of  
<br />
many other cancers too, including mouth cancer, but it diminishes also  
<br />
cardiac accident, which seems to be due mainly to the combination of  
<br />
nicotine and carbon monoxide.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Interestingly, Cannabis (or Salvia) doesn't seem to be (as)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fraught with that danger.
</em><br />
<br />Most papers I read go in that direction.
<br />
The negative papers on oral tobacco, cannabis and salvia divinorum  
<br />
maximize the number of occurrence of the &quot;p-&gt;q/q-&gt;p&quot; error, the  
<br />
confusion between p implies q, and q implies p.
<br />
<br />Recall me to explain this, when I will talk on logic, some day, perhaps.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I charged up Himalayan mountains to 5,000
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metres last year and watched the Nicotiana Tabaccum lovers in my party
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sweat, suffer and - eventually climb on the Tibetan pack horse &quot;taxi&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to ride up to the summit.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I can imagine.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I suggest the excellent african oral tobacco &quot;Makla Ifrikia&quot;. Very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; useful to make your enemy disappear. Be careful the Kanabo Gods are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not gentle and needs a lot of diplomacy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've got a statuette of one. He doesn't look very happy at all and is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; threatening me with a very dangerous-looking weapon
</em><br />
<br /><br />Looks like a Warao Kanabo God. Weird.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - Be super-cautious with Kava Kava,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have to go to Fiji to get that - might save it for a holiday cruise-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ship experience.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I would describe my first and last experience of it like if I drank 2  
<br />
bottles of strong Vodka followed by 5 thermos of strong italian coffee.
<br />
I was sick and super nervous.
<br />
Of course this is legal, here and almost everywhere.
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Will never touch DMT!! Scary stuff....
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't want to discourage you about salvia, but there is a ongoing  
<br />
debate among DMT and Salvia users according to which one is the most  
<br />
scary or &quot;intense&quot; experience.
<br />
<br />Most pools put Salvia as more powerful than DMT.
<br />
<br />If you decide to try it, I strongly suggest you try it incrementally.  
<br />
Just a few piece of leaves (1X), and then more (after ten minutes),  
<br />
and more again, and if you feel nothing then, try a very little piece  
<br />
of 5X , and continue up to the moment ypu feel something and you can  
<br />
continue.
<br />
Never take extracts like 5X or 10X the first time.
<br />
<br />The sensibility is person dependent but also circumstance dependent,  
<br />
and your set (and setting) matter(s) a lot.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tu rigoles, toi!!!!
</em><br />
<br /><br />And never mix salvia and alcohol. Take alcohol after! Well, you will  
<br />
learn ...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and Eggs,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why is it then that if you go to hospital you get EGGS with every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meal? (Having said that, I have never been to hospital but others who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have report this astonishing fact)
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is cheap and easy to prepare, and not bad for the health in some  
<br />
quantities, yet not to good when your liver are fragile I dunno.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or please keep your own liver.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ma foi, je vais bien garder ma foie! En effet, je préfère le shit à
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; l'alcool, hein?? Le cannabis opère à un niveau complètement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; différent à l'alcool. Mais - tu sais bien...
</em><br />
<br /><br />After salvia, my relation with cannabis is like my relation with  
<br />
alcohol after cannabis. No need.
<br />
This is a bit funny, but a secondary effect of salvia is its anti- 
<br />
addictive power. You loose your addictions, be it game, heroin,  
<br />
cannabis, coffee, tobacco, etc. I don't like that too much, and now  
<br />
consume salvia very rarely and just some quantity of 1X. No real need  
<br />
to go where you always are too often.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - For the leisure, try hunting the Snark, but beware everything

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; beginning by the letter &quot;B&quot;, like Baker, Butcher, Belgian, Brussels,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bruno, Bugs and other Boojums. Never take what they propose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; literally, they lie or joke half the times.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Humour is by far the most significant activity of the human mind&quot; -

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Edward de Bono. He is right. Study him.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I remember having read some of his books once in a trip to London. It  
<br />
is not bad, but I remember that I disagreed on something. I don't  
<br />
remember what.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to move, or you will have to vote for the relevant local politicians

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and wait.
