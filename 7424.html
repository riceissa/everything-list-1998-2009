<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'intuition is always like believing that the earth is flat.'(BM)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I disagree. People believed the earth was flat because it looked flat, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they didnt intuit this idea. Intuition is not just the absence of any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doubt about a proposition, intuition is active not passive.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well I can agree. My &quot;earth is flat&quot; was perhaps not a good example. I 
<br />
just like it because it makes the pointing toward the idea of local 
<br />
truth. Earth *is* flat locally.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For many reasons I think that is wrong. Intuition is experience in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; action, it is functioning wisdom. It is refined and precise, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; almost always right.
</em><br />
<br /><br />... always right locally. Don't take this as dismissing intuition. Of 
<br />
course I relate intution and first person knowledge and Brouwer's 
<br />
intutionism, and all this with some purpose in mind related to the main 
<br />
points discussed here. We will recur again on all this.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Im troubled by the extent to which counter intuitive ideas are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; embraced seemingly /because/ they are counter intuitive. It almost 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; becomes the case that the more counter intuitive a hypothesis is, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more we trust it. Theoretical physics is testament to that surely?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here I disagree. Surely modern physics makes many counter intuitive, 
<br />
but if you look at history you see that physicist take time to accept 
<br />
them.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is counter intuitive about the DH is that it offers no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understandable mechanism for its conclusion.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Like in classical logic. You can prove things without constructing them.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is what immediately strikes one when you read the DH for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first time, there is an air of supernatural about it. How can the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventual population of the universe - however reference classes are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined - ever have a  backwardly causal relationship with a cataclysm 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; today?
</em><br />
<br /><br />But that was not the goal. Accepting the premisses and the 
<br />
reasoning-ways you get the conclusions, even if you don't see the 
<br />
&quot;causal&quot; links.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Furthermore, im sure that your expressed belief in the truth of the DH 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesnt /actually/ interfere with your day to day routine.
</em><br />
<br /><br />As I said I find the DH correct, I just don't buy its hypotheses (nor 
<br />
to be sure the idea of absolute self-sampling among humans, why not 
<br />
bacteria).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You argue with folk like me, rather than build bunkers in preparation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the apocalypse. Why?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here I totally differ from &quot;Leslie&quot;. Would I bought the DH (reasoning + 
<br />
premisses), I would definitely not build a bunker. The &quot;beauty&quot; of the 
<br />
DH argument, is that, as you told yourself, he does not refer to 
<br />
&quot;causality&quot; or &quot;concrete reasons&quot;, so that if DH is correct there is 
<br />
absolutely no point in trying to build a bunker to prevent it. If the 
<br />
humans solve all &quot;human problems and prevent all risk of apocalypse, or 
<br />
build bunker for all citizens&quot; then the DH entails we will all die for 
<br />
an unknown reason. But as I said the DH premisses do not make sense for 
<br />
me.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is quite obvious from the ease with which counter intuitive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusions can be derived from baysean reasoning in conjunction with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1rst person perspectives generally.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. In particular Leslie error (imo) is to mix 1 and 3 person 
<br />
reasoning in a non genuine way.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway Im arguing more than I wanted to about all this. I ought to go 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and download one of your papers.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If you read the SANE paper I would like to know if you follow the UDA 
<br />
(the Universal Dovetailer Argument) which shows that IF the comp 
<br />
hypothesis is true THEN physics is (in a constructive sense) a branch 
<br />
of computer science. Take it easy and don't hesitate to make comments 
<br />
for any step of the reasoning. Some on this list agrees physicality 
<br />
could be secondary and could or should emerge from some relative or 
<br />
absolute measure on the set of &quot;Observer-Moments&quot;. We disagree on what 
<br />
are exactly those OMs, or about the way to analyze the &quot;measure&quot;, etc.
<br />
As you see we dig deep: the primitive nature of nature is really where 
<br />
Aristotle opposed himself against Plato, and since 2300 years most 
<br />
follows Aristotle.
<br />
