</em><br />
<br />1) Well, this obviously depends on the subject of the seeming. To me,
<br />
'red', 'middle C', or 'bitter' all *do* seem to possess a sort of
<br />
directly sensed 'vibrational' quality that is essential, for example,
<br />
to why I would feel they were 'like' or 'unlike' other colours, sounds,
<br />
or tastes, or where they would *subjectively* lie in 'spectra'
<br />
analogous (but not identical) to those of 'physical' properties.
<br />
<br />2) They are by definition incommunicable in mathematical or any other
<br />
language, but this does not in my *experience* equate to their being
<br />
'structureless' in *feel*. If I attempt to imagine what the 'bare
<br />
substrate' would *feel* like, I am frankly at a loss because it *seems*
<br />
to be devoid of content - what would there be to be 'felt'? But beyond
<br />
the substrate we have the equally fundamental IMO notion of
<br />
differentiation (a neutral term I'm using because it isn't committed to
<br />
a purely 'physical' view) and it seems to me that the intersection of
<br />
substrate and differentiation could well *be* the direct experience of
<br />
content. I also call such content 'structure' because it is
<br />
differentiated but if you'd rather reserve this for the relational
<br />
idea, so be it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Correlation is not identity.
</em><br />
<br />Precisely. But the correlation of qualia with structurally
<br />
differentiated 'physical' phenomena leads to the intuition that qualia
<br />
themselves may be an *experiential synthesis* based on structural
<br />
differentiation of the same bare ('property-less' in your own terms)
<br />
substrate. The substrate, as you say elsewhere, provides enduring
<br />
existence within which the properties manifest and change. I'm
<br />
suggesting that the *existence* of the differentiated substrate
<br />
*synthesises* the qualia (i.e. they entail multiple differentiations)
<br />
and the mutual *relations* of the differentiated substrate *are* the
<br />
'properties'.
<br />
<br />BTW, when I meditate on a substrate whose differentiation resolves into
<br />
'me' 'you' and other persons, I tend to 'take it personally'.  The
<br />
'impersonal' gaps between persons are IMO no different in kind than the
<br />
gaps between my own experiences at different times, places, branches of
<br />
MW, etc. The substrate is in these terms a single 'potential
<br />
experiencer'. The actual experiences it possesses are then a function
<br />
of an infinite network of differentiation. I've said something
<br />
elsewhere about the implications of this for the perception of time
<br />
both as discrete, rather than totalised, experiences, and as a
<br />
'dynamic' quale, mediated by discrete 'capsules' of locally-delimited
<br />
information.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mutual relations are not internal relations. Purple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lies between red and blue, but being told that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doens't tell you what purple looks like unless you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already know what red and blue look like. Realtional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information about colours does not convey the colours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves.
</em><br />
<br />Nothing can 'tell you what purple looks like'. Purple is a medium that
<br />
carries information, not information itself. However, the *feel* of
<br />
purple may seem related to the *feel* of blue. Isn't this ultimately a
<br />
matter for each 'seemer' to meditate on?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If that were the case, there would be no HP, and threfore no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need for any first-personness worth arguing about.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think that the HP is a useful idea. I think there is existence
<br />
and this is something I 'take personally' because it *seems* to
<br />
manifest as me, and other mes, all of whom I find it intuitive to
<br />
conceive as subsets of a much Vaster me, with 'conscious regions' (e.g.
<br />
'me yesterday', 'me on the branch where I didn't have that last beer',
<br />
'Peter five minutes ago') and 'unconscious regions' (e.g. 'me after
<br />
that last beer', interstellar space, a rock). The EP is the observable
<br />
behaviour (information content) of all this, insofar as we have access
<br />
to and can make sense of it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is still pure Chalmers -- natural supervenience is not identity,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after all.
</em><br />
<br />Well, if 'experience' is the fact of *being* differentiable existence,
<br />
and 'the physical' is the observable relations thereof, then both
<br />
ultimately 'supervene' on there being something rather than nothing.
<br />
Further correlation is IMO an empirical issue from which might stem a
<br />
more robust theoretical model embracing both. If this is the substance
<br />
of Chalmers' claim then I suppose I would go along with it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How - by relational modulation of the 0-personal substrate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you modulate a bunch of relations , you get another bunch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of relations. That is no departure from reductive physicalism.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but that's not what I meant. You experience as the fact of *being*
<br />
the 'modulated' (differentiated) substrate, not *observing* it (i.e. as
<br />
information). You do of course observe it, but that then is 2nd-order,
<br />
the relational level of information, not the substrate level of
<br />
existence. This is why I insist that differentiation is as 'primitive'
<br />
as the substrate, in the sense that there is nothing in the notion of
<br />
'substrate' as a semantic container for 'bare enduring existence' that
<br />
would lead you to suppose that it was differentiable. There's no
<br />
reducible 'process of differentiation' at this semantic level, but
<br />
rather having introduced the notion of difference, you can then
<br />
synthesise this into whatever sort of differentiation/ structure/
<br />
relation/ content you need for your theoretical ends.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you are going to continue being unable to specify what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal about your primordial 1st peson, then that would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be better, yes.
</em><br />
<br />I don't really want to go back into the word dispute, but as I've
<br />
implied above, this may just be an aspect of explanatory style. Of
<br />
course I never meant to claim that the substrate is a 'person' as
<br />
conventionally conceived, but as I say, I can't help 'taking
<br />
personally' the existent thing from which I and all persons are
<br />
emanating. I think, imaginatvely, that if one pictures a 'block
<br />
universe', Platonia, MW, or any non-process conception of reality, this
<br />
is more intuitive, because everything is 'just there' - superposed, as
<br />
it were. So, sure there's a 'layer' at which the individual 1st-person
<br />
'emerges', but it's taking everything else 'working together' to
<br />
manifest it. So in this sense, for me, it's all 'personal'. But maybe
<br />
not for you.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It all depends on what you mean by physical. For me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what physicalism means beyond materialism is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all properties are quantitiative and relational. A consequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that there is no layering of any significant kind.
</em><br />
<br />You're on to something here, I think. Of course you're right that the
<br />
physical description renders the other 'chemical', 'biological' etc.
<br />
schemas redundant. However, this is clearly not the case
<br />
experientially, and this seems a very fundamental distinction. 'Form'
<br />
for example exists experientially where it is a redundant concept
<br />
physically (though not Platonically). So there is something that is
<br />
producing a 'layering' that is shaping what we experience and in what
<br />
way. I've already suggested that experience is the fact of *being* the
<br />
structured substrate, and when we start to conceive the structure in
<br />
terms of behaviour (i.e. treat it dynamically) what emerges may well
<br />
display the characteristics of a  perceiver+perceptual model system.
<br />
These characteristics would include the 'forms' of its perceptions and
<br />
the modalities of their qualia, including the 'dynamic' quale of
<br />
temporal experience. This would yield a relational treatment of
<br />
experience which would could be correlated to whatever degree with a
<br />
physical description. The results of this would be an empirical test of
<br />
conjectured 'supervenience' relations.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; It is not clear why they should be that fact. For one thing,

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't see why you're resistant to the idea that qualia could have a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; structural aspect.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) the don't seem to have, and they *are* what they seem

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; For one thing, they seem to be systematically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; correlated with physical phenomena (light, sound) which are structural/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relational.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Correlation is not identity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  Also, they seem experientially (at least to me) to display
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mutual distributive relations that are analogous to, say, the frequency
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distribution of the colour spectrum.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mutual relations are not internal relations. Purple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lies between red and blue, but being told that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information about colours does not convey the colours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  So I don't see the suggestion that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; different qualia are different structural modulations of a substrate as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; so counter-intuitive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If that were the case, there would be no HP, and threfore no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need for any first-personness worth arguing about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As to HP 'riding on the back of' EP, I'd rather put it that they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; correlated, but probably don't map in a simple, one-to-one, 'identity'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is still pure Chalmers -- natural supervenience is not identity,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  If this is simply 'neutral monism', so be it. Insofar that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have been disagreeing over terminology, this is entirely fruitless, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we should try not to dispute any more over words. Perhaps I could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; replace the form of words 'global 1st person primitivity' with 'global
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; neutral (0-person if you like) primitivity', as long as this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; understood to be the backgound from which 1st-persons, under suitable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conditions, emerge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you are going to continue being unable to specify what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal about your primordial 1st peson, then that would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be better, yes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; AFAIC that amounts to saying they supervene on the physical --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; on the 0-personal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No, that's going too far, IMO. I'd rather have them both mapping onto a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; neutral substrate that is basic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AFAICS, that *is* supervening. What do you think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervening is ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  As I concede above, we could call this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 0-personal, but this is surely not baldly equivalent to 'physical'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Just as we schematise the physical into chemical, biological,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physiological levels etc, there may be analogous but different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'experiential layering' supporting the emergence of the conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; modalities we in fact encounter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If they are not all just structure, there must be, yes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The claim of physicalism (as opposed to materialism, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neutral monism) is that everything is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structured matter, and that all the layers reduce to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different types of structure yield different types of qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; How and why ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How - by relational modulation of the 0-personal substrate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you modulate a bunch of relations , you get another bunch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of relations. That is no departure from reductive physicalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Why -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; because of the infinite (or at least Vast) possibilities of modalities,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; range, etc. inherent in this, on the analogy of the physical/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relational correlates (light, sound, taste, etc).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; That would be equally true of a 0-personal substance, ie matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But a 'neutral (0-personal?) substrate' is not a rigidly 'physical'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one, if that's what you intend by 'matter'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It all depends on what you mean by physical. For me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what physicalism means beyond materialism is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all properties are quantitiative and relational. A consequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that there is no layering of any significant kind.
