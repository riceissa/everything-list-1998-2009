<br />
And yet I persist ... [the hiatus of familial duties and seasonal 
<br />
excesses now draws to a close [Oh yeah, Happy New Year Folks!]
<br />
<br />SP: 'If we are talking about a system designed to destroy the economy of 
<br />
a country in order to soften it up for invasion, for example, then an 
<br />
economist can apply all his skill and knowledge in a perfectly 
<br />
reasonable manner in order to achieve this.'
<br />
<br />We should beware of conceding too much too soon. Something is reasonable 
<br />
only if it can truly be expected to fulfil the intentions of its 
<br />
designer. Otherwise it is at best logical but, in the kinds of context 
<br />
we are alluding to here, benighted and a manifestation of fundamentally 
<br />
diminished 'reason'. Something can only be 'reasonable' it its context. 
<br />
If a proposed course of action can be shown to be ultimately self 
<br />
defeating - in the sense of including its reasonably predictably final 
<br />
consequences, and yet it is still actively proposed, then the proposal 
<br />
is NOT reasonable, it is stupid. As far as I can see, that is the 
<br />
closest we can get to an objective definition of stupidity and I like it.
<br />
<br />Put it this way: Is it 'reasonable' to promote policies and projects 
<br />
that ultimately are going to contribute to your own demise or the demise 
<br />
of those whom you hold dear or, if not obviously their demise then, the 
<br />
ultimate demise of all descendants of the aforementioned? I think 
<br />
academics, 'mandarins' and other high honchos should all now be thinking 
<br />
in these terms and asking themselves this question. The world we now 
<br />
live in is like no other before it. We now live in the Modern era, in 
<br />
which the application and fruits of the application of scientific method 
<br />
are putting ever greater forms of power into the hands of humans. This 
<br />
process is not going to stop, and nor should we want it to I think, but 
<br />
it entails the ever greater probability that the actions of any person 
<br />
on the planet have the potential to influence survival outcomes for huge 
<br />
numbers of others [if not the whole d*mned lot of us].
<br />
<br />I think it has always been true that ethical decisions and judgements 
<br />
are based on facts to a greater extent than most people involved want to 
<br />
think about - usually because it's too hard and we don't think we have 
<br />
got the time and, oh yeah, 'it probably doesn't/won't matter' about the 
<br />
details of unforeseen consequences because its only gonna be lower class 
<br />
riff -raff who will be affected anyway or people of the future who will 
<br />
just have to make shift for themselves. NOW however we do not really 
<br />
have such an excuse; it is a cop-out to purport to ignore the ever 
<br />
growing interrelatedness of people around the planet. So it is NOT 
<br />
reasonable to treat other people as things. [I feel indebted to Terry 
<br />
Pratchett for pointing out, through the words of Granny Weatherwax I 
<br />
think it is, that there is only one sin, which is to treat another 
<br />
person as a thing.] I think a reasonable survey and analysis of history 
<br />
shows that, more than anything else, treating other people as things 
<br />
rather than equal others has been the fundamental cause and methodology 
<br />
for the spread of threats to life and well being.
<br />
<br />You can see where I am going with this: in a similar way to that in 
<br />
which concepts of 'game theory' and probabilities of interaction 
<br />
outcomes give us an objective framework for assessing purportedly 
<br />
'moral' precepts, the existence now of decidedly non-zero chances of 
<br />
recursive effects resulting from one's own actions brings a deeper 
<br />
meaning and increased rigour the realms of ethics and 'reason'. I don't 
<br />
think this is 'airy-fairy', I think it represents a dimension of 
<br />
reasoning which has always existed but which has been denied, ignored or 
<br />
actively censored by the powerful and their 'pragmatic' apologists and 
<br />
spin doctors. To look at a particular context [I am an EX Christian], 
<br />
even though the Bible is shonk as history or any kind of principled 
<br />
xxxxxxological analysis, it is instructive to look at the careers of the 
<br />
prophets and see how each involved a seemingly conventional formative 
<br />
period and then periods or a whole life of very risky ministry AGAINST 
<br />
the establishment because being true to their mission involved the 
<br />
prophet denouncing exploitation, greed and corruption.
<br />
<br />So let me wave my imaginary staff and rail from the top of my imaginary 
<br />
mountain:
<br />
'Sin is against reason! And that's a fact! So THERE! And don't you 
<br />
forget it, or you'll be sorry, or at least your children and their 
<br />
children will become so! Put that in your pipes all you armchair 
<br />
philosophers!'
<br />
<br />Regards

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Sorry to be so slow at responding here but life [domestic], the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe and everything else right now is competing savagely with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this interesting discussion. [But one must always think positive; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'Bah, Humbug!' is not appropriate, even though the temptation is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; great some times :-]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Stathis,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am not entirely convinced when you say: 'And the psychopath is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; right: no-one can actually fault him on a point of fact or a point of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; logic'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That would only be right if we allowed that his [psychopathy is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mostly a male affliction I believe] use of words is easily as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasonable as yours or mine. However, where the said psycho. is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; purporting to make authoritative statements about the world, it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not OK for him to purport that what he describes is unquestionably 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; factual and his reasoning from the facts as he sees them is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessarily authoritative for anyone else. This is because, qua 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; psychopath, he is not able to make the fullest possible free 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; decisions about what makes people tick or even about what is reality 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for the rest of us. He is, in a sense, mortally wounded, and forever 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; impaired; condemned always to make only 'logical' decisions. :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The way I see it, roughly and readily, is that there are in fact 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; certain statements/descriptions about the world and our place in it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which are MUCH MORE REASONABLE than a whole lot of others. I think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; therefore that, even though you might be right from a 'purely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; logical' point of view when you say the following: 'In the *final* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; analysis, ethical beliefs are not a matter of fact or logic, and if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it seems that they are then there is a hidden assumption somewhere'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in fact, from the point of view of practical living and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessities of survival, the correct approach is to assert what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; amounts to a set of practical axioms, including:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  *   the mere fact of existence is the basis of value, that good and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bad are expressed differently within - and between - different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cultures and their sub-cultures but ultimately there is an objective, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; absolute basis for the concept of 'goodness', because in all normal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; circumstances it is better to exist than not to exist,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  *   related to this and arising out of it is the realisation that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all normal, healthy humans understand what is meant by both 'harm' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and 'suffering', certainly those who have reached adulthood,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  *   furthermore, insofar as it is clearly recognisable that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; continuing to exist as a human being requires access to and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consumption of all manner of natural resources and human-made goods 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and services, it is in our interests to nurture and further the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; inclinations in ourselves and others to behave in ways supportive of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cooperation for mutual and general benefit wherever this is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasonably possible, and certainly not to act destructively or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; disruptively unless it is clear that doing so will prevent a much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; greater harm from occurring.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It ought to be clear to all reasonable persons not engaged in self 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; deception that in this modern era each and everyone of us is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dependent - always - on at least a thousand other people doing the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; right thing, or trying to anyway. Thus the idea of 'manly', rugged, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; individualism is a romantic nonsense unless it also incorporates a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; recognition of mutual interdependence and the need for real fairness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in social dealings at every level. Unless compassion, democracy and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ethics are recognised [along with scientific method] as fundamental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; prerequisites for OUR survival, policies and practices will pretty 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; much inevitably become self-defeating and destructive, no matter how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; well-intentioned to start with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In the interest of brevity I add the following quasi-axioms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  *   the advent of scientific method on Earth between 400 and 500 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; years ago has irreversibly transformed the human species so that now 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we can reasonably assert that the human universe is always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; potentially infinite, so long as it exists and we believe it to be so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  *   to be fully human requires taking responsibility for one's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; actions and this means consciously choosing to do things or accepting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that one has made a choice even if one cannot remember consciously 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; choosing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  *   nobody knows the future, so all statements about the future are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; either guesswork or statements of desires. Furthermore our lack of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; knowledge of times to come is very deep, such that we have no truly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasonable basis for dismissing the right to survive of any persons 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on the planet - or other living species for that matter - unless it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can be clearly shown that such killing or allowing to die, is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessary to prevent some far greater harm and the assertion of this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is of course hampered precisely by our lack of knowledge of the future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This feels incomplete but it needs to be sent.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with you as far as advice for how to live a good life goes, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I guess where I disagree is on the technical matter of what we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call reasonable. Peter Jones said that a system of economics designed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to create universal poverty is not reasonable. I would agree *given* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the purpose of an economic system is not to create poverty. If we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are talking about a system designed to destroy the economy of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; country in order to soften it up for invasion, for example, then an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; economist can apply all his skill and knowledge in a perfectly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasonable mannner in order to achieve this. The human values driving 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an economic system, although we can predict what they might be in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; majority of cases, are subjective states and are beyond reason: this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is what I want, this is what I like, and you can't tell me otherwise. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This stands in contrast to empirical statements such as &quot;the Earth is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flat&quot;, which is true or false independently of what anyone thinks or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wants.
