</em><br />
<br />I have spent some time thinking about conciousness and how it relates to 
<br />
time, and here are my thoughts:
<br />
<br />I agree with most of what GSLevy said.  However, what is it that links two 
<br />
observer moments?  The answer: memory.  The *only* reason you even have a 
<br />
perception of other observer moments is because you remember them within 
<br />
another observer moment.  In fact, when you are experiencing one observer 
<br />
moment, it is not necessary for any previous observer moments to exist (or 
<br />
have existed) at all, because they are still perceived in exactly the same 
<br />
way within the current observer moment regardless.  You simply do not make 
<br />
the assumption that anything that has ever happened up to this very moment 
<br />
in your life really did happen.  Of course, in order to be accurate about 
<br />
what moment you are actually experiencing and which ones are just memory, 
<br />
you would have to constantly update your conclusions because of our 
<br />
perception that we are continually flowing through observer moments.  Our 
<br />
conclusions would not be correct until we reached the actually existing 
<br />
observer moment, and all of our previous conclusions never were actually 
<br />
reached, but we only remember them being reached in that one single observer 
<br />
moment.  The same goes for all of our thoughts and experiences throughout 
<br />
life.  We never actually had any experiences; we only remember them within 
<br />
that one single observer moment.  The only reason it seems as though they 
<br />
are actually happening is because we assume that what we remember actually 
<br />
did happen.
<br />
<br />GSLevy said that time is an illusion created by the logical linking of 
<br />
observer moments; really, though, the illusion is created by the logical 
<br />
structure of memory.  All of our memories must exist within a single 
<br />
observer moment.  Not only must we remember everything that has happened in 
<br />
our lives, but we must remember what we remembered within all of the 
<br />
remembered observer moments in order to have a perception of time.  The 
<br />
easiest way to do this is with a linked-list type of memory.  The actually 
<br />
existing observer moment need only remember the most recent observer moment; 
<br />
the rest are automatically remembered because the memory of every remembered 
<br />
observer moment includes the memory of the previous observer moment.
<br />
<br />Basically, our entire lives are just a logically structured linked-list 
<br />
memory within a single moment of reality that exists independant of time.  
<br />
Let me know what you think about this theory.
