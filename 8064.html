<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at least if it is done carefully and correctly.  If you believe in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reproduce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and substitute for the activity of your mind.  (Some people have  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the details of the transfer process from the mind to the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but they are often satisfied if the change is done slowly, perhaps one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neuron at a time.)  Likewise if you would accept that your mind could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be substituted by a computer, you are a computationalist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So where do the Church Thesis and Arithmetical realism come into play
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as part of the DEFINITION of &quot;comp&quot;?  I don't understand this.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is just because I make a deductive reasoning from YD, at first,  
<br />
but at the step 7 I need the universal dovetailer to be enough  
<br />
general, that is really &quot;universal&quot;, and this is made simple by CT.  
<br />
Well, even at step 0 (Yes doctor), if the doctor is honest it will  
<br />
warn you that the artificial brain is a digital device, and I cannot  
<br />
imagine him explaining what that really means in all generality  
<br />
without invoking Church thesis. Church thesis also simplifies  
<br />
considerably many reasoning with comp.
<br />
The conceptual explanation is given in my two diagonalization posts.  
<br />
We can come back on this.
<br />
Arithmetical realism is a much weaker assumption. I have introduce it  
<br />
in comp to provide a way out for those who believes in YD and in  
<br />
Church thesis (quasi all computer scientist I met) but still doesn't  
<br />
not  believe in the conclusion although agreeing with most of the  
<br />
steps. looking in the detail it is the arithmetical realist  
<br />
assumption which they find the most weak.
<br />
But I agree with Godfrey that CT and AR are really bodyguard for YD.
<br />
But then, with the interview of the lobian machine, the physics is  
<br />
derived from CT and AR alone!
<br />
<br />To sum up: comp is essentially YD, if only to provide a picture of  
<br />
the first person comp indeterminacy. But CT is used to give a range  
<br />
for that indeterminacy (the UD*, the trace of the UD). It is by CT  
<br />
that the UD is really comp-universal, and it is a consequence of CT  
<br />
that this forces it to dovetail, and to dovetail on an incredibly  
<br />
redundant structures (providing non trivial relative measures). AR is  
<br />
used to just accept the notion of UD* and other infinite mathematical  
<br />
structures, and for justifying the use of the excluded middle principle.
<br />
<br />Given the apparent &quot;enormity&quot; of the reversal conclusion, I have no  
<br />
choice than to put all the card on the table. A referee of my french  
<br />
PhD thesis has try to convince me that the use of CT can be avoided  
<br />
in UDA. I am not convinced, and then I know it is unavoidable in the  
<br />
UDA lobian translation.
<br />
<br />Hope that helps,
<br />
<br />Bruno
