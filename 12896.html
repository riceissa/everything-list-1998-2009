I think we have been through this before actually.
<br />
<br />Can you point to any aspect of the world which can't be simulated no 
<br />
matter how powerful the computer?
<br />
<br />MP: For us mortals, this universe is in many respects infinite. If 
<br />
'someone' IS running it within a 'computer' then they have to be running 
<br />
all of it. Why? Because humans can do science. This means that our 
<br />
little brains can come up with questions about everything and we do; in 
<br />
fact we can say that 'we' - collectively the whole human species - must 
<br />
have asked questions about everything we already have beliefs about. The 
<br />
formal and systematic way of checking out answers to practical questions 
<br />
of fact is through the assertion of an explanation which is able to make 
<br />
specific predictions because we assume causality, then someone sets up 
<br />
experimental situation to test the predictions. Now the experiment will 
<br />
either falsify the assertions of the explanation because the predictions 
<br />
were not correct, or the predictions will turn out to be correct in 
<br />
which case the assertions will gain strength as explanatory tools and 
<br />
become linked, in the minds of ever more people, with all the other 
<br />
assertions that didn't get falsified. The more this happens, the more 
<br />
the universe is constrained to comply with our explanations. 'So what?' 
<br />
you say.
<br />
<br />Well, as curious people keep asking questions about their world, so more 
<br />
and more pervasive and detailed application of scientific theory occurs. 
<br />
Curious kids grow up to be curious adults, and some are always going to 
<br />
refuse to be fobbed off with the 'because it IS' response. And the ways 
<br />
of asking questions are potentially infinite because answers get 
<br />
re-input as new questions, which more or less guarantees non-linear 
<br />
results. So newer experiments get created which just by the by 
<br />
incorporate new juxtapositions of previously accepted results as part of 
<br />
the experimental set up. Over time this effectively demands that the 
<br />
accepted theories have to be 100% correct because any slight errors will 
<br />
be multiplied over time. Now I realise this is a rather informal way of 
<br />
asserting this but, as I said before, plain-English is what I want and 
<br />
yes I know this does seem to make things long winded. But the bottom 
<br />
line here is that, over time, scientific theories are constrained to be 
<br />
ever more exactly correct with less and less margin for error. In effect 
<br />
the human species will test just about all significant and practically 
<br />
useful theories to vanishingly small tolerances so whatever might be 
<br />
'simulating' the universe as seen from planet Earth has ever less margin 
<br />
for error. Simply put the 'universe in the bottle' has to be perfectly 
<br />
consistent and ontologically complete.
<br />
<br />So the conspiratorial simulators must have 'computers' that are able to 
<br />
increase their representational power to infinite precision when needed. 
<br />
And can the conspirators predict before they start the simulation 
<br />
running just precisely what tests and outlandish ideas the humans will 
<br />
come up with? I think not.
<br />
<br />I think this means that Stathis's 'no matter how powerful the computer?' 
<br />
is a bit of a cheat [nothing personal you understand; what I am saying 
<br />
is that I think the whole project of Mathematical universe and 'Comp' 
<br />
may be just a very sophisticated house of cards.] I believe that either 
<br />
all of our universe as seen on, at and from planet Earth is being 
<br />
simulated perfectly or none of it is being simulated at all.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     MP: I don't think I can accept this. Maybe I sound arrogant in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     saying this, but I think the idea of simulation is used a bit too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     loosely. I know there are those lurking on the Mind &amp; Brain list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     and JCS-online who would say I am 'the pot calling the kettle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     black', because I am always asserting what I call UMSITW
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     [pronounced um-see-two for English speakers] - updating the model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     of self in the world - is the basis of consciousness. But they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     misunderstand me, because I do not say there is anyone else doing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     simulation, merely that we experience being here because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     universe has evolved self sustaining regions within itself which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     maintain their structure by means of dynamically modelling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     themselves and their local region so as to avoid fatal dangers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     while obtaining everything they need from their environments. My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     point here is simply that the universe is its own best simulation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     and that any ideas of something greater, such as a Matrix type
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     operation, are science fiction only. Why? Because for a feasible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     universe like the one we seem to inhabit to be deterministic does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     not require that it is predictable nor that it can be repeatable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Nobody knows to what extent quantum level events are intrinsically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     random as opposed to being _pushed from 'behind' or 'below'_ so to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     speak.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whether the world can be simulated and whether the world is being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulated are two different questions. Can you point to any aspect of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world which can't be simulated no matter how powerful the computer?
