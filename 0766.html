&lt;&lt;Remember my idea that all worlds branch or converge toward one future. .
<br />
Obviously crackpot. How 'bout when I dropped time as a dimension. No one has
<br />
posted a response to anything I have written. 
<br />
I have been ignored. I posted ideas about the distant future being
<br />
determined or inevitable, and how that shapes the present, which got no
<br />
direct response. 
<br />
Quantumly speaking, we know the past is not determined until we observe it,
<br />
as is true of the future. There isn't merely one past. So we can imagine the
<br />
wave function of all possible worlds in the past. The wave function is very
<br />
wide first considering the immediate past, yet as we look ever deeper into
<br />
the past, all the many possible worlds we can envision merge toward a single
<br />
beginning, common to all paths, the Big Bang. All possible worlds begin from
<br />
or near a common single state. Notice how that one inevitable distant past
<br />
shapes what we observe about the past. It shapes our present. It makes the
<br />
background radiation evenly distributed. It shows us one model of the past,
<br />
not many depending upon which direction we look, or on different days. 
<br />
The common origin of all quantum worlds makes our past consistent and
<br />
contributes to the flow of time being consistent. It radically narrows the
<br />
wave function, as related to what is possible to have happened. Now look at
<br />
the future. What is possible in the immediate future is also wide. Consider
<br />
that the set of all possible futures narrows toward a single outcome, a
<br />
single state, just like the past. Notice how that single future would shape
<br />
our world, our present, just as the single state in our past shapes our
<br />
world. Notice finally that if the past only shaped the present, if the
<br />
future didn't shape the present, then what is possible; the wave function,
<br />
would expand radically into chaotic possibilities. Then, there would be no
<br />
rational laws of nature. &gt;&gt;
<br />
Interesting idea which is coherent with the idea according to which the
<br />
universe spreads from a Big Bang to a Big Crunch. But this raises a
<br />
fundamental question : what makes the arrow of time ? The fundamental laws
<br />
of physics are symetric concerning time. Theoretically, one could reverse
<br />
any event. But if a perturbation occurs, we don't get back the initial
<br />
state. This implicitely supposes that the perturbations propagate toward the
<br />
future, and not the past, because the past is fixed. What makes the
<br />
direction of th arrow of time could be the opposite direction of the nearest
<br />
fixation point, the Big Bang. This would mean that near the Big Crunch, the
<br />
arrow of time would point in the reverse direction, with a time stagnation
<br />
zone in the middle.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metaphysical reflections - The arrow of time
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important question about the models of the universe is time.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time appears to us like a linear succession with a causality
<br />
orientation, from causes to effects. But the physicists have discovered that
<br />
the fundamental laws of physics are temporally symetric. How could we
<br />
explain this ?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physicists explain this with what they call the second principle
<br />
of thermodynamics, according to which the total entropy (physical measure of
<br />
disorder) of a system can only increase.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine what are the deep causes of this dissymetry. Let us
<br />
take an example.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vase falls on the ground and breaks into pieces. During the
<br />
falling, it obeys to an approximatively symmetrical law. If we thow it up it
<br />
will follow approximatively the same trajectory if we ignore the resistance
<br />
of the air. When it reaches the ground, the deceleration produces forces
<br />
greater than those making its cohesion, and it breaks into pieces. These
<br />
pieces, following symmetrical laws, fall down on the ground, producing
<br />
vibrations of sound (ordered agitation of molecules) and warmth (unordered
<br />
agitation). At the microscopic level, the agitation of the molecules also
<br />
obeys to symmetrical laws. So where does the dissymmetry come from ?
<br />
Couldn't we imagine that this phenomene happens reversed in time ? Let us
<br />
see what would happen then.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A warmth and a noise would cause vibrations of the ground. But these
<br />
warmth and noise would not be any agitations of molecules but very
<br />
particular agitations, such that the resulting vibrations would throw up the
<br />
debris of the vase in such a way that they would gather and remake the
<br />
entire vase which is thrown up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an event is theoretically possible but we do not observe it.
<br />
Why ? The dissymmetry comes from the fact that the initial conditions of the
<br />
reverse processare so particular a very small perturbation would be enough
<br />
to prevent the result, but for the breaking, if the initial conditions are a
<br />
little different, the event would happen with little modifications.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us imagine what would happen if a perturbation occurs. For
<br />
example, a fly flies near the falling vase. The resulting moving of the air
<br />
modifies a little the trajectory of the vase and the pieces will be little
<br />
differents.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the reverse case, the fly would modify the very particular
<br />
molecular agitation which cause the vibrations which throw up the pieces and
<br />
gathers them. This perturbated molecular agitation would not give this
<br />
result and will remain an ordinary warmth and noise.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can feel where is the dissymmetry. We spontaneously tend to
<br />
consider that the perturbations propagate toward future, and not past.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we considef that the laws of physics are not totally
<br />
deterministic and that a place remains for free will, we could conceive that
<br />
this free will could act on both directions of time.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience shows that this free will acts only toward one
<br />
direction that we call future. Why couldn't it act toward past ? Maybe
<br />
because past is fixed and future is free, the universe is fixed at a
<br />
fixation point in the past, the Big Bang. The past being fixed, freedom
<br />
could only act on future.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could also imagine that there could exist several fixation
<br />
points, the nearer from now being in our past, our Big Bang. Some scientists
<br />
think that the expansion phase of the universe could be followed by a
<br />
contraction phase which will terminate by a Big Crunch, a reverse Big Bang
<br />
during which the universe will go back to its original state of primitive
<br />
atom. But during this contraction phase, the arrow of time will probably be
<br />
reversed, so that in fact it will be an expansion for those who will live at
<br />
this time, then the Big Crunch would not be the end of the universe but
<br />
another beginning with a time in reverse direction compared to our time,
<br />
these two universes going one toward the other and gathering in a phase of
<br />
temporal stagnation during which time would be approximatively symmetrical.
<br />
In fact, there would not be three separated phases but a continuity.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us imagine how things could be perceived by an hypothetic living
<br />
being which would cross this temporal stagnation phase.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, when he is nearer from the Big Bang than from what
<br />
appears to him as the Big Crunch, time appears to flow in one direction,
<br />
from what he calls past to what he calls future. Then he begins to perceive
<br />
of inversion time some phenomenes. We perhaps already perceive a few
<br />
phenomenes of this kind, for example divination which could be memory of
<br />
future. He could also observe inversions between perceptions and actions,
<br />
then will become more and more these phenomenes frequents, and in
<br />
progressively he the zone will enter where will seem stagnation temporal the
<br />
symmetrical time him. sense normal the being like perceive will he what in
<br />
flowing but inversed not him seems time, Crunch Big the like perceives he
<br />
what than Bang Big the like perceives he what from nearer is he when,
<br />
beginning the At.
