<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wouldn't it be the equivalent of quantum entanglement where you really have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the equivalent of just the original?  This is where I think the reasoning 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in your puzzle is flawed.  Having 10^100+1 identical bodies is equivalent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to having one body, so it makes it a 50/50 chance.  Until the information 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is actually revealed, it would be just like the copying didn't happen, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;therefore there is no way to tell which state (copied or not copied) is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;currently in effect.  Even though this may not be an appealing option, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe that copying, if possible, wouldn't change anything having to do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with identity (it doesn't &quot;add to the measure&quot;).  Like Einstein said, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different result.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In addition, even if copying a body with two subsequent diverging histories 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;were possible, why wouldn't this become just like two different people?  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Who cares if there are disputes?  That's nothing new.  What does that have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to do with consiousness?  I don't believe that identity is dependent on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />The idea of &quot;exact copying&quot; not being consistent with QM is raised quite 
<br />
often on this list. The problem with this is that you don't need literally 
<br />
exact copying to get the same mental state. If you did, our minds would 
<br />
diverge wildly after only nanoseconds, given the constant changes that occur 
<br />
even at the level of macromolecules, let alone the quantum state of every 
<br />
subatomic particle. It is like saying you could never copy a CD, because you 
<br />
could never get the quantum states exactly the same as in the original. 
<br />
Brains are far more complex than CD's, but like CD's they must be tolerant 
<br />
of a fair amount of noise at *way* above the quantum level, or you would at 
<br />
the very least turn into a different person every time you scratched your 
<br />
head. If this does not convince you, then you can imagine that the thought 
<br />
experiments involving &quot;exact&quot; copying are being implemented on a (classical) 
<br />
computer, and the people are actually AI programs. Once the difficulty of 
<br />
creating an AI was overcome, it would be a trivial matter to copy the 
<br />
program to another machine (or as a separate process on the same machine) 
<br />
and give it the same inputs.
<br />
<br />As for your other questions: yes, of course once the copies diverge they are 
<br />
completely different people. For the purposes of this exercise, however, I 
<br />
am assuming they *don't* diverge. In that case, I  agree you have given the 
<br />
correct answer to my puzzle: from a first person perspective, identical 
<br />
mental states are the same mental state, and at any point there is a 50-50 
<br />
chance that you are either one of the 10^100 group or on your own. But not 
<br />
everyone on this list would agree, which is why I made up this puzzle.
