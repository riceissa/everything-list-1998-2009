<br />
Dear Stephen,
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK] No, Bruno, I like Comp, I like it a LOT! I just wish that it had a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;support that was stronger than the one that you propose ...
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />[BM]  Where do I give a support to comp? I don't remember. No doubt that I 
<br />
am fascinated by its consequences, and that I appreciate the so deep 
<br />
modesty and silence of the Wise Machine.
<br />
But the reason why I work on comp is just that it makes mathematical logic 
<br />
a tool to proceed some fundamental question I'm interested in.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;and that in addition to your 1 and 3-determinacy that there would be a way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to shift from the Dovetailer view (the &quot;from the outside&quot; view) to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;inside&quot; view such that some predictiveness would obtain when we are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;trying to predict, say the dynamics of some physical system. Otherwise, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;claim, your theory is merely an excursion into computational Scholasticism.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />The whole point of my work consists to show (thanks to math) that comp is 
<br />
indeed popper falsifiable. It is just a matter of work and time to see if 
<br />
the logic of observable proposition which has been derived from comp gives 
<br />
a genuine quantum logic and ascribes the correct probability distribution 
<br />
to the verifiable facts.
<br />
The weakness of the approach is that it leads to hard mathematical question.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I am sanguine about QM's &quot;weirdness&quot;! I see it as implying that there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is much more to &quot;Existence&quot; than what we can experience with our senses. ;-)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I agree with you. Now comp shows much more easily that it *must* be so. You 
<br />
know Bohr said
<br />
that someone pretending to understand QM really does not understand 
<br />
it.  The same with comp, it can even be justified.
<br />
If a machine can believe something, it will be hard for her to believe in 
<br />
comp and in its consequences, until she realizes that indeed if a machine 
<br />
can believe something, it will be hard for her to believe in comp and in 
<br />
its consequences, until she realizes that indeed if a machine can believe 
<br />
something, it will be hard for her to believe in comp and in its 
<br />
consequences until she realizes that indeed if  ....  (apology for this 
<br />
infinite sentence).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; comp =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;         1) there is level of description of me such that I cannot be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aware of functional digital substitution made at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Here we differ as I do not believe that &quot;digital substitution&quot; is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible, IF such is restricted to UTMs or equivalents.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />No consistent machine can really &quot;believe&quot; that indeed. But this does not 
<br />
mean a consistent machine will believe not-comp. The point is: are you 
<br />
willing to accept it for the sake of the reasoning.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;         2) Church thesis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I have problems with Churches thesis because it, when taken to its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical conclusion, explicitly requires that all of the world to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enumerable and a priori specifiable. Peter Wegner, and others, have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argued persuasively, at least for me, that this is simply is not the case.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Church thesis entails that the partial (uncontrolable a priori) processes 
<br />
are mechanically enumerable.
<br />
AND Church thesis entails that the total (controlable) processes are NOT 
<br />
mechanically enumerable.
<br />
In each case we face either uncontrolability or non enumerability. It is 
<br />
Church thesis which really
<br />
protects comp from reductionnism. That was the subject of one thesis I 
<br />
propose in the seventies. Since then Judson Webb has written a deep book on 
<br />
that point. (Webb 1980, ref in my thesis, url below).
<br />
See my everything-list posts &quot;diagonalisation&quot; for the proof of those facts.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;         3) Arithmetical Realism)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  makes the physical science eventually secondary with respect to number 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory/computer science/machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; psychology/theology whatever we decide to call that fundamental field ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I have no problem with AR, per say, but see it as insufficient, since 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it does not address the &quot;act&quot; of counting, it merely denotes the list of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules for doing so.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Certainly not.  AR is the doctrine that even in a case of absolute 
<br />
catastrophe killing all living form in the multiverse, the statement that 
<br />
there is no biggest prime will remain true. It has nothing to do with 
<br />
axioms and rules of formal system. Indeed by Godel's incompleteness theorem 
<br />
Arithmetical truth extends itself well beyond any set of theorem provable 
<br />
in any axiomatizable theory.
<br />
Now, what do you mean by AR is insufficient? AR just say that arithmetical 
<br />
truth does not depend on us. It does not say that some other truth does not 
<br />
exist as well (although as a *consequence* of comp plus occam they do 
<br />
indeed vanish). Don't confuse AR with &quot;Pythagorean AR&quot; which asserts 
<br />
explicitely &quot;AR and no more&quot;. We got P.AR as a consequence of comp, but we 
<br />
do not postulate it in the comp hyp.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I will go through your thesis step by step again and see if I can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrestle my prejudices down into some reasonableness. ;-)
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. Be sure to go to step n only if you manage to go to step n-1 before. 
<br />
Don't hesitate to ask question if something is unclear. Be sure you accept 
<br />
the hypotheses (if only for the sake of the argument).
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />
<br />Bruno
