<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	Here your misunderstanding is clearly exposed.  The way I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; defined p(A), it is the effective probability of an observation-moment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with the property 'A'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Oh dear - and I thought we were debating whether the RSSA is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent with Bayesian statistics. Now you revert to the ASSA, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I quite accept is consistent.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate started when you claimed that the RSSA is needed.  I
<br />
have been trying to show you that it isn't.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that you have oscillated between saying that the RSSA is a
<br />
special case of the ASSA, and (as above) saying (or implying) that they
<br />
are quite distinct.  Part of the blame no doubt lies with me because at
<br />
certain times I have been sloppy in my use of the term 'measure'.  However
<br />
that was a while ago.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To try to clear up any confusion, let me state what I see as the
<br />
distinction.  In the ASSA, the effective probability of an observer-moment
<br />
is proportional to it measure; the measure must be determined by some
<br />
physical or mathematical 'reality' + some proceedure to map that to a
<br />
measure distribution.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view I expect the measure to be proportional to the number
<br />
of implementations of a computation.   In QM it is (the absolute
<br />
square of the amplitude of a wavefunction) x (the number of copies of that
<br />
observer in that branch), but this should be derivable from the former rule.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RSSA: there seem to be two versions of it.  The following is my
<br />
attempt to describe what my impression is; no doubt those who actually
<br />
give the RSSA some respect may wish to clarify it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) A special case of the ASSA as defined above, but in which the
<br />
measure distribution is not merely proportional to the number of
<br />
implementations.  Rather, there is some kind of hidden variables that link
<br />
a set of implementations over time and give rise to an objective &quot;identity
<br />
function&quot; that seperates them into various sets called &quot;identities&quot;; the
<br />
measure of an observation A is proportional to the sum over identities i
<br />
and over time t of [(# implementations for A in identity i at time t) /
<br />
(total # of implementations in identity i at time t)] x
<br />
[some constant C_i associated with identity i]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or 2) There are &quot;identities&quot; as above, but unlike in the ASSA,
<br />
only &quot;relative probabilities&quot; for observation A at t, given that B was
<br />
observerved within that identity at t', can be calculated.  Questions
<br />
about other quantities are not addressed.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My view is that 1) is unneccessarily complicated, while 2) is also
<br />
incomprehensible to me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	Definitions of identity, of 'me' or 'not me', are irrelevant to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; finding p(A).  By definition, if my current observation is A, and A and B
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are such that it is not possible for the same observation-moment to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; both, then I observe (not B).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	If you want to talk about the probability that, using some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; definition of identity that ties together many observation moments, &quot;I&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; will eventually observe Y1 - that will depend on the definition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; identity.  It is NOT what I have been talking about, nor do I wish to talk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about it until you understand the much more basic concept of the measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of an observer-moment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have no problem with the concept of observer moment. It appears you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a problem with the concept of connecting up a set of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moments into an observer. One cannot discuss QTI or RSSA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without doing this.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, what I want to discuss is the measure of
<br />
observer-moments.  I don't care if you &quot;connect them&quot; (as in RSSA-1
<br />
above) to do your calculations, as long as your final answer is about the
<br />
measure I'm asking about.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In light of our previous discussions, p(X) was defined as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability of being observer &quot;Jacques Mallah&quot;, not the probability of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being observer &quot;Jacques Mallah&quot; at a particular observer moment.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No!  I was careful that time to define it precisely.  What I said
<br />
was it was the effective probability of a set of observations, i.e. 
<br />
observation-moments, with that characteristic.  Observing that one is
<br />
Jacques Mallah is something I often do, but if you take some drugs
<br />
or have a bad dream or something, for a moment you might think you are
<br />
Jacques Mallah as well!  That moment is included in the set of
<br />
observations with characteristic 'X'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is an obvious normalisation problem with the usual model of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; branching histories in MWI (I see from your signature you at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accept that!). Since the total number of histories (belonging to say a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular observer) is some exponentially growing function of time,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and extends indefinitely into the future, the total measure of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer is unnormalisable, without some renormalisation applied at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each &quot;timestep&quot; (which seems rather arbitrary - unless you've got some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better ideas). Your measure argument, which is a variation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Leslie-Carter Doomsday argument, implicitly relies on a normalised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure distribution of observer moments. I seem to remember this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normalisation problem was discussed earlier this year, but I'm not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure (without rereading large tracts of the archives)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been discussed by others, but let me just say again,
<br />
there is no such problem.  In QM, the total measure is given by the
<br />
squared amplitude of the wavefunction, summed over the possible outcomes
<br />
containing the observer; my belief is that this should be explained in
<br />
terms of numbers of implementations of computations.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, with RSSA, this normalisation problem is not an issue, as only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the relative measures between successive time steps is important, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the overall measure.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Time steps'?  As in RSSA-2, I just don't understand what you're
<br />
trying to say.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a more important reason why the ASSA is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unbelievable. Basically, the ASSA implies that the first person view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the world is identical with the third person (the observer moment I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am experiencing now is selected from precisely the same distribution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as other people's observer moments). There are many examples that show
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the opposite (eg Tegmark's suicide experiment, Marchal's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;KILL-THE-USER&quot; instruction) that are basically &quot;Schroedinger's cat as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer&quot; variants.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bullshit.  Tegmark's suicide experiment, for example, shows that
<br />
when you try to commit suicide, your measure decreases (in the ASSA
<br />
without RSSA, or ASSA for short).  Of course, if you put the RSSA in by
<br />
hand the way Tegmark effectively did, you will get it back out again.
