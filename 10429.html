</em><br />
<br />This is a big topic difficult to do justice to. I'm sure we've both had
<br />
the experience of re-perusing various treatments of the alternatives
<br />
without necessarily being completely persuaded either way, but I for
<br />
one have accomodated my intuitions to this fairly successfully.
<br />
There's a brief discussion of this in 'not the roadmap' with Bruno and
<br />
Colin which addresses these issues from the perspective of the
<br />
'gestalt'. The points discussed all seem paradoxical from the pov of a
<br />
classical 'nameable 1st person', and this is IMO a powerful strike
<br />
against this position.
<br />
<br />BTW, I have a question for you re 'intrinsically dynamic' views of
<br />
reality. It has always seemed to me that this view commits one to a
<br />
sort of continual annihilation of each state by the succeeding one. So
<br />
both 'past states' and 'future states' are 'radically absent'. My
<br />
question is: what is left to be 'present'? Recent developments in
<br />
string theory (M-theory) picture time in terms of a 'cinematographic'
<br />
view of Planck-time segments. If these are all that exist at any given
<br />
'point in time', then haven't we as-near-as-dammit banished the
<br />
universe from substantial existence? After all, 'structure' when
<br />
decomposed is in fact extraordinarily dense action - energy IOW. In the
<br />
'salami-slicer' model, aren't we left the grin without the cat?
<br />
<br />It seems to me also that our subjective experience of 'the specious
<br />
present' entails the compresent existence of Vast numbers of such
<br />
temporal atoms - say one to one 1/2 seconds-worth. Again, if we try to
<br />
imagine our experience in the face of the razor of dynamic time, does
<br />
it seem anything like this? Have you an alternative presentation of a
<br />
dynamic model that resolves these issues?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That doesn't mean all contrast leads to dynamism !
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can get stasis out of dynamism by slowing things dwon to a halt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is still a paradox to get dynamism out of stasis.
</em><br />
<br />Substrate/ differentiation is also a global/ local distinction.
<br />
Locality is manufactured out of information and its manner of
<br />
propagation. The global/ local contrast is inherently dynamic. Don't
<br />
expect dynamism to reduce to primitive 'dynamic atoms'. It emerges from
<br />
the tension between two contrastable states.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the argument is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) David is a person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Because David is a person, some parts of David are conscious, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others unconscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) Some parts of the universe are conscious, and others unconcisous.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) Therefore the universe is a person, too.
</em><br />
<br />4) should read: therefore the universe manifests personhood in macro as
<br />
David does in micro.  'Indexical David' is a lens through which the
<br />
conscious/ unconscious personhood of the universe concentrates a
<br />
particular perspective.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;1) Persons aren't irreducible
<br />
<br />Persons are defined and delimited by the intersection of structure and
<br />
substrate. Or in dynamic language, persons are substrate behaving
<br />
personally. Neither element is dispensible. It depends what you mean by
<br />
reducible. A substrate that adopts personal indexicality in this way,
<br />
that claims 'I am indexical David', is something I 'take personally'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Qualia aren't structural.
</em><br />
<br />Qualia are the instantiated experience of persons defined indexically.
<br />
They are the appearance of the substrate behaving personally. They are
<br />
the analogic instantiation of information. Information is derived from
<br />
their mutual relations, and these relations are structural/
<br />
behavioural. They are the carriers of the metaphoric 'aboutness' of
<br />
substrate-as-meaning. The meaning they express is 'like this!' From
<br />
these origins all 'what it's like' is synthesised through structure/
<br />
behaviour/ process.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) There needs to be some sort of Hard Problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attached to peronhhod to justify the manoeuvre of making the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1st-pesoanl
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primary. If a person is just a particualr structure, or a 1st person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just a  statement made by a person, that is not the case.
</em><br />
<br />The HP is not hard if qualia are understood to be the substrate's
<br />
unmediated, reflexive, self-referential, self-revelation of its
<br />
internal structure/ behaviour.  Each of the advectives I have used is
<br />
non-dual in its intent. Even if the limitations of language create the
<br />
artefact of an apparent dualism in the notion of 'self-reference', this
<br />
is a linguistic mirage. We're talking equivalence, not 'property'.
<br />
<br />BTW I don't mean by this that we will ever 'understand' why qualia have
<br />
any 'absolute' as opposed to relative appearance.  This is in principle
<br />
unanswerable.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) Strenuous avoidance of dualism. Not all dualisms have the problems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Cartesian dualism. There are dualisms within physicalism.
</em><br />
<br />As soon as we allow 'dual ontology' we let in the notion of mediation
<br />
between two realities, and an unstoppable regression of mediating
<br />
processes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5) How the apparent duality between the Easy problem and the Hard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerges, if not from some other dualism.
</em><br />
<br />The only 'duality' is substrate/ differentiation, or whole/ part. I've
<br />
said before that though substrate is implied by differentiation, it
<br />
doesn't necessitate its existence; indeed its origin is paradoxical in
<br />
causal logic. From this 'primitive duality' all other apparent
<br />
dualities arise. I know this puzzles you and perhaps you think it's
<br />
nonsense. But the 'subjective/ objective' duality arises directly from
<br />
it by the construction of the world-as-information (virtual) within the
<br />
world-as-appearance (situated). The pervasive but illusory independence
<br />
of these 'realms' creates the apparent ontic duality, but both are
<br />
artefacts of substrate/ differentiation.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't see why it should be. It does not conform to our

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  because everything is 'just there' - superposed, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it were. So, sure there's a 'layer' at which the individual 1st-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 'emerges', but it's taking everything else 'working together' to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manifest it. So in this sense, for me, it's all 'personal'. But maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not for you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This business of what 'conforms to our experience' I think is fairly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; deep. I used to be adamant that, whether or not 'timeless' theories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could be shown to be true or false on any other grounds, that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simply didn't 'conform to our experience'. I was, however, also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; suspicious of my own doubts: after all, we can't feel the earth moving,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and everyone knows you need to keep pushing things or otherwise they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; grind to a halt. So I tried to go on an imaginative journey that might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; take me into this apparently static realm but nevertheless preserve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; something like 'what we experience'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In my mind's eye I placed myself in the various 'points of view' that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'timelessly' exist within these structures. What would I see? Well,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; whatever was manifested to me in virtue of 'my' local capabilities and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the perceptual information available to this 'me'. Would these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiences be discrete, or would they be overlaid or 'smeared' with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information from other perspectives? Well, it seemed to me that what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; characteristic about our experience, what makes it seem 'sequential',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is precisely what we *can no longer* or *can't yet* see, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information we *don't* have access to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In dynamic theories of time , that is explained by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact that memory traces are laid down causally, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future doesn't causally influence the present, so there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are no traces of the future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A static universe could be structured the same way, although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it would be coincidental.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An Everythingist universe can't be. Every possible time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capsule must be instantiated. There must be versions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you who ar the same in every erespect except that hey remember their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And so despite the 'superposed'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; existence of these other states, delimitations of access to information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would act to make each capsule discrete.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What does &quot;access to information&quot; mean ? In a dynamic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, it means causality. In a  Barbour-style universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it means some &quot;nows&quot; coincidentally contain patterns representing other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;nows&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just as , in a world consisting of every possible picture, there will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be pictures containing pictures-within-a-picture.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; All the capsules capable of it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are 'conscious', but the localisation of information prevents there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; being a 'totalising' point of view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what does the localisation of informatio mean ? What do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1's and -0's mean if they were not caused by anything ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The next puzzle for me was why any of this would 'feel' dynamic. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; IMO is a subset of the qualia issue - i.e. why does anything feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; anyhow? Now, given that the arena under consideration consists in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; both a 'substrate' and the structures within it, it has both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distributed and all-at-once aspects. Could it not be the the dynamic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; temporal 'feel' is the tension between these two? All dynamism derives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from contrast,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That doesn't mean all contrast leads to dynamism !
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can get stasis out of dynamism by slowing things dwon to a halt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is still a paradox to get dynamism out of stasis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and this seems to offer it. Putting these elements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; together (over a period of time involving many 'thought voyages') has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; re-aligned my intuition to make the scenario seem more plausible, at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; least experientially.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Finally we come to the question of all these 'mes'. They all exist, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; they're all conscious (the ones that are, that is). What's different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about the other parts of the structure? Why aren't *they* conscious?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; They're just organised differently, just like the parts *within*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; persons that aren't conscious (ever), or the part that just went to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sleep, or died. So the whole structure, reflexively, *to itself*, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; manifesting consciously, unconsciously, and no doubt every nuance in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; between and beyond. That's my capital-P Personal. I strongly suspect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that you find this way of thinking uncongenial, which is absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fine by me. But I've tried to describe it as clearly as I can, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; perhaps we can do no better than leave it at that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the argument is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) David is a person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Because David is a person, some parts of David are conscious, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others unconscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) Some parts of the universe are conscious, and others unconcisous.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) Therefore the universe is a person, too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; That isn't at all clear to me - mainly because you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; are nto makign the all-improtant distinction between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; structures-structures and qualia-structures.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The qualia-structures are the fact of *being* the differentiated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; substrate, and they manifest as 'feel', as distinct from 'possessing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; properties'. The structure-structures are the observed relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; derived from these experiences, which also give us our relational or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'property' view of things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Why is it not possible that *being* a substrate differentiated in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; particular way just *feels like* a particular existential/ experiential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; quality to the differentiated substrate in question?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I didn't say it was impossible. This is a confusion about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the meaning of &quot;structure&quot;. I was only doubting that qualia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are structures of a non-fundamental, decomposable sort.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I find the choice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of vocabulary here almost impossible, because it's not the sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; thing we're used to trying to communicate. But we're trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; comprehend a sort of reflexivity, a 'seeming-to-itself'. How would you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; prefer to characterise it? Is it critical to your conception that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; qualia are individual irreducible 'feels' and are subjectively neither
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; analysable or synthesisable even to the 'feeler'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Qualia are what they seem. I still don't know what you mean by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;synthesise&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I feel that we're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; getting to the point here where the problem stems from interpreting our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; personal experience in characteristically different ways, and this may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simply be irreconcilable. As you say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I disagree. I can discern no structure *within* the taste
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of lemon or the colour red. There are relations between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; tastes, colours and so on, but they underdiefine the tastes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; and colurs themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I agree about the underdefinition, but beyond this can one really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; debate something so personal as what one can 'discern'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The HP rests on the very fact that such things cannot be communicated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If they were just (structural) strcutures, they could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I can't think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of any further argument to advance this here, so &quot;Wovon man nicht
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sprechen kann, darüber muß man schweigen&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; At this stage, and attempting to recall our various points of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; departure, are you able to summarise what substantive areas of dispute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; may remain that do not boil down to imaginative or linguistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; preference?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) Persons aren't irreducible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Qualia aren't structural.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) There needs to be some sort of Hard Problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attached to peronhhod to justify the manoeuvre of making the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1st-pesoanl
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primary. If a person is just a particualr structure, or a 1st person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just a  statement made by a person, that is not the case.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) Strenuous avoidance of dualism. Not all dualisms have the problems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Cartesian dualism. There are dualisms within physicalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5) How the apparent duality between the Easy problem and the Hard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerges, if not from some other dualism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I mean this genuinely, not rhetorically. I have discovered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; many points of agreement in thinking about your interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; presentation of your views, and your pointed questions to this juncture
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have been most helpful in getting me to formulate justifications with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as much precision as I can. I'm only sorry I don't do better, but words
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; often fail me (or do I fail them?)
</em><br />
