very good. In many movies.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You should print it and put it in your kitchen or toilet, and put a

</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Excellent. Remember we are platonist, and we have all the time. Better  
<br />
to go slow and deep than quick and superficial.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course Everett could be wrong, and comp could be wrong, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; naturalism could be right: but it is up to the naturalist to say  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is the machine's atomic operation that a Turing machine cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; complete. If it is the generation of a truly random event, and if  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is based on the wave collapse, then I can understand (but you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have to solve all the problem raised by the collapse, you will  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abandon the theory of relativity like Bohm and Bell suggested,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; etc.).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or you say like Searle that &quot;only special machine can think:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; biological brain&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; If Searle (and Penrose) are right, then why not a simple biological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; brain transplant? Why bother with looking for &quot;the right  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; substitution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; level&quot; at all in this case?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Just pilfer a wet, messy brain from a road accident victim and shove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; it into your skull. But where would we now stand with respect to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; indeterminacy?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I asked my partner today whether she felt she would be the same  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; after receiving a biological brain transplant and she said &quot;Of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; not! I would now be the dead person whose brain I have inherited.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I am is generated only by MY brain.&quot; Proves she is a materialist/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; physicalist, I guess. We all know people like this. Sigh.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Ah gosh Kim, be careful or add enough smileys when you do jokes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK - will use emoticons from now on - I promise! (I am very slack  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here, agreed, but then - as you now know - the Everything List Court  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jester reserves the right to lace a lot of his discourse with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; humour! What are court jesters for, after all? Smilies ultimately  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weaken the power of the humour,
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I agree with you. Totally. Good comics looks terribly serious.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; just like in (a good many but by no means all) Hollywood films where  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the moral of the story is ALWAYS given at the end in case the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; audience was too dumb or too drunk to follow the discourse and its  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implications.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I love American Movies but I agree with you, &quot;moral&quot; is like &quot;humour&quot;,  
<br />
it cannot be said. Few &quot;moralist&quot; are aware of that. In my opinion,  
<br />
the champion is Lie-Tseu: his teaching is by little stories and  
<br />
dreams---thought experiments if you want----: without any conclusions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There appears to me to be a certain point in leaving the listener to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wonder whether it was a joke or not - this, for me, is the 'serious'  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aspect of humour, that I have alluded to in the past - if that isn't  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too self-contradictory.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No no no. You fly only near inconsistency, the land of the terrible  
<br />
jokes! I think you will appreciate the intrinsic humor of the  
<br />
universal machine. Not everyone appreciates.
<br />
I think Alan Kay, one of the inventor of object oriented laguages, was  
<br />
a jazz musicien, and told that he quit music for computer science as a  
<br />
natural generalisation capable of providing more emotions and  
<br />
imagination spaces.
<br />
Universal machine are universal dynamical mirrors, you already go near  
<br />
inconsistency when you put two universal machine in front of each other.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Comes of being a composer (of music) - an aesthete. I like to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occasionally trick the audience or test their ability to view  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something from an unexpected perspective (maybe not the best thing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to do with scientists, mathematicians and logicians!). Example: in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the second movement of Sir William Walton's 1st Symphony (Scherzo,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; con Malizia) I say that there is much &quot;malicious use of musical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; humour&quot; but some do not get this when they hear it. As if the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; composer's own use of &quot;con malizia&quot; to describe the mood and tempo  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of his piece does not already provide an &quot;external clue&quot;... but  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; musical humour is hard for many to appreciate, particularly as here  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - in a symphony; an instrumental composition where there are no  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; words being sung to &quot;explain&quot; the accompanying music. There is no  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; musical equivalent of the emoticon because ALL of music is an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emotional &quot;con job&quot; - much poetry is the same - would you ask  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Shakespeare to use smilies? ;-D
</em><br />
<br />That would be comical!
<br />
To be or not to be ;-)
<br />
<br />I believe and appreciate very much humour in Music.
<br />
<br />I have also a theory according to which british humour is obtined by  
<br />
taking classical logic seriously enough. The comical effect comes from  
<br />
the fact that in the real work classical logic NEVER works. Dutch  
<br />
humour is the opposite. It is based on constructive logic which always  
<br />
work, which explains the absence of comical effects.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK - we are doing serious explanatory work here so I will cut back  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the cryptic stuff
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To get back on-topic:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually I wasn't joking! Sorry to be an &quot;inconsistent machine&quot; (or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more likely just a momentarily confused and chatty one). Up to now I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; felt that the basis of MEC was the existence of the substitution  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level which allows that all body parts, indeed anything &quot;immaterial&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is simulable. Consciousness itself is not simulable as you say;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because consciousness is not even yet &quot;immaterial&quot; (having no shape,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form, ideal description etc.) It probably does not supervene on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain activity but is the conjunction of the many-histories of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;I&quot;. For me, that means that one functional brain (digi or wet) is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as good as another provided it functions correctly. A brain is, in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the first instance at least, a receiver, not a transmitter. We can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transmit thoughts, feelings, ideas etc. to each other only after we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have downloaded today's emails from Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I now accept though, that the thing that I wasn't taking into  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; account was the &quot;encoding&quot; of the neurons with the contents of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; histories as memories. Part of my personhood is reflected in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact that I can recall my own past.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. And Freud and Jung would add that even memories that you cannot  
<br />
recall may be part of your personhood. The very structure of the human  
<br />
brain, that you normally are not even aware of, is part of your  
<br />
personhood. And the point of MEC (2.1) is that *you* are in the  
<br />
immaterial connections or the relations between the elementary parts,  
<br />
even the &quot;reptile in you&quot;. The elementary parts can be substituted by  
<br />
any equivalent machinery. You are immaterial. This does not mean you  
<br />
are unreal, conventional, eliminable, or anything negative like  
<br />
that ... on the contrary.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is of course your partner who is right.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Assuming the neurophysiological evidences, your biological wet  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; brain in your skull is the one responsible for your personal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; memories, character and identity. That is why we have to scan and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; copy brain (in the teleportation experiences) at a sufficiently  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fine grained level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I have a digi-brain. Perhaps you already have most of its  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contents backed-up on your system - so the scanning procedure can be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simplified; just a quick synchronisation required ;-)
</em><br />
<br /><br />That could be done, but then this would give another thought experiment.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If I take your brain out of your skull, and put the brain of a pig  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in there: the pig survives, with your body.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entendu - the history-traces of pighood are encoded in the neurons  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of its brain. I felt previously that these might evaporate on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; removal of the pig's brain from its body - like volatile RAM. I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guess this thought, were it true, would be to assume that the mind  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the &quot;ghost in the machine&quot; and then we are no longer dealing with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp
</em><br />
<br /><br />Again I am not sure. If the pig neuronal connections are volatile, and  
<br />
if I have a backup of your instantaneous description, then to save you  
<br />
through the pig brain would be reasonable or conceivable.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You die or disappear, in the usual clinical sense. I guess you are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK with this, I mean with this point, if not (re)read the 2.1 posts  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (or drink more coffee, I dunno ...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Accompli - probably needs more study
</em><br />
<br /><br />You can understand, and then forget and understand again, and then  
<br />
forget again. Yes it is work demanding.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; When your partner said &quot;Who I am is generated only by MY brain&quot;,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; she is not making necessarily a &quot;materialist commitment&quot; . her  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; statement could as well be interpreted as a computationalist  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; commitment: she *has* a brain. Tell her that, assuming MEC, she  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could have more than one brain, with backup of instantaneous past  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I then asked her if she would feel herself to be the same person  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; a digi-brain transplant. She responded that this was maybe possible,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; but she felt dubious about it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Would there in fact be any difference? After all, we are assuming  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; wet, messy brains and digi-brains are equivalent, all things  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; considered?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; With MEC (and the neurophysiological evidences) Wet-brain and digi- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; brain are equivalent in their potentialities (and are indeed  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; equivalent with any universal machine).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This affirms my feeling, expressed earlier
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But once &quot;programmed&quot;, by relative life events or by copy or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whatever, they are no more identical and differentiates through  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; memories and experiences. Nor is your computer hard disk identical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with mine, despite they are both digi-brain, with similar capacities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is what I was missing. Virgin tabula rasa brains are difficult  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to come across, I guess. Even the newborn does not possess this
</em><br />
<br /><br />No, but there is a sense in which the newborn can be said to be  
<br />
closer. In a sense the closest will be the universal machine.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am talking for the short terms, the everyday life prediction,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which the UDA will show that they have to be explained or re- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explained if we assume MEC.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What you say could be interpreted again in a larger sense, at  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; another level (once you identify yourself with the universal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine: then indeed you survive even with a pig brain  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; substitution, but not in a useful way to derive the physical laws.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It concerns the *very* long run only.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Messy brains, digi-brains, whatever- brains, what makes us is what  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is written there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you mean that they make us what is encoded in them, their  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contents are all-important
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. Digital mechanism is roughly captured by the idea that your mind  
<br />
is the software acting through your brain-body/hardware. Your  
<br />
consciousness can manifest itself where brains can execute (or &quot;run&quot;)   
<br />
your software in the correct-relative way.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In that case we have to suppose something very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; special about the brain: it generates consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; This made me laugh out loud. I just love it when you say things like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; this. Perhaps we must give up on the notion that personhood has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; anything at all to do with a brain?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm afraid I must a bit temper your enthusiasm. Without my brain  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and my computer, it would be hard for me to answer your post. What  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will happens, is that MEC will show that the brain is not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; responsible for the existence of your consciousness, it is needed  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; only to entangle your computations (going through to your states of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mind) with mine, so that we can share a conversation, indeed an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; history (or a sheaf of similar histories). OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK - it is more a question of the brain's role as a node or a hub -  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not as a generator (except in the trivial, everyday sense)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes. Note that I was anticipating.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But this is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a blocking argument: it could be interesting only if it points on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something special in the brain that a digital machine cannot  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; imitate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Without such specification it is just equivalent with the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *assumption*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the brain is not a digital machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Enter the soul, enter religion - enter the supernatural. Hummmph!!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Soul? Of course it all depends on the sense of the words. I like to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; identify or define the 3-soul by the coded body/brain or its  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; backup, and the 1-soul, by the owner of that code.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Makes sense. But we are computationalist practitioners. Materialist/ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physicalists (like Dawkins and Dennett) still do not understand  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this. I wish they did, because everything else they are doing I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider heroic and positively necessary! Please get onto  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RichardDawkins.net and unburden yourself, Bruno!
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am so glad you wish Dawkins and Dennett understand the consequence  
<br />
of digital mechanism. I share your enthusiasm for their heroic defense  
<br />
of reason. But it seems to me they fall in the trap of religious  
<br />
naturalism or atheism. Their critics on religion is misguided.
<br />
<br />If you say &quot;theology&quot; is a crakpot thing, then you abandon theology to  
<br />
the crakpot people, who will make theology even more crackpot.
<br />
Dennett at least seems aware of the &quot;consciousness&quot; or &quot;mind-body&quot;  
<br />
problem, but being rather rigorous he is attracted toward  
<br />
consciousness elimination. Brrr...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The immaterial one who choose a new body every morning and evening  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (if you remember 2.1).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah, oui
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Religion? Well, that could be more problematical indeed, like  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ideologies or anything using long term moral authoritative  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; normative arguments (full of hidden or not logical errors usually).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; THIS is the thing that Dawkins and Dennett heroically fight. Neither  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have yet managed to say anything about ultimate reality, if you are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right.
</em><br />
<br /><br />They take for granted that the ultimate realm is the physical realm.  
<br />
It is normal. Most believe so since Aristotle, and before Pythagorus.  
<br />
Look at the time made by physicists to &quot;swallow&quot; Everett. Things go  
<br />
slowly.
<br />
Then mathematical logic is just not taught in most places, only as  
<br />
option in pure mathematics. UDA is simple, but unbelievable by experts  
<br />
without a familiarity with Everett and Godel. Without mentioning the  
<br />
taste you need to inquire in so fundamental matter.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Then for 2.7; either you take my word for some key point, and then  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2.7 can be made easily (as easily as the preceding steps), or, (as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I secretly hope) you don't take my word and ask for the true  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; understanding of the seventh step, but then we have to open the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; gate of mathematics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will need to invest a lot of time in grappling with that. Maybe  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better if I just take your word for it! I will try though
</em><br />
<br /><br />Take it easy. We will see.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What is that point? It is the point of the existence of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal machine. This has to be seen as:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - a theorem in mathematical computer science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - a schema of theorems in mathematical computer science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - a thesis overlapping mathematics and philosophy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When does it become an engineering problem that we can turn over to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brent? ;-)
</em><br />
<br /><br />For the two first points above the corresponding engineering problem  
<br />
(the implementation of universal machine) has been solved, beyond  
<br />
nature, by Babbage, Turing, Suze, von Neumann, and many others, and  
<br />
this up to you right now in front of your computer (usual name for  
<br />
this line of historical concrete universal machine &quot;hand made&quot; be it a  
<br />
MAC or a PC: both are universal).
<br />
For the last point it becomes an engineering problem when  
<br />
biotechnology extends itself into theotechnology. When some people  
<br />
will bet on some level, where it is not illegal, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To understand this, it is useful to understand the explosive &quot;many  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; incompleteness&quot; which is the price that the universal machine has  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to pay for that universality. Assuming the MEC hypothesis, it is a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; big price *we* have to pay ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The prison of our consciousness - we cannot get outside
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah yes, that too ...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2.7 eliminates all the trace of &quot;science-fiction&quot; of the preceding  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; steps, and is needed to understand that the UD Argument is an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; eliminative argument, that is a proof, up to a remaining &quot;big&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hypothesis: the existence of a &quot;concrete&quot; universal dovetailing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can &quot;see&quot; the UD? What does it look like?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is a program. I have written a UD in LISP in 1991, and I let it  
<br />
runs for some number of days. The program and the running is described  
<br />
in my long version french thesis &quot;Conscience et Mécanisme&quot; (see my url  
<br />
for more).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Then 2.8, UDA 8, or the MGA (Movie Graph Argument)  eliminates that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; remaining &quot;big&quot; hypothesis, and completes the reversal. Darwin has  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to be extended to the physical laws, they evolve through an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; arithmetical self-reflection &quot;process&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here Dawkins may want to agree with you but he hasn't the right to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yet, being physicalist. Send him a bag of Salvia, Doctor....
</em><br />
<br /><br />Exactly! The Mazatec Shaman use Salvia for finding back the lost  
<br />
objects. Lost of faith? Smoke Salvia!
<br />
<br />But Vic Stenger would say that it is just a chemical reaction in the  
<br />
brain,
<br />
<br />And I would say: all right, but then recall that the belief in atheism  
<br />
is also a chemical reaction in the brain, and the only question is how  
<br />
we interpret those reactions.
<br />
<br />Then it is a theorem. Self-perturbation leads universal machine to  
<br />
&quot;interesting&quot; fixed points.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Then 3? (cf the plan). It will depend of the appetite.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My eyes are ALWAYS bigger than my belly (= my enthusiasm to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand always surpasses my technical ability to do so. I am  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; working on that, with your expert help.)
</em><br />
<br /><br />You have the enthusiasm (*the* key)
<br />
You have the technical abilities (I have no doubt about that).
<br />
<br />But you are a working man surrounded by a living environment entangled  
<br />
to deep histories so it leads to time management problems. I can't lie  
<br />
on this: it is time demanding to grasp what a universal machine is,  
<br />
and in what (weak) sense a universal machine can happen to *know* she  
<br />
is universal, can happen to bet on its incompleteness, and the  
<br />
consequences (like how soul cannot not emerge and then fall and why  
<br />
this can hurt).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; UDA is enough to understand the reduction of physics to the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theology of numbers. 3 is really the &quot;UDA for the dummies&quot;, where  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the dummy person here *is* the (chatty) universal machine who knows  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; she is universal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, that sure sounds like moi. Thanks for being so politically- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct about it!!!
</em><br />
<br /><br />I guessed you were already enlightened.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 3 is really far simpler that the UDA, given that for 3 we really  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; presuppose only the understanding of three very elementary axioms  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of arithmetic. Unfortunately, by this very token, by the fact that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the pure virgin umprogrammed universal machine is so dummy, the UDA  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; becomes far longer, and mathematics get only more sophisticated,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because  we have to shorten the conversation. It happens that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Gödel, Löb, Solovay and others have already make the hard part of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that shortening. Take it easy, one step at a time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; VERY small steps, in my case. The tempo will doubtless quicken  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; later. I can always play the music at a faster tempo after I know  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the notes :-)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Very small steps. Just tell me things like &quot;pause&quot;, &quot;stop&quot;, &quot;next&quot;,  
<br />
&quot;repeat&quot;,  &quot;wtf&quot;, etc.
<br />
<br />;-)
<br />
<br />Happy New Year,
<br />
<br />Bruno
