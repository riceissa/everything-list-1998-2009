</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Real in the sense that &quot;I&quot; am real. is ambiguous.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Either the &quot;I&quot; refers to my first person, and then I have ontological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; certainty.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As I said on FOR, I can conceive that I wake up and realize that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; quark, planet, galaxies and even my body were not real. I cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conceive that I wake up and realize that my consciousness is not real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Ontological first person does not need an &quot;IF this or that theory is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; correct&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You are reifying theoretical constructions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think need to take a hard line on RITSIAR.  I feel that the key lies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in what Bruno terms the certainty of the ontological first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (OFP): i.e. the sine qua non of reality as it is uniquely available to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us.  Since this is inescapably the foundation of any and all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; judgements whatsoever, it is simultaneously both the both point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; departure and the 'what-is-to-be-explained' of RITSIAR.  In this light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it becomes self-evident that any and all explanatory entities -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical, computational, or whatever - are severely restricted to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; domain of epistemology.  IOW - as Bruno says above - they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretical constructions.
</em><br />
<br />That doesn't follow at all. A theoretical construct can have a real
<br />
referent. eg, if the theory of quarks is true , quarks exist. What
<br />
else
<br />
would &quot;theory X is true&quot; mean?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So far so obvious.  But - as has again been recognised immemorially -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solipsism is a dead-end and hence we seek a theory to capture the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation between the OFP and its environment.  But immediately we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; faced with the notorious 'explanatory gap',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it seems to me that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its most precise expression is in the gap between ontology and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemology.
</em><br />
<br />I don;t know what explanatory gap you are talking about,
<br />
but is doesn't sound like Levine's one.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Indeed, what conceivable strategy could raise these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretical constructions - to which the OFP uniquely lends existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - to the ontological certainty of their host?
</em><br />
<br />What is &quot;Ontological certainty&quot;? Certainty belongs to epistemolgoy,
<br />
so &quot;onotlogical&quot; can't bve qualifying &quot;certainty&quot;. Do you mean
<br />
something like &quot;the one certain fact about ontology/existence&quot;?
<br />
<br />Beyond that, you have raised a fake problem. Realism doesn;t need the
<br />
existence of a non-mental world to be a certainty, it just needs
<br />
it to be more plausible than the alternatives.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is there a coherent way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to conceive what it could mean to *be* a theoretical entity (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opposed to postulating or observing one)?
</em><br />
<br />Probably not, but that is because the question posed is somethign of
<br />
a category error. What the realist would say is that she can conceive
<br />
of theoretical statements havign real referents.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quintessential that stubbornly eludes capture, because epistemological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; access never tells us what an entity *is* - only what can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ascertained of its 'externalised' properties.
</em><br />
<br />How do you know? If you can't detect some mysterious inner essence,
<br />
how do you know there is one?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And lest we be tempted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to accept the sum of these properties as exhausting 'existence', we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need only turn to the self-evident corrective of the OFP.
</em><br />
<br />THat passage is very far from self evident. Explain, please.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the gap must remain, and I think that now I see why Bruno appeals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply to the 'ordinary' mathematical sense of existence - because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP, under this analysis, is an epistemological schema, and its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities are theoretical constructions.
</em><br />
<br />No, Bruno is a Platonist. He thinks numbers are RITSIAR
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Hence the question of jumping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ontological gap is in abeyance, perhaps permanently, but in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case in the realm of faith.  And if this is true for COMP, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mutatis mutandis it is true for physics.
</em><br />
<br />Of course not. Physics is about explaining the real world.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's no use appealing to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notions of 'what it's like to be a brain' - nor what it's like to be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP-quale - because we can never say that it is 'like anything to be'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the stuff of epistemology. Hence we must see our theorising and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observing - in physical, computational, or whatever terms - *in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation* to ontological certainty, not as constitutive of it.  This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily weakens what can be ascertained by theory or by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observation, but at least keeps us honest.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The unavoidable consequence of the foregoing is that atoms, quarks and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers cannot be RITSIAR.
</em><br />
<br />That has not been demonstrated at all. At best you have an argument
<br />
that they are not necessarily RITSIAR. Which is straightforwardly
<br />
given
<br />
by the observation that theories are less than certain. All you have
<br />
writen
<br />
boils down to the fallacy that &quot;no necessarily true&quot; implies
<br />
&quot;necessarily untrue&quot;

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You're doing it again. You are assuming that because the mental

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is epistemically certain, it is ipso facto ontologically basic. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; doesn't follow at all. I have evidence that the physical is basic --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of science. You have no evidence that the mental is basic because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; does not reveal its own ontological nature. All you have is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; **epistemic*** claim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that the mental definitely exists, in some sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The unique feature of consciousness is not - as you claim - its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'epistemic' certainty, but its status as what is *ontologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain*.
</em><br />
<br />Whatever that means.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To regard consciousness itself (or in Bruno's terms the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontological first person) as merely the object of 'knowledge' is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; commit the fallacy of taking 'observation' in a naively literal sense:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i.e. to require there to be an 'observer'.  But this, self-evidently,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can only lead to infinite regress.  Consequently, consciousness does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not consist in the 'observation' of epistemic entities, but in their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiation.
</em><br />
<br />Whatever that means. Surely if soemthign is insantiated, it exist and
<br />
is therefore ontological.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consciousness is, as it were, the 'ontology of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemology'.  When you say that the physical is basic, you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yourself mistaking the epistemological for the ontological.
</em><br />
<br />No, I am takign certain highly succesful theories to be true.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your evidence consisting in 'the whole of science', since the nature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and significance of this evidence is precisely what is in question, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is inadequate merely to make such appeals to authority.
</em><br />
<br />Au cotnraire, it is inadequate to assume that theories are necessarily
<br />
false bcause they are not necessarily true.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more helpful if you would address these arguments in their own terms,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather than begging various questions by appeal to 'pre-established
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact', or tilting at straw men of your own making.
</em><br />
<br />I have great difficulty following your terms. Almost all your
<br />
invocations
<br />
of &quot;ontological&quot; and &quot;epistemological&quot; read like nonsese to me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But you haven't said what the problem is in the emergence of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; from the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; On the contrary, I've said it repeatedly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Please say it again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is this: in the face of one indubitable ontology - that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exemplified in consciousness - you try get physically-basic ontology
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for free.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Free? The development of physics involves a huge effort. And note
<br />
that I am not claiming cvertainty for it.
<br />
<br />And I don't think I get any ontology from consciousness. I'll grant
<br />
that it is indubitable that it exists, but that tells me nothing
<br />
about *what* it is. A brute fact is not an ontology.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In other words, you simply assume that if we take ourselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to 'be' - what? - say, neural activity in 'computational' - or some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yet-to-be-established  - guise, then - pouf! - the ontological first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person is conjured from mere description.
</em><br />
<br />No, the first person is conjured from the brain -- from the territory,
<br />
not
<br />
the map.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But there is no sense in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which one can simply 'be' an epistemic 'object' - a theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construction.
</em><br />
<br /><br />As noted before, that is an artificial problem. Since theories
<br />
*can* be correct, one *can* be the referent of a  theoretical
<br />
description, and the referent of  a theoretical construction, if it
<br />
has one, is
<br />
a real thing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;*This* is the explanatory gap,
</em><br />
<br />No, it is nto the standard one in the literature. You are just
<br />
commiting a basica fallacy -- saying that because the map is not
<br />
itself real, it cannot *represetn* a real territory.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;?and you are trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; jump it by this customary, well-worn sleight-of-intuition.  But it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precisely this bit of magic that is in question.  And in my view the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right place to start questioning is the direction of inference, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've - repeatedly - said.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You still haven't said what the objection is to saying that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the mental emerges from the physical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm saying that all that can 'emerge' from one class of description is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another class of description.
</em><br />
<br />The physical is not a description/map. Physics is the description/map.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If that exhausts your idea of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'mental' I say you are an eliminativist.  But you say you're not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What then?
</em><br />
<br />I do think there is an explanatory gap, and I also think it is very
<br />
specific
<br />
the the nature of the mental and the nature of phsycial
<br />
*descriptions*. However
<br />
that does not mean that it is impossible for the mental territory to
<br />
emrge
<br />
from the physical territory. There are two things here, the brute fact
<br />
-- *that* the mental
<br />
emerges -- and the  explanation -- *how* it emerges.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Assuming (without justification) that anything can arbitrarily be said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any function. That is an argument you have made elsewhere, it is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a particularly good argument, and it is not germane to this discussion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a straw man of your own construction.  My argument does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consist in the claim that 'anything can arbitrarily be said to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any function'.  What I'm criticising, quite specifically, is the claim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the self-evidently existent category of the ontological first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person is equivalent to a particular class of  arrangements of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontologically-basic-in-their-own-right physical entities.
</em><br />
<br />You have in fact *not* criticised
<br />
the emergence of mental territory from physial territory, you have
<br />
criticised the emergence
<br />
of the mental territory from the physcical map. Well, you can't grow
<br />
potatos in a map of Norfolk,
<br />
but you can still grow potatos in Norfolk.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take it, can be construed only as a particularly odd form of dualism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or eliminativism.
</em><br />
<br />Don't take it, expalin how you came to that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The 'arbitrariness' is inherent in the burden of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the term 'functionalism', which is intrinsically neutral as to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; details of physical implementation.
</em><br />
<br />No, there are two quite differnt claim here:
<br />
<br />1. A function can have multiple instantions
<br />
2. Anything can instantiate any function.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is its great strength in its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; legitimate sphere of application, and its fatal weakness in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present context.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;But then one must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; abjure functional-computational justifications for the 'mental':
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; again, fair enough (it's probably closer to my own prejudice).  But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; unless you're an eliminativist about the mental, you can't have it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; both ways.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course you can! There are plenty accounts of the mental that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are neither functionalist nor elimintativist. Sheesh.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes of course there are other accounts, but my argument at this point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is specifically against functionalist accounts based on an assumed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical ontology.  So I repeat: the burden of my claim is that if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want to be ontological about the physical, you must give up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functionalist arguments for mind; otherwise you are an implicit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dualist, or else an eliminativist, even though you may be unaware of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it (as indeed an eliminativist would have to be!)
</em><br />
<br />You haven't supported any of that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You may of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disagree, but saying 'of course you can' is not an argument.
</em><br />
<br />It is noting that most people disagree with you conclusion. What is
<br />
asserted
<br />
with little argument can be rejected with little argument. The burden
<br />
is on you.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Beyond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that, I'm not arguing here against other accounts of the mental,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though you don't indicate what you have in mind (as it were)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; But I think we can save them quite handily.  First, calling something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 'idealism' just pumps the intuition that there have to be sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; bright images everywhere independent of 'minds'.  The problem here is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that we're stuck with folk vocabulary that drags in extraneous notions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; left, right and centre causing an implosion of the imagination.  We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; need to fix this, and I have a couple of suggestions.  The first was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; in my reply to Rex, where I suggest, in answer to your implicit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; question above, that the universe has to take things just as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; personally as it needs to exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Why, for heaven's sake? That seems completely arbitrary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps you could try a little harder to go beyond the vocabulary (I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sorry if this seems impolite, I don't intend it to be).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I've said,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; virtually every term we use has been used by someone else to mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something different.  The use of the term 'personal' in this context,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as I've tried to explain, is to carry the sense that what 'exists' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always, as it were, incipiently personal or 'owned'.  This is, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe, not crude idealism, but in fact the crucial prerequisite for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any intuition as to how the 'ownership' of consciousness could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceived to emerge from something in some sense more fundamental, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nonetheless categorically congruent.
</em><br />
<br />That is still arbitrary. Why would the personal have to be
<br />
fundamental,
<br />
rather than the cognitive, the experiential, etc etc.
<br />
<br />If you have a *specific* explanatory gap in mind, that guides you into
<br />
what is specifically missing from physical accounts. For, instance
<br />
the
<br />
Levine-Nagel gap indicated that phenomenal expereince is lacking, and
<br />
that
<br />
is what people like Chalmers and Rosenberg try to plug back in.
<br />
<br />However, you don't have a specific explanatory gap in mind. Your
<br />
argument that the &quot;epsistemtologcial&quot; (theoretical?? descriptive??)
<br />
can never
<br />
be the &quot;ontolgical&quot; (real?) is general-purpose.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; This leads to the second suggestion: what we call 'mind' is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; evolved capacity for representation, memory and intention directed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; towards an environment, resulting from selected-for elaborations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; primitive but critically-similar potentials.  Of course, this is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; standard direction of any explanatory thrust, but with the critical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; stipulation that we must be able to preserve the appearances from soup
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; to nuts: this is, as you point out, the nub.  Again, I don't insist on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; any particular vocabulary, only the necessary sense.  As Popper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; remarks, debate about words is futile - just clarify your terms until
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the problem emerges precisely, or goes away.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Repeating that we need to save the appearances does nothing to save
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Patience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Of the above factors, the one that bears, I think, most on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 'appearance of mindlessness', is memory (a point made by Russell in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; his neutral monist guise).  Essentially, we're 'conscious' of what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; can remember - this is inherent in the sense of re-presentation.  So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; it may not in fact meet the case to hold that we're 'unaware' of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; we don't remember so well, but rather that 'primitive' awareness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; swamped in our memory by repeated re-presentation of dominant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; higher-order themes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You cannot derive an &quot;is true&quot; from a &quot;might be true&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, of course not.  But your mind seemed to be boggled by the idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the fundamental 'personalisation' of the universe must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily manifest with a very different appearance to that which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in evidence.
</em><br />
<br />No, I am just noting that having arbitrarily put forward
<br />
a hypotheises, you are arbitrarily adding qualifications to
<br />
it to save appearances.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm merely trying to apply a little massage to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuition that this doesn't have to be so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You have no need to struggle to come up with a panpsychist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; theory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't have a 'panpsychist' theory.  Rather, I've made some general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguments relating to the various senses of the term 'to exist' with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which I hope to give a shove to intuitions that have perhaps become
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too stuck in one groove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; since you have no valid objection to physicalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Your argument so far has been based on two dubious premises --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that eliminativism and functonalism are the only physicalist options,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and that functionalism is arbitrary and in-the-eye-of-beholder.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, calling them 'dubious' is not an argument (as you correctly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pointed out when I lazily resorted to 'specious').
</em><br />
<br />The first is just plumb wrong, and the second is based on a confusion,
<br />
as
<br />
I have shown.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; AFAICS you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not independently argued for their dubiousness, but instead have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gestured towards 'well-established' positions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If you argue that X and Y are the only theories, how
<br />
else can I refute that but to point to the existence of theory Z in
<br />
the literature?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Furthermore, I haven't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at all claimed that they are the *only* physicalist options, I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply attacked these specific positions where they are resorted to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you are prepared to confront what has actually been said,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specifically and point for point, we may make progress, but otherwise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I fear we shan''t get much further.
