<br />That's an interesting point, but I'm not sure it's correct.
<br />
You might want to consider Nick Bostrom's &quot;Simulation Argument&quot; at
<br />
www.simulation-argument.com as an alternative.
<br />
<br />I think the problem with your argument is that you are assuming that all
<br />
physical arrangements of matter appended to the universe are equally
<br />
likely.  And in that case, you are right that some random arrangement
<br />
would be far more likely than one which looks like an observer who has
<br />
set up a computer to simulate our universe.
<br />
<br />However, I prefer a model in which what we consider equally likely is
<br />
not patterns of matter, but the laws of physics and initial conditions
<br />
which generate a given universe.  In this model, universes with simple
<br />
laws are far more likely than universes with complex ones.
<br />
<br />It seems plausible that our own laws of physics are not particularly
<br />
complex.  If string theory or loop quantum gravity or some other merging
<br />
of QM and GR can work, we may well find that our entire universe is
<br />
isomorphic to a few lines of mathematical equations.  Similarly there are
<br />
provocative hints that the initial state of the universe was extremely
<br />
simple and had low complexity.
<br />
<br />These prospects lend support to my view, even though the universe
<br />
contains objects of immense complexity.  It's not the complexity of
<br />
the universe that counts, it's the complexity of the equations that
<br />
generate the universe.  Consider a universe just like ours but where a
<br />
given person is replaced by a random pattern of matter.  Based on matter
<br />
complexity, such a universe may seem more likely, since the structure
<br />
of a human being is incredibly complex.  But based on generative-law
<br />
complexity, such a universe is much less likely, since it has a &quot;hole&quot;
<br />
where the laws of physics did not apply, where what should have been a
<br />
human being was artificially replaced by a random pattern.
<br />
<br />Therefore I'd suggest that when you consider the possibility that our
<br />
universe is embedded in a larger structure, you can't just look at
<br />
the matter complexity of that structure.  Rather, you should look at
<br />
the physical-law complexity.  And it seems plausible to me that the
<br />
physical laws of the outer universe don't necessarily have to be much
<br />
more complex than our own.  In fact, it may be that we are capable of
<br />
simulating our own universe (we don't know the laws of physics well enough
<br />
to answer that question, IMO).
<br />
<br />Nick Bostrom proposes in effect that the outer universe could be the
<br />
mathematically identical to the inner one.  He also suggests that there
<br />
could be many simulations running, so that the number of observers in
<br />
the simulated universes is far greater than the number in the outer
<br />
universe.
<br />
<br />Based on this reasoning, the likelihood of our being in a second-order
<br />
simulated universe is very considerable and can't be ruled out.
