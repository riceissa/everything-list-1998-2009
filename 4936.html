I'm sure we all agree that QM on its own is not the full story.  Ditto
<br />
with GR.  Has anyone claimed to come up with a self consistent, complete
<br />
description of our universe?   Saying that &quot;all universes exist which
<br />
follow the MWI&quot; is putting too much faith in a partial (and perhaps
<br />
merely approximate) model of our universe.
<br />
<br />With your line of reasoning you would say that people's consciousness
<br />
differentiated at the time QM displaced classical physics.  Surely QM
<br />
was waiting to be discovered?
<br />
<br />For this reason,  I think it is important that we look for better
<br />
ontologies of QM.  Even though these different interpretations make the
<br />
same predictions today,  they affect the way we reason about things -
<br />
and our ability to extend the model in new directions.  
<br />
<br />Anton Zeilinger has brought up the example of Einstein's publication of
<br />
special relativity which provided the missing ontology - when most of
<br />
the equations had already been provided by Lorentz, Fitzgerald etc.
<br />
There is no doubt that this ontology had enormous benefit.
<br />

<br />
<br />This list is dedicated to exploring the implications of the prospect
<br />
that all universes exist.  According to this principle, universes
<br />
exist with all possible laws of physics.  It follows that universes
<br />
exist which follow the MWI; and universes exist where only one branch
<br />
is real and where the other branches are eliminated.  Universes exist
<br />
where the transactional interpretation is true, and where Penrose's
<br />
&quot;objective reduction&quot; happens.  I'm tempted to even say that universes
<br />
exist where the Copenhagen interpretation is true, but that seems to be
<br />
more a refusal to ask questions than a genuine interpretation.
<br />
<br />Therefore it is somewhat pointless to argue about whether we are in one
<br />
or another of these universes.  In fact, I would claim that we are
<br />
in all of these, at least all that are not logically inconsistent or
<br />
incompatible with the data.  That is, our conscious experience spans
<br />
multiple universes; we are instantiated equally and equivalently in
<br />
universes which have different laws of physics, but where the
<br />
differences
<br />
are so subtle that they have no effect on our observations.
<br />
<br />It may be that at some future time, we can perform an experiment which
<br />
will provide evidence to eliminate or confirm some of these possible QM
<br />
interpretations.  At that time, our consciousness will differentiate,
<br />
and we will go on in each of the separate universes, with separate
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
<br />It is still useful to discuss whether the various interpretations work
<br />
at all, and whether they are in fact compatible with our experimental
<br />
results.  But to go beyond that and to try to determine which one is
<br />
&quot;true&quot; is, according to the multiverse philosophy, an empty exercise.
<br />
All are true; all are instantiated in the multiverse, and we live in
<br />
all of them.
<br />
