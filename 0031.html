<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Max Tegmark's Many Worlds paper (quant-ph/9709032) gives an experiment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; called quantum suicide for testing the Many Worlds Interpretation.
</em><br />
<br />Committing suicide is pretty scary.  But if uploading and/or mind
<br />
duplication is possible, it's not so bad.  Make a copy of your mind.
<br />
Arguably you can expect beforehand to find that you are one of the two
<br />
copies with equal probability.  Now, flip a coin to choose one, and that
<br />
copy pushes a button to make itself stop.  This is less frightening
<br />
because you would only be giving up a few seconds of unique experience.
<br />
<br />If many-worlds is true, then I think the copy who pushes the button will
<br />
find himself continuing to live.  Either the part of the program which
<br />
is supposed to make him stop fails, or something else strange happens.
<br />
<br />Of course this is only convincing to the one who is selected to try it.
<br />
You can repeat it a number of times and expect to be the selected one
<br />
eventually (or can you?).
<br />
<br />Does this seem like a convincing test?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems possible a variant of this experiment could be used to test the idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that all universes exist (is there a shorter name for this idea?). 
</em><br />
<br />You would have to assume that your same mind could exist in another
<br />
universe.  But this is not just another Everett world, it is conceivably
<br />
a completely different universe, with totally different properties.  Maybe
<br />
it is two-dimensional or maybe there is no such thing as distance.  It
<br />
would seem questionable whether your mind could really exist for any
<br />
length of time in such a different universe.
<br />
<br />It would seem that the other universe would have to be only a little
<br />
different from our own, so different that you can't notice the difference.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Basicly the experimenter reduces the measure of his personal continuation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this universe sufficiently so that his mostly likely continuation is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another universe. This would involve setting up a suicide device that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; almost certain to succeed in this universe but not as likely to succeed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another. However, this experiment is even less practical than quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suicide since constructing such a reliable suicide device (I guess failure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability must be much smaller than 2^-100) would be nearly impossible.
</em><br />
<br />How about if you set up the device so that it was deterministic but
<br />
fired based on some measurement of physical properties.  Take something
<br />
like the speed of light, and set up a system to measure it with more
<br />
and more accuracy.  Prepare your suicide device to kill you unless the
<br />
initially unknown digits of the speed turn out to have some special value.
<br />
<br />If all universes exist and there are a range of speeds of light in universes
<br />
where you live, then you will stay alive because in some universe there is
<br />
an instance of you where light has that special speed.  But if only the
<br />
one universe exists and the speed of light has some fixed value, then
<br />
chances are you will die.
<br />
