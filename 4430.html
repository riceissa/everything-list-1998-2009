Dear Russell, your lines are enlightening to me.
<br />
Some of them I find hard to accept, but you talk authoritatively so I give
<br />
them my consideration.
<br />
<br />Our acquaintance goes further than on the NECSI list, you commented
<br />
privately on my SciRel writing (missing the point, quite opposite to Tim,
<br />
who saw in it: only as he wrote: &quot;it is about religion and memes&quot; while you
<br />
refused &quot;to be called a religious person&quot; as a scientist. Both opinions fail
<br />
to see the point I was making about the comparison of &quot;belief&quot; on different
<br />
grounds) - we &quot;met&quot; on this list before your visit to NECSI.  ('Plenitude')
<br />
<br />The Necsi complex-science list is really mixed, as you said, many
<br />
particpants mix the &quot;complexity-thinking&quot; (I wish I had a better word for
<br />
it) with the convoluted, complicated systems -  usually called 'complex
<br />
systems'
<br />
- in the historical (linguistic, conventional) meaning of the word.
<br />
<br />As to this list: - so far I missed the &gt; &quot;Ensemble theories of...&quot;&lt; before
<br />
the &quot;&gt;everything&lt;&quot;, definitely did not associate it with TOE, which I always
<br />
looked at with awe, because to draw a TOE we should know &quot;everything&quot; first.
<br />
Looking at the progressing epistemic development of our (scientific)
<br />
cognitive inventory over the decades (millennia?) our 'everything' is
<br />
enriching - new and new elements are discovered in the progress of time,
<br />
while a formal TOE,  as an 'equation-formulated' (quantized, mathematically
<br />
expressed) THEORY would not allow the inclusion of such - (unless maybe with
<br />
substantial changes or reformulations).
<br />
<br />I don't call my 'speculations' a theory, not even a hypothesis, my 'story'
<br />
of generating universes from a Plenitude is called 'a narrative', a
<br />
proposition to put our observations into a followable framework for us (for
<br />
me?). It is a vision of &quot;everything&quot; - already discovered or not, all
<br />
influencing all, beyond our capabilities of the mind to organize known and
<br />
unknown properly. What (conventional?) science does is to formulate models
<br />
of treatable segments/compositions and study the characteristics of them,
<br />
within the reduced limitations of the boundaries set for such models. It is
<br />
highly successful and productive. This I call (my) scientific reductionism.
<br />
The total inclusion - (un)discovered so far - goes into my &quot;scientific
<br />
agnosticism&quot;, because we have no way to include into formulations the so far
<br />
unknown and unlimited variables with influencing factors unknown. That would
<br />
eliminate those paradoxes of which some physicists say &quot;I can live with
<br />
them&quot;.  I just do not find acceptable to make corrections for the presently
<br />
unknown inventory on the basis of the presently known inventory, in an
<br />
anticipation, or by mathematical techniques.
<br />
This is the foundation how I read this list and found exciting ideas
<br />
(observer moment, multiverse, the rabbit, etc.) in reading it.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;In your 2nd par you wrote a 'redundancy' about 'complex science' (which is
<br />
different from my domain):
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;...I'm not saying that they're wrong, but I am saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I didn't have a clue what they were talking about, and that no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amount of reading their postings helped me to make any kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense...&lt;
</em><br />
Of course.
<br />
Most people 'don't have a clue' and so it does not make sense to them.
<br />
On &quot;that&quot; list,  some talk in engineering, some in mathematical biology,
<br />
some Peircianese, some systems sci.,
<br />
some post-Darwinian evolutionese, some philosophy, some plain common sense
<br />
language, etc. etc.
<br />
so you could pick a strange one easily. Most are non-responsive to my
<br />
particular kind of speculation either.
<br />
<br />Your 3rd par is plain list-wisdom, similar to what I proposed earlier in the
<br />
question of (why not) moderating
<br />
this (and other) lists in a topically narroww way.
<br />
As Tim wrote: inappropriate posts can be taken apart by other list-members
<br />
in no time. And they do.
<br />
Sorry for having bored most of you with my thoughts in a different view from
<br />
what you people like.  I am not a physicist, a long time ago in my
<br />
(chemical) Ph.D. I had physics mandatory (but what physics does a chemist
<br />
know?) plus math as elective (same remark) and later my D.Sc. was in
<br />
polymers, (applied reductionism!) and my views changed over the past 1½
<br />
decades by a specific natural science philosophy. Starting with Bohm.
<br />
I don't want to persuade anybody into accepting my views. I wrote about them
<br />
because &quot;it just came up&quot;.
<br />
Sometimes it is interesting to see another view. In cases I wrote to
<br />
list-members in private, when I had a remark &quot;out of the regular bounds&quot; of
<br />
the list and I usually got a friendly (topical) response. (Including
<br />
Russell, who was mostly (not always so) friendly &lt;G&gt;)
<br />
<br />Now I learned to put a special filter on my mouse - to make any (rare, if
<br />
any) comment palatable to the general
<br />
audience of this list.
<br />
<br />John Mikes

<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your expression &quot;complexity-thinking&quot; reminded me that I first came
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; across you in a different forum, namely NECSI's complex-science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list. Indeed the various terms you quote after that would be more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate for that list than the &quot;everything&quot; list. The everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list was not intended for discussing every possible topic, but rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Ensemble theories of everything&quot; or &quot;Ensemble TOEs&quot;. This is quite a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; focussed topic, which has by and large been adhered to by the list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; participants.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The big problem with complex-science was that there were several
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prolific people there who would use the terminology of complex systems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in ways totally different to how they're conventionally employed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complex systems. I'm not saying that they're wrong, but I am saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I didn't have a clue what they were talking about, and that no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amount of reading their postings helped me to make any kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense. I once complained on that list about there being two languages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on that discussion list.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ultimately, and perhaps a little sadly, I have had to take the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pragmatic strategy of censoring those individuals - simply deleting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their postings without reading them, as I just don't benefit from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reading them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cheers
