<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; memory loss, but rather replacement of the lost memories with someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; else's, which I feel is a greater threat to my identity and which I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; less likely to agree to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's &quot;someone else&quot; just because that's the *feeling* you have about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it! Since you have &quot;the feeling&quot; that you are the same person today
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that you will be tomorrow, perhaps some day you can achieve the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;feeling that your duplicate sitting across the room is really you too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Memory loss would be more like having myself backed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; up and the backup run after I have died. If the backups are frequent, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; suppose it is better than no backup at all, but I would still feel 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;afraid of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dying. At its most basic, for me anyway, the fear of imminent death is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fear that the person I am *now* will be wiped from the universe and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have any more experiences.
</em><br />
<br />Actually, I am wrong about (at least) one thing: memory loss and memory 
<br />
replacement do amount to the same thing, once the copy with the lost 
<br />
memories has new experiences.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Have faith in physics. If from *every* objective measure, a Stathis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will be awaking tomorrow in your bed, and will do things and talk to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;everyone just like you, then he is you. There are no souls. You must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have faith.  The physics of the situation is all that there is.
</em><br />
<br />An interesting choice of words: &quot;there are no souls... you must have faith&quot;. 
<br />
There *is* one objective (and subjective) measure whereby the copy differs 
<br />
from the original: the lost memory of the post-backup experiences. You might 
<br />
argue that it doesn't matter very much, but it is real, and it is what I 
<br />
have been using to define death: no successor observer moment, anywhere or 
<br />
ever.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The same consideration ought to apply to memory loss, but people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; don't generally think of it that way, because they know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that they'll be OK afterwards, on the basis of past experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Just because they're not used to thinking of it in the right way,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does not preclude our embracing the right way that we should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thinking of it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, it's true:  the very first thing you learned on this Earth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was how to tell what was outside your body from what was inside,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and slowly your concept of self was formed. But we can see now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that it was wrong. We can see now that if you are to have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consistent view of what self is, then it must include all processes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that (from the viewpoint of physics) are indistinguishable from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you. Or rather, which are very, very similar (like the you yesterday,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or the you across the room).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Just embrace it: when you see your duplicate across the room,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and you know all the facts of his and your existence, just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;repeat: &quot;There by the grace of God go I&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />As I have said above, it is possible to rigorously define death as occurring 
<br />
when there is no successor observer moment, anywhere or ever. This is the 
<br />
case with physical death where there is no surviving copy or where the 
<br />
surviving copy has diverged from the original, and it is also the case with 
<br />
memory loss. Losing a lifetime's memories is equivalent to physical death 
<br />
with no surviving copy, so it is certainly a very bad thing. Losing a 
<br />
shorter period of memories or dying and leaving behind a copy made a short 
<br />
time ago might not seem as bad, but I think this is only because the 
<br />
&quot;survivor&quot; is unable to remember any loss. The situation is not any 
<br />
different to suffering pain and then having the memory erased; the knowledge 
<br />
that they are about to die is for many people even more distressing than 
<br />
physical pain. You argue that the doomed person should not consider himself 
<br />
doomed if there is a backup available, and certainly you have more chance of 
<br />
convincing him of this than you have of convincing a victim undergoing 
<br />
torture that he isn't really in pain because his memory will be erased or he 
<br />
will be killed and a pre-torture copy will take over. Nevertheless, I would 
<br />
still be upset if I were about to die, unless I knew that my mind was being 
<br />
backed up continuously, so that no experiences are lost.
