You are arguing that it is possible to have an absolute measure for
<br />
each observer moment, as well as a relative measure on the transitions
<br />
between observer moments. Of course this is correct. 
<br />
<br />However, the ASSA and the RSSA are more than that. The SS stands for
<br />
self sampling, ie the principle that one should reason as though one's
<br />
own observer moment were sampled from the A or the R measure
<br />
respectively. With the RSSA, only the birth moment is sampled
<br />
according to an absolute measure, so it is an elaboration of the
<br />
SSA. I'm not sure how compatible the ASSA is with the SSA.
<br />
<br />The ASSA and RSSA are incompatible principles, even if both absolute
<br />
and relative measures are compatible.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;randomly from the set of all observer moments gives the wrong answer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can you explain more why you think this one-to-one relationship implies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's incorrect to apply the self-sampling assumption to observer-moments? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I said in the &quot;Request for a glossary of acronyms&quot; thread (at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5265d">http://tinyurl.com/5265d</a> ), I am inclined to believe a final theory of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything would allow us to use both the ASSA (the theory would assign 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each observer-moment an absolute probability, and we could reason as if our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current OM was randomly selected from the set of all possible OMs, weighted 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by their absolute probability) and the RSSA (for each OM, the theory would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give a conditional probability that the observer's subsequent experience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be any other possible OM). If you're suggesting the two are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incompatible, there's no need for them to be. Consider the following 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analogy--we have a bunch of tanks of water, and each tank is constantly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pumping a certain amount of its own water to a bunch of other tanks, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having water pumped into it from other tanks. The ratio between the rates 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that a given tank is pumping water into two other tanks corresponds to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ratio between the probabilities that a given observer-moment will be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; succeeded by one of two other possible OMs--if you imagine individual water 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecules as observers, then the ratio between rates water is going to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two tanks will be the same as the ratio between the probabilities that a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given molecule in the current tank will subsequently find itself in one of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those two tanks. Meanwhile, the total amount of water in a tank would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correspond to the absolute probability of a given OM--at any given time, if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you randomly select a single water molecule from the collection of all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecules in all tanks, the amount of water in a tank is proportional to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the probability your randomly-selected molecule will be in that tank.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, for most ways of arranging this system, the total amount of water in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different tanks will be changing over time. In terms of the analogy, this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be like imposing some sort of universal time-coordinate on the whole 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse and saying the absolute probability of finding yourself 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiencing a given OM changes with time, which seems pretty implausible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to me. But if the system is balanced in such a way that, for each tank, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; total rate that water is being pumped out is equal to the total rate that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; water is being pumped in, then the system as a whole will be in a kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equilibrium, with no variation in the amount of water in any tank over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time. So in terms of OMs, this suggests a constraint on the relationship 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the absolute probabilities and the conditional probabilities, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this constraint (together with some constraints imposed by a 'theory of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness' of some kind) might actually help us find a unique 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-consistent way to assign both sets of probabilities, an idea I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elaborated on in the &quot;Request for a glossary of acronyms&quot; thread.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In terms of the QTI, accepting both the ASSA and RSSA seems to imply there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be no point at which our stream of consciousness would end, but the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ASSA also implies that it's unlikely a typical observer-moment has memories 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of being extremely old, so it seems we'd have to accept some sort of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;immortality with amnesia&quot;--maybe as I approach death, my stream of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness will move into simpler and simpler OMs, and then eventually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; start climbing back up the ladder of complexity into the OMs of a different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person who has no memory of my life. Or maybe the advanced transhuman 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligences of the future periodically like to wipe most of their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memories and experience what it was like to be a human-level intelligence, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so that at the end of my life my memories will be reintigrated with those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of this larger intelligence (maybe this replaying of a life would be a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary part of the merging of two distinct transhuman minds, something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which transhuman intelligences would probably want to do if at all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible). There are probably other creative ways to have immortality (as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implied by the RSSA) be compatible with the idea that my current OM is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;typical&quot; one (as implied by the ASSA), too.
