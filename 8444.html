<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;  uv: that this 'strong
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; mechanistic' approach of Bruno really leaves a lot of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the real world outside its bailiwick.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bm: Could you elaborate just a little bit. I am not sure I understand.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uv: Well  you state elsewhere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bm; What I called &quot;strong mechanism&quot; in &quot;mechanism and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; personal identity&quot; is what I call &quot;computationalism&quot; today,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or just comp. I have no idea if comp is true or false, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it is my working hypothesis. the advantage of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hypothesis is that we can reason about it and even be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; led to testable consequences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uv: So that suggests, on your own statement, that comp may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not be an accurate statement of the real world.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Right. But note that this can be said of *any* theory. QM may not be an 
<br />
accurate statement of the real world (whatever that is), nor General 
<br />
relativity, nor .... any theory.
<br />
But comp adds something here in the sense that comp makes necessary the 
<br />
possibility of &quot;not comp&quot;. Comp share this feature with the consistency 
<br />
notion as viewed by some consistent machine. A machine can prove that 
<br />
if she is consistent then she will never been able to prove its own 
<br />
consistency. Comp is similar: if comp is true then we can only bet on 
<br />
it; we will never been able to deduce it from a weaker theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that, it is reasonable to suppose that a lot of the real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world may be outside its bailiwick. The less charitable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation would be that a lot within its bailiwick is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong or incorrectly stated.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't care at all for two reasons. Once is that my point is just that 
<br />
once we postulate comp we get an explanation where the physical laws 
<br />
and the physical sensations come from including the relation in between 
<br />
(cf UDA). Second, as I said recently, the machine's psychology or 
<br />
theology remains invariant for all the main weakening of comp, and 
<br />
remains sound for *all* weakening of comp, and this transforms my 
<br />
testability argument for comp into a concrete device for measuring our 
<br />
degree of non-computationality.
<br />
(All this is not obvious, and I am not even trying to explain; I just 
<br />
point on the results I got and  on some recent extensions of those 
<br />
results).
<br />
<br />Now please note that the only scientist who explicitly postulated 
<br />
non-comp is Penrose. His first &quot;godelian&quot; argument against comp is just 
<br />
wrong. His second one is formally correct but shows no more that &quot;IF we 
<br />
are machine THEN we cannot know which machine we are&quot;, and this is 
<br />
indeed a key point  because it gives the relation between the first 
<br />
person indeterminacy on the multiple computational histories (from UDA) 
<br />
and the incompleteness phenomenon (and indeed this is used when I 
<br />
&quot;translate&quot; UDA in the language of a lobian machine).
<br />
<br />Again, when you say &quot;The less charitable interpretation would be that a 
<br />
lot within its bailiwick is wrong or incorrectly stated&quot;, well I agree, 
<br />
but this is the case for any theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course there are a third and a fourth interpretation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The third would be a combination of the first two and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fourth that comp is correct as it is. But you have just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said that we can't assume that it is,
</em><br />
<br />I am just saying we will never know it to be true. But as I show, we 
<br />
can perhaps know it to be false. In that sense comp is a &quot;scientific&quot; 
<br />
theory in the sense of falsifiable theory (Popper).
<br />
<br />So I would say that we can assume it to be true. We can &quot;only&quot; assume 
<br />
it to be true, and then expect a contradiction with the facts, or not.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I think that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct. Bearing in mind the fact that the whole subject
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of mind, brain and mechanism is in flux, that situation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not surprising. Ultimately we may be led to category
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory for the mappings.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I  still should say I do have argument in favor of comp, in the sense 
<br />
that I do have argument in favor of  each of YD + CT + AR (= comp as I 
<br />
make it enough precise to be able to reason on it).
<br />
<br />1) YD (&quot;yes doctor; see my last paper of search for doctor in the 
<br />
archive; it is the assumption you can survive with an artificial 
<br />
digital brain).
<br />
<br />2) CT (Church thesis): all digital universal machine are equivalent. 
<br />
(modern version!)
<br />
<br />3) AR (Arithmetical Realism): Arithmetical propositions (see Podnieks 
<br />
page for a definition) are true or false independently of &quot;myself&quot;. For 
<br />
example that &quot;18 and 25 are relatively primes&quot; is true or false 
<br />
independently of me, of the belgians, of the europeans, of the earth 
<br />
creatures, ... of the milky way creature, etc.
<br />
<br />But I am NOT interested in those arguments, if only because comp makes 
<br />
clear that such arguments are quasi personal and concernes more our 
<br />
private relation with a doctor or a priester than something we need to 
<br />
really argue for or sell. I find this funny (and it gives also a 
<br />
political if not religious relief) : comp makes comp proselytes 
<br />
inconsistent. Comp makes comp (in term of truth, practice, therapy ...) 
<br />
a personal affair. Of course to reason from or on comp can be done, but 
<br />
then all what you get is a theory which offer the laws of physics, and 
<br />
then you can evaluate comp by comparing the comp physics with the 
<br />
physics you bet from empiry. And until now, comp succeeds its first 
<br />
step by showing that the logic of physical proposition cannot be 
<br />
boolean and even that it is apparently quite close to the quantum logic 
<br />
of propositions we can infer from experiments.
<br />
<br />I am aware of many subtleties here, which makes an english rendering 
<br />
close to a set of contradictory statements. Here the modal logics of 
<br />
self-reference helps a lot. We should come back on it perhaps. But now 
<br />
I must go.

<br />
<br /><br />PS Russell: About Parfit look at &quot;parfit&quot; or &quot;token&quot; in the archive 
<br />
(the mirror:
<br />
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/">http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/</a>
<br />
Escribe seems down) to see what I think about his book. En gros, I 
<br />
agree with him until the middle of his book where he argues that we are 
<br />
token, but comp makes us type. In any case, Parfit &quot;reason and person&quot; 
<br />
is quite excellent and enjoyable, and surely useful for this list.
