<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;demonstration of &quot;digital character&quot;, the default value being analogicalness.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Do you think that a distance of 10^-500 has a accepted meaning for any

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thesis which makes things clearer.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I do not know any description of our brain that is obviously exactly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;equivalent to some TM. I would be very happy if someone in this group
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;could give me one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Any reasonable quantized version of Schroedinger equation. Nobody has ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proved the necessity of non-computable real numbers there. Only Penrose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seems to search non-computability there, for rather obscur reasons.
</em><br />
<br />One reason may be that we don't know the ultimate TOE, even in the
<br />
continuous form. The problem is not the use of discrete variables and how
<br />
accurately they can  reproduce continuous ones. It is first that we don't
<br />
have any exact theory of the world. Schroedinger equation does not describe
<br />
properly relativistic QM or quantum gravity, and no one has succeeded in
<br />
finding a theory that answers anything. If you imagine a thought experiment
<br />
capable of simulating the quantum state of a brain (which requires indeed a
<br />
huge computer!), you can as well imagine an experiment testing quantum
<br />
gravity and interfaced with a brain - and no known theory could compute the
<br />
result. You MAY postulate that this computation exists, and that it is of
<br />
discrete nature, but this is a postulate.
<br />
<br />I know that you present comp as a working hypothesis- I just insist that
<br />
comp is indeed the very strong hypothesis that there is a computable TOE.
<br />
I agree that with this hypothesis any system is digital (equivalent to the
<br />
computation of its state). In this case the separation analogical/digital
<br />
is useless. But there is another problem. Indeed I should have added a word
<br />
to my definition:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;For me digital systems are systems whose some OBSERVABLE characteristics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(description and evolution of their &quot;state&quot;) are EXACTLY equivalent to a TM.
</em><br />
<br />Recalling that the quantum state of a single particle is not observable ( a
<br />
fact that seems to have been neglected by some computer scientists...) ,
<br />
unlike for example the magnetic moment of a computer memory cell, I
<br />
maintain that there is an objective distinction between digital systems and
<br />
analogical ones, and that the brain is not obviously digital : the clearest
<br />
difference between an analogical system and its digitized computation is
<br />
that the relevant information (quantum state) is fundamentally hidden in
<br />
the first case, but is known in the second one. This is as fundamental
<br />
physically as Church thesis for computability!
<br />
I see no reason why this fundamental physical difference would not have any
<br />
influence on the existence of consciousness. In fact all proposed
<br />
&quot;simulated brains&quot;, Chinese room, Mauldlin experiment and so on imply the
<br />
use of classical systems whose state IS measurable - i.e. are digital
<br />
following the definition I propose. It may be why (as we tend to think
<br />
intuitively) they can't be able to think. Only the duplication of quantum
<br />
state would then be able to duplicate a consciousness....
